    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the question of punishment, the concept which we must, above all, avoid is that of revenge.  The idea that the community must get an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth with respect to the offender should not be the motivating force.  I fear that this concept is very often there behind the scenes in some of the ideas put forward about penology: it is dressed up in more acceptable rationalisations.  We should avoid <Col N="156" /> such an approach (1) because it is basically an unchristian and uncharitable attitude to adopt towards the offender and (2) because, to a great extent, criminal tendencies arise in people because of their social background, because of educational deficiencies and because of simple mental deficiencies, in many cases.  I had pointed out that it is about eight times more likely that a person brought up in the north dock area in Dublin will be involved in criminal activities than will a person brought up in some part of the rather more prosperous south Dublin suburbs. These figures were drawn up in relation to England but I am sure they apply here also.</P>
      <P>The educational background is also a very important factor.  I mentioned last night a survey carried out in St. Patrick's Institution and in regard to which the Minister sought clarification. As far as I know, this survey was carried out by the UCD social science department and a report of it was published in the <i>New Irish Jurist</i>, 1965.  The survey indicated that, of the inmates there, 50 per cent were semi-literate and 4 per cent were illiterate. In other words, the educational background of 54 per cent of these people was well below par.  In these circumstances, I think they could not adapt to the community.  It is not surprising, and not their own fault to a great extent, that they became involved in criminal activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This survey disclosed that a common factor among all the inmates in St. Patrick's Institution was that they mitched from school; they could not feel happy at school and stayed away from it many times.  In other words, they were educationally deprived.  It was pointed out that a very substantial number of them had actual mental deficiency as distinct from educational deficiency.  The average IQ among people there was 84 which is well below the community average; 3 per cent were classified as mentally defective and 30 per cent of them were borderline mental defectives.  In other words, one-third of the inmates of St. Patrick's Institution were classified as suffering from mental defects.  Is it any wonder that, in these circumstances, these <Col N="157" /> people cannot adapt to the highly-competitive community that we are evolving towards in this country?  Is it any wonder, therefore, that they turn to crime as a sort of outlet and a way of hitting back at a community which has no place for them?</P>
    <P>We must recognise that the primary cause of crime does not lie so much in the offenders themselves as in the fact that in their early youth we have not cared for them to a sufficient extent, educationally and otherwise, so that they will fit into the community and not have to turn to crime.  The criminal tendencies of some of these people are just as much our fault as they are theirs.  We should, above all, avoid seeking revenge on criminals when we are evolving our concept of punishment. We should seek to redress what we have not done for them in their youth.  We should seek to redress these educational deficiencies.  As far as possible, we should seek to enable those who are mentally defective to take their place in the community even if it be not as good a place as it would be if they had full mental capacity.</P>
    <P>In approaching the question of what punishment should be given to people involved in crime, we should apply the concept that the punishment should fit the criminal and not the crime. The idea of having a blanket punishment for all people who commit a certain type of crime is not the right concept. Although a number of criminals may have committed the same type of crime they may have different needs in regard to treatment in order to be rehabilitated and they may have committed the crime for different reasons. The whole approach to sentencing should be based on the individual need of the criminal.  We should ensure that whatever punishment is meted out to him is best calculated to bring about his rehabilitation and is best suited to his needs.  There are certain deficiencies in our sentencing arrangements.  Very often the judges giving these sentences are not fully aware of the treatment facilities which are available.  Very often, too, they might not have visited these institutions.  Furthermore, they have not the expertise in sociology, criminology, and so on, to gear the <Col N="158" /> punishment they award to the needs of the criminal who is before them.  While leaving the determination of whether or not the person is guilty to the judges we should transfer the matter of sentence to a sentencing authority. This is the arrangement they have in California.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I doubt if that would arise on this Bill.  The question of sentences would be a matter for the courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important that we should realise that the conditions under which people are committed to institutions are of very great relevance to any prospect they might have of being rehabilitated in those institutions and a certain reference to this is essential if we are to ensure that our discussion is really relevant.  In California this is a matter for an expert body of sociologists and psychologists who can go into the problems of the criminal in great depth, analyse him, find out the reason why he went into crime and prescribe an appropriate type of sentence and an appropriate type of treatment while he is in confinement and afterwards.</P>
      <P>In this context there is a clear need to develop a more specialised type of treatment of criminals in our institutions. We cannot just lump them all together whether they are mentally defective, educationally defective, whether they have violent tendencies, whether they have a very low mental age, whether they are first offenders or recidivists.  We cannot lump them all together into one type of institution. We must develop specialised institutions for different people in different age groups with different backgrounds and different criminal tendencies and they must be treated specially.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Instead of one, two or three big institutions we need to develop a number of smaller specialised institutions for different types of criminal.  We need a specialised institution for criminals who are mentally defective so that they can be treated to enable them to be rehabilitated.  We need a specialised type of institution for those who have a particularly low educational background. <Col N="159" /> We need a specialised institution for those who are first offenders and who, therefore, have, perhaps, the greatest prospect of rehabilitation and we need, of course, another type of institution for recidivists who have, perhaps, a low prospect though not by any means no prospect of rehabilitation. We also need special institutions with high security for those who have violent or psychopathic tendencies.  I do not think we should have the same degree of security for those who do not have violent tendencies.</P>
    <P>This is the way in which I feel the Minister is moving, judging by his speech, which, as I said last night, I regarded as a very good and compassionate speech.  However, there is need for a greater degree of progress.  Shanganagh Castle, which will accommodate approximately 55 to 60 people, is, in a way, only a token.  It enables the Minister to say we have got an open prison but it is only nibbling at the problem. The number of people who can benefit from varying degrees of open institution and open prison are much greater than the number that can be accommodated in Shanganagh at the moment.  We must seek to open up all our prison institutions in some way. This does not necessarily mean opening them up from the point of view of allowing people to walk out and walk in.  We must open them up in other ways.</P>
    <P>There is a danger that these institutions can become introverted, that they can be closed in on themselves.  They have the staff living in the prison, the prisoners have little or no contact with people who are living in the outside community.  Thus what they learn in the prison they cannot adapt to outside conditions which they will have to face and in which they will have to use whatever they learn in the prison. There is a need to ensure that there is greater contact with the outside world for all prisoners.  This can be achieved by relaxing the visiting regulations and the regulations as to correspondence.</P>
    <P>It can also be achieved by attracting a greater number of voluntary workers to go in and visit the prisoners in the prisons, particularly prisoners who do <Col N="160" /> not have many relatives.  Such voluntary workers could visit a small number of prisoners regularly, take an interest in their problems while they are in prison, keep them informed of what is going on outside as regards job opportunities and then take a particular interest in them when they leave prison.  There is a great need to attract voluntary help into the rehabilitation of prisoners and into contact with prisoners both in prison and afterwards.</P>
    <P>There is a need for a vigorous advertising campaign on the part of the Department of Justice to attract voluntary effort.  The voluntary effort of which they are getting the benefit at the moment is largely confined to religious organisations&mdash;the Salvation Army and the Legion of Mary.  There is a need to widen the spectrum from which we are drawing voluntary help, to get people to come in&mdash;even on an individual basis, people who are not members of an organisation&mdash;to the prisons and to take an interest in the prisoners.  This can be done if the Department of Justice make information available and, if necessary, advertise for this sort of assistance, if they go out and look for it and do not merely reluctantly accept help when it is offered.</P>
    <P>There is also a need to develop a greater sense of responsibility among the prisoners for their own actions and for shaping their own environment in the prison.  The big problem with these prisoners is, to a great extent, that they are not able to accept responsibility in the outside community, that they are not able to act responsibly as a result and this leads to crime.  What happens in the prisons at the moment is that even the little responsibility they did have to exercise in the outside community is reduced, because lights are turned off for them, doors are closed for them, everything is done for them. Their whole life is regimented.  They have to accept even less personal responsibility than they did in the outside community.  It is quite possible that, as a result of this institutionalised treatment, they can become more and not less irresponsible for their actions.  This is, in fact, a backward step.  I feel there is a need to <Col N="161" /> adapt our institutional treatment to ensure they can develop more responsibility.</P>
    <P>This can be done by giving them some responsibility through consultation procedures and so on in regard to the internal running of the prison. This, of course, will have to be approached in a very tentative way but I feel many prisoners, particularly the more intelligent ones, could make useful suggestions as to how the prison could be run without any question of there being a danger to security.  I refer to mere routine matters&mdash;that they could be given responsibility for certain matters within the prison itself. Of course, there is a danger here of separating a certain class of prisoner from others, thus creating a gulf in the prison community between the &ldquo;scabs&rdquo; who are doing work for the prison officers and the good fellows who will not co-operate with them at all.</P>
    <P>We must avoid that but, while avoiding that, we must seek to ensure that all prisoners take some responsibility for the running of the prison.  If they are seen to be granted a share of responsibility in the running of the prison community, they will be able to accept some responsibility in the community outside and they will be able to adapt better to living in the outside community.  There is the basic problem with criminals that they have not been able to adapt to living in the outside community and as a result they return to crime.  Everything we do for them should be motivated by the idea that we are seeking to enable them to adapt to living in society and to accepting the responsibilities of life.  Our prison institutions must seek to give them responsibility and not, so far as possible, to take it from them.</P>
    <P>There are security limits which are, of course, paramount.  Perhaps the most important way of all in ensuring that they adapt to the outside community is the concept of day-release for employment towards the end of their stay. Prisoners should be allowed to go out and work in the community, returning to prison at night.  This is a &ldquo;halfway house&rdquo; existence between the prison and outside employment.  Very often the big difficulty is that the first few days in the new job are the most <Col N="162" /> difficult.  If the prisoners get over these days and stay in the job they are likely to stay for a longer time.  It is important that they should encounter those days while they are actually under institutional care.  If employment is available practically every prisoner, towards the end of his sentence, should be allowed out on day-release.  While the Minister welcomes this idea in principle, in fact there has not been a great deal done towards implementing this scheme.  The percentage of prisoners and the percentage of the through-put in any year in any prison who avail of day-release is six to seven per cent.  This percentage has declined since 1966.  In 1966, 42 prisoners were released on a day-release scheme from St. Patrick's Institution.  In 1969 44 prisoners availed of this scheme.  While this is an absolute increase, the prison population in St. Patrick's has risen more rapidly than that between 1966 and 1969, so the proportion of prisoners who are released on a daily basis from St. Patrick's has declined.  This shows that there is not acceptance of the idea to the fullest extent.  The day-release scheme is not being implemented in the way it should be implemented. It is something which should form part of the prison sentence of every prisoner.  There should be a transitory stage in a prisoner's life when he is on day-release towards the end of his sentence.</P>
    <P>The percentage of prisoners in Mountjoy who avail of day-release is also very small.  It is six to seven per cent which is a very small percentage of the total number of prisoners.  This percentage has not increased; possibly it has decreased since the scheme was initiated in 1966.  I believe the Minister considers it a good idea.  If this is so, we should see that the day-release scheme is extended to more prisoners than are availing of it at present.</P>
    <P>Another important question is the placement of people in jobs to ensure that the right person is put into the right job.  The welfare officers look for the jobs and find out what jobs are available.  It is quite another thing to ensure that the right man is put into the right job.  This is something of which an educational psychologist, of <Col N="163" /> whom we have been talking already, would be aware.  No educational psychologist has yet been appointed. It is important that there should be no further delay in respect of such appointment.  We need more information about training facilities in St. Patrick's and in the prison service in general.  We need to know how much time is spent each day on training in the different techniques and what standards on some objective scale are reached by the prisoners.  It is not enough to enumerate the subjects taught without telling us what time is spent and what standard is reached.</P>
    <P>We must take a look at the training of prison officers.  There is in-service training for prison officers at present. This is to be extended.  Prison officers are to get a course from the department of psychology in UCD.  We should try to ensure that these people are trained before they start work.  People should not be put in to work as prison officers unless they have received some basic minimal training in the various techniques involved.  The reason given for not having this training is that the intake to the prison service is irregular. People are coming in as the vacancies arise.  This should not be an insuperable difficulty when dealing with the pre-service training of prison officers.  We have the juvenile liaison scheme.  The intake is irregular here also but there is a two-week pre-service training course for this job.  Why cannot there be a similar course for those who are going into the prison service?  If the question of irregular intake is all that difficult, why can there not be a specific day in the year for taking in officers? This might involve having a slightly larger number of prison officers to ensure that, with the wastage during the year, the number does not drop below the necessary standard.  The extra number involved would not be very great.  There is an argument for applying the same methods as in employment for other jobs and for having a regular date for entry and regular pre-service courses.  In Great Britain there is a course of six or eight weeks pre-service training for prison officers. I concede that it is easier for them to have these courses because they <Col N="164" /> have more prison officers and a greater intake.  I cannot see why we could not send some of our prison officers to England to avail of these courses until such time as we are able to set up a similar course here ourselves.</P>
    <P>It is evident that the remuneration of officers in the prison service has not kept pace with the remuneration of the rest of the community.  There is difficulty in getting recruits.  It is likely that some of the difficulty is caused because of the inadequate remuneration. The prison officers at present have been attuned to the idea that they are turnkeys and that their job is purely a security one.  Prison regulations dealing with the duties of the prison officers are concerned almost exclusively with their security role. There is very little mention of their duties in regard to rehabilitation.  All the matters which are enumerated in the regulations are questions of the locks they must turn, <i>et cetera.</i> In rule 114, which I have mentioned before in this House, the prison officers are forbidden to become familiar with the prisoners or to speak unnecessarily to them.  If this rule is to be enforced and the prison officers cannot get familiar with the prisoners or get to know them how can they exercise a genuinely rehabilitative role in regard to prisoners? There is a clear need for revision of these regulations.  While the emphasis cannot be taken off security altogether, there is need for emphasis in regard to the role of the prison officer in rehabilitation to ensure that each officer gets to know the prisoner and has a particular responsibility for a number of prisoners.  This is being done at present in Shanganagh.  It is a good thing.  There is a question of introducing the house-master system where a particular officer has responsibility for eight or ten prisoners.  I cannot see why this system of house-mastering has to be confined to Shanganagh. There is every reason for applying it in all prisons and to have particular prison officers responsible for a particular number of prisoners. In this way they become acquainted with the prisoners.  They can thus make a useful contribution towards their rehabilitation and find out what the problems of the prisoners are.  In turn, <Col N="165" /> this can be related to the treatment they are given so that it will be possible to find a place for them in the outside community.</P>
    <P>There is another rule, rule 165, to which I should like to refer.  That rule specifies that the chaplain is responsible for the mental welfare of the prisoners.  No other person is explicitly given this responsibility.  I do not believe that the mental welfare of prisoners should be the sole responsibility of the chaplain.  The whole prison service should be concerned with his mental welfare.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>If so, it is not specifically laid down in the regulations. When the regulations are being revised we should spread that responsibility. Up to now I have been talking about the institutional treatment of prisoners. Even the most modern and enlightened type of institutional treatment has not achieved by any standards the proven results of treatment of criminals outside institutions.  Probation is, perhaps, the only form of treatment of criminals which statistics have proved to be really effective and it is in this field that we should look for the greatest development in the near future.  We can do this not only from the point of view of achieving results but also from the point of view of cost.  The cost of keeping a prisoner in an institution works out at about £800 or £900 a year.  I know that to employ a probation officer would, perhaps, cost twice as much as that but the officer could be given responsibility for 15 or 16 criminals outside an institution.  Therefore, it will be seen that treatment of criminals outside an institution is much cheaper than their treatment inside institutions.  In this regard I must welcome what is suggested in the Minister's speech in relation to expanding the probation service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must seek to reduce greatly the case load of each probation officer.  The average case load at the moment is 60. In other words, in a given week the probation officer must see and take an interest in 60 persons.  This possibly involves a considerable amount of travel with the result that he is likely to spend <Col N="166" /> only about 15 minutes each week with each probationer.  This is totally inadequate. For a probation service to be effective it would be necessary to reduce the case load of each probation officer to 15 or 16 probationers so that the officer can share in their recreational activities and also go around with the probationer and help him to find a job if he has not already got one.  A case load of 60 rules out this possibility almost entirely and what probably happens is that the person on probation calls at the office of the probation officer for a few minutes each week where he is more or less patted on the head and asked how he is getting on.</P>
    <P>The personality of the probation officer is of very great importance. It is not enough that he should be highly qualified&mdash;most of them have degrees in social science and other subjects from the universities&mdash;but it is also important that he should have the necessary personality traits for the job.  He should be a gregarious person who gets along well with people.  In this context, perhaps, some form of course in probation could be developed either in our universities or by the Department of Justice.  I do not know much about this but as far as I know there is no such course at the moment.  This is a highly specialised field so that we should consider developing a course in probation.  At any rate, our aim should be towards reducing the case load of each probation officer to 15 or 16 probationers.  This may seem expensive but it is much less expensive than keeping the people in prisons and, as I have said, it has proven results. Therefore, it would also be in the interests of the taxpayers that this should be done.  At the same time, any attempt to impose economic considerations into this field in a narrow sense without taking into account the possible rehabilitation prospects would be unwise.</P>
    <P>Another point in this regard is that probation in Ireland, in so far as I know, is applied only to juvenile offenders.  It has been shown that probation can play as beneficial a rehabilitative role for older criminals as it does for younger ones.  Therefore, <Col N="167" /> in developing the probation service we should incorporate all types of offenders and, where possible, we should tend to put people on probation rather than to send them to prison. Confining them to an institution may give us a certain amount of satisfaction but it cannot produce the same results as rehabilitation.  The whole question of sentencing should be reviewed and there should be greater emphasis on treatment of offenders in the community as against their treatment in institutions.</P>
    <P>Another question which should be considered is that of the visiting committees. I am afraid that the visiting committees to prisons are not as critical as they should be or, perhaps, they are but the critical parts of their reports are suppressed.  A perusal of the prison reports will reveal that only extracts from the reports of the visiting committees are published.  These committees are independent bodies; they are the watchdogs for the community on the prisons.  The fact that only extracts of their reports are published leaves one open to suspect that the critical parts are effectively suppressed &mdash;at least they are suppressed to the extent that they are not made available to the public.  Another possible interpretation is that the visiting committees themselves are not critical at all.  As I pointed out, they tend in their reports to use the same phraseology in referring to different aspects of the prisons, in regard to the food and so on.  When they can more or less copy out large chunks of last year's reports for inclusion in this year's report, it suggests they are not adopting a very critical attitude towards the prisons.  It is quite possible that in the parts of the reports which are not published they adopt a more critical approach, and I should not like to pre-judge this matter.  However, I hope that in relation to the revision of the annual prison report, which was indicated to me yesterday by the Minister in answer to a question I asked, we will in future publish the whole of the report and not just selected extracts which could possibly be suspected of being the more pleasant parts from the Minister's point of view.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="168" /> Another point is that of the total number of 48 members of the visiting committees there is only one social worker among them.  This is inadequate. There should be many more social workers.  There is a need to extend the membership to include people with expertise in criminology, penology and social problems so that they would be able to be critical of prisons in relation to rehabilitation and so on.  That is not in any way to decry the work of the existing members of the visiting committees who are doing voluntary work of a very laudable character.  I asked a question yesterday about the prison reports and it is a fact that the prison reports for 1967, 1968 and 1969 are not yet available.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I was, yes, but I believe that when this House is considering the Prisons Bill they should have up-to-date reports available to them and the Minister should have taken steps to ensure these reports would have been available to Members before they were asked to consider this Bill.  The fact that they are told the reports will be available in two or three weeks time is no use to them from the point of view of using the information that will be in the reports. This is most regrettable.  It is said the reason for not printing the 1967 and 1968 reports was that it was necessary to up-date the format of the report.  It should not take three years to do that if any serious effort were put into it.  We should ensure that in future these reports are brought out much more promptly than in the past.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of that, but this has not been the practice in the past.  Section 4 of this Bill will apply for the time being the 1947 rules to the new institution of Shanganagh.  I hope every effort will be made to bring these rules up to date in certain respects. I mentioned before the question of the role of prison officers, that their duties as laid down in the rules are confined almost entirely to security duties.  Any <Col N="169" /> new rules which will be brought in and which will be applied to Shanganagh as well as to our other institutions should stress more the rehabilitative role of prison officers than the security role.</P>
      <P>Rule 54 refers to secular instruction, instead of work, in reading, writing and arithmetic for prisoners who need this type of instruction.  I wonder if this rule is implemented vigorously and if all prisoners who need this training are given it and not being made use of as mere manual workers in the prison. This is a good rule but I am afraid it may not be implemented sufficiently vigorously.</P>
      <P>Rule 12 provides for the classification of prisoners on entry to the prison. It requires the taking of particulars in regard to name, age, height etc.  It is not enough, in classifying a prisoner and determining what sort of treatment he is to get, merely to take note of physical characteristics.  Classification should be greatly extended to include criminal background, mental capacity, mental problems and so on.  I hope these rules will be revised pretty soon because the whole concept of prison treatment has greatly changed since 1947 when these rules were originally drawn up.</P>
      <P>There are a few points I wish to raise in relation to the Minister's speech.  He said in the second paragraph that not every prisoner has the basic stability to allow of his being sent to an open centre like Shanganagh.  It is quite possible, therefore, that the prisoners with stability, those who, perhaps, it could be argued, are least in need of treatment, will get the best treatment.  We must also know what sort of improved treatment will be available for those who have not got the basic stability to be moved to Shanganagh, because these people without this stability are the people with the biggest problem.  It is important they should not be left behind in an old fashioned institution. As I said earlier, we should open up all our prisons and the question of opening up our prisons to community influences should not be confined to the few prisoners at present being sent to Shanganagh.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="170" /> The Minister refers to the question of recruiting suitable staff for Shanganagh. We need some more details as to what &ldquo;suitable&rdquo; means in this context, what type of staff will be recruited and what type of qualifications will they have.  It says here also that instruction in the three Rs will be given daily in Shanganagh.  I hope this instruction will be better than that which has been given to date in St. Patrick's, which I do not think is of a very high standard.  I am not sure about this, but people who need instruction in the three Rs are very often people who have to be given what you might call remedial education.  They are people who have to catch up. It is clear in regard to educational matters that the people who need remedial education need better quality education than the people who are getting education in the ordinary way at the correct age.  You need fewer students per teacher in respect of remedial education than in respect of ordinary education.  Many people in those institutions are getting remedial education.  We should ensure that an adequate number of teachers is available to give the required individual treatment to ensure that those people catch up in respect of the three Rs. I understand there is only one teacher teaching the three Rs in St. Patrick's Institution at present and that the average population there is 195.  If one assumes that half of those people are getting education in the Rs this would indicate that you would have a class of 100 and only one teacher.  This certainly is not in accordance with the need of having fewer students per teacher in remedial education.</P>
    <P>We are told that a grading system has been introduced to provide incentives for the detainees and to reward their efforts rather than their accomplishments. This is a very good thing although in fact such a grading system was provided for under the 1947 rules so there is nothing new in regard to this proposal.  There is a point the Minister makes later in his speech that prisoners are given 7s gratuity per week for work done and that this is pocket money.  There is an argument for not having this at the flat rate of 7s per week.  We should try in some way to <Col N="171" /> give more to those who make the greatest effort and less to those who do not.  A flat rate of 7s is not the right approach.</P>
    <P>We are also told that reconviction rates are being compiled but they will not have any real significance until figures for a minimum &ldquo;follow-up&rdquo; period of two or three years become available.  This is in relation to Shanganagh. There is need for much more detailed statistics in relation to reconviction rates for all types of prisoners, not just those leaving Shanganagh.  We have figures for the number of people committed in a given year who were previously committed, but we do not have a breakdown as to whether this is the second, third, fourth, fifth or sixth conviction.  The case of a person who goes back for a second conviction is not as serious as the person who goes back for perhaps a sixth conviction. We need to have in future a breakdown in regard to whether this is the second, third, fourth, fifth or sixth conviction and also some information as to the age, education and background of the people who have been reconvicted.</P>
    <P>Reconviction rates are not the only acceptable yardstick for the effectiveness of a prison institution.  It is not just enough to say that so many people did not come back.  It is quite possible that after leaving prison, although they might not have returned to crime, they are still maladjusted individuals.  Even though they do not return to crime they might not be successful in finding a place in the community.  We should try to have a greater follow-up of those people to find out whether they have got employment and how they are adapting themselves to life in general. This would be a useful way of measuring the success of our penal treatment.</P>
    <P>Section 6 of the Bill proposes to reduce the maximum age for persons who are remanded or committed to St. Patrick's Institution from 21 to 19 and that people over 19 will in general go to prison.  It is not appropriate to lump all people from 19 upwards in one institution.  We need a special institution for those people between the ages of 19 and 22 because the young offender is a different type of offender <Col N="172" /> from the older offender.  Young offenders are very often people who will not repeat their offence when they get married and accept their responsibility in the community.  However, they are people who are maladjusted and this maladjustment is likely to continue even though they might not return to crime.  We should certainly have an institution to deal with those young offenders between the ages of 19 to 22.  There is need for a third type of institution between St. Patrick's and the ordinary prison to deal with the people in that age group.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned that St. Patrick's Institution has taken on more and more the character of a centre for the detention of young offenders serving short terms.  It is very important also that we should have a separate institution for young offenders who are serving long terms because people who are serving longer terms can be given more intensive training in various skills to help them to adapt themselves to work in the community.  We should not lump all types of short-term and long-term people into the one institution because people who are only there for a short term cannot acquire the necessary training.  When you try to cater for short-term people you are likely to hold back the training of those who are on a long-term basis and who can avail of longer term training facilities.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that the growing pressure on accommodation made it necessary last year to encroach further on the cell accommodation remaining for the female prison.  We are adopting the wrong approach here in that we are anticipating a growing pressure on accommodation in the prison. If we can move towards the emphasis which I am advocating that their treatment in the community would be by means of probation rather than institutional care or imprisonment there is no reason why there should be a growing pressure on accommodation.  The adoption of more in-community treatment would solve a lot of the problems here.</P>
    <P>The Minister states that Marlborough House is expected to be closed this year on the opening of a new preventive centre at Finglas.  We need from him or some other Minister <Col N="173" /> more information on what is involved in this preventive centre.  What will be done there?  This word &ldquo;preventive&rdquo; is a new word here and we should be given some information about what is involved in this preventive centre. The Minister also speaks about the appointment of a psychologist.  This has been spoken about for years but nothing has been done about it.  The Minister recognises the point I have been making when he says:</P>
    <P>Moreover, the environment of an institution is basically unsuitable for encouraging individuals to become adequate and responsible members of normal society.  It is an entirely artificial community and the high degree of uniformity which is unavoidable militates against the development of responsibility and of a person's individual character.</P>
    <P>I think this is a very laudable sentiment, with which I agree entirely. However, we must see some definite indications that it will be acted on in connection with a policy for the treatment of prisoners in the future.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that temporary release is a significant step forward. Certainly it is, but I am afraid it is not being applied nearly as vigorously as it should be.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's colleague, Deputy Fitzpatrick, complained that too many were being released.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with Deputy Fitzpatrick on that point. Deputy Browne expressed doubt on the wisdom of having instruction in car driving and repairs.  His approach to it was very tentative and I do not think he had given it any great thought.  I regard it as a very important matter because, as the Minister pointed out, people who are able to drive can find employment much more easily than those who are not.  I suggest we should have information as to how many prisoners are given this instruction.  It is one thing to say that this facility is available but it is another thing to ensure that a substantial number of prisoners avail of instruction in car <Col N="174" /> driving and repair.  It might be possible that only four, five or six prisoners get such instruction in a year.  I should be glad if the Minister gave us the figures.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's discussions with AnCO in efforts to ensure that the training given in these establishments is of the most suitable kind to equip prisoners for industrial employment. Such co-ordination is desirable and I must congratulate the Minister and the Department on this improvement.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to prison diet and there has been discussion here on it.  He commended Deputy Tunney on what he had said, to the effect that prison diet is as good as that of many breadwinners outside.  I asked for information about the cost per prisoner per week in respect of food and I was told it is 22s.  There are very few people outside who live on a diet costing 22s a week.  It is, therefore, evident that a prisoner's diet is not a luxurious one, to say the least of it.  On the question of butter and margarine, it is margarine which is used entirely.  We are an agricultural country and I suggest that a proportion of butter should be used.  I am not seeking to discriminate against margarine, which is also produced here, but we should ensure that a certain amount of butter is used.</P>
      <P>I welcome the course for prison officers which has been arranged with the department of psychology in UCD. The Minister mentioned the loyalty and discipline of the service which was impressively shown towards the end of last year when disturbances occurred in Mountjoy and Portlaoise.  The Minister paid a tribute to all the officers concerned, some of whom were injured. On behalf of my party and, I am sure, on behalf of all on this side of the House, I should like to join in that tribute.  Great credit is due to the prison officers for their handling of those unfortunate occurrences.</P>
      <P>The Minister mentioned the possible utilisation of voluntary workers and he said every effort is being made to utilise them to the fullest possible extent.  I suggest that efforts should be made to get the co-operation of organisations in addition to the Salvation Army and the Legion of Mary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="175" /> In conclusion I should first of all like to repeat my welcome for this Bill and for the Minister's opening statement which outlines so many reforms.  Section 3 (1) of the Bill states that the Minister may, by regulations, specify by reference to age and sex the classes of persons who may be detained in a place provided under section 2.  I suggest we need criteria other than age and sex in such regulations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that, but I think it is desirable that they should be discussed in relation to the Bill.  At any rate, there is a need to open up the whole question of prisons to make provision for community involvement so as to ensure that prisoners can adapt what they learn to life outside.  We should not be afraid to be described as eggheads because we use psychological methods.  We should not be afraid to give prisoners more responsibility in regard to the running of prisons.  We should give the public more information about what is going on in the prisons and, therefore, we should not issue prison reports which are almost <Col N="176" /> secretive.  We need to ensure also in this context that whatever we do in regard to individual prisoners is associated with their psychological and criminal backgrounds.  We should learn to treat criminals outside as being part of the community and help them to adapt to life outside.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to be associated with my colleagues in the Labour Party and with Deputies Bruton and Fitzpatrick in welcoming this measure and in congratulating the Minister for having introduced the Bill in such a comprehensive manner.  The Minister should also be congratulated for having placed before the House not merely an analysis of the amendments proposed in penal legislation but more particularly for giving to us his detailed personal views and the views of the professional staff of the Department on prison reform generally.  We in the Labour Party have found that the comprehensive statement of the Minister is an indication that we may revise our circumspect opinions in relation to prisons.  This augurs well, and I am not speaking in a patronising way to the Minister.</P>
      <P>I particularly welcome the Bill as a public representative in whose constituency the semi-open institution of Shanganagh is situated, on the borders of Shankill village.  It is my hope that that semi-open institution, with accommodation for suitable first offenders&mdash; I detest the term &ldquo;inmate&rdquo;; would the Minister not consider deleting it?&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it is beyond our ingenuity to delete both terms.  I do not regard Shanganagh as being ideal but I welcome the set-up in the institution.  Although admittedly the Department and the prison staffs have had two years experience of running this institution, and although admittedly it is still in the experimental stages, I feel strongly that it will become a vital part of the evolution of a more effective, a more humane and a more democratic penal system in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, I welcome the comments of the Minister.  I have not any special <Col N="177" /> insight into penal practices but I consider there are a number of points worthy of mention in this House.  The professional staffs of the Department of Justice work in these institutions in extremely difficult conditions.  They must possess an exceptionally high degree of training and understanding. At the same time, they must maintain normal discipline and be able to develop effective relationships with the persons committed to these institutions. By and large, the staffs concerned are not accorded either the level of training, of pay or general conditions of service that are essential to attract and retain in the service men and women of the high calibre required. There is an urgent need for the new Minister and for all the parties to review in a comprehensive and effective manner the conditions of service of prison officers, of governor grades and the new ancillary categories of staff.</P>
    <P>So far as actual prison conditions are concerned, there does not seem to be any really effective long-term policy in the Department of Justice on the future role of our penal institutions.  I think Deputy Bruton and Deputy Fitzpatrick would concur with me that we have spent many thousands of pounds on maintenance and reconstruction of institutions such as Mountjoy and St. Patrick's when it might have been wiser to seek alternative sites convenient to Dublin and construct modern detention centres.  By doing this I consider we would now have a more effective system in operation.  I stress this point because, notwithstanding the efforts of the Department staff and the associated Government agencies, I am convinced there is an urgent need to get rid of the old, grim, Victorian structures of Mountjoy and St. Patrick's and many of the other needlessly unpleasant features which still exist in our prisons.</P>
    <P>In Ireland we have developed a more modern attitude towards prison conditions in the past few years but we are still far behind much of the advanced European thinking on this matter.  We have a long way to go before we catch up with the modern evolution of prison reform on the Continent and even in certain parts of Britain.  There are many aspects of prison life which need <Col N="178" /> reform: there is the matter of prison dress, the censorship of letters, the restriction and supervision of visits, cheap labour, the discharge of prisoners and, in particular, the insurance situation where employment cards are not given to prisoners.  All of these are justified by the Department as being necessary evils and due to lack of facilities.  However, to an objective outsider, and particularly to the prisoners themselves, these aspects of prison life can only be regarded as a continuation of outdated policies and of what might be called a perverse attitude in the matter of punishment and general human degradation.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the enlightened statement of the Minister, there is going to be considerable difficulty in convincing the public at large that they must advocate improved conditions in our penal institutions.  We must get rid of the idea that transgressors must suffer, that unless they suffer to the limits of the law their crimes will not be expiated and they will not be reformed. This moralistic assumption is inbred in our attitude to prison life and punishment and until there is a change of public opinion a great deal of the work and the enlightened attitude in the Department of Justice will come to nothing.  I am of the opinion &mdash;this is generally accepted among those concerned with prison reform&mdash; that prolonged imprisonment is more likely to have deformative effects on the mind and outlook of those subjected to it rather than reformative.</P>
    <P>When inmates, to use that horrible term, suffer deliberate punitive methods in prisons, these are more likely to aggravate the human defects they already suffer from than reform them. I submit there is an obligation on the prison system, even if it cannot make better men and women out of those committed to its charge, to ensure it does not make them worse.  The main purpose of modern methods in our prisons, institutions and juvenile detention centres is to seek to counter, as strenuously as possible, the danger inherent in prolonged confinement of the deterioration of the moral fibre of the prisoners as well as of their mental and physical well-being.  I am not suggesting <Col N="179" /> that the same degree of impact occurs on those serving short sentences; nevertheless, I think this aspect is worthy of consideration by the new Minister for Justice.</P>
    <P>There is a great need to replace the negative aspects of prison life, the repressive aspects of institutional custodial life, with something positive and constructive.  All sentences should be designed to encourage the reawakening and the development of self-respect in the prisoners themselves.  The only way this can be done is by having these virtues practised in prisons.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's intention to develop more open prisons.  There is nothing particularly new about open prisons.  The First United Nations Congress on the Prevention of Crime and the Treatment of Offenders, held in Geneva in 1955, defined an open prison as characterised by the absence of material or physical precautions against escape (such as walls, locks, bars, armed or other special security guards) and by a system based on self-discipline and the inmate's sense of responsibility towards the group in which he lives.  The congress concluded that the open institution marks an important step in the development of modern prison systems and represents one of the most successful applications of the principle of the individualisation of penalties with a view to social readjustment. It recommended the extension of the open system to the largest possible number of prisoners, subject to certain conditions suggested for the proper working of the system.  This is of particular importance in penal and prison reform in this country.</P>
    <P>It is always dangerous for the public representative to say this, but I believe there is a residue of public ignorance in relation to the question of crime, and a great deal of superficial public reaction to questions of crime and prison reform.  There is therefore a tremendous obligation on the Department of Justice and on Members of this House to try to develop a more enlightened public attitude on this question.  Most people do not think about the prison system until a member of their own family, a neighbour's child or an acquaintance gets a prison sentence.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="180" /> I concur with the courageous admission made by the Minister about employment for prisoners.  In his speech he said the provision of suitable employment for prisoners was one of special difficulty.  He pointed out that the present gratuity paid to prisoners is 7s a week and that this cannot be regarded as being anything more than pocket money.  If one is sentenced to a term of imprisonment, whether for a couple of months or a couple of years, I do not think the sum of 7s a week payment for prison labour, which is, after all, only the price of 30 cigarettes, can be regarded as anything but a personal insult.  When their sentences are up these prisoners are expected to resume a normal role in society and perhaps even maintain a family.  The provision of suitable and normal employment for prisoners should be the subject of great consideration by both the Minister and his Department.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Minister I am not unaware of the difficulties involved.  I am not unaware that some employers will start shouting their heads off about the use of cheap labour; equally, some trade unionists may feel that prisoners working on a particular job may affect their particular employment.  I am not unaware of the difficulties of training prisoners in skilled or semi-skilled work.  I would particularly encourage training in the construction and engineering industries because prisoners are likely to obtain employment in these industries when they are released. I feel the work done by the interdepartmental committee for the employment of prisoners should be reassessed by the Minister.  I am not entirely certain whether or not this committee is still in existence.</P>
    <P>The Minister did mention the interdepartmental committee for the prevention of crime and the treatment of offenders, but I would suggest that a special internal committee to deal with the question of the provision of employment for prisoners should be set up.  I should like to see a special committee set up on a national basis, representative of employers, trade unions, prison staffs, specialist staffs and so on.  This could be of immense value in breaking down many of the existing barriers. <Col N="181" /> The day has gone when it was accepted that the work of the prisoner, be he a juvenile offender or an adult criminal, must be made as hard and as degrading as possible.  This concept is now being abandoned and the general idea is that reform is constituted of a great deal more than merely keeping prisoners out of mischief or making sure that lazy prisoners do some work.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's statement in regard to prison employment.  I have no doubt that the introduction of a board, together with a comprehensive and effective system of employment, will ensure that prisoners will make the best possible contribution to the community in general while serving their sentences.  Because sentences are for the most part of short duration it is extremely difficult to give any proper training for employment, but if work is properly scheduled and organised there is no reason why rehabilitation and reintegration should be difficult.  If Deputies had experience of the timetable in Mountjoy they would emerge very shattered.  It is archaic, to say the least of it.  I am sure the prison staff could make many suggestions for improvement, suggestions which the Minister should consider.  If suitable employment is properly integrated into the timetable it could make a very valuable contribution towards the training of prisoners before they leave prison. Many of our young offenders have very little experience of anything other than casual work.  Many of them find themselves in dead-end jobs.  If they could be educated during their time in prison into appreciating what a typical industrial job is like and what it requires this could have a very healthy effect. As it is, they have no proper concept of working under normal working conditions and they are completely unaware of this particular type of human activity.  I am not overstressing the situation.  If they are given this kind of experience they will have a far better chance of getting a job on discharge and, more important still, of keeping it. But that will not be the pattern if they are occupied in wholly ineffective employment during the duration of their stay.</P>
    <P>I do not suggest that prison employment <Col N="182" /> alone is the only internal reform required, but it is most important.  If the young prisoner or the juvenile detainee cannot get employment in the critical three or four weeks after discharge then a very small incident&mdash; perhaps the reaction of a prospective employer or of a member of his own family&mdash;sets in train again a pattern that one is trying to correct and I suggest to the Minister that a great deal depends on prisoners being given confidence in themselves while they are in prison and confidence in their ability to do a job in industry as an alternative to making a living through crime.</P>
    <P>I have had some very small experience of trying to get trade union membership cards for young offenders just out of prison to ensure their being integrated into a normal industrial environment and the one quality I found lacking in most of them was the feeling of their personal incapacity to do a job, even when they were given a job and were looked after by a trade union secretary.  This total failure in confidence is quite contrary to the popular conception of what a prisoner is like on discharge.  I would stress this to the Minister from the point of view of welfare and discharge care.  It is of major importance.</P>
    <P>I can never understand why prisoners in our society should be completely debarred from access to the outside world.  I could never appreciate the ultra-moralistic concept that one takes a man out of normal living and cuts him completely off from ordinary social conditions.  Then, on discharge, he is expected to re-integrate himself into society.  I suggest there should be full access to wireless and television.  That is the only hope.  That might be the popular wish, but there is also the popular conception that not only must freedom be withdrawn but normal human involvement must also be cut off.  This is an inbred attitude to crime and punishment in our community and it is almost impossible to convince people that, by taking this attitude, one is only increasing criminal propensity instead of eradicating it.  The worst punishment is the withdrawal of freedom.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="183" /> We get the kind of juvenile delinquent we deserve.  I detest the term &ldquo;juvenile delinquent&rdquo;.  I do not think anyone has defined it.  I find these terms on the whole most unsatisfactory. The Minister might examine them in the context of future development. I am sure Spiro Agnew would not share my sentiments, but time will tell where he is concerned.  There is a good deal of talk&mdash;I do not suggest political parties have contributed to it&mdash;about forging ahead.  I see a great deal of the suburban rat race in which so much emphasis is laid on the acquisition of the trappings of what is regarded as the good life, the acquisition of the consumer goods which allegedly symbolise the development of human status in our contemporary society. You see this tremendous pressure, epitomised by RTE advertising and newspaper advertising, and the general goals and ideals held up as being the life which people should live, and you see these goals being accepted by the vast majority of our population as normal in our society.  Then take somebody coming from a poor background, a deprived family, somebody whose mental capacity is perhaps innately in some respects subnormal or deprived in many ways and he sees that many other sectors of the community are striving and racing after these success symbols, and when he stumbles when put under the same pressure, inevitably he develops the idea of taking the illegitimate, illegal shortcuts to gain these success symbols.  Therefore, I suggest to the Minister that he might in future warn society at large against unleashing unrealistic and unattainable aspirations among many sections of our community. The consumer orientated status society in which we live has aroused aspirations&mdash;not only aroused them but frustrated them in many respects &mdash;and as a result we get the criminals, the juvenile delinquents and the people that we deserve to get from that approach.</P>
    <P>I suggest that this is a dangerous tendency in society.  We do not need any moralistic lectures about the dangers of materialism but I think it is a tendency which the Minister should <Col N="184" /> in future discourage.  I have no doubt that he will do so much more effectively but in a much more humane manner than by adopting the out-dated attitudes his predecessor at times tended to adopt in such matters. I do not accept, notwithstanding the growth in our prison population and the development of a more effective penal system, this Jeremiah view which is so popular, particularly in America and in many parts of Britain, epitomised by the Conservative Party attitude and epitomised by some of the attitudes of some of the backbenchers of some of the parties in this House: that society at large has become much more immoral and has generally declined in terms of moralistic propriety in this country and in Europe as a whole.  It is by no means established, as yet, that either in this or in any other country in Europe the average family is less stable or less cohesive or less integrated than, say, 20 years ago.  When we look upon the social changes that have occurred in this country even in the past decade, I think it is true to say that the television set has resulted in families becoming more home centred and that social life centred around the local pub has, perhaps, declined among certain sections of the community.</P>
    <P>We have shorter working hours, better housing conditions.  We have had a considerable increase in our standard of living and an enormous increase in household goods.  We have a better system of education&mdash;for which the Opposition parties, I would submit, are as much responsible as the Government&mdash;and we have greater leisure to enjoy these benefits.  As a result we have had a considerable breakdown in the rigid roles of parents. Husbands, in particular, now take a more active interest in their homes and children.  As a result, many public-houses have lost custom which they had down the years.  These are social developments with a profound impact on the lessening of crime and instability among our people and on the opening up of society.</P>
    <P>While, admittedly, there are new problems such as drugs and new social pressures and so on, it is my view that the general moral health of our <Col N="185" /> young people is better now than in the twenties or thirties or even the fifties and sixties.</P>
    <P>These points I am putting to the Minister are of a somewhat general nature but they are of considerable importance.  I do not favour public relations officers in Government Departments as such but I think the public relations of his Department could be better.  Equally, I would suggest that Deputies should have an opportunity of visiting the institutions under the Department.  I know there is the fact, and I agree with it, that a Member of this House has no special privileges in regard to visiting any constituent who may be in prison and that he has to seek the permission of the Minister.  But if a State-sponsored body such as Aer Lingus can invite Deputies to go up in a jet and fly around Dublin and then discuss with the general manager of Aer Lingus the role of the company, why should we not have an opportunity of visiting Mountjoy?  I have been there before on visitation.  Why could we not visit Shanganagh and other institutions in groups and meet the staffs and the governors?  I have no doubt the departmental staff would accept that a more enlightened knowledge by public representatives of what happens in these institutions would contribute to more effective debate here.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I congratulate the Minister on his comprehensive introductory speech on this Bill which was of a very high order.  I certainly welcome and support this Bill and I have no doubt that it augurs well for the Minister's future tenure of office.</P>

      <P>I should like to welcome the thoughtful and constructive contributions made by all Deputies who spoke.  I think everybody who spoke had a really worthwhile point of view to put.  I particularly appreciate that the Bill was approached in the proper spirit&mdash;it was a non-party approach and I think there was a great deal of agreement on both sides of the House as to what is desirable. Unfortunately, as Minister, while I agree with a great deal of what has been suggested as desirable, I am not in <Col N="186" /> a position to agree that in all cases it is practicable for financial and other reasons.</P>
      <P>I should like to refer particularly to Deputy Tunney's contribution to this debate and to thank him for what he said, but in particular to thank him and through him to thank all the other members of the visiting committees to our prisons and to St. Patrick's for the work of great public service which they are doing without any great publicity and, perhaps, without any great thanks. Their services are given voluntarily and are not as fully appreciated by the public as they might be.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately I have not yet had an opportunity to make as detailed a study as I would wish of prison rehabilitation and the reform of our criminal procedures.  Indeed, all of what is proposed in the Bill and a great deal of what I referred to in my speech is the work and the creation of my predecessor. I should like to take this opportunity, as Deputy Bruton and other Deputies have done in this debate, to pay tribute to him for the very special efforts which he made in this regard during his term of office.</P>
      <P>I shall open my reply with some fairly general remarks.  I propose later to deal with some of the specific problems referred to by individual Deputies.  One of the first things I should say is that I am very keen that my Department and, indeed, all concerned with prisons and offenders should endeavour to co-ordinate the efforts of all agencies whether departmental, local authority, or voluntary, and work together towards the end which it is clear from this debate we all desire to achieve&mdash;the rehabilitation of prisoners and their reintegration in society as people who are able to contribute and play a responsible part.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Much of the debate was concentrated on the reforms and improvements that are necessary in the institutional side of our penal system.  I was glad to hear many Deputies place special emphasis on what needs to be done on the non-institutional side.  I see this in the long run as perhaps the more important of the two.  I made it clear in my opening speech, and it was reiterated very <Col N="187" /> strongly and very well by Deputy Dr. Browne, that the very fact of being detained in an institution has an undoubted detrimental effect on the average individual.  This is particularly so where he may be inadequate socially or intellectually.</P>
    <P>Not alone from the point of view of benefiting society and benefiting the individual offender but also from the purely economic point of view, as Deputy Bruton pointed out this morning, I think we should try to direct our efforts to the greatest possible extent to the non-institutional care of offenders. It has been demonstrated that this is more effective both for society and for the offender.  Those reasons in themselves are more than sufficient to justify concentrating an increasing proportion of our resources on non-institutional services such as probation officers and welfare officers.</P>
    <P>I suppose I would be optimistic to think that I could reverse a national trend in crime which is part of a worldwide trend but a greater impact can perhaps be made by concentrating on the non-institutional forms of treatment. It was for these reasons that I announced the proposal to strengthen very considerably the Dublin probation service, to increase it from six to 13 officers and to appoint eight officers in the Provinces where unfortunately, there has been no full-time probation or welfare service at all.  As Deputies will appreciate, this is a very considerable increase in non-institutional services. One might as well be can did about it and say that up to now they have been grossly unsatisfactory.</P>
    <P>I want to go further than this and assure the House that if I find that the increases proposed are still not sufficient, I will certainly appoint further probation and welfare officers in Dublin and in the Provinces.  I see this as a more beneficial and a more economic use of our resources.  These were my own feelings on the matter before I came into the House yesterday for this debate and they have been reinforced by the very worthwhile contributions made by all Deputies who spoke.  A very high measure of agreement in regard to these matters has been displayed in the House and a very helpful <Col N="188" /> and responsible approach has been adopted by all Deputies.</P>
    <P>The speech which disturbed me most perhaps was that of Deputy Dr. Browne.  In the course of his speech he acknowledged very freely that his views were not typical and might well be rejected by a great many people.  I am glad he acknowledged that himself and that it is not necessary for me alone to point that out.  At the same time, I think I should not let some of his remarks with regard to the punitive aspect or element in our penal system pass without making some comment on them.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dr. Browne seems to feel that the sole motivation in our penal system is this punitive element or aspect.  I would beg leave to disagree rather fundamentally with him.  There must of necessity be a considerable element of punishment in any deprivation of liberty.  Even if someone were confined in the most luxurious hotel in Dublin there would still, by virtue of the deprivation of liberty, be a considerable punitive element.  I suppose there is also some punitive element in restriction on visits and letters.  This restriction is necessary in the interests of security.  Outside of that it is quite wrong to suggest that there is any other punitive attitude or motivation in our treatment of offenders.</P>
    <P>I cannot see how we can use any system of detention that has not got that unavoidable element of punishment in it.  This is not the way the prison staff approach their duties.  Perhaps it is unfair to Deputy Dr. Browne to say that he appeared to imply that the staff are there to punish the prisoners rather than help them.  I should like to refer the House to some of the comments I made in my opening speech.  I said:</P>
    <P>Here may I say that the quality of any service is only as good as that of the people who provide it.  The prison service is no exception.  It requires of the staff qualities of sympathy and understanding and, where necessary, firmness and control. I believe our service has these qualities to a high degree ...</P>
    <P>I think it should be pointed out that <Col N="189" /> the prison officers are Christian men who do their best to alleviate the hardship involved for anybody who is isolated from the community.  They are as jealous of their good name as anybody else, either inside or outside this House.  I think they are entitled to have their good name vindicated.  The work which they do is undoubtedly very difficult.  They work at times under conditions of strain which less tolerant and less patient men might not be able to endure.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton referred to some of the 1947 Rules for Prisons.  I agree with him that, on paper, some of them are not in accord with modern thinking. However, he can have my assurance that a group is at present working on the modernisation of these rules and I hope it will be carried out shortly.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton also may rest assured that it is not my wish, nor is it the practice of governors of prisons, that the more antiquated of these rules should be applied as they are set out. In particular, in regard to Shanganagh, which is the place to which this Bill refers most particularly, no such rules apply at all.  Indeed, the very opposite is the case in Shanganagh because every effort is made to encourage the staff and the offenders detained there to meet on as friendly terms as possible.</P>
    <P>Another point in Deputy Dr. Browne's speech&mdash;I think it was taken up to some extent afterwards by Deputy Bruton&mdash;was that sentences should be indeterminate to some extent and that they should fit the criminal rather than the crime.  That is all very well in theory.  I appreciate Deputy Dr. Browne's approach, as a psychiatrist, to this problem.  However, it is because my own background is that of a lawyer that I somewhat recoil from Deputy Dr. Browne's views.  I do not think that the basic sense of justice in the community would accept for a minute that the length of a person's detention should be determined by his progress or lack of progress in rehabilitation rather than by the seriousness or otherwise of his offence.  I do not think either that our Supreme Court&mdash;having regard to the provisions of our Constitution relating <Col N="190" /> to the liberty of the individual&mdash;would be prepared to look kindly on an indeterminate length of sentence such as that proposed&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is quite flexible at present&mdash;much more so than Deputies think.  I got the impression from Deputy Dr. Browne that the flexibility should be at the other end.  He seems to defeat his own argument about an individual becoming institutionalised when he suggests that, in certain cases, the rehabilitation of the persons required that sentences be extended.</P>
      <P>A number of Deputies raised questions requiring some detail with regard to the educational facilities available in Shanganagh, in particular, and in our other institutions.  While I have not had time to get all the detail which I might wish to give to Deputies, I think I can be of some assistance.  Like many Deputies who have spoken, I share the concern which they, and many of my predecessors, have expressed about the importance of basic education in these institutions, particularly for younger offenders.  It was principally to effect a radical improvement in this whole area that it was decided to appoint a psychologist.  I am in a position to say that the Civil Service Commissioners have interviewed applicants for the post of psychologist and that only formalities such as medical examination have yet to be complied with.  I have every reason to expect that I shall be appointing the successful candidate in a matter of a couple of weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me go through the educational facilities that are available.  I shall deal first with Mountjoy and say that, in that prison, there is a qualified teacher who, some years ago, took a special intensive course in rapid teaching for adults.  He conducts classes in Mountjoy <Col N="191" /> every morning and evening in the corrective training unit.  His work has been found to be of the very highest order.  He has achieved considerable success with adult prisoners who, for one reason or another, have little or no education.  In St. Patrick's, an officer who has some training&mdash;unfortunately he is not fully qualified&mdash;has been holding classes in the Three R's for educationally backward boys.  He, also, has achieved a good degree of success. He has approximately 20 boys for two hours each morning and each afternoon.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not regarded as desirable that the class should be any bigger.  However, with the appointment of additional people, it will be possible to run a number of classes there simultaneously in the near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it 20 per class with the possibility that there might be different boys&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Twenty over a given short period.  The 20 would vary from time to time.  In Shanganagh, we are fortunate to have an officer who has a natural flair for teaching.  Virtually all the boys there attend classes for half the day.  Because of smaller numbers and the greater concentration on education in Shanganagh a great number of them have made remarkable progress in basic subjects.  I think the House might be interested to know that, on arrival in Shanganagh, each boy is allocated to one of three groups.  The A group consists of those who are very backward: they attend class each morning.  The B group consists of those who are able to read and write reasonably well: they attend class on three afternoons per week.  The C group are those whose primary education is regarded as satisfactory: they attend on the two remaining afternoons each week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unfortunately, the majority of those <Col N="192" /> who come to Shanganagh are found to come into the A category but one of the most rewarding features of the programme has been the number of boys who have learned to read and write while there.  It has also been a feature that many of the boys, when they discover they are capable of learning, have devoted a good deal of their free time to improving themselves educationally.</P>
    <P>A vocational teacher visits Shanganagh three times a week to instruct a group in woodwork and one of the officers who is also a carpenter, supervises the manufacture of furniture for the house and the carrying out of necessary running repairs.  A great deal of reconstruction work has been carried out in the last 18 months or so in Shanganagh.  Much of that has been done by the boys themselves.</P>
    <P>I fully realise the importance of the educational work that must be done in all these institutions and I feel that the imminent appointment of the psychologist will bring about significant improvement. His primary task will be to establish an adequate educational set-up to rectify the shortcomings of young offenders educationally, particularly in reading, writing and arithmetic.  He will concentrate his efforts on St. Patrick's and Shanganagh, initially.</P>
    <P>I also intend to speak to my colleague, the Minister for Education, with a view to seeing whether special schools, suitably staffed and equipped, can now be provided in these detention centres and in the prisons.  The House can take it for granted that I will leave nothing undone to facilitate that development. I have also requested the County Dublin Vocational Education Committee to allocate two part-time instructors to Shanganagh.  They expect to be able to do this from the commencement of the new school year in September.</P>
    <P>With regard to the staffing of Shanganagh, it should be pointed out to the House that at present the staff is 22 for 55 residents.  That, in itself, is an excellent ratio.  It is, of course, by far the highest in any institution in this country but it is also higher than it is in many similar institutions abroad.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="193" /> When some additional appointments have been made I would hope and expect that within 12 months the staff attached to Shanganagh will number over 30 so that the ratio will, in fact, be better than one to two.  There is accommodation for 55 boys in Shanganagh. This is regarded as an optimum number.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton and other Deputies raised the question of day release and temporary release to employment. Deputy Bruton may have been confused by the reply he got to a question he had put down to me yesterday.  He asked the number who were on day-to-day release from St. Patrick's.  In fact, in addition to that number, which was 44 in 1969, there were 17 on full temporary release as well.  The total number paroled from St. Patrick's to employment in 1969 was 61.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is still a fairly insignificant proportion of the total number in St. Patrick's, is it not?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is.  First of all employment is not available for everyone to whom we would wish to give it and, secondly, we must face up to the fact that there are some detainees in St. Patrick's whom we feel it is not in the public interest to release, even if they did have employment available to them.  The Deputy should bear those factors in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Bruton also referred to the desirability of involving voluntary workers in the work of rehabilitating offenders.  I should like, for my part, to support what he has said and to say that I, as Minister, will facilitate, to the greatest degree that I can, voluntary workers with the necessary qualities interesting themselves in this very important social work.  One of the problems we have had up to now is that we have had insufficient professional welfare officers to supervise this type of work and I have often felt that voluntary workers in this type of activity, no matter how generous they may be in giving of their time and talents, will work more effectively if they are subject to professional supervision. We have not, unfortunately, up to now been able to provide that to <Col N="194" /> the extent to which we would wish. With the appointment of a substantial number of new welfare officers to the probation service and to our prisons I feel we will, in fact, be able to provide this training and guidance and I would welcome accordingly an increase in the involvement of volunteers in this important social work.  I should like to take this opportunity of conveying my thanks to the various organisations and individuals who have been participating in this work for quite a number of years past.  I look forward now, with the extension of the prison welfare service and with the extension of the probation service, to a further increase in the number of voluntary workers who will certainly receive every co-operation and assistance from me.</P>
    <P>In that connection&mdash;if I may digress for a minute&mdash;I should like to refer to the suggestion of Deputy Desmond that outside persons who are interested, including in particular members of this House, might be facilitated in visiting our establishments to familiarise themselves with conditions there.  It certainly would be my intention to facilitate that development in every way.  It might be better if Deputies were not to visit the prisons individually but rather in groups and certainly any reasonable group of four, five or six Deputies who have a genuine interest in this problem will be facilitated by me and I will certainly direct that they be given every co-operation by the prisons staff who I know will be only too delighted to extend it.</P>
    <P>I might refer also to suggestions made by a number of Deputies with regard to the importance of not cutting off from the outside world persons who are committed to one or the other of these institutions.  I thoroughly agree with this.  I feel that family contacts, in particular, should be maintained to the maximum extent that is permissible in the light of security and of staff availability.  Governors have a discretion which they use wisely and generously to allow additional letters and visits, particularly from members of families, to prisoners whom they feel they would benefit.  I propose to suggest to the governors that they use that <Col N="195" /> discretion as freely as they can to allow additional letters and visits from members of a prisoner's family.  I should point out, in case Deputies feel there are restrictions of this kind in Shanganagh, that this is not so.  An unlimited number of letters can be sent and received.  They are not opened or censored in any way.  Visits by members of detainees' families are allowed very frequently and are not supervised. Visits lasting a whole afternoon are common.  Deputies will appreciate that in the obvious interests of security it is not possible to allow unsupervised visits to institutions other than Shanganagh, but supervision is kept to the minimum that is consistent with security.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies referred to the drug problem which, unfortunately, besets our country today.  I made little reference to it in my opening speech because I feel it is not really a problem for me as Minister for Justice.  I am loath to regard people who are in difficulties of this kind as persons who should be dealt with primarily by the criminal law.  They should be dealt with from a medical rather than from a legal viewpoint.  The only people who seriously come within the ambit of my Department with regard to drugs are those who would seek to push drugs. In so far as it is open to me I will make every endeavour to enforce fully the law against such people.  Deputy Dr. Browne suggested that, perhaps, special institutions other than prisons or hospitals should be made available for persons who have got themselves into difficulties with drugs.  I would find it hard to disagree with the Deputy on that.  It is a matter the Deputy should take up with my colleague, the Minister for Health.  I do not think it is in the public interest, or in the interest of what I would like to call the patients, that they should have to seek treatment in any of the institutions under my control.</P>
    <P>Deputies also inquired about the centre which is to be established at Finglas.  Unfortunately, I am not in a position to give the House any details about that.  It is a matter which comes under the Minister for Education.  I <Col N="196" /> am sure Deputies who are interested will be able to get the necessary information from him.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick in the course of his speech referred to the fact that two sections in this Bill provide for the making of regulations by me for the conduct of Shanganagh or similar places which might subsequently be established.  I agree with Deputy Fitzpatrick and other Deputies that in general it is an undesirable tendency in our modern legislation that too much has to be done by way of regulation.  In matters of this kind I am afraid one has no option.</P>
    <P>If I were to spell out in this Bill the precise regulations, or even in a general way the sort of regulations, which should govern a place such as Shanganagh I would find myself in the position of having to come back to the House in, perhaps six months, and again in, perhaps, another 12 months time, to amend the regulations in the light of experience.  Regulations of this sort should be flexible particularly with regard to Shanganagh and it should not be necessary to come back to the House to change them every time an obvious change becomes necessary and desirable.</P>
    <P>I have covered most, if not all, of the points which have been raised in this debate.  If there is any further information which any Deputies seek I would be very glad to provide it.  I should like to conclude by thanking the House once again for the welcome they have given to this Bill and for the helpful and worthwhile contributions which have been made to the debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister referred to the necessity for a punitive element in our prisons system.  Does the Minister envisage this element merely as a deterrent or is there an element of getting an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think I said there was a necessity for a punitive element.  What I intended to convey was that if there is a system of detention there is unavoidably a punitive element in it in so far as it involves deprivation of liberty.  I deprecate any <Col N="197" /> suggestion of an eye for an eye or a tooth for a tooth.  The primary principle which underlies our approach to these matters is rehabilitation.  A secondary principle, which is adverted to in some sections of the Criminal Justice Bill, is a compensatory one.  I do not think we, in this country, have ever put sufficient emphasis on that element.  It is a principle which is foremost in the criminology of some countries. As I have said, a punitive element in our system cannot be avoided because of the very nature of detention. It is a very subsidiary element and in my approach to these problems it will certainly take a back seat.</P>

Figures brought out by the social science department of UCD would indicate that approximately 50 per cent are semi-literate or mately 50 per cent are semi-literate or illiterate. Fifty per cent of the present be approximately 100 persons.  Would the Minister not agree that about four times as many as are now receiving remedial treatment in St. Patrick's are in need of it?</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill marks the implementation of the third of the three major groups of recommendations made by the survey team on the horse breeding industry. In 1968 the recommendations dealing with my Department's horse breeding scheme were implemented by the introduction of the national mare nominations scheme with its adjunct of foaling <Col N="198" /> premiums.  I am happy to say that this has proved very successful.  This year we are awarding more than 6,000 nominations&mdash;that is more than double the number awarded three years ago.</P>
    <P>Last year the capital of the National Stud Company was raised from £500,000 to £2,000,000.  As Deputies are aware this was for the purpose of ensuring that, as the survey team recommended, the National Stud should be in a position to meet all the high standards required of such an institution.</P>
    <P>In this Bill we are dealing with those recommendations of the survey team that relate to the setting up of a Horse Board; the licensing of horse riding establishments; the provision of national training centres and the miscellaneous problems associated with improving the image of the Irish horse industry both at home and abroad.</P>
    <P>The importance of our horses is something that cannot fully be expressed in economic terms.  Even in economic terms their value is probably far more than the £5 million they realise on exports since for tourists they represent part of the Irish scene.  Our thoroughbred industry is in a healthy state and the achievements of our breeders and trainers are something we can all justly be proud of.</P>
    <P>This Bill does not involve the thoroughbred industry but it is of particular concern to farmers who breed non-thoroughbred horses.  As we all know the working horse on the farm is becoming, if not a vanishing species, at least a diminishing species.  This is part of progress; one might even be tempted to say it is part of the price of progress. But one way or the other it is a fact and we must deal with things as they are and adapt our production accordingly.</P>
    <P>In present day circumstances the best market is for the pleasure horse&mdash; the hunter, the showjumper, the three-day-eventer, the riding pony.  In this country we are very favourably circumstanced to produce such horses.  My Department are encouraging farmers, through nominations and foaling premiums, to keep brood mares of the right kind and to breed from them. They are also supplementing the <Col N="199" /> efforts of stallion owners by locating Irish draught and thoroughbred stallions in areas where there is need for them.  They also subsidise the Connemara Pony Breeders' Society in their efforts to foster our native breed of ponies.  Thus we hope to expand our production of horses and from what I have said earlier about the increase in nominations we may hope that we are succeeding.</P>
    <P>Production is of course only half the story.  The other half concerns everything that needs to be done to promote the Irish horse.  This is where the Horse Board comes in.</P>
    <P>The recommendations on the Horse Board were influenced by the frequency with which the various interests, in their discussions with the survey team, laid emphasis on (1) the need for some kind of controlling body to co-ordinate the activities of the various associations dealing with equestrian matters; and (2) the need for a national training centre at which promising riders, both civilian and military, would be trained and which would provide a supply of people sufficiently highly trained to act as instructors at local training centres throughout the country.  These two ideas were to a large extent tied up with one another as most of the views expressed to the team envisaged that an important part of the functions of the controlling body would be to run, or assist in running, the national training centre.</P>
    <P>Working on these two considerations as a nucleus the survey team drew up a list of functions for the board which are reflected in section 7 of the Bill. It will be seen that they are very far ranging and amount in fact, when coupled with my Department's horse breeding schemes, to a programme of development for the non-thoroughbred horse industry of this country.  Not only will the board co-ordinate activities and run a national training centre but they will help national teams to compete at equestrian events, will see to the training of riding instructors, do publicity on horses, help the trade in non-thoroughbred horses in various ways and provide for an apprenticeship scheme in farriery.  In addition to <Col N="200" /> these executive functions the board will act as my advisers on horse breeding generally.  Moreover, provision is made for giving the board extra functions if experience shows that this is desirable.</P>
    <P>Of the board's executive functions it is fair to say that none will be more important than the establishment and running of a national training centre. It is my hope and conviction that this will become the focus for progress in horse riding.  As a sport, as a means of publicising our horses, and even as a matter of national prestige, horsemanship is something we do well to foster. We should not feel aggrieved if we do not always dominate international jumping events.  What we should aim at is to enable the talent we have in horses and riders to find full development. Many wonderful successes have been achieved in the past by both our Army and civilian riders and I am confident that the national training centre will be the means by which we can be sure of maintaining the traditions and standards that have been handed down.</P>
    <P>It will be evident that the board will have a very onerous job to do.  Only men with outstanding qualities could hope to do it.  Sections 8 and 9 of the Bill deal with the appointment of members and of the chairman.  The board is to have not more than 11 members; they will be nominated by me and where appropriate I shall be consulting the horse organisations about the selection of people to serve on it.  Some interests may not necessarily be represented by any organisation but I would propose that all interested parties should have a voice on the board.  As it is important not to make the board unwieldy I have come to the conclusion that a maximum of 11 members is a fair assessment of the size needed for the board.</P>
    <P>Much of the rest of Part II is made up of routine provisions necessary for a statutory body.  The board will be a body corporate, they will have a seal, and members must disclose any interest they have in proposed contracts. The procedure at meetings of the board is detailed at section 12; they must furnish audited accounts and an annual report and they may employ staff who <Col N="201" /> may be delegated to carry out their functions.  Other powers of the board relate to acquiring premises, buying and selling horses, borrowing, the making of grants or loans, investment of funds, acquisition and disposal of land and the acceptance of gifts.</P>
    <P>There are two provisions however that I should like to dwell on.  The first is section 13 which relates to State grants to the board.  It is in this context that I want to deal with a recommendation by the survey team that a national lottery should be run on behalf of the board.  Even if such a lottery were run it would not be by the board and so in any circumstances it is not necessary to refer to the matter in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The idea of a lottery in aid of the board gives rise to some important questions.  By and large, as the law stands, a lottery in this country must be for charity.  It does not seem fitting to depart from this position in favour of an individual body; in other words, if any change were to be made it should be on a general basis, not an <i>ad hoc</i> one.  Even if there were no other consideration involved any such lottery for the board's benefit would have to be on a large scale and it seems inevitable that it would be to the detriment of lotteries for charity.  All things considered I believe it is best to leave this question in abeyance for the present. It is not, of course, intended that the State grant shall be the sole source of income of the board.  It is expected that the existing organisations which contribute towards the horse industry generally will continue to do so and that the State grant will be related to such contributions.</P>
    <P>The other provision I would draw attention to is section 25 of the Bill. This enables the board to appoint such committees as they think fit to help them in executing their functions and these committees may include persons who are not members of the board itself.  This is in line with a recommendation by the survey team.  Allied to this is a recommendation by the team that the board should themselves have an advisory consultative council.  Since most of the value to be derived from <Col N="202" /> outside opinion could be available to the board through their committees and since the addition of a consultative council would tend towards undue complexity of structure, it has been decided not to provide for a consultative council.</P>
    <P>I come now to Part 3 of the Bill, which deals with the licensing of horse riding establishments.  Before I deal with the individual provisions there is one point I should like to make.  It has been represented to me that licensing, with its concomitant of barring any unlicensed operator from carrying on business, would be premature.  This is a matter on which I have an open mind but in deference to these views I am prepared to be guided by whatever the Horse Board has to say on the subject. The board will have the function of advising on the conditions to be attached to licences and if they consider licensing to be premature then it will be deferred.  This will be possible because Part 3 will not come into operation automatically with the passing of this Act but needs an order for the purpose under section 34.  If licensing is deferred, a system of voluntary registration might be tried in the interim.</P>
    <P>A licence will be required under section 28 for any establishment as defined at section 27.  In order to avoid disruption of operations various periods of grace are allowed under section 28 to existing operators and to those who buy establishments and to the personal representatives of deceased licensees.</P>
    <P>Section 29 outlines the objectives against which applications for licensing will be assessed.  Broadly speaking, they may be summed up as concerning the welfare of the horses and the safety of the riders.  The section also outlines the procedure to be followed when licences are refused or revoked.  Powers of inspection are provided for at section 30. Section 31 deals with miscellaneous offences which again are concerned with the welfare of horses and the safety of riders.</P>
    <P>Section 26 gives power to exempt particular classes of business from licensing.  Experience may show that it is unnecessary to control small-scale operators on the one hand or on the other operators engaged solely in hiring <Col N="203" /> out hunters.  I have no views on these subjects at present but it seems wiser to allow for the possibility of exemption.</P>
    <P>This then is the Horse Industry Bill and I recommend it to the House.  It is based on the recommendations of the survey team on the horse breeding industry, a body of men to whom all concerned with horse breeding in this country owe a deep debt of gratitude. It is also acceptable to the various organisations concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister remarked, this Bill implements some of the recommendations of the survey team that was set up five years ago and which recommended certain changes, including some of the steps that have been taken in this Bill as well as an increase in nominations and an increase in capital in respect of the National Stud.  It is generally recognised, and the figure which was quoted by the Minister confirms, that the horse-breeding industry is one of the most valuable industries we have.  So far as the value to the country is concerned it is measured not merely in terms of actual income derived from sales or exports but also in terms of the valuable employment provided in widely dispersed areas, in many cases employment of the very highest standard, giving good pay and conditions and enabling people to live in areas where life is more attractive than would be the case if they had to migrate to towns or cities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The industry, as it is described, consists, I suppose, of two parts, thoroughbred breeding and racing which is not the subject matter of this legislation but, of course, attracts probably the greatest amount of attention.  As the Minister remarked the thoroughbred industry is in a healthy state. To that extent I believe that the country and particularly those employed in it owe to the proprietors of these studs a considerable debt for the employment which is provided.  While naturally people are in it for profit, nevertheless, it is the initiative and skill of the owners or directors of these studs that enable valuable rural employment to be provided and also assist the economy <Col N="204" /> through the breeding and sale of thoroughbred horses.</P>
    <P>With the very substantial increase in the value of bloodstock in the post-war era this particular aspect of the horse industry is confined to those who have the capital and are in general in a position to engage in the industry on a relatively large scale.  There are, of course, exceptions.  Very often the small breeders achieve success which does not come to the larger ones to anything like the same extent, but that is part of the luck of the game as well as the skill involved in the individual's management and breeding of horses.</P>
    <P>This Bill is designed to deal with the hunter, the showjumper and the three-day-eventer as well as the riding pony. Because of the greatly increased mechanisation which has been described as the price of progress, the numbers of half-bred horses have declined very steeply.  According to a reply to a recent question there has been quite a remarkable drop in the numbers even in the five years since the survey team was first set up.  In 1965 the number of horses, other than bloodstock, exported was 9,767 valued at £957,330.  The following year it was slightly up, but last year the number had dropped to just over 5,000, though in actual fact because of the decrease in the value of money the value of the 5,000-odd sold was £973,742.  Therefore, in the space of five years the number of horses other than thoroughbreds sold had dropped by half.</P>
    <P>It is therefore important that the measures which were recommended, one of which has already been put into effect, should be not merely availed of but if necessary added to.  I had a look at the figures quoted in the report for the premiums and nominations that had been given.  While they have been increased somewhat the rate that was available when this team reported was far too low compared with present prices and the costs involved.</P>
    <P>It is the small breeder who needs encouragement and assistance.  Sometimes people say it is impossible precisely to define the small breeder.  Quite a few successful thoroughbred breeders have very small studs.  Is it decided <Col N="205" /> because a man has say one, two or three mares that he is a small breeder? This man could be a very successful breeder and may not necessarily need the assistance, or he may have, because of other interests, or his success at breeding, access to either stallions or nominations over and above what we normally term those of a small breeder.  I do not want to get involved in a definition problem but I would say the average small breeder is the farmer who keeps one mare or possibly two mares and who&mdash;either himself or a member of his family&mdash;hunts, show jumps or goes in for various events and breeds either a half-bred or in some cases a thoroughbred.</P>
    <P>For the purpose of this discussion the important thing is those who breed hunters or show horses.  I believe there is a complete difference between the problem experienced by small breeders and the ordinary thoroughbred breeders and this is a factor which must be taken into account.  In breeding either show horses, hunters or event horses or for that matter chasers or hurdlers the time factor is a very big element. Horses do not reach the position in which, in general, they can be produced at shows at under four years old.  There are of course exceptions but on balance it is five years from the time the mare has been got in foal before the person concerned knows whether the animal he has bred, if he has retained it, is successful.  In that time a whole lot of things may have happened.  The mare for one reason or another may have been sold or failed to produce.  Many people are unable to find out subsequently how the animal they bred progressed and by the time it is successful, for one reason or another the mare is gone.</P>
    <P>Special consideration should be given to the small breeder and also to the person who produces what is described as a store horse, whether it is a half-bred or a thoroughbred.  Store horses take three to four years to be of any value to their owners, although in some cases they are sold as unbroken two- or three-year-olds.  If they are by a successful sire and the mare has a reasonable background the prospect of sale is reasonably good.  In many cases <Col N="206" /> the beneficiary is not the breeder because for one reason or another by the time the animal shows potential, or has developed his potential, the breeder may have either disposed of the mare or sold other produce at less than what they would have made if the success which attended the earlier progeny, either a hunter, show jumper or eventer had been discovered.</P>
    <P>The time factor is important here and special consideration should be given to encouraging the small breeders.  Horse breeding, no matter how it is looked at, is an expensive business.  It is naturally more expensive if it is unsuccessful than if it is successful. Nowadays a whole lot of expenses are incurred by breeders and a special case can be made for encouragement both in respect of the premiums and also in respect of grants or incentives to the breeders concerned.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the point, but he has not given direct indication of what is involved, that the survey team recommended the idea of a lottery.  I agree that is a bad idea.  It might be all right but it would be impossible in our circumstances with the provisions which apply to lotteries, confining them to charities to operate a lottery in respect of this.  In any event, it is possible that there is a limit beyond which we can expect to get revenue from lotteries and the number of sources in that regard have already been tapped.  I would be interested to hear from the Minister if any estimate has been made of the sum of money it is proposed to provide under section 13 or is it proposed to leave that to the board when it is set up?  It may be that at this stage it is difficult to put a figure on it.  At the same time it is obvious from the figures which were given in appendix D that the amount allocated for nominations&mdash;although I was glad to note from what the Minister said in the opening sentences of his speech that the number of nominations at 6,000 is more than double what was awarded three years ago&mdash;was less than £12,000 in 1965.  Approximately half the number of mares presented for nominations were approved and subsequently a number of them were actually sent for nomination.</P>
    <P>It is an extraordinary commentary <Col N="207" /> that the fees charged for some of the stallions are hardly more than you would pay in an AI centre at the moment in respect of a cow.  Some of them were as low as £3 so that the change in the amount of the fee is obviously warranted if we want to encourage the small breeders in this regard.  On this matter, it is to some extent impossible to divorce the consideration of thoroughbred breeding in respect of 'chasers and hurdlers from that of show horses, jumpers and others.  They are not entirely unrelated. Although nowadays a great many of the successful 'chasers and hurdlers have blood lines which, compared with formerly, are far more distinguished in respect of ancestry and performance, nevertheless, a number of smaller breeders breed both thoroughbreds and three-quarter breds which, if not successful as either 'chasers or hurdlers, may be successful as show jumpers and eventers.</P>
    <P>In that respect, gratitude is due to the farmers for their willing co-operation in permitting and assisting hunting.  The vast majority of farmers in the hunting areas of this country welcome hunting and this should be appreciated, particularly nowadays when a great many of the people who ride or hunt have urban backgrounds.  Of course, this is a welcome development.</P>
    <P>With the decline in hunting among farmers, their sons and daughters, because of mechanisation, there has been an increase in the number of people with urban backgrounds who hunt and ride.  This has been encouraged by things like the pony club, riding schools, gymkhanas and so forth.  At the same time, a number of the people who engage in such events and who also hunt, because of their urban backgrounds may not appreciate adequately the co-operation which is so willingly given by farmers and which is so vital to the success of hunting.</P>
    <P>This industry is all of a piece and in order to promote the development and success of the jumper and the eventer, facilities for hunting and free and generous assistance to it are most <Col N="208" /> important.  The farmer is to be thanked for this.  We must consider the cost of maintaining fences and the problems involved in regard to TB tested cattle and so on and the anxiety of all farmers to ensure that disease is not carried from one farm to another.  Those who hunt, therefore, must appreciate the generous co-operation of farmers, without which hunting could not be carried on.  This is a two-way traffic and those who hunt should bear in mind the responsibilities and the risks involved for farmers in regard to their stock and the expense that could be involved for any damage done.  Members of hunts generally ensure as far as possible that adequate steps are taken to repair any damage.</P>
    <P>Again referring to mechanisation, there is a great deal to be said for training schools or a training scheme for farriers.  This is a highly skilled craft but because of increased mechanisation it is a dying one.  Farriers are difficult to get.  Those engaged in the craft have to travel considerable distances and those who avail of their services are very glad to get them.  It is, therefore, essential that those engaged in this skilled craft should be properly trained.  One of the recommendations by the survey team is that an apprenticeship scheme be provided and I understand that some of the vocational schools are doing something about it.  It is a craft which can be learned from a person already trained or from an existing farrier.  It involves the entire horse industry and all engaged in it.  The presence of suitably qualified and trained farriers is a <i>sine qua non</i> as far as the industry is concerned.</P>
    <P>The survey team made certain other recommendations which are not directly dealt with but which were referred to by the Minister.  One is in respect of the National Stud.  When the National Stud was originally taken over just after the war it achieved considerable success with the first stallions purchased. The people there at the time set out on a certain line of policy and the initial purchases were by far the most successful.  The stallions purchased since never achieved the success <Col N="209" /> of the original three, Royal Charger, Preciptic and Black Rock.</P>
    <P>Those three horses were purchased on the basis of providing for the breeder in this country sires that would cater for different strata of breeders. Royal Charger was a classic or semi-classic horse and proved most outstanding. Preciptic was a tough and consistent racehorse with a consistent pedigree and he achieved great success, being made available at a lower fee than Royal Charger.  Then, there was Black Rock, a French bred, successful mainly in breeding chasers and hunters. Subsequently, the National Stud purchased such sires as Tulyar and probably the best thing they did in respect of Tulyar was to avail of the opportunity to sell him.</P>
    <P>It is important that the stud should decide on the policy to be adopted in the future to cater for different strata of breeders.  As the Minister mentioned in the course of his speech, the breeder of thoroughbreds, particularly the larger breeder, is in a position to avail of the more expensive sires because of his financial resources.  The smaller breeder, because of lack of capital, should be entitled to have from the National Stud stallions available at reasonable fees.  In this context the question of PLV or some other criterion should be brought to bear.  Here again, however, it is difficult to decide what is a small breeder.  Valuations differ from county to county and the size of a farm may not bear any relation to the size of the breeder.  He may be a man dealing mainly in cattle, or even in tillage, who keeps a mare. In the context of horse breeding he would be regarded as a small breeder.</P>
    <P>The survey team recommended that the National Stud should always have available a prestige stallion.  A prestige stallion can be defined as a classic horse.  The cost of a successful classic horse is quite considerable and it is never certain that such a horse, no matter what his background, will be a success.  It is argued that if the fee for such a horse is sufficiently high he will have paid for himself in three or four years at stud and this is partially true.  However, excluding the sale of <Col N="210" /> Tulyar and possibly Panaslipper, they have failed to achieve the objective which was mentioned in the idea of a prestige stallion.</P>
    <P>The tendency nowadays for most of the large studs is to avail either of the syndication of nominations or a number of studs interchange, through syndication, nominations to different stallions which course is possibly the most successful way of dealing with the matter.  In that connection the change that was made by agreement here last year in the Finance Act should enable those who own stallions, irrespective of whether they have stud farms in this country, to locate at satisfactory terms stallions in Irish studs and to avail of the tax concessions. From discussions I have had with breeders I am aware that the change we made in the Finance Act has enabled a number of successful racehorses who would ordinarily have been sold and sent abroad to be located at studs other than those owned by the actual owner of the stallion.</P>
    <P>Regarding the question of riding establishments, there is a good deal to be said for laying down minimum requirements.  At the same time, I agree it would be undesirable, without advance notice, to impose unduly onerous restrictions on riding schools or establishments that hire out horses. There is a case for providing a number of indoor riding establishments and this might be considered in conjunction with Bord Fáilte.  There is no doubt that due to weather and other factors, the advantages of indoor riding establishments are considerable.  They save the riders in inclement weather and are also useful when the ground is so hard to ride outdoors.  A number of the larger racing establishments have indoor schools for exercising and there are certain other indoor establishments provided in Dublin and in some other centres.</P>
    <P>This practice should be encouraged. I hold the view that we could extend considerably the attractions of riding and trekking, particularly for tourists. However, it is important that minimum safety and other requirements should be laid down.  Most prudent owners of That is a very important consideration <Col N="211" /> such schools will make certain that they have adequate insurance but certain minimum precautions require to be taken.  I agree with the Minister that it is important at this stage that an open mind be kept in regard to the question of licences and I presume this is one of the matters the new board will consider.</P>
    <P>The idea of establishing a single training centre was also mentioned.  I am not certain that this is a practical proposition or, if it is, it would be confined entirely to those whom one might perhaps incorrectly describe as &ldquo;professionals&rdquo;.  For those people who engage in show jumping it is essential that they retain their amateur status in order to comply with the requirements of the International Equestrian Federation. At the same time, in the ordinary accepted sense of the word &ldquo;professional&rdquo; the standard of skill nowadays required for jumping is much greater than it was before the war and that is one of the factors that has had an influence on the change in international events.</P>
    <P>In pre-war times most international teams were army teams because most European countries, and even nations outside Europe, had equitation schools.  However, the mechanisation of armies and the transition from pre-war to post-war conditions has meant that, with few exceptions, the numbers involved in equitation in any army is much less than previously.  There was genuine agreement here that it was a wise decision to allow mixed teams to compete in equestrian events.  Considering our resources, both financially and in regard to personnel, the standard achieved by our Army and civilian riders abroad bears comparison with the best.  We have sent abroad riders, both Army and civilian, who not only have brought the highest distinction on themselves but have reflected great credit on the country.</P>
    <P>The survey team recommended that qualified trainers be engaged from abroad but here again the luck or chance element enters into it.  Some of the most highly successful riders and performers are not the best instructors; <Col N="212" /> likewise, some riders who never attain the same skill in the saddle can be excellent instructors.  There is no royal road to success here.  In many ways a horseman is born and not made, although he can of course improve himself.  I think it is a great tribute to our horsemen and women that they achieved such success compared with the opportunities and facilities, financial and otherwise, which exist in many other countries.  International show jumping has changed a good deal, the military element is much less prominent and the civilian competitors are, in the main, engaged in it for a living, which, in one sense, makes them professional but at the same time involves them in the nominal retention of amateur status.</P>
    <P>The provision of either a single training centre or a number of riding schools in various parts of the country would be expensive and very few of the people involved would have the necessary capital.  To that extent this board, possibly in consultation with Bord Fáilte, should consider setting up, not merely in the big cities but in other centres to which tourists go, centres where horses can be bred.  While horsebreeding is not restricted in any sense of the word certain areas are more successful than others.  One of the interesting things about the statistics published in respect of premiums was that Kildare, which is a notable county because of the great number of horses trained there, had no nomination.  The only other county which I saw missing there was Offaly.  The idea of encouraging small breeders is that with very few exceptions horses can be bred anywhere.  In fact, some successful horses have been bred on very bad land.  The advantage of assisting people to breed horses is that they can carry this scheme out in almost every part of the country.  Horse-breeding in Connemara has provided an income for people who have much less chance of getting a living off the land.  In many cases the quality of the ponies bred in Connemara has been exceptional.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that the survey team recommended that particular bodies should be represented on the new Horse Board.  According to the way the Bill has been drawn up this is <Col N="213" /> not proposed, although the Minister has said he would consult with them. I think it is important to get the co-operation and goodwill of the various bodies, especially the long-established ones, involved in the business.  I am thinking of such bodies as the Horse Riding and Jumping Association, the Olympic Horse Society, the Thoroughbred Breeders and the Connemara Pony Society.  The RDS has also done good work.  The report commented on the fact that the RDS was in the anomalous position of promoting shows but having to rely on voluntary efforts.  With the changing pattern of life it is impossible for people to be engaged in such voluntary activities.  I think their contribution should be recognised and they should be consulted and represented as far as possible on this.  I believe all these bodies should be consulted and a representative board built up.  I notice there is no similar requirement in the National Stud Act but this may be included in the articles of association.</P>
    <P>Section 11 of the Bill provides that:</P>
    <P>A member of the Board who has&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) any interest in any company with which the Board proposes to make any contract, or</P>
    <P>(b) any interest in any contract which the Board proposes to make,</P>
    <P>shall disclose to the Board the fact of the interest and the nature thereof, and shall take no part in any deliberation or decision of the Board relating to the contract, and the disclosure shall be recorded in the minutes of the Board.</P>
    <P>I think this is an important requirement because I believe it is absolutely essential in matters of this kind that there be a full disclosure of the interest of anyone whose concern might conflict with the discharging of his duty as a member of a board.</P>
    <P>I do not know how the size of the board was arrived at.  I understand there are 11 members on the Racing Board.  I suppose the same number was hit on here.  If the board is to provide regional representation a reasonably <Col N="214" /> large board is necessary.  On the other hand, 11 may be a bit large from the point of view of effective working.  The Racing Board consists of 11 members but it was specifically designed to take a certain number from the Turf Club and the Irish National Hunt steeplechase committee&mdash;three from each&mdash;and five others.  In this particular instance no specific number is to be drawn from any source.  The discretion is left entirely to the Minister.  It is, of course, difficult to cover every eventuality, but there is something to be said for specifically naming some of the bodies that were consulted and which have been in existence for a number of years.</P>
    <P>I remember when a number of people came together to found the Jumping Association after the war.  It developed to such an extent that a number of regions had to be created. There is now what is generally known as the southern region, which in the main, I think, covers the State, though actually it has been subdivided, and then there is the northern region.  The Jumping Association have undoubtedly done a great deal of good work and a great number of those who have contributed to its success have themselves no direct interest or, if they have an interest, it is somewhat remote.  Many of them have given very valuable service and they deserve the best thanks of all those involved.</P>
    <P>The Connemara Breeders Society is of much older vintage.  It goes back to the first World War or to the years immediately after that.  This society has done very valuable work.  Some form of recognition might be included for some of these bodies.  Because of the number of bodies, it is not, of course, very easy to make a selection.  It is a matter that could be considered further with advantage on the Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>This is a very important industry and every possible encouragement should be given to it.  It provides in the main, although nowadays a number of females are employed, good male employment in the rural areas. The employment is dispersed widely over virtually the whole country, certainly over the majority of the counties. <Col N="215" /> remembering the advocacy on the provision of employment in these areas. This is an industry in which there is an immense amount of native skill and ability.  There are many natural advantages from the point of view of soil and climate.  As the Minister pointed out, people who are not themselves involved in either horse breeding or riding are interested in the industry. One of the advantages of television is that, in the case of both racing and show jumping, this is as good a way as any to watch events, though I would myself always prefer to be on the spot. But television has encouraged people who never had an interest previously to take an interest.</P>
    <P>This is an industry of which a country can be proud.  We can be proud of our riders, both Army and civilian. All cannot win.  All cannot attain the same standards but, allowing for our resources and the resources of the individuals themselves, the success that has been achieved reflects great credit not only on them but on the country. They have proved themselves to be ambassadors of the very highest calibre when they go abroad.  They have attracted the most favourable attention for the country.  Anything we can do from the point of view of promotion by way of legislation or financial assistance should be done.  The steps taken in this particular measure and in some of the others mentioned are a move in the right direction.  At the same time, we should not be complacent.  There has been a decline in the short space of five years in the number of horses, other than bloodstock, exported.  There has been undoubtedly some increase in the number of racehorses in training. That is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>The idea of a levy, such as was initially introduced in respect of the Tote and subsequently extended by the Racing Board on its establishment, has saved racing so far as this country is concerned.  Some years after the introduction of that levy here the late Aga Khan, the father of the present Aga Khan, advocated in a series of articles in <i>The Times</i> that the same thing should be done in Britain and Britain did subsequently, many years afterwards, <Col N="216" /> adopt the same policy.  The Aga Khan, was, of course, a very successful breeder, and so is his son.  The steps taken here at that time have acted as a headline elsewhere.  The French have a similar arrangement.  Without the financial assistance and without the increase in stakes it would have been impossible to bring racing to the pitch it has reached.  Both the trainers and the jockeys deserve credit.  We have produced trainers who are second to none.  Most of them started from relatively small beginnings.  They have achieved international success and, in many of the big races now, the question is what Irish runners are involved because they are the ones that will have to be beaten.</P>
    <P>We are to a great extent dependent on the horse breeding industry.  It provides valuable employment in a great many areas.  From that point of view it is essential that it should be encouraged in every way.  Changes suggested here will contribute to its further development. There may be certain details which can be discussed at greater length on the Committee Stage.  The changes are not merely desirable but essential to maintain the industry at its present level and to expand it in the future. These proposals will, I believe, contribute to that.  It is important, however, to keep an open mind in regard to certain aspects.  It is important to get from those involved their views and suggestions on how to operate the industry.  The recommendations made here contain a number of valuable suggestions. Some are not, perhaps, of any great significance but those that are valuable should be implemented as quickly as possible.</P>

      <P>I also welcome this Bill, which is long overdue, because this section of our agricultural industry received little or no subsidy or financial aid in the past.  The only aid it received for years was the value of the nomination ticket which was not very much.  It was only £12,000 five years ago and it is hardly more than £50,000 today.  This is very little in comparison with the vast sums in agricultural subsidy put into the remaining sections of agriculture.  Despite the lack of financial aid the breeding of <Col N="217" /> non-thoroughbred horses has progressed remarkably in the past 15 to 20 years.  The people involved used their skills and initiative very effectively not only to breed good horses and turn them out properly but also to succeed in exporting them to many countries.</P>
      <P>I was rather surprised to hear Deputy Cosgrave say that our exports in this field had fallen from 9,000 in 1965 to 5,000 in 1969.  Perhaps the Minister would say if the reason for this big drop was the fact that the export of live horses disappeared practically entirely and that the number of live fat horses exported was included in the 9,000.  I wonder if this is so because, speaking from my knowledge of my own constituency, the export trade in hunters and show jumpers increased in that period. Those involved have succeeded in establishing a very good name for our hunters and show jumpers in regard to their quality and in the way they have been turned out and handled and schooled before leaving our shores. They have developed exports to many countries, particularly England, to which we export a substantial number of those horses.  We have also succeeded in broadening our market and have even exported horses to the USA, Canada, Italy, Germany and many other Continental countries.  We have sent some of these horses to Egypt and places like Japan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We may thank those who have sought out these markets and made various contacts at the Ballsbridge Show with visiting foreigners.  They have spoken to them and encouraged them to come and see horses down the country.  They have succeeded in establishing a very lucrative market but it is one about which we should not be complacent. It is a market which I believe can be expanded substantially and rapidly given proper encouragement by this new board which the Minister proposes to establish.  It should also be remembered that any money now made available to this section of agriculture will not add to the Exchequer burden because I maintain that any breeder, and particularly the small breeder, who now decides to keep a mare and foal is surely keeping two or three cows fewer <Col N="218" /> in the parts of Ireland where this type of industry predominates.  When we realise the very heavy subsidy going to the dairying industry and the amount of subsidy involved for two or three cows we can see that we can afford to pour much more money into this horse breeding scheme.  The board should be mindful of this when disbursing the funds available to them.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt the people involved in this industry will welcome every provision in the Bill which covers practically all aspects of the industry in the broader sense from the time the animal is foaled until it becomes a famous show-jumper internationally or until it is exported.  There are, however, a few points to which I want to draw the Minister's attention so that he may lay particular emphasis on them when the board is formed.  The first is something I did not realise until recently: there is a very low fertility rate in this industry, not even two-thirds, I am told.  I suggest the Minister might take steps to set up some form of mobile clinic to cover one or two counties at a time. There are not many counties involved, only four or five, as far as I know, Clare, Cork, South Tipperary, Kilkenny, part of Wexford and, perhaps, Waterford.  These are the principle centres of this industry.  It should not be too expensive to establish a mobile clinic which would test a cross-section of the breeding mares.  The main reason for the low fertility rate is lack of knowledge among some breeders in regard to observing these animals.</P>
    <P>The Minister might also suggest that the board should seriously consider marking breeding mares and foals. What I have in mind is that there should be some form of tattoo on the inside of the upper or lower lip in the case of both mare and foal.  This may not seem very important but it is very important to the small breeder because in many instances horses have suddenly become famous.  This has happened with many of our horses.  I could mention particularly Stroller, a very famous show jumper for England, and Mr. Softee who has been European champion on a few occasions.  There are many others.  These are horses that were actually bred in Clare and <Col N="219" /> I know more about that county than others.</P>
    <P>When Mr. Softee became famous he was described as an English-bred horse for many years until investigations were made and some people were able to prove that he was bred in County Clare.  By the time that was done the dam and that particular strain had left the ownership of the breeder who lost any other benefits that might accrue from owning such a famous breed.  If the facts had been established in time I have no doubt many buyers would have found their way to this area in search of further horses of this breed and the owners and those concerned in the area would have got particularly high prices.</P>
    <P>Stroller, it is well known, was bred somewhere in west Clare but nobody can establish where.  Tattooing of mares and foals would eliminate this situation completely.  There would be no difficulty in tracing the origin of a famous horse and other members of its family.  This trade lends itself to the obscuring of these facts because a foal is often sold as a foal and then passes on to another man by whom he is broken and then passes through two or three other people's hands before being eventually recognised internationally. Perhaps the Minister would keep this in mind when making recommendations to the board.</P>
    <P>As regards membership of the board of 11, the Minister should consider representation for the breeding interests. It should include a person or persons who would capably represent the small breeders and also those who have been involved for a long time in the breaking and schooling of these horses and in the exporting of them and in the establishment of markets abroad. These people should be the first to get recognition on this board and should have a very strong voice in matters with which the board will deal.  I agree that the Army, the Show Jumping Society and the RDS should be represented but I should like the grass-roots people to be very well represented.</P>
    <P>The clause which covers the farriers is most welcome.  People have to travel <Col N="220" /> 20 or 25 miles to get horses shod even in my own county which is widely involved in horse breeding.  There are payments for live foals.  Believe it or not this is not widely known.  It has been very badly publicised.  It should be more publicised because many people do not realise that these payments are forthcoming.  They are very welcome payments of £25 and £15 for foals by thoroughbred and non-thoroughbred stallions.  These payments will add greatly to the remuneration accruing from horse breeding.  If you add one of them on to the price which the hunter type foal was fetching last year, anything up to £150, it makes it really attractive to change over to horse breeding from dairying.  This leads to a further relief in farm subsidy.  It is a market that can be expanded by a proper drive by this board.  We can expect a big improvement.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave mentioned equestrian centres and the running of indoor equestrian centres.  Some provision should be made towards their cost. They are very expensive to fit out and to run.  There are two in my own county and there is one I know of in Malahide.  The people running them are anxious to give tuition to young people.  This involves paying a full time instructor.  Perhaps the Minister would consider giving some relief to these centres.  They are well worthwhile and I have no doubt that young people will learn the business of horse riding, starting with ponies.  Young urban people are keenly interested in ponies and hunting of all kinds and they will benefit greatly from these centres.  In due course our whole horse industry will benefit because of the standard of the riders we will be able to put into the international field.  When all is said and done, our international team is the shop window of the whole trade.  This fact should be considered.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill as all people concerned with the industry will welcome it.  This is a section of the agricultural industry which has always had to stand on its own legs and has done remarkably well under many handicaps. It has built itself up and I hope it will now develop much more successfully. I hope the people who have <Col N="221" /> worked hard and with great dedication will be in a position to reap far greater rewards.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FintanCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I consider this Bill to be a belated effort.  It reminds me of closing the stable door when the horse has gone.  Possibly the horse is out in a field and we may be able to get him in again.</P>
      <P>The Connemara Pony Breeders' Society is mentioned here.  I should like to see them getting a greater subsidy than they are getting at present.  They can look back with pride to the day when the late Deputy Joseph Mongan saved this breed.  I remember the great Cannonball.  This was a great sire.  They even had a wake for him.  He was one of the last of a great line of Connemara ponies.</P>
      <P>Much more should be done for pony trekking throughout the country.  More should be done to help the American tourist effort in the off-season.  The Galway Blazers have a fine hunt.  The Americans think nothing of hopping over with their families and staying a week or two.  They spend big money. Something should be done to build up this effort during the off-season.</P>
      <P>I also see that the training of young men in farriery is mentioned.  I do not think you can get instant farriers by lectures as suggested here.  Vocational education committees can go a long way to help.  I can speak with a certain amount of authority on this.  I hold the certificate of master farrier.  I had the privilege of being the youngest floorsman in farriery in Ireland in my time.  I can look forward to a future for these young men but this is a tough trade.  It is all right to offer a young man an incentive to train but there should also be an incentive for him to remain in the trade.  Why have men left this business? That aspect should be examined.  There were greater incentives outside the trade.  There were easier trades for young men.  It goes back to what we learned in school: &ldquo;For the sake of a nail the battle was lost&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>You cannot build up this trade unless you have men who are interested in remaining in it.  It is all right to train a young man to fit shoes and nail them on.  He is a floorsman.  Unless <Col N="222" /> a man is able to make a shoe from the raw material he has no business in that line.  He is not a qualified farrier. There is also a shortage of the type of iron needed in the country areas. Fullered iron and concaved iron are required.  The concaved iron is required for the highly bred animal and it is not easy to obtain it in the country.  There is also a problem in relation to nails.  The local shopkeeper keeps the type of nails he thinks he requires and it is very hard for farriers to get these materials.  Those are the things that will help to kill the trade unless some central authority such as this board sees to it that supplies of materials are available for the man in the business.</P>
    <P>I wonder too who is left to train these young men.  Farriers are very few and far between.  In the Curragh there are master farriers who can train men but there are others who just go around tacking on, as we say, at race meetings.  You must have a man who knows the business from the ground up and is able to fit, make, shoe and finish off.  Otherwise he has just half learned the trade and he will not have an interest in it.</P>
    <P>This board should see to it that the materials I mentioned are supplied to the craftsmen because this is a trade which calls for a high degree of craftsmanship and a certain amount of temperament. When dealing with horses, one should be able to handle them properly.  The maxim &ldquo;all for the want of a nail the horse was lost&rdquo; applies to this industry to a great degree.  Is the expertise available to pass on the craft?  Have the old men with the skill the way of passing on the craft to young men?  The craft is disappearing very fast.</P>
    <P>Mention was made of mobile forges. That is not so easy.  I cannot see a mobile forge working satisfactorily in wet and stormy weather.  There must be centres.  If the job is not made attractive for young men to remain in it then we might as well throw our hat at it.  I have employed men.  Even after getting young men and training them at it, I have seen how some of them will not remain in this business.  With my background of many generations <Col N="223" /> in this business, naturally I would be prepared to help in every possible way with this board.</P>
    <P>The handling and training of horses are two very important matters.  We have seen horses ruined as a result of the temperament of the man training them.  Such a man would need to be trained first before undertaking the training of horses.  Who is to train the man?  That goes back to square one. It can take years to eradicate bad habits developed by horses through bad training and bad handling.  A man who dresses himself up in a riding outfit and who carries a riding crop does not become a trainer overnight. He must come up the hard way and prove himself.  The status symbol of riding outfits, and so on, are not the be-all and the end-all as far as the handling and training of horses are concerned.</P>
    <P>On the subject of the breeding of horses, I would say that a lot more could be done to publicise horses born in this country: that is especially so in the case of important races.  A horse could have been bred, born and reared in this country and then trained in, say, Britain.  Frequently when such a horse wins a race it is claimed that it is a British horse or an English horse. That claim is made just because the horse is bought by, say, an Englishman and trained in England.  The same could be said of a show-jumper.  It is very galling to see a show-jumper, which was bred, born and reared in Ireland and then bought by some foreign country and trained abroad, competing at international shows with other Irish horses and beating them just because it has been properly trained by some foreign team.  We should emphasise that that horse is beating other Irish horses and that it is not a foreign-bred animal.</P>
    <P>I wish this Bill every success.  There are no overnight farriers.  The technical school may do a lot but it will not do everything.  They have to come up the hard way.  When a craft is disappearing, I do not know where people can be found to carry it on.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is with considerable <Col N="224" /> diffidence that I take part in the discussion on this Bill.  Strangely enough&mdash;again, by chance&mdash;I was, in the words of a civil servant giving evidence at a public tribunal, the hod man on two of the Acts mentioned here &mdash;the National Stud Act and the Racing Board and Racecourses Act, 1945.  Strangely enough, both of these Acts were handled by the Department of Finance.  I did a lot of work on the Racing Board and Racecourses Act. The late revered Mr. Seán T. Ó Ceallaigh, who was such a pleasant gentleman, used to talk in this House about what his &ldquo;experts&rdquo; told him.  I shall not say who the other expert was but neither he nor I were racegoers.  I suppose that, through dint of hard work, one gets a certain amount of knowledge of things.  When we got to the other House, a representative of the Labour Party there asked, in effect: &ldquo;Is this the best piece of post-war planning that the Department of Finance can do?&rdquo; That was in 1945. We have no reason to apologise for the Racing Board and Racecourses Act.  If every measure that went through the Oireachtas were as successful as that Act has been, this country would be a better place than it is.</P>
      <P>Horse-breeding is of great importance in this country though the number of horses here has declined enormously since they ceased to be used for agricultural work.  About the only point not mentioned so far is that the natural limestone plain which covers most of this country is a wonderful breeding-ground for horses.  In addition, there were the Connemara ponies in the west: they are really spread over more than Connemara.  Despite the ill-conceived efforts of the Congested Districts Board to bring in hacks, which rather upset the breed for a while, they are back to where they were, say, in the third quarter of the last century.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This country is also extremely suitable for the breeding of hunters.  The Irish draught mare and the thoroughbred sire make almost the ideal hunting horse.  I am afraid hunting is on its way out.  It is less and less popular with farmers as they concentrate more and more on their agriculture.  Damage is done to fresh grass if hunters are not <Col N="225" /> careful although I think that usually they are extremely careful.  One farmer in an area can upset the way in which the pack of hounds works.  I am not sure that the end of the century will not see a change in the attitude towards hunting.  Luckily, the bulk of our farmers in the west and south-west are generous-minded and do not interfere with people who just go across their land.</P>
    <P>We have been lucky.  Were it not for the passing of the Racing Board and Racecourses Act which developed the Totalisator Board into the present terrific source of moneys for prize money in races, conveying horses to racecourses and so on, there is no doubt that this country would not be in the position in which it is because a horse that wins a race worth £100 is worth a certain figure on the market and a horse that wins a race worth £1,000 is worth a completely different figure on the market.  The market is, in fact, a kind of world market and a horse may be sent, say, to South Africa.</P>
    <P>I had some sympathy with the remark made here earlier today that for a long time&mdash;though the annual publication <i>The Irish Horse</i> has made a difference&mdash;if an Irish horse was successful he was British bred. Many an excellent Irish horse went to India and other parts of the world with the label: &ldquo;British bred&rdquo;.  Gradually various parts of the establishment in relation to horse breeding have been built up and this is a further brick in the edifice.  The Department of Agriculture are to be congratulated on bringing in this Bill.</P>
    <P>We have had some remarkable horses in this country.  I cast my mind back to the great stallion Blandford. No other stallion sired as many Derby winners as Blandford did.  He was removed from this country late on in his life&mdash;he did not settle down very happily where he was taken&mdash;because of an alteration in the tax law.  I am glad to say the former Minister for Finance, Deputy Haughey, changed that so it is very unlikely that stallions will again be taken out of this country.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave referred to Tulyar <Col N="226" /> and indeed to Royal Charger which was bought by the National Stud. Royal Charger was one of those horses which had not got an extraordinarily good racing record.  Indeed, Blandford had a very poor racing record, breaking down when he was a two-year-old. Royal Charger proved a remarkable investment because he bred horses which proved to be very fast at an early age.  The climate has changed in recent years but after the war it was noted that most owners wanted quick returns and the horse that would race well as a two-year-old was a far more desirable animal than the horse that would race well as a five-year-old.  This was one reason for the success of Royal Charger.  I suppose the best thing that happened to the National Stud in relation to Tulyar was the fact that a gentleman came along looking for a commission and Tulyar was sold for the the same price as was paid for him because, of course, Tulyar was a complete failure as a stallion and, in fact, I understand became quite bald when he was transferred to the United States. Perhaps he did not like the change in climate either.</P>
    <P>There are so many aspects of this matter that I am quite incompetent to deal with it in comparison with Deputy Cosgrave or Deputy Barrett.  I do not mean any reflection on them but I noticed that whereas normally they speak slowly and easily today words just poured out of them about horses. This occurs, of course, when men who love horses speak about them.  My contribution, I am afraid, will compare very badly with theirs.</P>
    <P>It certainly has been the purpose of the National Stud to make relatively expensive stallions available to smaller breeders and this is really essential if the breeding of throughbreds is to be spread throughout the country.  Deputy Barrett gave us a reason why it should be spread throughout the country and that was that part of that £35 million which is being spent on the Golden Vale might be saved.  I know my colleague Deputy Tom O'Donnell does not agree with me on this matter but there are limits to the amount of money we can pour into the Golden Vale, of all parts of Ireland.</P>

Deputy Cosgrave referred to the fact that we have produced since World War II, some wonderful trainers of horses for racing in this country.  There is no question but that two or three of the leading trainers in the world are in this country today.</P>
      <P>Part of this Bill deals with riding schools.  This is a difficult problem because it is suggested sometimes in England that horses in riding schools are kept somewhat underfed deliberately because this keeps them relatively quiet and complete newcomers to riding are not likely to be thrown to the ground or injured.  It is an awkward problem.  The late Commander Finlay ran a very fine establishment next door to the Phoenix Park racecourse.</P>

      <P>He also had the record of buying Limerick Lace.  He was a member of the Army jumping team, one of the really successful jumping teams, and he was responsible for buying Limerick Lace for the team. There is the question of State interference involved.  There is considerable comment in England, where these pony establishments are more numerous than they are here on account of the vast population there.  There is the problem of trying not to interfere too much and at the same time of trying to improve standards.</P>
      <P>The Minister's brief dealt with the question of a lottery.  It might not be a bad method of raising some money.  I am not necessarily disagreeing with the conclusion that was reached.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It occurred to me reading through the Bill&mdash;I hope I read it correctly&mdash; that there is no provision to remunerate the members of the board.  We live in an age when the number of people who can afford to serve on boards of this sort without remuneration is far fewer than it used to be.  I am afraid one could easily restrict one's selection in a way that would be undesirable.  I certainly <Col N="228" /> would consider putting down an amendment to provide, if the Minister saw fit, that members of the board might be remunerated.  I know, of course, that since the farming community pay no income tax they are better able to do this kind of thing than other people but I can think of actual persons who might prove very successful members of this board whom it would be unfair to ask to serve on it without allowing them remuneration.</P>
    <P>The Army jumping team was remarkably successful in the late twenties and in the thirties and then a wrong policy was adopted as regards the buying of horses, a parsimonious approach. I remember one famous show jumper, Tubbernagealt, that could have been bought on the market here for the Army jumping team.  That horse would have made a very big difference to the team provided £2,000 was prepared to be paid for it.  At that time the purchasers of the horses believed in buying young horses for about £300 each on appearance and attempting to build them up.  That policy has changed all right.  More expensive horses are now being bought for the Army jumping team and this is likely to lead to an improvement in performances.  However, it was rather unfortunate that for a longish period this very fine team should have fallen on relatively unsuccessful days.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill and hope the Department will be able to implement its provisions satisfactorily.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasGODonnell" hpid="Mr. T. O'Donnell Mr. T. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Coming from a constituency which I think can rightly be regarded as being in the forefront of the hunting and horse breeding industry down the years, I welcome this Bill.  It is long overdue.  The survey team was set up in 1965 by the then Minister for Agriculture and it reported in June, 1966, so it is four years later that we are presented with this Bill to implement the main recommendations of the survey team which examined the whole question of the horse breeding industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is an important development and provided the Bill is amended to cover certain observations that have already been made by some of the <Col N="229" /> speakers, this Bill can go a long way towards reorganising and modernising the whole approach to the breeding of non-thoroughbred horses.  The Bill, as I understand it, has three main objectives: first, the establishment of a Horse Board, to be called, I suppose, Bord na gCapall; secondly, the licensing of riding establishments; and, thirdly, the establishment of a national training centre.</P>
    <P>According to the Minister's speech it is proposed to establish a board consisting of 11 members.  The Minister has made a valid point in saying that a large board would be unwieldy and might not be workable at all.  The Minister also says that before appointing the members to this board he would consult with interested organisations and parties.  He will have a lot of consulting to do because in appendix B on page 43 of the survey report there is a list of bodies and persons who submitted their views to the survey team, and we find there were 17 different organisations who submitted their views, and in addition there were representatives from 18 different county committees of agriculture.  This makes a total of 35, and there is a long list of 40 or 50 other persons who made submissions to the survey team.</P>
    <P>I want to be quite blunt about this and to warn the Minister that his nominations to this board will be watched very carefully.  We have had examples of boards set up by various Departments and by various Ministers for Agriculture in which it would appear that the main qualification for nomination was membership of the Government Party.  I particularly want to warn the Minister against following the example of one of his predecessors in relation to nominating members to the Board of the National Stud.  Reference has been made in the Minister's speech to the National Stud.  An absolutely ridiculous situation obtains in relation to this board.  The National Stud is a State-sponsored organisation which should have and is supposed to have as one of its main objectives the assistance and encouragement of the smaller bloodstock breeder.</P>
    <P>Under one of the Minister's predecessors people have been nominated to <Col N="230" /> this board who themselves are owners and directors of private studs and who are in competition with the National Stud itself for sires.  It is a well-known fact that this has happened on a number of occasions.  If this Bill is to work out properly in the interest of the small breeders and in the interest of the farmers, who have been specifically mentioned in the survey report and in the Minister's speech, then the board should be comprised of people representative of those whom the Bill is setting out to help.</P>
    <P>I have certain reservations about this report.  While acknowledging the fact that the people who comprised the survey team are busy men and men who have considerable experience of the bloodstock industry, I think it is not without significance that two members of the team are non-nationals and are engaged in the bloodstock industry in a very large way.  As I said, the success or failure of this Bill will be largely dependent on the people who will be nominated by the Minister to serve on the board.</P>
    <P>In view of the fact that this Bill will be of considerable interest to the small breeder, the majority of whom are practical farmers, it is vital that the farming organisations, in particular, should be consulted and, in fact, should get representation on this board.  When the Committee Stage of the Bill comes before the House I certainly and many of my colleagues from this side of the House will be watching very carefully the Minister's approach to the appointment of the members to this new board.</P>
    <P>There are other aspects of this Bill which should not be lost sight of. Hunting is an activity which has considerable attraction for certain categories of tourists.</P>

      <P>The date of commencement of negotiations has been announced as 30th June.  It is not expected that negotiations on that date will be very comprehensive; they may be confined to formal statements by the applicant countries.  Procedural matters may also be discussed but that is not certain.  It was the intention to have a debate on the White Paper and this can be arranged between the Whips.  I have no strong views about whether it should be either before or after 30th June.  If it is desired to have it before that date I shall try to facilitate the House but, realising that the substantive negotiations will hardly take place before summer, that may not be very urgent.</P>

      <P>Does the Taoiseach not consider it important to have this <Col N="232" /> debate prior to negotiations so that the Minister could have an indication from the public representatives here as to what should constitute the broad basis of our negotiations?  I appreciate that the actual negotiations are the responsibility of the Government but it would be helpful if Members of the Dáil were to express their views on the application and on the terms of negotiation.  Secondly, is the Taoiseach in a position to give me any information regarding the format of the negotiations?  Has the Taoiseach any information that the first meeting will be a formal meeting between the four applicant countries and the EEC, followed by a withdrawal from the negotiations of Norway, Denmark and Ireland and that negotiations will not be engaged in so far as these three countries are concerned until the British negotiations are completed?</P>

      <P>I accept the Deputy's suggestion that it would be useful to have the views of Members of the House in relation to the broad approach to our negotiations.  I should like to repeat what I said in reply to Deputy Cosgrave's supplementary question that I would try to facilitate a debate in advance.  So far as the format of the negotiations is concerned, as I have already indicated I expect that the opening of negotiations will be formal, although there may be some procedural matters discussed on that date also.  I understand the British have requested a resumption of negotiations in their case during July but, if that request is acceded to, there is no reason to suggest that the British negotiations will be completed before negotiations of the other applicant countries are taken up.  The Minister for External Affairs has been given an assurance that so far as possible negotiations will be parallel in order to synchonise the ultimate date of accession of all applicants.</P>

      <P>The Deputy should understand that EEC matters are conducted mainly at ministerial level as between members of the Council of Ministers.  Those Ministers are usually the Ministers of Foreign Affairs or External Affairs as the case may be. However, when particular matters affect other Departments, whether agriculture, industry or transport, these Ministers take the place of the Foreign Ministers at that level.

      <P>The number of cases of viral or infectious hepatitis notified to my Department in respect of the year 1969 was 1,595.  While this was the highest number of notifications recorded over the past ten years there have been significant fluctuations in notifications over this period.  Consequently, it is not possible to state at this stage whether the increase for 1969 signifies the commencement of a continuing upward trend.</P>
      <P>It is not clear how infectious hepatitis is transmitted.  While it is generally agreed that occasional outbreaks may be food or water borne we have no evidence that cases of the disease have occurred in this country through river pollution by sewerage contamination.</P>

      <P>The figures fluctuate. There is some evidence of an increase all over Europe and nobody knows whether this is due to better notification or a greater incidence of the disease.  Deaths occur largely in people over 65 years of age.  Out of the 1,595 cases 25 people died here in 1969.  A great deal of research is going on to see whether the virus can be ascertained and whether the virus can be countered.

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that the Deputy's question relates to the resolution which was adopted by the 23rd World Health Assembly on the 19th instant and which reads as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>The 23rd World Health Assembly resolves that (1) all those present at meetings of the Assembly and its committees be requested to refrain from smoking in the rooms where such meetings are held; that (2) the Director-General be requested:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(a) to consider the desirability of making the subject for World Health Day &ldquo;The Health Consequences <Col N="239" /> of Smoking&rdquo; on the earliest possible occasion;</P>
    <P>(b) to call the attention of all Members and Associate Members to the report on limitation of smoking and to suggest that the advantages of applying the recommendations on pages 19 and 20 of that report should be considered in all countries;</P>
    <P>(c) to consider convening an expert group to recommend further action that might be taken to discourage smoking;</P>
    <P>(d) to examine to what extent and by what educational methods young people might be persuaded not to begin smoking;</P>
    <P>(e) to bring to the attention of FAO the need for studying crop substitution in tobacco-producing countries;</P>
    <P>(f) to report to the Executive Board at its forty-seventh session and to the Twenty-fourth World Health Assembly on the action proposed and the financial consequences for the organisation.</P>
    <P>This resolution was supported by the Irish delegation.  As the Deputy will appreciate, the resolution, in the main, relates to further action by the Director-General of WHO and arises, in fact, from a report submitted by him to the Assembly.  So far as member states are concerned the resolution draws their attention to the recommendations made by the Director-General in the report.</P>
    <P>These recommendations, ten in number, are rather lengthy and with your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I shall place a copy of them in the Library for the information of Deputies.</P>
    <P>I am at present considering widening the scope of the anti-cigarette smoking campaign operated by my Department which, as I have said previously, is essentially educational in character and aimed primarily at the young and I will certainly have these recommendations studied carefully by my Department. I should, perhaps, straight-away say that I have already very seriously <Col N="240" /> considered the question of the warning notice on cigarette packets and I do not see myself readily departing from the view I have already expressed to the House that it is an essentially futile gesture.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that the fact that the surgeon general in America has seriously considered the question of the warning notices on cigarettes tends to refute his suggestion that it is a futile gesture? Furthermore, is it not a fact that the consumption of cigarettes in America has tended to drop since its introduction?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware what the consumption of cigarettes is in America.  I have been in consultation with a number of people, including leading psychiatrists, on this matter and I am going to examine the recommendations of WHO.  I am convinced that our efforts should be directed to TV and educational campaigns to young people.  I honestly believe that cigarette smoking must be arrested at a young age.  I do not think the propaganda to persuade adults to stop smoking has succeeded.  Taking it by and large people are fully aware of the dangers of smoking.  I am quite ready to revise my opinion on that after further study and I am going to consult everybody who can give me useful advice on it.  The Minister for Finance has allotted me an extra sum this year over and above that made available last year for education in respect of the younger generation.  I feel we should concentrate our efforts there.</P>

      <P>Has the Minister for Health consulted psychiatrists about the advantages which accrue from serious smoking?  Is it not correct that many people benefit from cigarette smoking?  I am saying this as a non serious smoker.  Is it not true that people derive certain benefits from cigarette smoking in that it soothes their nerves, or helps in some other way, and is there not a credit side as well as a debit side?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be rather difficult to go into an elaborate discussion on this now, but the Deputy is <Col N="241" /> correct inasmuch as I have not yet met a psychiatrist who has not said that, if we were to abolish cigarette smoking entirely, many of those who smoke cigarettes would find some alternative drug which might be much worse. The danger of cigarette smoking, of course, varies with the number smoked each day.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be a matter of opinion and I imagine most Deputies would support the view that the end results of dangerous drug addiction are in many cases uncontrollable whereas, in the ordinary way, adults can control the number of cigarettes they consume.  There is a very great difference between amphetamine and heroin absorption and cigarette smoking. I do not think there can be any doubt about that.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Health if his attention has been drawn to a recent statement by a consultant psychiatrist that alcohol is the greatest single addictive drug in use in the Republic; what steps he proposes to take to reduce the incentives to non-addicts to become addicted either directly by advertisements on radio, television or newspapers or indirectly by advertisements purporting to be sports subsidies of various kinds.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the statement referred to by the Deputy and I recently expressed the view myself that the prevalence of alcoholism in this country, while not accurately known, was without a doubt one of very serious proportions and required far more public attention and consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="242" /> On the question of advertising alcoholic beverages, my Department has on more than one occasion taken this question up with the Institute of Advertising Practitioners in Ireland and expressed concern that the advertising of alcoholic liquor should not be specifically directed towards the young.  The director of the institute informed my Department last year that all member agencies and individual members were being requested to take due cognisance of the Minister's concern and indicated that the matter would be reconsidered when the next edition of the code of advertising standards for Ireland was being prepared.  It is undoubtedly a matter of serious import and will need to be kept continually under review.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>In this instance, as well as in the case of cigarette smoking, is the Minister not being completely hypocritical in his dual attitude in regard to drug addiction maladies, cigarette smoking in adults and alcohol addiction in adults?  Surely the adult has as much right to protection against his weakness as the adolescent has and the Minister should try to reduce the incentives to people becoming addicted to either of these two very serious and dangerous drugs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I think more of young people than I do of adults and Radio Telefís Éireann, for example, operate their own code of standards in regard to the advertising of alcoholic liquor, confining the advertisements to persons who must appear to be over 21 years of age and insisting that advertising should not convey the impression that there is any glamour attached to the drinking of alcoholic beverages.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lalor) (for the Minister for Transport and Power)</NameTxt>
      <P>: With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 12 and 13 together.</P>
      <P>Following prolonged negotiations between the B &amp; I Company and British Rail, the companies have arrived at a basis for agreement on a scheme of rationalisation of the companies' shipping facilities for the cross-channel cattle trade.</P>
      <P>The two companies, acting as a consortium, intend to set up an operating company to operate four livestock vessels and the cattle lairages at Dublin, Holyhead and Heysham.  The agreement will run for a period of five years and will then be subject to review and possible extension for a further five years, that is to say, until 1980.  The managing board of the operating company will comprise two representatives of the cattle trade, with representatives of the B &amp; I Company and British Rail.  Scheduled services will be provided on the Dublin/Holyhead and Dublin/Heysham routes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main objectives of the agreement are reasonable stability of freight rates and long-term stability of services for the cross-channel cattle trade. The agreement provides a continuing guarantee of substantial B &amp; I participation in the trade.  The company <Col N="246" /> accumulated losses of £376,000 in the period 1967 to 1969 on their cross-channel livestock operations and they expect that, under the proposed agreement, these losses will be eliminated.</P>
    <P>The agreement will enable the Irish cattle trade, for the first time, to have a voice in the service and in determination of freight rates.  It carries the assurance that exporters will have a guaranteed service to the ports of Holyhead and Heysham until 1975 at least. At the same time, the agreement will enable the B &amp; I and British Rail to formulate definite plans for the continuance of their services beyond that date.</P>
    <P>The shipping services operated by private shipping companies for the cross-channel cattle trade will in no way be affected by the proposed agreement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that there has been grave dissatisfaction for the past three or four years on the part of members of the cattle trade because of the transport facilities available?  Can the Minister now assure us that we will have a more efficient and up-to-date service for the next few years?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that centralisation of livestock shipping through Dublin could be detrimental to the trade since, if there were a strike in Dublin, cattle exports would have to be suspended?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>The allocation of funds voted for the major resort development scheme is a matter for Bord Fáilte.  I am informed by the board that under the scheme they contributed over £38,000 last year towards resort development works carried out by the county council in west Cork at a total cost of £56,000.  This brought total expenditure to date on resort works in west Cork to more than £121,000.  The county council have submitted to the board proposals for further works to be carried out in the current year and these are at present being considered by Bord Fáilte together with proposals for resort development works in other major resorts and resort areas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is regrettable that the Minister for Transport and Power is absent but is the Minister aware that the money allocated was for the year 1968-69?  There was no allocation for 1969-70.  Is he further aware that Bord Fáilte told us they had no money unless the Minister's Department would make it available?  Hence, the necessity for the question.  Is the Minister further aware that we have more undeveloped tourist resort areas in west Cork than in any other part of the <Col N="248" /> county and if so, will he ask the Minister on his return to give a definite answer to the question put down by both Deputies representing west Cork and addressed to the Minister for Transport and Power today?

      <P>I appreciate that the Deputy is not satisfied.  To satisfy him would be a feat.  Obviously the Deputy was not listening to my reply.  I indicated that Bord Fáilte did contribute £38,000 last year towards resort development in west Cork.

      <P>The Minister knows west Cork but is he aware that it has a coastline of between 200 and 300 miles which include some of the finest resorts in the country?  So good are they that the Taoiseach has a very soft spot for the area and mainly confines his holidays to that part of the country. In view of the special claims this area has on public funds, surely it is not justifiable for Bord Fáilte to tell the council that the Government have cut back on funds for tourist development? That is what Bord Fáilte have told us. I do not know where the £121,000 was expended.  Possibly, most of it was given to a few hoteliers and that is how the figure is accounted for.  In any case, we hope something will happen.  If not we shall be back again next month.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter has been examined in my Department.  The terrain at the airport is difficult and the extension of the main runway would relatively be very costly.  The extension of the runway would, nevertheless, be considered seriously if the operational need for an extension were established and the extension could be economically justified.</P>
      <P>I should say that no airline company or operator has as yet made any case of substance for an extension of the runway.  The limitations of the present main runway may from time to time impose economic penalties on individual aircraft operations but such penalties would be negligible compared to the cost of extending the runway; and there is as yet no evidence that the development of traffic at the airport is being inhibited by the present runway lengths.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Electricity Supply Board that the townlands in question are in the Knappagh rural area which has already been canvassed under the board's planned post development scheme.  For construction purposes the area has been divided into two parts. Work will commence in about two weeks time in the part that includes Knappagh, Drummin and Cushlough.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose taking Questions Nos. 20 and 21 together.</P>
      <P>Under the provisions of the Harbours Act, 1946, responsibility for the deepening, improving and dredging of the port of Dublin and for the taking of all proper measures for the management, control and operation of the port rests with the Dublin Port and Docks Board.  The carrying out of surveys or model tests in connection with dredging or reclamation is therefore a matter for the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am informed by the board that they have had model tests carried out at the <Col N="255" /> Hydraulic Research Station at Wallingford, England, from 1964 to 1967, to study certain aspects of the ESB's power station development.  In addition the board have been advised that reclamation works already undertaken have had no appreciable effect on the hydraulic regime of Dublin Bay.  They have also been advised that little purpose would be served by further model tests pending decisions on the board's long-term proposals for the future of the port the detailed design of which may possibly give rise to the need for hydraulic studies including the use of models.</P>

Am I to assume that a favourable reply will be available and this money recovered for the person who suffered this loss which is a not inconsiderable sum, £134 2s 11d, or am I to assume that the State solicitor in Cork is dithering on this in the hope that the man in question will pass on and the claim may fall through?

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, Sir, I propose to take Questions Nos. 23 and 24 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The failure of employers to stamp insurance cards at the proper time does not necessarily result in financial loss <Col N="258" /> to insured persons because of inability to satisfy the contribution conditions for receipt of benefit under the Social Welfare Acts by reason of an employer's failure to stamp an insurance card.  The position is that the employer is legally responsible for the amount of benefit lost, and any such amount may be recovered through the courts.  As Minister for Social Welfare I am empowered to take, on behalf of the insured person, the necessary steps to recover the amount of the benefit lost and am always prepared to do so at the request of the person concerned.</P>
    <P>According to the records of my Department the insurance and redundancy cards of some 29 employees of the firm named in the second question under reply have not been stamped since May 1968, although the employer has made deductions from wages for this purpose.  In the case of one of the employees concerned, a request has been received to have legal action taken by me in her name and on her behalf for the recovery of disability benefit lost through the employer's default and action is being taken accordingly.  The failure of the firm in question to pay outstanding contributions is now in the hands of the Chief State Solicitor who has been asked to initiate proceedings as expeditiously as possible.</P>
    <P>My Department have carried out an examination of the general question of loss of benefit by insured persons due to failure of employers to comply with the requirements of the Social Welfare Acts and are at present considering how best to provide more satisfactory protection for insured persons.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister indicate who exactly will be prosecuted in the case in question?  There was a change of ownership of the company from one registered company to another.

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">

I am not prepared to take action that would make it easy for employers to neglect stamping by providing them with the knowledge that, in that event, the money would be paid anyhow by the State.  The insured person has some obligation here, too.  I should be more inclined to amend the regulations to ensure that the insured person could see his card or stamp each week.</P>

      <P>The main difficulty here is that the employee never sees his card.  It occurs mostly in nonunion firms.  If the employee seeks to see his card, the employer very often terminates the employment.  Portion of the examination should lie in the direction of a compulsory right for the employee to see his card, say, once a month, in any place of employment.</P>

      <P>Something like this might be essential.  The employee has to get his wages into his hands once every week.  He never sees his card. Some method might be possible whereby he would be able to examine it occasionally.  It would be impossible to have inspectors going around so frequently as to be able to ensure that all cards are stamped and that everything is in order.  It is only when bankruptcy or liquidation occurs that trouble arises.  It may then be found that deductions were made but that cards were not stamped maybe for a year or longer.  If somebody applies for benefit in such circumstances, that person is deprived of it in which case such person has an action against the employer in ordinary civil contract. If such people do not want to take action then, at their request, I take it for them&mdash;and frequently do.</P>

      <P>In this case, the Department use all the pressure they can to get the person to pay the arrears.  In one case, they were successful in getting a big portion of arrears paid.  With regard to lack of payment to a person who would otherwise qualify, it is a separate action.  The first action is to try to get the employer to pay the arrears.  The next action is to hold him liable for the amount lost by some would-be beneficiary under the scheme&mdash;the old age or widow's pension, unemployment benefit, or whatever it may be.  In the case of unemployment benefit&mdash;as has happened in one of these instances&mdash; the claimant could be switched to assistance.

        <i>(Cavan):</i> I have suggested that, in cases where insured persons or employees suffer a loss through failure of their employers to stamp cards, the Minister should pay it and look for recovery afterwards. There is a very excellent precedent for that in the case of the Motor Insurers' Bureau.  If a person is injured by a non-insured motorist, the Motor Insurers' Bureau under agreement between them and the Minister for Local Government, pay up and then go and see if they can recover&mdash;and, in most cases, they can.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Colley)</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 26 and 27 together.</P>
      <P>Cash is being made available to meet normal Post Office transactions. Since the banks dispute began, the public also has been making greatly increased use of the existing Post Office remittance services and of Post Office Savings Bank facilities for making payments of all kinds.  It would not, however, be possible to provide money through post offices to meet general business and trading needs.</P>
      <P>Various banks are not affected by the closure and these are providing certain facilities for their customers, including in a number of cases the supply of cash to meet wages, salaries and other business needs.  The Central Bank has taken steps to ensure that sufficient cash will be available to these banks to meet their requirements. Arrangements have also been made to meet cash requirements of the public services for payment of wages and salaries.  Many businesses are able to get the cash they require from other businesses having a cash inflow.</P>
      <P>The banks still open and travel agents who normally provide such facilities will continue to be able to provide exchange facilities for tourists. I have no doubt also that hotels, guest-houses and traders will be able to facilitate tourists who are their customers which would follow normal practice.</P>
      <P>I should like to emphasise that, despite suggestions made to the contrary, there is substantially more currency&mdash; in the region of £10 million&mdash;in circulation than before the closure of the Associated Banks.  Special arrangements have been made to maintain an adequate supply of currency in circulation and there is no need for anxiety on this score.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Lands what procedure is necessary by co-owners of commonage to have such commonage partitioned; and what are the functions and responsibilities of the Land Commission in such schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is open to interested parties to apply to the Land Commission under the Land Acts for the partition of lands held in common.</P>
      <P>The procedure for the partitioning of commonages falls into two main categories, depending on whether all the owners of the commonage are agreed on the partition.</P>
      <P>Firstly, if all of the owners wish to have a commonage partitioned, they may submit to the Land Commission a joint application for permission to do so and submit a scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The application, which can be made informally, should embody all the necessary conditions regarding rights of way, erection and maintenance of fences, etc., and should be accompanied <Col N="273" /> by a map of the commonage on which the agreed division and rights-of-way are accurately delineated and lettered. The application and map should be dated and signed by all of the owners in common.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, if one or more, but not all, of the owners in common wish to have a commonage partitioned, it is necessary to lodge in the Land Commission an application on Form 131, in accordance with Order IV of the Land Purchase Acts Rules, 1951 (S.I. No. 50 of 1951).  A copy of this order, with specimen form appended, may be obtained from the Government Publications Sale Office, GPO Arcade, Dublin 1.  The application should be accompanied by copy Land Registry map showing the lands proposed to be partitioned.</P>
    <P>The basic authority for partition of commonage is section 24, Land Act, 1939.  This provides that, where all the owners in common apply to the Land Commission for leave to partition and submit a scheme, the Land Commission may authorise the partition and confirm the scheme.</P>
    <P>It also deals with the position where some of the owners in common apply to the Land Commission for a compulsory partition and provides that the Land Commission, after serving the prescribed notices and making such investigations as they consider necessary, may, if they so think proper, prepare a scheme for the partition. Apart from the partitioning of commonages pursuant to the provisions I have mentioned, the Land Commission are also disposed to undertake the actual division and rearrangement of commonages which are productive or reasonably productive and where the persons involved are the owners of sub-standard holdings which can be significantly improved by dividing the commonage and bringing it into production.</P>

      <P>The question of relating the leaving certificate to the British general certificate of education has been raised from time to time with appropriate authorities in Britain.  The position is that while successes in the leaving certificate are accepted in lieu of general certificate of education passes at ordinary level, honours in the leaving certificate are generally not accepted in lieu of passes at advanced level in corresponding subjects of the GCE.  The difficulty in this regard springs from the fact that there is a degree of specialisation involved in the advanced GCE in so far as it may be taken in as few as one or two subjects. On educational grounds I do not feel that we should abandon our broader leaving certificate programme in favour of a comparatively narrow specialised course.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Potez interests in their capacity as ordinary creditors will receive a dividend out of the proceeds of the liquidation of Potez Aerospace Ltd., at the same rate as the other principal creditors, related to the amount of their claims against the assets of the company admitted by the liquidator.</P>
      <P>As I stated in reply to a question on 19th May, the dividend is expected to be in excess of 10s in the £.  No other payment has been made to the Potez Companies in connection with the take-over of Potez Aerospace Ltd.</P>
      <P>No payment was offered by or sought from the Potez family or Potez Companies to offset the losses sustained by the State because of the failure of this enterprise.  There are no legal grounds on which the State could seek such a payment.  The losses sustained by the Potez Companies which had invested in the enterprises are, in fact, substantially greater than those incurred by the State.</P>

Has the Minister's attention been drawn to an article reported in <i>Business and Finance</i> this month which states that the Potez family will get £346,232 from the sale to Roadstone of the plant?

The losses sustained by the Potez Companies which had invested in the enterprise were substantially greater than those incurred by the State.  There are no legal grounds on which the State could seek such a payment in view of the fact that the losses sustained by the investors, from the point of view of Potez, were far greater than the losses unfortunately sustained by the State.</P>

Roadstone Ltd. are to receive financial assistance towards the cost to them of acquiring the fixed assets of Potez Aerospace Ltd., the assistance taking the form of an abatement by the IDA of their claim on the liquidator.  The amount of the abatement, which is being effected by way of dividend waiver, is £118,430, representing 25 per cent of the price to be paid by Roadstone Ltd. for the fixed assets at Baldonnel after deduction of the estimated realisable value of Roadstone's existing premises and disposable machinery and equipment.

      <P>The figure of £64 mentioned by the Deputy was given in reply to a question seeking the annual value per prisoner of goods produced in the manufacturing and farm departments and was calculated by dividing the estimated receipts for 1969-70 by the estimated daily average of prisoners for that year.  In fact, only about half of the prisoners are employed in manufacturing or on the farm so that the value of the work produced by these prisoners is about double the figure mentioned.</P>
      <P>The following employments are carried on in the manufacturing departments: baking, carpentry, mailbagmaking, matmaking, shoemaking, tailoring, laundry and woodcutting. Employment on lamp assembly, rug-making and slippermaking has recently been provided.

Apart from the case of Castlemartyr, to which I have previously <Col N="295" /> referred, there are no proposals for the closure of other Garda stations in County Cork, but there is a general review of the situation going on under a research and planning unit of the Garda Síochána, set up as a result of the Conroy Commission, which is inquiring into the general deployment of the force among other matters.

      <P>I have not, in the meantime, received any recommendations from the commissioner for the closing or reduction of Garda stations, but that is not to say that the question is not under examination by the research and planning unit established by the commissioner, with Government approval, following on a recommendation of the Conroy Commission.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 66 and 70 together.</P>
      <P>As I have indicated on a number of occasions in replies to Parliamentary questions and in public statements, the distribution of the Garda Síochána is being reviewed by a research and planning unit with a view to ensuring that the strength at various centres will be used to the best possible advantage and fulfilment of public needs.</P>
      <P>No station is closed without a certificate by the commissioner that he is satisfied that the station can be closed without detriment to the efficient policing of the area.  The assessment of the police requirements in any area is a matter primarily for determination by professional policemen who are the best judges of methods of prevention and detection of crime and of police needs in the locality.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that disquiet has arisen in some cases and in all such cases, as I have indicated earlier, the views of responsible local citizens are taken into account but ultimately the decision to close a station is not taken without a certificate from the commissioner that he is satisfied that the policing of the area will be no less effective than it was before.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Loughnane</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if, in view of the amount of State money invested in forestry in the area, the presence of a television booster station, the recent increase in robberies in the area and the great distance from the nearest Garda transport, he will reconsider the decision to close Feakle Garda station, County Clare.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that before a decision is taken to close any Garda station, all the relevant factors relating to the locality concerned are fully considered.</P>
      <P>Following the putting down of this question I consulted the commissioner, Garda Síochána, who assured me that he was satisfied that the decision to close Feakle Garda station should stand.  The commissioner has told me that the area will be effectively policed from the surrounding stations at Scariff, Tulla, Crusheen, Shanaglish, Gort and Woodford.</P>
      <P>In a matter of this kind it must be left to the professional competence of the police to deal with police problems.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BillLoughnane" hpid="Dr. Loughnane Dr. Loughnane">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Loughnane</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that in the past few months almost all the post offices in East Clare and many other businesses were broken into and robbed?  That was during the time of the television strike when the local gardaí were occupied for over 1,000 hours guarding the television booster station.  In this district there are over 2,000 acres of forestry land, five schools, including one four-teacher school&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="BillLoughnane" hpid="Dr. Loughnane Dr. Loughnane">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Loughnane</NameTxt>
      <P>I am coming to the question.  There are three points of signing for unemployment benefit.  All this represents a full day's work for the gardaí.  The district of Woodford that the Minister mentioned is 25 miles at the other side of the Slieve Aughty mountain without any direct surfaced road.  I fail to see how they could police the area from there or other <Col N="299" /> stations.  Because of these considerations would the Minister reconsider the decision until such time as he has had local advice?  I understand this was decided at headquarters and that it was only yesterday the decision was communicated to the local district from the commissioner's office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I would say, Sir, that I did mention other places besides Woodford which, according to my information, is 18 miles away.  I did mention other places some of which are much closer.  I can only say that the Minister did review the situation again and the result was as I have indicated to the House.</P>

    <P>Detailed records of road accidents prior to 1965 are not retained by the Garda and the statistics for those years are therefore not available. Publication of road accident statistics is a matter for An Foras Forbartha and the analysis and evaluation of accident figures and reports are also matters for the Foras to whom the Garda Síochána supply full particulars of road accidents.  The Garda do not attempt to assign causes for individual accidents, some of which may be the subject of civil actions, nor would they comment publicly on decisions taken by local authorities in regard to road improvements.  The Minister with overall responsibility for road safety matters is the Minister for Local Government.</P>
