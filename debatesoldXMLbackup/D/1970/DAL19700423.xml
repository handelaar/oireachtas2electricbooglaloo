      <P>In so far as the people will look at the Budget which was introduced yesterday to see how it affects them, the immediate reaction will be to see little change.  This attitude will overlook the real gravity of the economic and financial position, because the Budget temporarily obscures and indeed turns a blind eye to the real state of the nation's finances.  It allows the present dangerous economic trends to continue, ignoring all the warnings issued by a variety of informed opinion such as the NIEC, the forecasts of the Department of Finance in the review <Col N="1880" /> of 1969 and the outlook for 1970, and every other person or group concerned at the serious extent of inflation.</P>
      <P>When the full effect of the taxes that have been imposed by raising the turnover tax becomes operative, then the impact not merely will be severe but will raise very substantially the cost of every item, increasing taxation in a manner which informed comment suggested was the least satisfactory and least desirable method in the circumstances.</P>
      <P>In addition to that, there is no over-all plan to deal with major economic and social questions.  One of the most significant aspects of national affairs and probably the one which has given rise to the greatest concern in recent times has been the state of industrial relations.  With the exception of a brief reference, which ignored the attitude this Government adopted in recent years, little was said about it in the Financial Statement.  The reference was as follows:</P>
      <P>Under threats of disruption of their business the tendency of employers has been to buy industrial peace at too high a price in labour costs.</P>
      <P>It is right to inquire who gave the employers and the unions the green light in this regard.  It is now six years since direct Government action and intervention was taken for the first time during the negotiation of the ninth round.  Deputies will recall that the Government intervened at that time in order to gain temporary political advantage at the pending by-elections in Kildare and Cork.  The result of that intervention is the very serious inflationary situation which has rapidly developed.  Undoubtedly, some of the price rises which occurred were outside the Government's control but the extraordinary spur given by that intervention has been reflected in all wage and salary discussions since and the consequences to the economy have been more than serious.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Informed opinion has expressed great concern at the way this Budget ignores or makes little reference to these particular factors and suggests no policy to remedy the situation.  Comments made in the NIEC report, the <Col N="1881" /> Central Bank report, the report in the <i>Irish Banking Review</i> and other statements made on the state of the economy all express grave concern that when some form of deflationary action was necessary Government policy and Government directives were the other way.</P>
    <P>The NIEC report No. 28 adverts to the fact that on balance fiscal policy was expansionary during 1969 despite the warning given by the Minister for Finance in a broadcast in March of last year.  The report states that disappointingly little was achieved in the course of the year because last year's Budget tended to offset the disinflationary impact of the November, 1968, measures. It refers to the substantial increase in lendings by non-associated banks.  It considers that monetary policy may have exercised some disinflationary influence in the latter part of the year. It then considers what will happen in 1970 on the assumption that the over-all economic trend would be accommodated by a combination of capital inflow and domestic credit creation of approximately the same order as occurred in 1969.</P>
    <P>It refers to the outstanding concern that has been expressed about the problem of the evolution of money incomes. It states that the trend towards an increase in aggregate employee incomes of a higher order than that which obtained in 1969 would occur partly because of the carry over, as most of these were not applicable for the whole of 1969 but will apply for the whole of the current year, to which must be added the second and third phase which will apply from some date this year within the framework of settlements made last year.  It points out that allowance must also be made for drift and increased employment.  It assumes that further increases in incomes and Govvernment expenditure will contribute to a current balance of payments deficit estimated at £90 million.  It expresses concern, a concern which has been shared by every individual or group who have considered the situation, that the growth in GNP in real terms in 1970 will be about four per cent, that personal consumption will rise by 12 to 13 per cent, that investment will rise <Col N="1882" /> by about 19 per cent and that the consumer price index will be the same as in 1969, namely 7½ per cent.</P>
    <P>In fact, the effect of the Budget will be to add an unknown figure because, as Deputy Dr. O'Donovan pointed out yesterday, when the turnover tax was first introduced it was understood it would amount to 6d in the £ or 2½ per cent but when the turnover tax was first introduced the very minimum increase was three per cent.  No one believes that the 2½ per cent increase in turnover tax will result in an overall tax of 5 per cent.  The seriousness of these price increases was considered by Mr. Fogarty of the Economic and Social Research Institute and he dealt with the matter at some length in a lecture he delivered in March of last year.  He expressed the confirmed view of other commentators when he said:</P>
    <P>If, for example, income tax or turnover tax are increased the man who has accepted a pay increase that is reasonable from the point of view of stopping the rise in prices has to pay the tax just as much as the man whose increase was out of all proportion.  Naturally he feels aggrieved and unfairly penalised.</P>
    <P>Mr. Fogarty went on to say that this particular tax hits the just and the unjust alike and that it will mean a substantial increase in consumer prices. He said it was opposed to every piece of advice that was given to the Government in the course of the comments that were made and in fact, is the form of tax that was rejected as unsuitable in present circumstances.</P>
    <P>I want, for a moment, to advert to a matter I referred to earlier&mdash;the question of industrial relations.  With the exception of the intervention by the Government which sparked off the present inflationary situation five or six years ago, and which is highlighted and referred to again in the recent NIEC report where it recommends certain institutional and other changes, nothing whatever has been done about a prices and incomes policy in the intervening five years.  In the earlier NIEC reports, Nos. 11 and 18, guidelines were laid down and suggestions were made for the adoption of a prices and incomes policy but nothing was <Col N="1883" /> done about it.  Now, after a lapse of five years, during which the situation has got substantially worse, we are back where we were in the beginning.</P>
    <P>So far as one can see, the Government have ceased to take any effective interest in industrial relations, ceased to intervene in a positive or purposeful fashion.  Maybe as a result of the action that was taken five or six years ago they are anxious to keep their fingers out of the pie.  With the exception of the establishment of the Department of Labour, nothing positive or constructive has happened.  In fact, the establishment of that Department has coincided with the period in which the Labour Court has ceased to be effective or influential in settling disputes or evolving a policy in respect of industrial relations&mdash;with one sole exception: it is right that the conciliation officer of the Labour Court should have his efforts adequately recognised and appreciated.  He has performed, on many occasions, a most useful and constructive role.  A conciliation officer, however, is not a policy for prices and incomes.  A conciliation officer in the main is concerned with settling disputes when they occur, with bringing parties together.  His role is something like the old role of the tangler in a fair.  He tries to split the difference.</P>
    <P>The real problem with which we are faced in the economic field is that of bringing price and income increases under control.  Though this statement has been made and remade, emphasised and re-emphasised, there does not appear to be not merely sufficient public understanding of it but any understanding at all so far as the Government are concerned.  The damage which can be done and will be done by a continuation of the present situation created by the rate of inflation that has characterised the economy in the last couple of years has been pinpointed and all the bodies that I have referred to have time and time again adverted to this situation.  Recent experiences in the export field reinforce everything that has been said in that regard.</P>
    <P>To say that a prices and incomes policy is necessary is not to argue <Col N="1884" /> against higher wages, nor against a more just distribution of wealth within the community.  It is merely to underline a self-evident fact: that if, as a result of incomes in this country going up too quickly, our costs are higher than those in other countries, particularly in Britain, then our goods will become uncompetitive; we will not be able to sell them and larger numbers of people will not only not have higher wages but may well find themselves out of jobs of any sort.  This situation was noted in the OECD Economic Survey where it said that the movement of earnings and productivity suggests that wage cost pressures on manufacturers must have increased considerably, that the earnings per unit of output have risen by as much as 9½ per cent.  This contrasted with the favourable experience in the previous two years.  Unit labour costs rose much more than in the United Kingdom, Ireland's major export market, and in most other OECD countries.</P>
    <P>The fact that these warnings have been given before may well cause people to think, and even this debate may create the impression, that because people have been saying: &ldquo;Wolf, wolf&rdquo; there is some effort made to deny workers legitimate improvements in their standard of living.  Certainly it cannot be denied that in the past, employers have used as a standard negotiating tactic the threat that higher wages could lead to a loss of employment but on this occasion the figures which have been published by the NIEC, a body which not merely embraces employers but is representative of workers in the State, surely leave no doubt that we are dealing with an exceptionally dangerous and serious situation.</P>
    <P>The figures which I have quoted from the OECD show that between the third quarter of 1968 and 1969 unit wage costs increased in Irish industry by 11.53 per cent as opposed to only 3.45 per cent in Britain.  This, as the OECD report pointed out, is a trend which we could not sustain for long without disastrous consequences.  We have advocated for many years, and in our policy published as far back as 1965, the basis and principles on which a prices and incomes policy should be <Col N="1885" /> adopted.  A detailed report was made subsequently by the NIEC in 1965 and now again, five years later, when nothing has been done, a further report recommending far-reaching institutional changes adverts to the same situation.</P>
    <P>In no area of Government administration have the Government shown themselves so devoid of leadership, so incapable of acting effectively and so unwilling to take action as in this critical area.  This is not a situation that has developed overnight or without warning. For most of the last decade, certainly for the last six years, the need for a prices and incomes policy has been a constant matter of public debate and discussion among all those who are concerned to establish a high but stable rate of economic growth.  No one pretends, and we do not believe nor is it advocated in the NIEC report, that a prices and incomes policy can be 100 per cent satisfactory.  If it was 50 per cent, or even less, it would be an improvement on the present position.  The efforts made in Britain initially ran into many difficulties and left many problems and questions unresolved but the one outstanding attribute of the economic policies that have been pursued there over recent years, whatever initial mistakes were made in delaying devaluation and so on, has been the consistency with which they have been applied and in the economic field consistency or an approach based on a consistent, constant effort to deal with the situation pays off.</P>
    <P>Nobody would seriously suggest that this problem is not one that requires a great deal of thought and consideration. In this country over the past half-century we have developed attitudes and traditions in the field of industrial relations which make it difficult now to approach these issues from anything but the most narrow, sectional standpoint. The challenge which now faces the country, the Government, employers and trade unions is by imaginative and effective leadership to make a determined effort to convert public opinion and the opinion of those directly involved to a broader and more modern outlook in regard to these problems.</P>
    <P>This task is not impossible even if it <Col N="1886" /> may be difficult.  Most people have come to realise that the increases in incomes which have been won over the last few years, and which in particular instances and in some cases when taken in isolation, appear to be substantial, have been eroded by a corresponding increase in prices.  This has been recognised by trade unions, employers, by those who have commented on this matter, and even by individual workers.  That is where the Government have failed lamentably in this Budget and the climate now exists, because of widespread national concern over substantial price increases, in which effective and purposeful action may be taken in order to create a wider understanding and acceptance of a system of achieving improvements in incomes which in some cases might be modest in monetary terms but would have real value because they would not result in corresponding increases in prices.</P>
    <P>A successful prices and incomes policy must include certain fundamental elements.  There must be a clear and explicit acceptance of the principle that national incomes should rise in line with real growth in national resources. It is essential also that those who traditionally have believed that income increases can be obtained only by wrenching them from employers through militancy, must be convinced that employers accept without equivocation the need for a steady improvement in living standards.  There must be acceptance of the changes which need to be made in the relationships between the various groups in the community. Any incomes policy which is to have any chance of success must include some understanding of, for example, the particular problem of improving the position of the lower paid workers in relation to other groups.</P>
    <P>Another key matter in any incomes policy is that there should be full confidence in the various institutions involved. The defect which everyone recognises in the NIEC report and the recommendations that are made&mdash;and that is no reflection on some of the persons concerned&mdash;is that a number of the members hold dual positions and consequently are inhibited from recommending <Col N="1887" /> or adopting policies that are necessary in particular circumstances. They are inhibited by reason of their other positions from recommending changes that might conflict either with the particular bodies they represent or, especially in the case of some Government nominees, conflict with the Government or with individual Ministers.</P>
    <P>This report on prices and incomes deals again with many of the problems that have been adverted to in the past. It recommends the establishment of a prices and incomes committee; it deals with the role of the Labour Court, of the Fair Trade Commission and the prices section of the Department of Industry and Commerce.  At one stage it makes the astonishing comment that this prices section should be used, implying that in recent times that section has not been functioning.</P>
    <P>The report also refers to the statement made in the third programme which indicates that the Government have decided that the Restrictive Trade Practices Act should be amended to empower the Fair Trade Commission to investigate restrictive practices and then it states that the prices section should operate effectively.  Finally, it recommends the establishment of a new body.</P>
    <P>The Government must make up their minds about what they want and what should be done in this field.  The Labour Court as at present functioning has ceased to be effective in any sphere of industrial relations except in regard to its conciliation officials.  The prices section of the Department of Industry and Commerce has ceased to operate effectively and it has not got the confidence of the public in general; it has been found to be ineffective and inequitable in the way it operates so far as industry is concerned.  This was highlighted recently when, after an announcement that the price of beer and stout was to go up, the Minister for Industry and Commerce announced that it would not go up.  Once that was announced it was obvious that there was going to be some change in the Budget.  The effect of the Budget will be to increase the prices of beer and stout just as surely as if the usual <Col N="1888" /> penny or twopence had been imposed on them and the increases will be just as real as far as the consumers are concerned.</P>
    <P>There is a multiplicity of bodies all of which are supposed to operate in regard to prices and incomes.  None of them is effective because of the failure to adopt a constructive and consistent policy in regard to all the problems involved.  The NIEC report refers to this multiplicity&mdash;the prices section of the Department of Industry and Commerce, the Labour Court and the Fair Trade Commission&mdash;and now there is to be a co-ordinating body to deal with them.  This problem must be faced in a realistic fashion.</P>
    <P>For many years the Government have sat staring at the problem like a rabbit hypnotised by a weasel and the evidence is that far from developing a policy they have retreated from the position which existed five years ago. They have been a party recently to the NIEC report which in fact represents a retreat from the recommendations made in an earlier report.</P>
    <P>In the Third Programme reference was made at page 142 to the need for a prices and incomes policy and stress was laid on the need to avoid disruption of national development by the commitment on the part of the Government to action in that field.  Now, more than a year later, there is an NIEC report on this matter which takes the country back to where it was in 1965.</P>
    <P>Some three years ago the Department of Labour was established and it was expected that they would apply themselves energetically to promoting an understanding of the need for new attitudes, new methods in the incomes field and that they would give a lead in promoting the necessary changes in regard to relations between employers and employees.  In effect, the Department have said: &ldquo;Do not make any effort towards a solution of the problem or become involved in adopting and spearheading a policy for industrial relations or a policy in respect of the harmonisation of the traditional conflicts which exist in respect of these two key areas in the economy&rdquo;.  The only action the Government took in <Col N="1889" /> this field, facing the mounting crisis, was a call last December for a seven per cent limit to incomes increases. That intervention, coming at that time, was so absurd and unrealistic that it merely discredited the Government in the sphere in which they should have had influence and be a source of leadership or guidance.  During the whole of last year, the Government said nothing and gave no evidence of any sense of leadership or direction.</P>
    <P>The 12th round was allowed to develop on the basis of income increases ranging up to 20 per cent and more.  Then, at the very end of the year, it was suggested that, for the remaining workers, all they should get was 7 per cent.  This was an example of the inability of the Government to give leadership or to face the problem. The facts are that during last year, the Government were so concerned with winning the general election that they refused to take effective action to keep the economy under control or to provide the leadership and direction. Instead of financial leadership, the crudest form of political expediency took over.  That situation has now been ended.  One of the consequences of such action is that different sections have themselves taken action&mdash; because of the intervention by the Government.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach yesterday, on behalf of the Minister for Finance, said that, under threats of disruption of their business, the tendency of employers has been to buy industrial peace at too high a price in labour costs.  Is every employer in the country, is every major concern, not bound to consider what happened in 1964 when the then Taoiseach intervened and, as a result, succeeded in securing a wage and salary adjustment more than the trade unions themselves expected, more than the trade unions themselves were negotiating and more than the industries concerned, in the circumstances of the country as a whole, could afford?  That situation, because of the deliberate action taken at the time, has bedevilled industrial relations ever since and has affected the attitude which the Minister for Finance, through the Taoiseach, yesterday <Col N="1890" /> commented on in the paragraph I read.</P>
    <P>But the situation that is now developing, the magnitude of the increase in consumer prices which can and will occur, is alarming.  This has been highlighted by every informed commentator&mdash;all of them pointing to the gravity of the situation and all of them indicating that action should be taken to deal with it.  The NIEC Report, to which I refer so frequently, said:</P>
    <P>The magnitude of the increase in consumer prices which could occur this year is alarming.  If it materialised, it could seriously damage competitiveness and therefore put many existing jobs in jeopardy and erode one of the basic conditions for future growth in output and employment.  It could create new social tensions because many social categories could not be adequately insulated from its effect.  On the external side, even given the present level of external reserves, the risks associated with a deficit of £90 million are unaccepably large.  Our reasons for this conclusion are the extent of State and State-guaranteed borrowing which occurred last year; the likelihood that it might be very difficult to borrow abroad on the same scale this year; the uncertainties connected with capital flows; the fact that the balance of payments has continuously deteriorated since the end of 1967; the dangerous expectations that would be consolidated by maintaining the inflationary momentum through 1970 and the serious problems that these would create for the economy in 1970 and 1972.</P>
    <P>Let us turn to a quarter that could not be regarded as unfriendly to the present Government.  The other day, Maynard, in the <i>Sunday Press</i>, calculated that, in the last year, between rising prices and income tax, an investor would have needed to earn 12 per cent simply to get his money back in real terms.  These inflationary pressures, to which every body has referred and of which we are all the victims in one form or another, were triggered off by the action of the then Government in 1964.  Of course, the immediate aftermath of that <Col N="1891" /> was satisfactory from a political point of view so far as the Government were concerned.  The immediate effect for those who got wage increases was beneficial but the effect on the economy has been very, very serious.</P>
    <P>This particular form of collecting tax increases is, in the opinion of all the commentaries I have mentioned, the worst form of tax for dealing with the present position.  But, over and above that, what will be the fate of the small trader?  The small trader faces extinction not because of competition from supermarkets, native or foreign, but at the hands of a rapacious Government who are using Irish shopkeepers as tax collectors.  That is the real danger in it. The little traders, the people everyone is anxious to see continue; the people who have been the backbone of the small towns; the people in family businesses in which a son or daughter succeeds the parents or possibly, in some cases, family concerns in which are bound up not merely the interests of the family itself, but the interests of those employed in them; the people affected by rising rates; the people whose lot the increase of £2½ million in the Health Estimate is meant to ease&mdash;these are the people who will find the burden of operating this tax possibly as great as&mdash;certainly no less than&mdash;those who will be obliged to pay it.  This tax is, in the view of those who have commented on it, the worst form of taxation to deal with the present situation.  It taxes, as the reference by Mr. Fogarty indicates, the just and the unjust alike.  The inflationary situation that has developed is so grave that the March quarterly issue of the <i>Irish Banking Review</i> had this to say:</P>
    <P>There can be no question that a dangerous degree of inflation exists. It is equally unquestionable that this state of affairs should not be allowed to continue, still less to grow worse. In many of its recent reports the Central Bank has called attention to the urgent necessity for restraining the growth of the external payments deficit.  It may be assumed that all responsible, well-informed opinion is unanimous on this important issue.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1892" />&mdash;&mdash;with one exception, the Government. This serious situation is such that we believe that the time has arrived for a review of the Free Trade Area Agreement.  Last year the rise in the exports to the United Kingdom slowed down sharply.  Most of the deceleration was accounted for by the fall in the value of agricultural exports, sales of live cattle and fresh or chilled beef, which accounted for over 50 per cent of all agricultural exports and almost 30 per cent of the total exports. Exports fell by 5 per cent in value and by about 9 per cent in volume.  The numbers of live cattle sold dropped by 58,000.  There was an increase of 12,000 in respect of chilled or manufactured meat.  The over-all effect was a drop of 46,000 in the number of cattle sold to Britain.</P>
    <P>The time has come for this country to consider the position on two fronts. We must consider it in respect of the slowing-down in the opportunities for the sale of cattle to Britain and in respect of the effect of the continued reduction in tariffs at the same time as the British continue the import deposit requirement.  It is true that the terms of that deposit requirement have been modified but it is still operating in breach of the agreement.  If that policy is to be continued, and if there is no further action by the British to relax that imposition, I believe the time has come for this country to consider seriously deferring further tariff reductions. From the middle of this year we will be at a half-way stage in the term for which the tariff reductions take effect. There is an obligation in present circumstances, and a justification because of the British action, for this country to postpone further tariff reductions. The agreement provided for review procedures where it operates unfairly or inequitably or contrary to the terms or the spirit of it.  It is now time for a full-scale review.  Initially, when we accepted that position, we accepted it on the basis that it was an interim arrangement pending membership of the EEC.  A considerable period has elapsed.  While the negotiations and discussions in connection with the EEC membership may be accelerated this year the fact is that two major matters &mdash;the drop in the exports of cattle and <Col N="1893" /> the effect of the import deposit scheme being continued&mdash;entitle this country to request a full-scale review and afford us an opportunity of considering what action should or might be taken in respect of the situation which is developing.</P>
    <P>The effect of this Budget in raising the cost of living will not appear immediately.  In the usual tradition it is a case of taxes being imposed which will fall on the old reliables immediately after the Budget&mdash;there is a week's respite this time&mdash;but the inter-action and reactions of these price increases in respect of a wide variety of commodities must impinge on the very categories mentioned yesterday. There was great play made yesterday in the Budget speech of concern for the lower-paid and weaker sections of the community.  Comments have been made on this point in the press and elsewhere.  Every single individual which the Budget was designed to assist will be affected adversely by the increase to five per cent in turnover tax. The categories of persons least able to bear the increase will be affected. This was emphasised in the comments made and in the speech by Mr. Fogarty.  The argument has been brought forward on the basis of past experience that the people who are least able to bear the price increases will have to meet them to the same extent as the people who have done well in wage and salary negotiations. Mr. Fogarty said that if the income tax or turnover tax were increased the man who accepted a reasonable pay increase would have to pay just as much as the man whose increase was out of all proportion.  He said that such an increase would hit the just and unjust alike.</P>
    <P>On all the evidence, this is the wrong way to deal with the problem.  The shopkeepers and traders of the country are being used as tax-collectors.  Past experience in respect of turnover tax shows that it stimulated price rises. The action of the Government in 1964 led to wage rounds.  This followed the introduction of turnover tax.  The discussion in respect of wages and salaries in progress at that time was held because of the introduction of <Col N="1894" /> turnover tax.  This increase in turnover tax will add to the prices spiral.  It will inject into our economy the very things which were mentioned as unsuitable economically and financially and as those which should not be applied at present.  We have added to the projected 7½ per cent price rise another 2½ or 3 per cent as a minimum. All experience shows that the rise will be greater than that.</P>
    <P>This position was allowed to develop by reason of the Government's policy. It has been facilitated by the terms of this Budget.  We realise that this problem will take time to settle.  A prices and incomes policy would have to be operated not merely with goodwill but with the co-operation of the various interests.  The fact that no action has been taken in this Budget would appear to indicate that the Government have no policy to deal with this problem.  It would indicate that not only have they no policy but that they are allowing the recommendations made by the NIEC and other bodies to remain dormant.</P>
    <P>This cannot be achieved by having a multiplicity of bodies dealing with it. The first thing is to decide what is to be done and then to take action to deal with it.  It cannot be dealt with by a multiplicity of bodies such as the Labour Court, the Fair Trade Commission and this co-ordinating body that is recommended.  Those bodies have been acting and inter-acting on each other with no authority or sanction behind them effectively to deal with the situation.  This has resulted in the present serious economic position.</P>
    <P>The Government recognise in the Budget that some action had to be taken to compensate farmers for rising costs, to compensate pensioners and other retired persons.  The increase granted in respect of the beef subsidy, the milk subsidy, pensions, the increases in respect of retired State personnel to bring them up to the level of existing retired State and semi-State employees, all will be negatived by increases in prices and in the cost of living.  The Budget will mean in a very short time a substantial rise in consumer prices.  The NIEC's most recent report adverted to the prospects facing the economy and stated that the forecast <Col N="1895" /> of a deficit of £90 million rested on the assumption of a 14½ per cent rise in non-agricultural employees' incomes in 1970 compared with last year, some slackening in the increase in public capital and current expenditures and the fact that consumer prices would rise by about 7½ per cent.</P>
    <P>This situation, to which the NIEC referred, would in other countries need measures such as changes in hire purchase regulations, in interest rates, the availability of credit, and import controls. This Government are relying on one single regulator, credit restriction. This again is a blanket system to deal with it.  Credit restriction affects the just and unjust alike, as it were.  Credit restrictions have meant difficulties for those who want to build houses.  They have meant a full stop for many.  Credit restriction applies most unfairly to the smallest borrower, and less severely to the bigger institutions.  Nobody will suggest that insurance companies, large industrial and other concerns who want to build, buy or rent offices, will have any difficulty in getting credit, but the person who wants to buy a house under the Small Dwellings Acts, the person who is faced with the problem of a mortgage, will feel the pinch of credit restriction most severely.  Bank managers throughout the country, accordingly, have been instructed to operate a policy whose implementation has been left in their hands by the Government.  Of course it is the poorest individual citizens who feel the brunt. The same is true of the effect of the turnover tax.</P>
    <P>This, in our view, is the wrong way to deal with the economic situation.  If there is to be a tightening it should operate fairly and equitably over the entire area.  The Government's method of dealing with the economy at the present time is the method which was dismissed as being totally unsuitable by informed comment, by the NIEC, by people such as Mr. Fogarty.  It has been adopted by the Government because they regard it as a simple way out and because it makes no distinction as between the stronger and the weaker sections of the community.  It is no wonder, then, that there has been <Col N="1896" /> associated with this Government the stigma that their concern lies with those who have most rather than those whose needs are greatest.</P>
    <P>We are anxious to see a policy put into effect that will look after the older sections, the pensioners, those in need generally, the sections which we have repeatedly referred to as pensioners, the people on medical cards, the people whose needs are in no way catered for in this Budget.  But the medical card system under which a defective, deficient health service is operated is being continued.  The reliefs provided in this Budget are merely to redeem a promise given that the rise in rates as the result of health charges would not exceed 2s in the £.</P>
    <P>That is a reckless and an irresponsible way of dealing with a problem of this magnitude.  The real defect in this Budget is that it provides a system of taxation that will hit the weakest just as it hits the strongest, that will hit those who have been referred to so accurately in the address given by Mr. Fogarty to the trade union group&mdash; that those who have got the biggest wage and salary increases as well as those who got the least under this system will pay equally.  The Budget differentiates in no way between the weakest and the strongest.</P>
    <P>As far as the present dangerous position of the economy is concerned, there is no doubt that the action of the Government in this Budget is neither in line with the recommendations and advice given nor in the interests of the country as a whole.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of it that I feel bound to comment on.  It is the recent statement of the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries that he was looking for a sum of between £14 million and £20 million, and the subsequent rejoinder of the Minister for Finance that he could not give it.  This form of public bargaining between one Minister and another is, first of all, contrary to the collective responsibility of Ministers, who are supposed to act in a united fashion and, secondly, indicates a lack of cohesion.  In the course of his remarks, the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries said it was a reference to an earlier practice.  I do <Col N="1897" /> not know of any such earlier practice of this character.  The only conclusion one could come to is that there was an effort being made at compromise in order to secure some support in the by-elections then imminent.  This creates the impression that the Government are disunited in respect of matters that affect the economy and I am surprised the matter has not been the subject of some reference by the Taoiseach.  I look forward to some comment from the Taoiseach to the effect that, if it happened on this occasion, it is not approved of and is deprecated as a line of action for Ministers in the same Government.</P>
    <P>As far as the effects of the Budget are concerned, we believe the result will be to raise prices further.  It will not improve our competitiveness at a time when we should be aiming at more efficiency.  It will inflate still further the present dangerous inflationary situation.  It lacks any form of constructive economic or financial approach to the problems that beset the country.  It will generate still further the very things that every commentary that has been made suggests should not be generated&mdash;increases in prices, a weakening of the weaker sections, interference with our capacity to compete effectively and efficiently not merely with out competitors in the British market but with those on the continent of Europe&mdash;countries we will have to face if we become members of the EEC.</P>
    <P>The policy that has been adopted in relation to this Budget is contrary to every piece of informed advice that the Minister is being given from any quarter and it may well be that when the Budget is considered in retrospect and the results and the policy are apparent, the circumstances surrounding it will long be remembered.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>When asked during a radio interview for a quick comment on the additional taxation imposed in the Budget my first impression was that this was the Budget of a lazy man, a man who decided that he needed £20 million and that there was one lazy way in which to get that money.  The Minister simply said that since a turnover tax of 2½ per cent now produces <Col N="1898" /> about £22 million a year, he would double the tax this year and so produce the extra amount required.</P>
      <P>Again, I regret that the Minister is not able to be here today but he should be a little more careful about how he gets off a horse.  He has brought a rather frisky animal before the House and perhaps the damage which he suffered while getting off his horse will be very much less than the damage which his Party will suffer as a result of this Budget.</P>
      <P>In my opinion, the Minister is a competent and capable man who could have done much better.  From reading the text of his statement it would appear that, unlike some other Ministers, he did not depend entirely on advice.  The statement bears his own hallmark from the start.  This Budget is a rather poor effort.  When I asked the Taoiseach if the turnover tax applied to everything he told me that if I read the Guide to the Turnover Tax I would know to what it applied.  I did not then have a copy to hand but when one had been obtained for me I noticed that written in ink at the top of the cover were the words: &ldquo;Not now up to date&rdquo;.  Therefore, anybody wishing to know the exact position with regard to turnover tax will not be able to find out until new booklets are issued.</P>
      <P>I presume the tax applies to practically everything but the following exemptions are set out in the Guide to the Turnover Tax:</P>
      <P>Sales of goods for delivery abroad.</P>
      <P>The exports comprise most of that.</P>
      <P>Sales by farmers and fishermen of their own produce otherwise than in connection with the carrying on of the business of a shop or similar retail business.  Sales of live animals otherwise than in connection with the carrying on of the business of a shop or similar retail business.</P>
      <P>All sales of animal feeding stuffs and veterinary supplies in general use in large quantities by farmers for the purposes of their occupation.</P>
      <P>There is nothing about medicines for humans.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sales to the value of £1 or over of all other materials and substances, equipment, plant and machinery in <Col N="1899" /> general use by farmers and fishermen. This exemption does not apply to sales of hydrocarbon oils for domestic use or for road transport or to sales of motor vehicles designed for the conveyance of persons by road...</P>
    <P>There is provision for banking and insurance services as well as for services given in return for wages and salaries within the scope of Schedule E of the Income Tax Act, 1918.  There is also provision for services provided for agricultural, industrial or commercial purposes.  There is provision for services provided by the State and by local authorities as well as by hospitals, nursing homes and similar establishments.  Also mentioned in this booklet are building, the installation of heating, lighting and so on; the provision of transport&mdash;this exemption covers only the carriage of persons or goods.  There is also mentioned letting of houses and accommodation.  Moneylending is mentioned otherwise than in connection with hire purchase or credit sale restrictions.  I wonder if unlicensed moneylending is included in that.  Also, in relation to services, funeral undertakings and advertising are listed.</P>
    <P>In effect, this means that turnover tax goes on everything except what I have mentioned.  The very poor with only £1 per week to spend and who now because of the system of turnover tax get only 19/6 worth for their £ will as a result of the Budget get 19/- for the same £.  I do not know whether it was the Minister for Finance himself who decided this was the way to deal with the matter or whether, having been assailed on all sides by people who were giving him advice, he decided to take the easy way out.  It is difficult to understand how an intelligent and competent man would make such a poor attempt in relation to taxation.  Where now is the capital gains tax about which he talked so much during the year?  What about the taxes on luxuries which he talked about on the 16th March, 1969 when during a tearful appearance on television he told us that the country was going down the drain? What saved the country at that particular <Col N="1900" /> time was the decision of the Taoiseach to have a general election. This decision had an amazing effect. The drain down which the country had been going was blocked at least until the election was over.</P>
    <P>Last year it was suggested that there would be a mini-budget during the year and I am convinced that that mini-budget would have been introduced if it had not been that we in the Labour Party did not move the writ and we, of course, suffered severely because of our South-West by-election.  If we had moved the writ with the indecent haste with which writs have since been moved we would have won the seat and a mini-budget would have been introduced. That is my personal opinion.</P>
    <P>It has been said by certain Government speakers already that this Budget will not have any effect on prices but I have here a telegram sent to the Leader of my Party yesterday evening by the Secretary of RGDATA which reads:</P>
    <P>Protest strongest possible terms at increased additional 2½ per cent turnover tax particularly on foodstuffs. Anticipate strong reaction from our members throughout the country.  Use your good offices to protest.</P>
    <P>That is the start of it.  The Minister and the Government can be assured it is only the start of it, because this will snowball.  We remember when the turnover tax was being debated in 1963 the long and heated arguments that took place here, and we remember the question of counting who would vote and who would not vote.  Indeed, I was rather amused to hear yesterday evening one gentleman here protesting that it was a very good Budget and that the turnover tax would do no harm.  He is one man in this House who has reason to thank God that the turnover tax was introduced because if it were not I do not think he would be here. He was looked after very well for his help, but for which the Government could have fallen that night.  Another man was not so appreciated by Fianna Fáil for his assistance and he is no longer with us.</P>
    <P>The turnover tax was introduced as a new system.  At one period there were naive people in this House, many <Col N="1901" /> backbenchers of Fianna Fáil, who took part in the debate, and but for the fact that I do not want to delay the House when I know many other Deputies are anxious to participate, it would give me great pleasure to quote the statements of some of these people who felt or claimed to feel that a turnover tax of 2½ per cent would in some peculiar way replace all other taxes and eventually leave us in the happy position that the State could be carried on a 2½ per cent turnover tax.</P>
    <P>We said from those benches that the 2½ per cent tax had one great weakness: it was too easy to manipulate. The temptation, when money was needed without much effort except to burden people who had not much money, was to increase the turnover tax, double it and double it again. Eventually if this sort of thing is allowed to continue, instead of an unfortunate poor person paying £1 across the counter and getting 19s worth of goods, as he will from 1st May, he will be paying the £1 across and getting a shillings worth of goods, because the Government will be taking 19s. This is perhaps an exaggerated view of it but it could happen.</P>
    <P>When the turnover tax was originally introduced, one unfortunate old chap told me he had been working on an estate for many years off and on.  His cards which should have been stamped were not stamped and he finished up with the magnificent sum of £2 per week pension from his employer.  He said: &ldquo;I will be paying tax at the same rate as the man who formerly employed me, a man who owns a castle and thousands of acres of land.&rdquo;  That was quite true.  While he would not be paying the same amount he would be paying on each £1 exactly the same amount as the man who was very wealthy.</P>
    <P>I was rather interested in the reference made in the Minister's Financial Statement yesterday to the added value tax.  I suppose we can expect that next year.  As it lends itself very well to decimal currency I imagine he will wait until decimal currency is introduced, and he will then be able to do another bit of fiddling around giving the impression he is not doing much <Col N="1902" /> damage, but we know what is being done.</P>
    <P>There is another rather peculiar aspect of this turnover tax.  Last time, when the turnover tax was a small amount and the amount payable was a fraction of a penny, the retailer because the farthing had gone tended to charge a halfpenny, and when the halfpenny went he tended to charge a penny.  When the penny goes what will the turnover tax be on a small amount? Will the person buying small items not be charged turnover tax at whatever is the least amount the coinage covers?  Therefore he will be paying very much more than he should, and there is not a thing he can do about it, because that is the way this tax is designed.</P>
    <P>In broad terms I suppose a Budget should do three things: it should look after the housekeeping accounts of the Government and the Civil Service; it should operate as a social instrument and re-distribute income; and it should operate as an economic instrument in regulating the level of demand and hence the level of employment.  One of the remarkable things about this Budget is that the Minister does not seem to have any great interest in employment, except when he was warning workers that if they looked for large increases in wages this would cause unemployment.  I do not know whether the Taoiseach or the Minister was responsible for this 7 per cent ceiling the Taoiseach talked about some months ago.  That a responsible Minister of Government should come into Parliament saying there should not be a greater increase this year in income than 7 per cent, while at the same time he must have been aware that increases up to 23 per cent had been granted a few weeks before he made the statement, showed how much out of touch with reality the Government appear to be.  In addition, the Minister now appears to be trying to ride two horses. While agreeing on one side that increases have been granted and are being granted he attempts&mdash;this is mentioned in the course of his statement&mdash;to take back from the workers the increases which they have got.</P>
    <P>The twelfth round is in process of <Col N="1903" /> being negotiated over the last few months.  Speaking as a trade union official who has day-to-day association with these wages negotiations I can say we have been attempting to get reasonable compensation for the people we represent, particularly lowly paid workers&mdash;and in my book any man who is attempting to rear a family on £20 a week or less is in the category of a lowly paid worker.  As a result of the increased turnover tax there will be an increase in the workers' outgoings of at least 3 per cent.  I am being very generour in this because I believe, as Deputy Dr. O'Donovan said, it could be much closer to 5 per cent or 6 per cent, but allowing that the machinery for collecting it is there and that there will not be as much effort involved as the last time, let us say there will be a 3 per cent increase in prices as a result of this additional turnover tax.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister consider that these people, hard-headed men who have nothing to sell but their labour, will agree to accept the same increase now as they were prepared to accept before their outgoings were increased by 3 per cent or their net income was reduced by 3 per cent?  The Minister may consider this is a very clever move, but I honestly believe he has caused trouble not alone for himself but for the workers and employers.  He has caused trouble for industry which, instead of cooling down industrial disputes, will make the matter a great deal worse.</P>
    <P>Again the Minister has referred to the question whether or not there can be some system of bringing up the wages of lowly paid workers.  Deputy Cosgrave also referred to this this morning.  The whole problem of the lowly paid worker, which must be considered by everybody who has any sort of Christian principles at all, has got to come to the forefront.  I believe it is necessary for the Government to establish a national minimum wage but they have not attempted to do that here.  Certain tax remissions are being given to single people earning under £10 a week but this will only help the lower paid worker in a very small way and the Minister should have faced that fact <Col N="1904" /> when he was framing his Budget.</P>
    <P>I shall repeat the case of the man&mdash; I have repeated it often without any success but I shall try again&mdash;who drives 30 or 40 miles to the building site where he is working.  He starts off at 6.30 or 7 o'clock in the morning and arrives at the site as near 8 o'clock as he can make it.  He works there very hard all day and if there is any overtime he works as long as there is enough light before travelling the 30 or 40 miles home.  He has to pay tax and insurance on his car.  He has to buy petrol and he has to pay for repairs and running costs.  He arrives home weary at 9 or 10 o'clock at night on five or even six days of the week and even though we hear all this talk about leisure time he does not have any time with his family.  At the end of the week he gets £18 or £20.  His employer takes 13s 10d for his insurance stamp and 1s 3d for his wet time card.  If he is lucky his income tax will only amount to £2 10s a week, which will bring his £18 down to less than £15. He will have to pay £2 a week rent for his house and if rates are not collected he may have to add an extra £1 during the year which will bring his £15 down to £12.  He has to pay £2 10s income tax and the Minister thinks he is doing a great thing by giving him a couple of shillings a year.  These people are not entitled to the general reduction for low income people because their gross wages may amount to £18 or £20 a week.</P>
    <P>I wonder if any effort is being made by the State to try to help those people who are helping themselves.  These people could stay at home and go to the labour exchange and draw a certain amount of money.  Some people try to give the impression that that is what most workers like to do but instead they travel 50, 60 or 100 miles to work in order to keep their families in some kind of comfort.  If they apply to the local authority for a medical card in order to get treatment for their family they are told: &ldquo;Your gross income is £18 or £20 a week; we are very sorry you are not in the lower income group.&rdquo; I thought the Minister would make some effort to try to straighten things up, but he has made no effort at all. He has simply applied, as I say, the <Col N="1905" /> lazy man's taxation system and the provision for remission of income tax has not been given.  An employer who travels the same distance to work at a much later hour in the day is assumed to be using his car in the course of his employment and he, therefore, gets tax relief.  The Minister showed cognisance of that.  Why can no allowance be given to the worker?  Why cannot a worker be allowed tax relief if he is working far away from home and has to go out and buy his lunch when a businessman can take all his friends out for a business lunch and claim tax relief on it? Surely, there is something wrong with the system which allows this sort of thing to go on.</P>
    <P>It is very nice for the Government party to be able to say: &ldquo;Oh, we have given far more in social welfare benefits than was given by the last inter-Party Government.&rdquo;  I am quite sure I shall hear that again and again from Fianna Fáil Deputies.  A Deputy talked about 10d per week when, in fact, he should have been talking about 10d per day. The increase which has been given this year is not as generous as the one given last year.  Again, I am intrigued by the phraseology used by the Minister. At page 41 of his brief he said:</P>
    <P>A genuine and widespread feeling of social concern is the hallmark of a humane and civilised society.</P>
    <P>We all subscribe to that view.  If I have read the Minister's brief correctly unemployment and disability benefit is 17s for one person, whereas last year where a married couple was involved it was 10s each and that, according to the way I read it, makes it 3s less than was given last year.  I am quite sure someone in Fianna Fáil will correct me if I am wrong, but that appears to be the position from the Minister's brief.  The insured person will get 17s, adult dependent relatives will get nothing but children who got nothing last year or the year before are going to be given 2s 6d.  If one were to give a child 2s 6d he would look at one as though you were a freak because 2s 6d goes nowhere these days.  Widows' contributory pensions are to be increased by 15s and 12s 6d where appropriate to £4 10s and the widows' non-contributory <Col N="1906" /> pension is to be increased by 11s 6d to £4 5s.  I assume the same thing will happen here as usually happens when an increase is given, the widows lose on the swings what they gain on the roundabouts and will probably finish up with less than they had. I recently discovered that the introduction last year of a scheme whereby widows of Civil Service pensioners, who had died before they had qualified for the pension, were given half the pension, the non-contributory pension was affected and the result was that they finished up with an increase of only a couple of shillings a week instead of the increase of £4 or £5 a week which they had been led to believe they would get.  The scheme of assistance for deserted wives is long overdue. I am glad that at last something is being done about it.  I am sure it will be appreciated.  Many of us have been making a case for it for a number of years.  It is regrettable that it should be necessary in this State to introduce such a scheme.  I hope it will be administered with commonsense and that we will not have the difficulty referred to here some years ago in regard to proving the death of a man who had deserted his wife.  I remember former Deputy James Dillon bringing up one of these cases and the Minister told him that although the man was 32 years absent it could be proved that he was still alive.  Apparently there was more money spent on proving that he was alive than on giving assistance to the unfortunate woman he had left 32 years earlier.  I do not know what the regulations will be but I will be very interested to know.</P>
    <P>There is something on which I have made a case here on numerous occasions and I am sorry to say that it does not appear to have been accepted by the Government.  I hope it will not be too long until it is.  It is the question of what I choose to call disability assistance.  If a man is drawing unemployment benefit and his right to it ceases, he can draw unemployment assistance or the dole.  If, one the other hand, he is ill and, because of the fact that his cards have not been stamped by an unscrupulous employer &mdash;and this has become very common <Col N="1907" /> in this country&mdash;or if he has less than 156 stamps at the end of the period for which he has been on disability benefit, even though he may have a wife and family depending on him, his right to disability benefit ceases after one year and the result is that he is destitute.</P>
    <P>A number of these people have come to me and I have approached local authorities in an effort to get a few pounds from the rates to help out these people.  I feel the responsibility should be on the State to introduce a disability assistance system.  It would operate exactly as unemployment assistance.  There is no reason why it should not be introduced except that nobody has yet taken time to investigate this.  As recently as a week ago I had representations made by a woman whose husband had been working in England.  Whether his cards were stamped or not, they cannot now be found.  He came home here, qualified for benefit for a period, and now, although he is seriously ill, he cannot draw any more disability benefit.  She and her six children were, when she wrote to me, hungry, to use her own words.  This is the sort of thing which should not be allowed to continue. The answer is obvious and I would ask the Government to do something about it.</P>
    <P>I am aware that the Government are considering a system whereby if an insured worker has not his card stamped, even though he paid for it, the situation will be considered in the same way as occupational injuries: that the person will be paid and the employer can then be sued.  This is a good idea.  The onus should not be on an unfortunate working man who, through no fault of his own, through the action of a dishonest employer, is left without benefit.  I would ask that this be considered and brought into operation fairly quickly.  It would solve half the problem, but only half, because there are others who are disqualified for other reasons.  This is something that would be very welcome and there is no reason why it should not be attended to.</P>
    <P>I am also interested in the scheme <Col N="1908" /> which was introduced the year before last and extended last year whereby an allowance is paid to a person who looks after incapacitated pensioners at home.  This has now been extended to cover necessitous persons over 70 years of age whether they are pensioners or not.  I am interested to know to whom this applies.  I do not know of any necessitous persons over 70 years of age who do not apply for the pension. Maybe there are some in the country but if they are necessitous and they do not apply for an old age pension I do not think they will apply for this allowance either.  This would appear to be one of these things which have been put in to make it look nice but which does not mean a damn thing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be very glad to hear the Deputy's contribution later on.  Perhaps he will explain.  I assume it is the lady in Balbriggan.</P>
      <P>There is a very vague reference here. It says:</P>
      <P>New insurance schemes for limited retirement pensions, at age 65, invalidity pensions and death grants will be brought into operation on 1 October next.</P>
      <P>What is meant by that?  Surely we should have got from the Minister or from the Minister for Social Welfare some indication as to what exactly was meant by that?  I am not of a suspicious nature but at the same time I believe that it is always useful to look what appears to be a gift horse in the mouth.  I am under the impression that this is one of the things that appear to be a gift horse and that may turn out to be worth little or nothing.  On a number of occasions I attempted to get the Minister of Social Welfare, who is very courteous gentleman and always gives plenty of information, to give me some idea of what was happening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unfortunately he did not have the information or he felt it was something that would be revealed in the Budget. All that has been revealed in the Budget is what I have read out, and it does not explain anything.  I would <Col N="1909" /> suggest that an effort be made by somebody to explain exactly what is meant by this because, if it is what I think it is, it will not be very welcome in the country.</P>
    <P>We come now to the question of children's allowances.  Last year, in a discussion with the Minister for Industry and Commerce on television, I commented that children's allowances would be included under the income tax code.  He did not say anything but subsequently the Minister for Finance here in the House said that this was wrong and that it was unfair to take advantage of the Minister.  I do not know why he felt he should not have known.  He said that it was not so.  Here it says, referring to the increases this year:</P>
    <P>As with the increases granted last year, the increases now proposed will be recovered in part from persons paying income tax by reducing the allowance under the Income Tax Acts for each child who benefits from the increase.</P>
    <P>That is clear enough for anybody.  It says:</P>
    <P>Under the general scheme of children's allowances, the present allowance is 40 shillings a month for each qualified child after the first two.  This allowance will be increased by five shillings in respect of each such child with effect from 1st October, 1970.  The present allowances of ten shillings for the first qualified child and 30 shillings for the second qualified child remain unchanged.</P>
    <P>All that is wrong with that is that we are still paying the lowest amount of children's allowance possible.  My objection to income tax on children's allowancess is not because I feel that the wealthy people will have the money taken off them but because I feel that the wealthy people should not be entitled to children's allowances at all. We are very much opposed, and I personally am opposed, to means tests but it annoys me to hear the extremely wealthy talking about putting their children's allowances into the purchase of luxury goods or depositing <Col N="1910" /> the money in the post office so that when the child reaches 21 he will not even notice the addition of this amount to the money he will already have coming to him.</P>
    <P>It is a bit ridiculous when on the other side we see unfortunate people waiting with bated breath for the day when the children's allowances will be paid so that they can buy food or pay their rent to the rate collector who is usually waiting around the corner for it, or, perhaps, recover their books from the unlicensed money lender who wants his money quickly.  The Minister should consider this whole question of children's allowances again.  If those who do not need the money did not get it those who do need it could get very much more.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see that an extra effort is being made in regard to those who are making the care of the aged their responsibility.  This is something which should be dealt with in a bigger way by the State because throughout the country, and particularly in this city, there is a big number of old people who, to use their own expression, worked their fingers to the bone to rear families who, when they grow up and marry, go away and feel they have not responsibility for those aged persons.  Perhaps they have their own responsibilities; God help some of them because they may find it difficult enough to look after their families and their own responsibilities, but there are far too many who apparently feel that aged parents should not be their responsibility.</P>
    <P>There is nothing so touching as to talk to some of these old people who because of economic circumstances, because they had not enough money, to make ends meet from one week to another, find themselves in what are not now called county homes but which, in effect, are what they are. These are decent people who cannot exist because they do not get enough money.  The galling thing about it is that when they go into these homes the cost of their upkeep may be two or three times what would have sufficed to keep them in reasonable comfort in their original homes.  I do not know where all this is going to end.  As we <Col N="1911" /> are setting up so many commissions it might be a good idea if a commission were set up to go into this problem and see if these unfortunate decent people who want to stay at home could be enabled to stay at home and not be thrown into the county homes where they will have poor enough comfort no matter how well looked after they may be.  Certainly, they miss the friends with whom they associated for many years and, indeed, their biggest hardship is loneliness.  I have met many of these people because I deal with some of the workers in some of these places and when I go to these homes I invariably have a chat with a few of these people.  The eagerness with which they greet people who are prepared to talk to them is evidence that they are not happy in their environment despite all that has been done for them by the people who look after them, whether they are lay or clerical.  A small amount of money would work wonders for them.</P>
    <P>The Minister said something in his speech with which I am entirely dissatisfied. He said, with reference to the question of increases in old age pensions, that &ldquo;the increases are well above what would be needed to offset the rise in living costs and so they should give the old age pensioners a modest improvement in real terms in their standard of living&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Perhaps somebody who knows more about this than I do would explain how, if a working man requires an extra £3, £4 or £5 to keep himself and his family in frugal comfort it can be suggested that another person who is older is being more than compensated by a payment of 17/-, 8/6 for himself and 8/6 for his wife.  That is a fair question.  I should like to know how the Minister makes out that this can more than compensate for the rise in the cost of living.  Does he feel that the small increases paid to them over the years have reduced them to the level of existing on bread and spread and, therefore, they do not have to worry about the additional increases in the price of meat, butter and so on and particularly the increases which will result from the increase in the turnover <Col N="1912" /> tax?</P>
    <P>I welcome the new provision regarding free travel.  It was stupid to have an arrangement whereby the man could have free travel but the wife although she was drawing a pension was not allowed it.  An appeal in this regard was made by people from all sides of the House and I am glad the Minister has agreed to the request.</P>
    <P>The increase in public service pensions is also welcome but I feel that parity should be given in this regard. Eventually it will have to be.  For a number of years an appeal has been made in this regard by one organised body, the State service pensioners.  Dr. Ryan, when Minister for Finance, promised parity and subsequently made a small effort to do so by bringing them forward two years.  A few weeks ago the Minister for Finance promised it again.  He said he was the first to promise it but I do not care who was first or who was second I would just like to see it put into effect.  He has done it partly by bringing them up to 1968 and it should now be possible to go the whole way.  It seems very unfair that a man or woman who is retiring now and who may have less service may have twice as much as a pensioner who retired earlier with longer service.</P>
    <P>There was reference also in the Minister's speech to something with which I am not quite in agreement, the question of the new retirement scheme for temporary full-time State employees who hitherto have not been pensionable.  The Minister said: &ldquo;Lump sums will be paid on the same basis as applies to established staff. The pensions will vary with the amount of social welfare benefits payable in each case.&rdquo;  As a representative of one of the trade unions negotiating this matter&mdash;and this has not been finalised&mdash;I regret to see that a slightly garbled version comes before the House.  My understanding is that the pensions will not vary with the amount of social welfare benefits payable. There was a reference to the social welfare benefits payable but not this reference.  If this is correct then there is not complete understanding between the negotiating parties.  The only other trouble about it is that it does not appear to be made clear <Col N="1913" /> who is going to benefit.  Many people consider themselves to be full-time employees of the State and I am referring particularly to auxiliary postmen. I should be glad to find out whether they are in or not.  They may only work four or five hours a day but they are postmen.  As I said, it is rather unfortunate that the reference was made in the way it was.</P>
    <P>Itinerants were also referred to and, of course, everybody is terribly sympathetic but very few want to do anything about the problem.  All the subsidies and grants in the world can achieve very little without goodwill. First of all, the question of employment for them should be considered because that is more important than the question of housing.  There is no point in putting an itinerant into a house and saying: &ldquo;There you are, now you are all right&rdquo; and then at the end of the week the rent collector comes to collect £2 which the itinerant has not got and has no hope of getting. By all means let us house them because they are the people against whom apartheid has been practised but if we are going to house them we must ensure that they will have an income.  There is no sense in giving them a few shillings in unemployment assistance or saying that they can carry on their original calling&mdash;perhaps, calling is not the correct term&mdash;either of begging or of going around buying scrap and piling it outside the front door.  This is the sort of thing that will mark them out as different and antagonise their neighbours and cause trouble.  I know a number of them who were housed and got jobs.  The youngsters are growing up to be fine children and the people themselves are showing that they are prepared to avail of facilities which are given to them.  However, let us not have a system of just putting them into a house and saying, in effect, &ldquo;Now you are all right&rdquo; because that just will not work.</P>
    <P>Conservation year has been mentioned. I do not want to dwell at length on the subject.  I am rather interested in the special allocation of £100,000 most of which, it appears, will be spent at Gartan Lough in County Donegal. <Col N="1914" /> It must be great to have a Minister such as Deputy Blaney in a constituency. One thing the Minister for Finance might have done in this regard concerns the major pollution of our rivers by industrial effluent, household refuse and sewage.  Many towns still dump sewage straight into rivers and it ends up on our beaches. The same can be said of industrial effluent.  When will we find some system of disposal of household waste and industrial effluent other than piping it expensively over long distances? Surely there must be another way? Some effort should be made in this connection.  If portion of the money being spent to ease the situation were diverted towards experimenting to discover suitable new systems of waste disposal, it might prove a great boon because, eventually, the answer to this problem must come.</P>
    <P>The amount of additional taxation, starting with the turnover tax, is the big talking point in this Budget.  There is another matter about which I feel particularly sore.  At the end of the year, the Minister had almost a balanced Budget&mdash;excluding certain increases which have to come into operation.  I am involved in wage negotiations.  Suppose you get an increase of £3 a week for a worker.  That £3 becomes £1 19s after taxation.  Forestry workers call that taxation deduction &ldquo;Charlie's bite.&rdquo;  Seven shillings in the £ disappears before the worker gets the increase. Something must be done about this sort of thing.  The employer will say: &ldquo;I am paying out this money and I do not care where it goes.  Why should I have to do this?&rdquo; One has to try to show him that, because the State will take some of this money away, you want more from him.  I am the first to admit that money must be found.  The State cannot run unless it has money. The whole argument is that the money is being taken from the wrong people.</P>
    <P>Because of Figures I shall give later on, I maintain there was a very big scope to prevent purchase abroad by wealthy people of materials, of machinery, which they did not require.  If they did require them, they should have been made to pay for them.  It is ridiculous to allege that the balance of <Col N="1915" /> payments was adversely affected by the purchase of foreign consumer goods with increased wages.  I probably go into more working-class homes throughout the country than anybody else here&mdash;not alone in my constituency but elsewhere as well.  Every time there is a wage increase, the woman of the house can show me bills and she is hoping that the increase will come quickly to enable her to pay them.  Her husband has some explaining to do about the tax deduction of 7/- in every £ from the increase.  Some women find it difficult to understand that the State must get almost as much as they get from the pay packet.  The husband will not get very much more than the price of an extra pint to celebrate &mdash;particularly if it goes up, as it must, with the 2½ per cent turnover tax increase. This whole thing is a vicious circle.  Along with the general increase in turnover tax, our workers are paying a lot more than their share in income tax.  I thought the Minister for Finance was the man to deal with this matter but apparently he had neither the time nor the inclination to tackle this problem.</P>
    <P>Our workers have not forgotten that, from the first week of this year, they have had to pay an extra 1s 10d per week for their stamps.  Offsetting it in any way one likes against tax remissions referred to here, it still remains money taken from them without a comparable increase in their incomes.  Until some years ago, social insurance was divided, roughly, between one-third employers' contribution, one-third workers' contribution and one-third State contribution.  The then Minister for Finance said the State did not propose to increase its share and that future increases must be carried by the employer and employee.  Instead of having to pay, roughly, 1s 6d or 1s 4d, they must now pay 1s 10d because the State welshed on its side of the bargain. The present position is no credit to the State and something should be done without delay to rectify it.</P>
    <P>We have heard about a prices and incomes policy.  Every time I hear a Government spokesman on this topic I become uneasy that what he has in <Col N="1916" /> mind is a type of wages standstill rather than a prices and incomes policy.  On and off, particularly coming to the time of a by-election, the Minister for Industry and Commerce may say that the price of, for instance, drink may not be increased.  However, there does not appear to be any prices policy in the Department because, over the years, the prices body has been completely inoperative.  I remember a hullabaloo some years ago about an investigation that was to take place into the cost of certain commodities; that died down.  I think the price of the pint was looked into; apparently the State considered it important.  Meat was supposed to be the next on the list.  Apparently, the price of meat was not investigated. Therefore, even this week, we have a proposal being considered to increase the price of meat by 6d per 1b.</P>

      <P>The farmers have been told they will get something.  The money for the farmers all seems to be going in the one direction.  Some of the southern Deputies will not be too happy about this but they know it is the truth. The farmers generally do not appear to be getting very much of what is being given.  Before the by-elections, the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, Deputy Blaney, with his customary cuteness, decided to meet the NFA. After many hours discussion with him &mdash;they thought he was a very nice man &mdash;the farmers felt that they had satisfied him that they needed £20 million. I myself was interested in the phraseology the Minister, Deputy Blaney, used.  He said: &ldquo;Yes, that is so.&rdquo; They convinced him it was necessary to provide £20 million.</P>

      <P>Some of the farmers were amazed at the ease with which they had convinced the Minister.  They said the Minister was satisfied that they had been harshly treated.  They felt he was going to make amends.  I was very interested in the phraseology he used.  The word the Minister used was that he was going to &ldquo;impress&rdquo; on the Minister for Finance the <Col N="1917" /> necessity for a boost of £20 million. The Minister did not say the farmers would get £20 million but that he would &ldquo;impress&rdquo; on the Minister for Finance the need for £20 million. Eventually the Minister said he would settle for £14 million.  The Minister for Finance, not being in the same particular section of the Fianna Fáil Party as the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, and feeling that this might be a step which would have reactions at a later stage when other things happened, decided to step in quickly.  The Minister for Finance said he was not going to give anything like £20 million.  In fact, he was prepared to settle for about £10 million.  I am not surprised at the reaction of the farmers at discovering that the £10 million became £5 million.  The farmers feel they have been misled.  If the farmers felt that they would get £10 million, £14 million or £20 million from the present Government they deserve to be misled.</P>
      <P>In the debate on agriculture I commented that my biggest complaint about the way agriculture was run was that we seemed to have a Department hell-bent on increasing production of things which we cannot sell. They do not appear to be able to find markets for commodities other than those which are heavily subsidised.  If industry attempted anything like this there would be severe criticism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand the economics of farming. The Taoiseach pointed out to Deputy Corish that unless you have the cattle you cannot have beef.  For beef production there must be a certain amount of milk production.  We should be able to do something about this. Reference has been made to what will happen when we get into the EEC. We cannot sell milk products in the EEC.  Unless things have changed, the amount of beef required in the EEC, in addition to what they have at present, is only that amount required for Southern Italy where there was a shortfall of nine per cent recently.  The Italians do not eat the beef we produce. We would have to change our whole system of beef production.  The politicians in favour of entry to the <Col N="1918" /> EEC say &ldquo;We will be in the EEC in two years time and the farmers will not need to get up at all them.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>The EEC offers us nothing from the point of view of agriculture. We do not claim to know as much about it as the experts who have gone to Europe several times.  Some of us have been to Europe four or five times. From the discussions that have taken place and the information freely given by EEC personnel it would appear that we have nothing which they want. Wheat is a typical example.  I predict that we will have a bumper crop of wheat this year.  If we do not have fine weather it will be serious for the farmers.  France is producing so much wheat in excess of what is required in the EEC that it takes almost the entire agricultural fund to subsidise it.  It is being sold&mdash;like out butter which is practically being given away&mdash;to Red China.  It is no wonder that General de Gaulle was so anxious to ensure that there should not be strained relations between France and China.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this country we are not told these things.  It is unfair that we should have to find them out for ourselves.  Irish farmers are entitled to know the full facts.  They are not being told that because of the tremendous over-production of milk and milk products a system of subsidy for slaughtering cows has been instituted.  That is better than the Fianna Fáil policy of slaughtering calves.  The EEC now propose to slaughter cows and pay a subsidy for slaughtering them.  This scheme is in operation.  No Irish herd-owner would like to be told that he would be all right in the EEC where he would get a subsidy for slaughtering the best cows in his herd.  One cannot continue to ignore this sort of thing and hope it will never be found out.  I do not think Ireland will ever be in the EEC.  In Britain, feeling is hardening against it.  The odds are five to three against, according to the man-in-the-street. The man-in-the-street is important and it is amazing what he can find out eventually.  It is stupid <Col N="1919" /> to talk about Ireland going in if Britain does not go in.  If Britain goes in, we must go in too.  It is no answer to our economic ills to tell us that we will be grand when membership of the EEC becomes a reality.</P>
    <P>Deputy Treacy had a few questions yesterday and has some today about industry.  His questions indicate what is likely to happen.  Some of the industrialists in the EEC told me they felt they would be able to supply this country with what they were not able to sell otherwise.</P>
    <P>They were running their factories for 12 months but had a market for only eight months production.  Our industries will suffer heavily if this happens.  At present industry is absorbing only the number of persons leaving agriculture.</P>
    <P>According to a reply given to a Parliamentary Question yesterday, in 1959-60, 8,000 workers left agriculture and 3,000 more were employed in non-agricultural work.  That is a net loss of 5,000 jobs.  In 1960-61, 10,000 left agriculture and 8,000 more were employed in industry, a loss of 2,000 jobs.  In 1961-62, 9,000 left agriculture and there were 16,000 more employed in industry, an additional 7,000 jobs.</P>
    <P>At that stage, one would be inclined to say we are away with it.  In 1962-63, 8,000 left agriculture and 14,000 more were employed in industry, a matter of 6,000 extra jobs.  In the following year 9,000 left agriculture and 14,000 more were employed in industry, 5,000 additional jobs.  In 1964-65, 14,000 left agriculture and 12,000 more found work in industry, a loss of 2,000 jobs. In 1965-66, 6,000 left agriculture&mdash;I do not know how it came down to that figure&mdash;and there were 3,000 extra jobs in industry, a loss of 3,000 jobs.  In 1967-68, 9,000 left agriculture and 11,000 more found jobs in industry, an additional 2,000 jobs.  In 1968-69, 12,000 left agriculture and 16,000 more became employed in non-agricultural work, an additional 4,000 jobs.</P>
    <P>According to comments made in the EEC recently, it appears they think there is no future in Irish agriculture and there was some talk about the provision of additional industries.  The <Col N="1920" /> Minister for Lands recently referred to working farmers, farmers who work in industry and at the same time work their farms, and said that is the future for agriculture in this country.  Where are we going?</P>
    <P>The Financial Statement contained no plan, good, bad or indifferent, in regard to the creation of further employment. Not the slightest effort has been made.  We have promises. Recently in Limerick&mdash;why in Limerick at this time I do not know&mdash;it was said there would be the biggest industry ever started in this country.  Then it was forgotten.  It reminded me of the Minister for Industry and Commerce coming home from Canada before the last general election, waving his bag and telling us he had got four new industries.  Then the election campaign began and by some magic the four became 44.  I have been trying to trace them in the meantime and I have not been able to find even the four.</P>

      <P>It is rather alarming when a responsible Minister can make a statement like that and then simply forget about it.  That is what he has done.  In this Budget we are making more trouble for ourselves.  The facts and figures which we have been given prove simply that this state of affairs cannot continue.  If we are to do anything to try to get out of our present situation there has got to be a genuine effort by the Government.  One of our biggest troubles, as the NIEC have said, has been our disappointingly low rate of efficiency during the last year. This is very true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While all the talk has been going on about our balance of payments deficit, it is true to say that it worsened from £22 million in 1968 to approximately £60 million in 1969, and we are told that this year it will be £90 million.  Will somebody please tell me what the Minister for Finance has done to try to remedy this position?  Does he honestly believe the turnover tax which, as I have said, affects mainly the spending power of small people&mdash;the bigger people do not mind&mdash;will remedy the situation? To somebody buying a <Col N="1921" /> £2,000 car, if the cost goes up to £2,200, it does not matter so much, but to a man buying a £20 bicycle if he has to pay £20 10s, it is a hardship.  Telling the banks to restrict credit affects only the small person.  We always find that it is the small fellow who gets caught.</P>
    <P>I had a visit from a person a few nights ago who told me a harrowing story.  A man had a small shop.  He married.  They had no family.  He died. His widow carried on the shop.  She made just enough to live on.  After a couple of years she married a widower with a family.  The man was working. She ran the shop.  She kept no accounts.  She opened a bank account and in addition to the small takings from the shop she lodged the proportion of his wages her husband gave her.  Then the turnover tax people came and said: &ldquo;You owe us a lot of money&rdquo;.  She then got an accountant who went into the figures and although there was no evidence whatever of the amount of money she made, apart from the bank account which had grown not because of her shop takings but because her husband had been giving her a substantial proportion of his wages, she had to pay more than £250 turnover tax.  She paid but she complained.  She has got a further bill for £250 turnover tax and the husband has been told that he must not have been disclosing his full wages. Though he had been paying income tax for years he has got a bill for £50.</P>
    <P>These people are as honest as the day is long and have worked hard all their lives.  It is evident that the Government are determined to put such people out of existence.  After paying the first £250 and whatever other outgoings there are, there is not enough money left in that household to pay the balance.  The good lady said to me that the stock in the shop is not worth £40, that if the turnover tax people insist on the payment of the balance all she can do is to sell the shop and go into digs.  I do not think the State ever intended that this tax should be imposed in this way.  Therefore, its administration must be looked at.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1922" /> I ask the Minister for Finance to appreciate that sixpence in the £ was bad enough.  If he insists on pouncing on all small businesses as he did in this case he has got to think again. He should make every effort to facilitate people like the woman I have been speaking of.  If they owe tax he should allow them to pay it over a period and if they cannot pay it at all they should not be pressurised into paying it.</P>
    <P>There is a document which we dug out recently which makes interesting reading.  It states that the balance of payments position worsened from £22 million in 1968 to approximately £60 million in 1969; that this was caused by an increase of £93 million in imports, or 19 per cent.  On the other hand, exports failed to keep pace with imports, rising by only £39 million, or 12 per cent.  The import excess of £218 million in 1969 was £54 million more than in 1968.  In real terms the import excess was £33 million more.  Producer capital goods accounted for nearly £40 million of entire imports, though imports of aircraft parts amounted to £15 million. Finished consumer goods went up by £18 million but these, compared with total imports, declined slightly.</P>
    <P>How, then, can the Minister for Finance say that because of increased spending power the workers are consuming more?  The facts do not bear it out.  Yet, it would seem that he had this in mind when framing the Budget. It is interesting to note that material imported for further production by the non-agricultural sector added £38 million to the excess.  It is obvious that consumer goods are not the main imports; that the dependence of Irish industry on imported capital, goods and raw materials accounts for 70 per cent of imports.  It will be seen, therefore, that the setting-up of factories is not the ultimate solution because if we must import raw materials to operate them, the profit is very slow and our balance of payments is affected.  This is a feature which should be very carefully considered by the Government when a factory is being set up.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1923" /> During the debate here in connection with the Free Trade Area Agreement, the then Taoiseach, Mr. Lemass, told us how proud he was of his team in London and lauded in particular Deputy Haughey and Deputy Lynch. Shortly afterwards, Deputy Haughey announced that in the first year of the agreement Irish agriculture would benefit by an additional £10 million. However, the fact is that Irish agriculture has lost very substantially and while it was said for a period that cattle could not be sold on the hoof if sold as beef there was a reduction in volume which was so great that even that story did not stand up to argument. Were it not for the increases in price the position would be much worse because the volume, as compared with a few years ago, has dropped considerably.</P>
    <P>The country now has an adverse trade balance with Britain of £93 million. In 1968 the adverse trade balance amounted to £45 million.  So that in one year our trading position with our major market has deteriorated by £47 million, almost the entire increase in import excess.  The responsibility for this must lie with Fianna Fáil and they cannot dodge this responsibility.</P>
    <P>It may be said that I am being destructively critical of the Budget but again I should like to refer to a remark made by Mr. Seán Lemass when he sat in this House as a Member of the Opposition.  During that time he was asked to make a contribution suggesting how certain taxes were to be imposed and he replied very quickly that it was not the responsibility of the Opposition to advise or say how taxes should be imposed; that it was the Opposition's function to criticise.  I take that from him.</P>
    <P>When the Free Trade Area Agreement was first introduced all of us believed that we could take the word of the people who had negotiated the agreement in so far as it was only a matter of a few years until entry to the EEC became a reality.  Mr. Seán Lemass said on several occasions that we would be a member of the EEC by 1970.  He did say in an offhand sort of way that the agreement was <Col N="1924" /> only for the purpose of jizzing up industry here to modernise so as to be prepared for free trade when we joined the Community.  This little bubble burst and we are now being told that we will be a member of the EEC by 1972.</P>
    <P>In any shop in this city or any sizeable store in any part of the country it is possible to buy British goods.  In fact, British goods seem to be offered before Irish goods.  I do not know what will happen after July when the ten per cent is taken off since our home market is now open to the British and I do not know what will happen next year if we do not get into the EEC.  We have stripped our industries of protection, so that, like the shoe factory in Clonmel, they will close down one after another.</P>
    <P>Imports from Great Britain which is still our main market have been too great.  I notice that the increase in imports from the United Kingdom is made up of £22 million for machinery. Each year one can see new machinery being imported, mainly for harvesting. I cannot understand why people continue to buy expensive foreign machinery even if it is the most modern available.  It would appear that jealousy of their neighbours' purchases influences some farmers to invest in these expensive machines.  Very often they are bought on hire purchase. As I said here before I noticed on one occasion that there were ten combine harvesters within an area of ten miles in which there were not 300 acres of corn.</P>
    <P>The amount invested in one of these machines would be more than would be required to modernise an entire farm.  Without wishing to be too severe on the farming community it is my opinion somebody should tell them that if the combine harvester which they had last year did the work in 1½ days they would not be justified in spending three or four thousand pounds this year on one which would do the work in one day.</P>
    <P>Of the £20 million worth of manufactured goods imported last year, textiles accounted for £4 million.  We understood that our textiles would beat the world after the signing of the agreement with Britain.  I note, too, <Col N="1925" /> that £5 million went on chemicals and that foodstuffs accounted for £5 million of the total amount.  I cannot understand why we must import foodstuffs from Britain since we can provide some of the best food in the world. Perhaps this stems from an overspill of advertising on ITV and UTV networks. Certain types of goods and foodstuffs are being sold in Northern Ireland and Great Britain and, as a result of advertising, the housewife has been persuaded that these commodities are wonderful.  Maybe the lack of competition from here is partly responsible.</P>
    <P>It may not be generally admitted but it is a fact that British biscuits are flooding our market.  If this trend continues it will have serious consequences for those in the biscuit industry here. At the present time, also, Heinz Éireann are advertising on television and it appears that some of their new soups will shortly be available on the market here.</P>
    <P>All this gives the impression that our home market is been taken from us.  Maybe it is bad salesmanship on our part but something must be done to correct this trend.  I am not talking about harsh methods but there must be an effort to educate people to buy Irish.  Where the Irish article is as good and in many cases it is better than the foreign product I see no reason why the Irish article should not be bought.  We have an Irish Week around St. Patrick's Day when everyone talks about buying Irish.  The 52 weeks of the year should be Irish Weeks if we are to survive.</P>
    <P>We seem to be a selfish people.  As long as it does not affect us individually we do not seem to worry a great deal. Looking around the House at the suits worn by various people&mdash;I am a fairly good judge of cloth; I know British material when I see it&mdash;I am sorry to say that the amount of Irish material being worn here is much less than it should be.  Then we wonder why Claytons of Navan had to close down a few weeks ago and why other factories all over the country are not standing up as they should.  If the shoes were available for inspection I am quite sure we would see not alone British but, among the younger element, Italian shoes, even <Col N="1926" /> though they cost twice as much as the Irish ones.</P>
    <P>The Budget introduced on behalf of the Minister for Finance was introduced in such a way that it will not do what a Budget should do.  The taxation added will be very substantial.  It will affect wages and prices.  It will also affect the poor, people on fixed incomes who have no way of recovering it.  They have not enough money to pay income tax but they must pay it this way.  It is the only tax that could have caught them and it is being added on.  This was a lazy idea; just double the turnover tax.  When the turnover tax was first introduced we warned what was most likely to happen, and I am warning now it is likely to happen again.  It is so simple that no individual can say: &ldquo;I smoke a lot of cigarettes and they should not have taxed that.  I drink beer and they should not have taxed that.&rdquo; The Minister was very cute.  He put it in such a way that everyone has the same complaint and no one can say he was picked out and taxed out of existence, as some of these people are.</P>
    <P>Particularly, no effort was made to try to set the economy right.  It is in a shocking condition and I fear that in a few months time the Minister will come along and say: &ldquo;I did my best. I did not want to be hard on you but I must be twice as severe now.&rdquo; He is pretty good at that.  We remember on 16th March last year, the Minister's impassioned appeal with the tears rolling down his cheeks, to everyone to set things right.  If he had held to that point of view I believe the balance of payments would not have been £60 million and we would not be looking to a £90 million balance of payments coming up. Unfortunately he changed his mind with the election coming along and we have this imposition, but he makes no attempt to correct the situation.  He would appear not to have made any study as to what should be done.</P>
    <P>In regard to unemployment, here we have an artificial situation.  With the number of people who are out of work as a result of the cement strike we cannot entirely blame the Government. However, we can blame them in one way, that as long as we as politicians tolerate a system which <Col N="1927" /> allows any individual, in this case a group of people, most of whom are non-nationals, to set up an industry and to say they can close that industry for as long as they like, we are doing a disservice to the community.  If this were not an industry with a monopoly, there would be a settlement of this strike much more quickly.  I am not a believer in telling the Minister for Labour: &ldquo;All right.  It is your job.  You settle it.&rdquo; This is a case where collective bargaining must operate.</P>
    <P>Again this is something which has been alleged&mdash;I do not know whether it is true or not, but if it is true it should not be allowed to continue&mdash; that the employer in this case has been able to insure himself against losses through a strike for a considerable period.  If this is so, then it is creating an artificial situation.  No employer should be allowed to do that and no insurance company should be allowed to insure him.  The next thing would be that the trade unions would have to take collective action, that they would be obliged to come together and put up sufficient funds so that when the employer was ready to settle they would hold him for as long again when he would be losing.</P>
    <P>I hate industrial disputes.  They must be settled some time and from my experience people must eventually start talking around a table and must give a little.  It is rather a pity that this has not been found possible in this dispute.  It is no compensation to people who are getting low wages if workers in the same employment are getting high wages.  It is wrong that while workers are getting low wages and cannot obtain a reasonable increase the employer can boast of a clear profit of £1 million or £1½ million after everybody has been paid. These workers should be protected in some way.  My suggestion, as I said earlier, is that there should be a minimum wage laid down and no employer should be allowed to employ people under conditions which can only be described as slave conditions.</P>

      <P>I am a long time here in this House and I can only compare the debate this morning to <Col N="1928" /> that famous play <i>The Merchant of Venice.</i> I listened very carefully to the two speakers this morning and thought I would learn something.  What I did glean from what they said is that they want the Government to supply everything without taxation.  I was amazed that a number of the people in the Opposition, people of goodwill, could vote against the various items we suggested to improve the standard of living of our people.</P>
      <P>I agree with what Deputy Tully said about industrial disputes but on the overall issue he hedged all the way.  If the economy could afford to give all these services without increased taxation it would be better for us, but I do not know of any country in the world, except countries that struck oil or have great mineral resources, that could progress without increasing taxation.  This is a jolly good Budget, in my estimation. We have tried to look after every section of our people, bending over backwards towards the weaker sections.</P>
      <P>What amazed me here last night was the reaction of people who are alleged to be socialists.  The Labour Party do not want the 2s 6d increase in children's allowances.  The following people in the Labour Party were against that increase: Deputy Corish, Deputy Desmond, Deputy Kavanagh, Deputy Keating, Deputy Murphy, the &ldquo;bishop&rdquo; himself, Deputy Cruise-O'Brien, Deputy O'Donovan, Deputy Pattison, Deputy Thornley, Deputy Treacy and Deputy Tully.</P>

      <P>The same people do not want the 10s increase in non-contributory pensions which would make the pension £4 5s a week.  The Labour Party do not want a 17s 6d increase in the basic rate of old age pensions which would bring the pension up to £5 a week.  I think the Fianna Fáil Party is the only Christian socialist party in this House.  I was shocked to hear the reaction of the Labour Party to these increases last night.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unemployment assistance has been increased by 10s 6d a week to £3 12s and £3 6s in urban and rural areas <Col N="1929" /> respectively.  Again, the same Labour Deputies do not want this increase.  I think they must have made some mistake but if they have made a mistake they should own up to it.  My Christian friends do not want the extension of free travel to husbands and wives of veterans of the War of Independence or to old age pensioners or blind pensioners under the age of 70.  Labour Deputies must have some old people in their constituencies and yet they want to debar them from this scheme. The Labour Party do not want an increase in Garda pensions; they do not want a 14 per cent increase paid to local authority workers, civil servants, including postmen, and people on very small salaries.  The Labour Party have been campaigning for increases for workers all year and now that increases are to be given they do not want them. I have never seen such a dishonest display in this House.</P>

Believe it or not, the same gentlemen, whose names I have read out, voted against that too.  I am quoting from the <i>Evening Press</i> of Wednesday, April 22nd.  It says:</P>
      <P>The new relief will benefit all single and widowed taxpayers with earnings below £500 per year and married taxpayers with less than £900 a year.</P>
      <P>They voted against that also.  They are supposed to be concerned with the lower paid workers and we are not supposed to be concerned with anybody at all.  They are supposed to be the saviours of the workers and they voted against removing 50,000 taxpayers from the tax net.</P>

      <P>Relief this year to income tax payers, especially those with small incomes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I never thought that I would see the day when my Socialist friends on my left here would try to make these people pay more income <Col N="1931" /> tax and, when they were getting relief, come along and vote against it.  It goes on:</P>
    <P>A new feature in the earned income relief will give a minimum allowance of £125 for single and widowed persons and £225 for married couples.</P>
    <P>This provision will raise the exemption limits for earnings from £332 to £374 for single persons and from £365 to £399 for widows and widowers.</P>
    <P>The same gentlemen voted against that. I am just wondering whether there are any of those people in their constituencies at all, or are they supported by very wealthy people?  It may be something like that.  They are not concerned anyway about the poor people.</P>
    <P>A working wife will have her present allowance of earned income increased from £45 to £74.</P>
    <P>They do not want the working wives' allowance increased either.  The same gentlemen voted against this.  I did read out the names, I think.</P>

      <P>Deputy Collins will speak and I will not interrupt him. He is a decent man.  I am not interfering with him, I am only telling what happened here yesterday and how deeply concerned these people are for the poor people that I represent in County Dublin.  I was shocked.  It was only when I got to my feet that I recovered.  The next item is:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The combined marriage allowance <Col N="1932" /> and wife's earned income relief will then be twice the single allowance.</P>
    <P>Another change in the income tax system to provide proportionately greater relief to those in the lower ranges of taxable income.</P>
    <P>The same gentlemen voted against that.</P>
    <P>The first £100 of taxable income will be charged at two-thirds of the standard rate, namely at 4s 8d in the £ instead of 7s.</P>
    <P>My friends do not want that.  They want my poor people in County Dublin and everywhere else to pay 7s instead of 4s 8d.  I cannot understand it.  I do not think they could have listened to the Minister's speech at all.  They would never have voted against their own people like that.</P>
    <P>Cost of these proposals in the current year will be £7.4 million and in a full year £8½ million.</P>
    <P>They expect the Minister for Finance to get that from the sky.  The Opposition yesterday and this morning reminded me of <i>The Merchant of Venice</i>&mdash;you may take a pound of flesh but dare you draw a drop of blood.  There is nothing personal in what I am saying. I am dealing with it solely from the economic point of view and the wellbeing of our people.  Fianna Fáil are concerned with every section of our people.  The next one is:</P>
    <P>For persons over 65 years of age relief allowed on unearned income at the same rate as for earned income, but it will apply only to the first £600 of such income.</P>
    <P>It is a help.  My friends have voted against that also.</P>
    <P>This allowance will be brought into line with the new form of minimum earned income relief.</P>
    <P>In the case of a single or widowed person over 65, there will be a minimum allowance of £125.</P>
    <P>A married couple will receive a minimum allowance of £225.</P>
    <P>The limit of qualifying income for age relief will remain at £600 for single and widowed persons but will be raised to £900 for married persons.</P>
    <P>For persons with total incomes of <Col N="1933" /> less than £450 earned income relief or its equivalent is granted.  This is to be raised to £500 and the relief will be a flat £125, where income is below that limit.</P>
    <P>Why did they vote against this?</P>
    <P>Marginal relief will apply for income slightly above £500.</P>
    <P>New scheme of assistance for deserted wives will be brought into operation on October 1st.  They will qualify for an allowance equal to non-contributory widow's pension of £4 5s a week.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand people in a Christian society such as ours voting against thise, especially people who profess to be concerned about these people.  In Dublin we have the welfare department of the Dublin Health Authority trying to help these people and here we have an opportunity for a new scheme of assistance for deserted wives &mdash;yet these people vote against it.  I do not think these lads realised what they were voting against last night because they are very decent people and they would not try to deprive poor, deserted wives&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The scheme of allowances for persons looking after incapacitated pensioners at home to be extended to cover necessitous persons over 70 years whether pensioners or not.</P>
      <P>We have such cases in the city and county of Dublin, people who for one reason or another have not applied for pensions and who will not complain to anybody.  I have come across cases where people were hungry.  They had no money but they may have had some property and therefore they had to pay rates.  That is a good provision.</P>

      <P>The whole Opposition voted against this grant and then they tell us they are concerned about the people.  I never thought I would see the day when people would vote against giving an increase to farmers. They said in effect &ldquo;give everything you like away but do not put one penny on anything&rdquo;.  That is the attitude.  I am really shocked after my years in the House to think that they should have this unbusinesslike approach to such matters.  My estimation is that we are trying to help every section.  Our aim is to ensure that our external deficit does not exceed £50 million a year. We are most anxious to set our balance of payments position right.</P>
      <P>We have come a very long way and I should like to repeat something I have said here before.  When we got our freedom and when the plenipotentiaries had signed on the dotted line the then British Prime Minister said we would never be able to carry on economically. We have carried on and we have come a long way.  I should like to pay tribute to all those who have been responsible for this, to the people who have tried to sell our products abroad, to the semi-State bodies and all who have contributed in no small way to building up our economy.  I do not want to mention individual companies by name but even in the last ten years we have come a long way.  I do not think that the present balance of payments trend will continue because the Government will be careful to see that the position is rectified and does not get out of hand. We do not want to have a repeat of the experience we had some years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A good deal has been said about the EEC, about what we are going to do when we go into it and what we are going to do if we do not get into it.  I know that there will be problems and that everything in the garden will not be rosy, but if Britain goes in and we do not she will be debarred from buying our products.  It is a serious position. It is easy to say &ldquo;Do not do this, that or the other thing&rdquo; but if we do not go in what are we going to do? Are we to be left out on the dead limb of a tree?  The matter has been discussed at great length here and elsewhere and we have read much about the position <Col N="1935" /> and we will have to try to make the best bargain we can.  The Six seem to be carrying on very well and that is about the best guarantee we can have. There may be disagreements amongst them but then we even have disagreements in this House.</P>
    <P>I can remember how views have changed over the years in this House. When we started to build up the tourist industry we were told that we were putting up hotels to attract foreigners who would eat our food but eventually such people changed their views.  One man who unfortunately is no longer with us came in here and criticised the position but a few months later when he became a Minister the tourist industry became his responsibility.  At that time tourist traffic was down to minus one, in 1941, but we were arranging to bring it up.  That man opened a holiday camp and said that the industry was worth so much to us that it should be built up.  Changing from one side of the House to the other helped to change his mind.</P>
    <P>Admittedly the number of industries we have is not as large as it might be. Some people have magnified the failure of certain industries but we could not be too choosy.  We have come a long way in this regard also.  We have tried to get our industrialists to modernise their factories so that they can compete in foreign markets and we hope that they will do their utmost in this regard. We are all anxious to see our industries doing well.  We have had to stand on our own feet without resources to fall back on.  When I attended an international conference in Jerusalem I was interested to hear about the money that was coming from all over the world to help the Jews, but we started without financial help from anybody except our own people who helped in terms of loans and taxation.</P>
    <P>Our housing situation has also improved from the time when we had slums in Dublin to its present excellent position.  All over the country people who did not have homes when the State was founded now have them. Each Government tried to see that this was done.  Our educational facilities have also been improved greatly and <Col N="1936" /> today we have free secondary and free university education and free school transport.  All these things add up to an improvement in the country's position. We will have a new generation who will take great pride in trying to do more for our people.  One man to whom I should like to refer is Mr. Seán Lemass who did so much for the industrialisation of this country.  He is a wonderful man who did excellent work.</P>
    <P>There have been great improvements too in regard to our fisheries and our fishing fleets.  We have tried to improve harbours although a lot still remains to be done.  Every one of us would like to see more and more money being poured into all these national schemes which concern the wellbeing of our people.</P>
    <P>There were long statements in this House today on the alleged harm the increase in the turnover tax will do to our economy and to the present standard of living of our people.  Liberal increases are being given to the lower income group and to pensioners.  In order to give benefits, the money must be got from somewhere or other. Deputy Tully spoke about taxing luxury goods imported from abroad. Even if we taxed such goods to the hilt we would not get anything near the amount of money we require to administer this State.  We cannot forget the demands for housing, water supply schemes, sewerage schemes, school building, and so on.</P>
    <P>Rates are increasing because our people are demanding more and more services.  Such services cannot be provided without money.  The more educated our people become and, the more they travel abroad, the more they will demand the types of services they see available in other countries. The same can be said in relation to this Budget.  Increases in benefits cannot be given except by the imposition of taxation.</P>
    <P>We are very sorry that the Minister for Finance, Deputy Haughey, is ill. He has been an efficient and helpful Minister and has managed the housekeeping affairs of the nation well.  This is a really well thought out Budget.  He tried to be fair to every section and to <Col N="1937" /> help the weaker sections.  None of us likes taxation but what is the alternative?</P>
    <P>I am completely disappointed with the Labour Party.  One would expect they would support us in all our efforts on behalf of the community.  However, they are entitled to their opinion, just as Fine Gael are entitled to their opinion.  Each of us is entitled to his opinion.  It would be refreshing to hear some constructive suggestion instead of being treated once more to this negative approach which is so characteristic of both Fine Gael and Labour. We hear complaints that more and more should be done and yet they vote against any forward step we take.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that our industries and the people promoting exports, as well as our trade missions abroad, will do their utmost to help this nation in every possible way.  We must export and we must therefore encourage this aspect of our economy to the greatest degree possible.</P>

      <P>It is very difficult to quarrel with Deputy Burke.  My impression is that he is so indoctrinated with the Fianna Fáil gospel that his remarks were made in all honesty. Like other speakers, I regret that, because of an unfortunate accident, the Minister for Finance cannot be present. The preparation of a document of the magnitude of this Budget obviously involved a lot of work, time and energy by the Minister for Finance and it is regrettable that Deputy Haughey cannot be here for this debate.  I want to say, not in any derogatory way or with any malice, that the Minister for Finance has got himself very firmly on the taxpayers' backs and that it is harder to shake him off their backs than it was to shake him off the horse's back.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Tully made a pretty fair and accurate assessment of this Budget. Credit should be given where credit is due and criticism should be made, where necessary.  This is a lazy man's Budget.  To be factual, more was never provided in any Budget for social welfare recipients but, on the other hand, never, in two or three lines of a Minister's Financial Statement, was more taken from them.  It has been noticeable <Col N="1938" /> for a number of years here that the rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer.  This Budget is very subtle and very slick. The turnover tax has been doubled.</P>
    <P>Quite recently, I heard that when the pension was £3 15s per week the income of a goat's milk would deprive the pensioner of 5s per week.  I should like to hear from the Minister for Social Welfare the number of persons who have qualified for the maximum rate of non-contributory old age pension. These pensioners, whether or not they have any dependants, will be paying turnover tax on every item they buy.  They will pay turnover tax just like the people with £4,000 to £8,000 per annum.  The trend of the rich getting richer and the poor getting poorer is encouraged by this Budget.  All the recipients of social welfare benefits, while they have never got more in any Budget, never have had more taken from them.  In 12 months time I would like to know whether or not the extra money they will have to pay in turnover tax will mean that they will be even worse off than they are at present.</P>
    <P>The Budget was introduced in a subtle and slick way.  I was amazed by the contributions made yesterday by the Leader of the Fine Gael Party and the Leader of the Labour Party.  The Taoiseach on his way out of the House said that the debate on the Budget would be resumed this morning which would give an opportunity to the Fine Gael and Labour Deputies to justify their consciences for the action they had taken in voting against the Budget.  Such a remark should not be passed by the Taoiseach.  I have no apologies to offer to anyone for voting against the increase in turnover tax.  This remark by the Taoiseach who holds such a responsible position and who is held in high esteem by many people disappointed me.  The Taoiseach should examine consciences nearer to him than the Opposition benches.</P>
    <P>Some concessions are given and there are some good things in the Budget to which I shall refer later.  Immediate reaction to the Budget was favourable. The Budget looked very well on paper but in my opinion it does nothing <Col N="1939" /> to curb the menace of inflation whereas it erodes the pay-packets of the workers.</P>
    <P>A problem remains as a result of the increase in turnover tax.  When the pay-packet is brought home and the housewife is budgeting for the week she will find that, due to the turnover tax, it is not sufficient to provide the necessaries of life.  This will create a demand for further wage and salary increases. In the past ten years wages have been chasing prices all the time. This turnover tax will increase the cost of living still further.  It will provide a justifiable case for people on fixed incomes and those in receipt of weekly pay-packets to seek further increases. A continuation of this will be detrimental to the economy.  I am concerned at the losses in the purchasing power of money.  Even with increases in salaries and wages, purchasing power is rapidly diminishing.  This creates hardships for persons on fixed incomes and for social welfare recipients. The trade union representatives will be called upon to remedy the situation arising from the Budget. They will have difficult problems to solve.  We are all aware of the serious economic effects of industrial disputes and the serious effect on export markets.</P>
    <P>Deputies must notice the absence of provision for persons on housing waiting lists.  In some cases persons have been on waiting lists for four or five years.  I understand that in this city it is necessary to have two children before being put on a housing waiting list.  I am more conversant with the situation in Cork.  We are faced there with a very serious housing problem in both the city and county.  People who have houses do not realise the hardships involved when two families have to occupy one house.  Sometimes people are not wanted in a house, especially when they have young children.  Deputies should concern themselves with this serious social problem.  It must be settled.  This Budget does nothing to assist these people.  Many Deputies may have good intentions but they are not involved in or aware of the hardships people suffer in overcrowded <Col N="1940" /> houses or in conditions of squalor and misery.  People appeal to local authorities and hope their turn will come soon to get a house.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>In this Budget there is the largest ever provision for housing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>There is nothing in the Budget to alleviate housing hardships. There is no provision to house the homeless or to provide homes for those on waiting lists.  Have we forgotten that in this country there are thousands of engaged couples waiting to get married but who cannot get married because they cannot get houses?  Recently, we were informed that the Cork housing authority would provide loans and, if I may digress for a moment, I want to commend this scheme which I think is excellent, although the rate of interest is too high.  This is not an encouragement to people who are on housing lists to build their own houses.  Every encouragement should be given to those people through subsidised or greatly reduced rates of interest.</P>
      <P>However, we are faced with a situation of which every Member of the House as well as every local authority member is aware, that if an SDA loan is made available the house will have to be built and the contractor, the builder, will have to be paid before the local authority will make the loan available to the applicant.  In order to help to work this scheme, the banks made bridging loans available.  Now, however, we are informed that because of the credit squeeze, by some banks particularly, this is to be discontinued. If the bridging loans are to be discontinued much of that kind of building will be closed down altogether.</P>
      <P>I mentioned at the outset the great problem the 5 per cent turnover tax will be to everybody and I said it was the easy, quick way to get £20 million. However, it will militate more against the shopkeepers and the businessmen in the small villages and towns of rural Ireland than against those in built-up, densely populated areas.  It is unfair of the Minister for Finance to get this £20 million by turning small shopkeepers and business people into tax collectors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1941" /> Where you have a small business, where you have people who made a fair living from a small shop and where they are slow to keep records. I am afraid there will be a good deal of tax evasion because of the difficulty for those people of keeping records and accounts.  Most of these shopkeepers do not keep day to day accounts and they will find it extremely difficult to collect turnover tax on commodities as they are handed over the counter. In this context we must consider bread, butter and every other item on an extensive list.  This will mean more than 5 per cent because, as I read in the <i>Irish Times</i> this morning, if you have not a halfpenny a penny will do. It will affect the pint, cigarettes, spirits and several other items.  All of it will mean a severe increase in the cost of living which will have very serious repercussions.</P>
    <P>Besides, we have reached the stage now when we do not legislate for increased prices for such items as boots, shoes, clothing, bread, <i>et cetera.</i> This remorseless process proceeds very silently.  It is done in silence by the Minister for Industry and Commerce. Daily there is a gradual increase in the cost of living and the pay packet is being more seriously eroded week after week.  This will make the situation worse because money is losing its purchasing power so rapidly.</P>
    <P>Much capital has been made out of the fact that non-contributory pensions have been increased to £4 5s per week. This is supposed to provide, if you take the person living alone, every item from Monday until Sunday night, every month of the year.  If any one of us in the House were given £4 5s. a week to live on&mdash;let me emphasise that this amount in the majority of cases will be only £4&mdash;how would we attempt to provide ourselves with clothes, coal, shoes, rent and all the other essentials?  No matter how economical a person might be, with the cost of living at its present level, no one can be expected to provide all these items on £4 or £4 5s a week.  The relentless erosion of purchasing power takes care of this.</P>
    <P>I intervened in this debate mainly <Col N="1942" /> to deal with agriculture.  We are here talking about the £5 million extra provided for the farming community, yet prior to the Budget it was accepted by everybody that the farmers' incomes were falling far short of those in other walks of life.  At any rate, I was pleased to learn that the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries engaged in protracted consultations with the various farming organisations.  As I have said already in the House, such consultations are necessary no matter who is Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries: there is a lot to be learned from discussions and from confrontation with people and their problems.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I am glad the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries took it on himself to meet the NFA, the ICMSA and the other farming organisations. It surprised me that, having met them for 72 hours, the Minister, who is accepted as a hardliner, who is known for his lack of sympathy with the farming community and who has taken stern action against them, conceded that £20 million was needed in order to boost the farmers' incomes.  This came from a Minister who is a shrewd, hard politician.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to bore the House with quotations, but in a recent issue of the <i>Irish Independent</i> the agricultural correspondent, Jim Norton, stated in his column headed: &ldquo;Blaney says £20 million needed to boost farmers' incomes&rdquo;:</P>
    <P>Estimates for the coming year were that about £20 million would be needed to keep the income of the farming community in pace with those in other walks of life.</P>
    <P>The Minister claimed that £14 million was necessary by way of Exchequer support and that the other £6 million would be provided by improved marketing, more efficiency and higher production by farmers.  The Minister admitted that this extra money was necessary but in the following week we read in the newspapers that Deputy Blaney's £14 million had been rejected by Deputy Haughey.</P>
    <P>If the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries is convinced that £14 million is necessary to boost farmers' incomes and that approximately one-third of this <Col N="1943" /> amount should be provided by the Exchequer, who is to provide the extra £9½ million?  Does this mean that farmers must accept a lower standard of living than those engaged in other employment?  Does it mean that the farmers must work seven days a week while those engaged in industry and elsewhere work only five days?  Does it mean that the farmer must be satisfied with less reward for the amount of work he puts into his way of life?  The Minister for Finance has told us in his Budget speech that:</P>
    <P>Despite significant increases in agricultural output and State support, agricultural incomes continue to lag behind other sectors of the economy.</P>
    <P>This is true and it is a fact that is accepted by all farmers in the country but because of the statement made by the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries prior to the Budget the farmers were hopeful that there would be an increase in their income and, in particular, an increase to the dairy farmers.</P>
    <P>This Budget, in so far as the farming community are concerned, is disappointing. It is a set back to that particular section of the community who work so hard for seven days each week and who have responded magnificently to any encouragement or inducement that has been given to them during the past 40 years.  There is not a Minister in the Government who can deny that at any time at which a price inducement was given to the farmers they responded immediately so that there was over-production of whatever the inducement was given for.  I am concerned especially with the incomes of the dairy farmers.  There is an increase in this Budget for the first 7,000 gallons.  There are approximately 112,000 creamery milk suppliers in the country and the average production is 4,800 gallons a year for each farmer. Therefore, if my mathematics are correct, the increase will amount to 7s 6d or 8s per week.  Is there any trade unionist or anybody else in any other sector of the community who, in 1970, would accept such an increase?  This is what the increase will mean despite what we have been told by the Taoiseach and the Minister for Agriculture <Col N="1944" /> and Fisheries as to agricultural incomes continuing to lag behind those in other sectors.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance also stated:</P>
    <P>It has already been announced that, as from 1st May, liquid milk producers will be getting an additional 2d per gallon which, with the increase of 1d last February, gives a total increase of 3d per gallon. This represents an additional £¾ million a year for liquid milk producers.</P>
    <P>This, also, is true and it applies in particular to the liquid milk producers in the Leinster and Cork districts.  The increase of 3d per gallon will not be provided by the Exchequer but will be paid for by the housewife.  The Minister has stated that this represents an additional £¾ million a year for the liquid milk producers.  One would get the impression that there is a further £¾ million per year being provided by the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>The Minister further states:</P>
    <P>It has also been announced that the prices on which the export support payments for beef and lamb are calculated were being increased by 1½d per lb and 3d per lb respectively as from 6th April.  The additional value of this to the livestock and meat industry is estimated at £1¼ million a year of which the Irish Exchequer will bear about £¾ million.</P>
    <P>This is only in line with the recent British announcement.  I admit that it will boost farmers' incomes to some extent but further on the Minister has stated in regard to developing beef production that there are possibilities for the marketing and sale of beef. It is necessary at this time to encourage farmers and, in particular, creamery milk suppliers, to diversify from milk production to beef production and we, on this side of the House, have suggested time and again that in order to encourage this diversification it will be necessary to increase the beef subsidy from £12 to £24.  The Minister told us that for the first qualifying cow a grant of £21 will be paid and that for the second cow, the grant would be £19.  However, the first two cows in every herd are omitted from the <Col N="1945" /> scheme.  The Minister has made a case that this is to exclude the non-agricultural or non-farming people.  In order to help those in areas where it is not economic to produce milk, such as the west of Ireland, the subsidy should be paid on every animal in the herd to farmers having only five or six cows.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>Before Question Time I was dealing with agriculture and the extra subsidies to agriculture.  I was just about to deal with the bacon industry and pig production generally.  In <Col N="1949" /> page 39 of the Financial Statement the Minister said:</P>
      <P>To help offset rising labour and feed costs the guaranteed minimum prices for top grade pigs up to 150 lbs weight will be increased by 10s per cwt dead weight with effect from 4th May, 1970.</P>
      <P>The present guaranteed price for top grade pigs is 288s but because of the scarcity of pigs and the uncertainty there is in pig production the factories and the marts are already paying that 10s for the past four months.  The top price in some factories is as high as 300s.  The whole pattern of pig production, particularly pig fattening, is changing completely and fattening is now done in sweat houses and the margin of profit is small.  This has changed the whole pig industry because this is being done by big combines, big concerns.</P>
      <P>What I think is the tragedy of the whole situation is that at one time pig production was almost entirely confined to the small farmer.  Because of the uncertainty now in pig production, particularly in regard to the fluctuation of pig prices, the small farmer can no longer take the risk of getting involved in pig production on any big scale.  I would like to see pig prices tied to the price of pig feed so that, if pig feed goes up, the price of the pigs will automatically go up.  This would ensure a safe return on the amount of labour and money invested by the producer. If the Government want to encourage pig production, particularly if they want to benefit the people most deserving, namely, the small farmer, they will have to guarantee prices closely related to the cost of pig feed. When pig producers start to rear pigs they have no idea what price the pig will fetch.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A case can be made for pig co-ops. In some areas producers rear pigs up to the store stage and then sell them to fattening co-ops or to pig fatteners of some kind or another, but here again prices are uncertain.  I think guaranteed prices would encourage production by the small farming community. The Minister said yesterday that he was providing £240,000 for the <Col N="1950" /> cost of bacon and pork export price support.  This sum is welcome but insignificant in an industry which earned £35 million last year.</P>
    <P>While on agriculture I should like to refer briefly to the continuing flight from the land.  The Budget has done nothing to arrest or to come to grips with this very serious problem.  When farmers leave the land it has a detrimental effect on local business and everyone in the area suffers as a result. Unless we make some effort to keep the population in rural areas all the money and energy which has been spent on preserving the native language will be wasted because it is the people in the Gaeltacht who are moving away.  It is very difficult to convince young people to stay in rural Ireland because social life is non-existent and they are attracted to the towns and cities abroad.  Unless something is done to check this flight from the land soon I think the position will be beyond retrieving.  The development of the tourist industry could help.</P>
    <P>There is, however, the problem of the people in those areas not getting modern amenities.  I have mentioned before the extension of rural electrification to these areas, because we are living in an era when people are conscious of the benefits of electricity but yet they all cannot get this amenity. The special service charge is so prohibitive that no one could afford to have electricity on those terms.  Unless the problem is tackled, however, we will find ourselves in serious trouble in the not too distant future.</P>
    <P>There appears to be a mistaken idea that the farming community are doing reasonably well.  All those engaged in the industry and the Minister and the Taoiseach know perfectly well that this is not so.  I read a letter recently in a Sunday newspaper.  The person who wrote it was paying income tax and he saw on television that bullocks on the Dublin market were making £94 apiece.  He reckoned a farmer could sit down, watch 12 bullocks getting fat and that this would give him an income of £20 a week.  That seems to be the attitude of the non-farming community.  When the Minister for Finance or the Minister for <Col N="1951" /> Agriculture and Fisheries states that subsidies of £95 million or £96 million are being paid to the farmers, people get a false impression that the farming community is thriving and everyone else is paying income tax to subsidise them.  It must be remembered that this is an agricultural country, our basic industry is agriculture and it should therefore be the Government's major concern.  Some people think our industrial exports far exceed our agricultural exports but, in fact, net agricultural exports are treble net industrial exports.</P>
    <P>The families engaged in agriculture should get better treatment.  The Fianna Fáil Government regard the farming community as second class citizens and they have never realised the importance of the farming community to the economy of this country.  If one compares the farmers, who must work a seven-day week, in many instances 12 to 14 hours a day, with the industrial workers who have a five-day week, one sees that for the amount of effort, time and labour that is put into agriculture the reward is nothing like sufficient.  I believe there is a mistaken idea in this country, particularly among some Deputies who have not got a proper knowledge of agriculture, that the farming community are doing pretty well.  In fact, the reverse is the case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I was struck this morning when reading the <i>Irish Independent</i> by the comment of Mr. Arthur Noonan, the political correspondent, in which he referred to the Budget as &ldquo;generally a warm, social document.&rdquo; Much as I generally admire the perspicacity of Mr. Noonan I must disagree strongly with him on this occasion. I find this Budget leaves me distinctly cold.  I do not think it can be classified as having a great deal of social or general humanitarian warmth. Indeed, one could classify it as being quite conventional and a classic example of a rather tired Government, a Government which certainly does not display&mdash;entering into the alleged excitement and challenge of the 1970's&mdash; any sense of dynamism.  There are not the budgetary innovations I would have expected&mdash;and most certainly I <Col N="1952" /> would have expected them from Deputy Haughey, whose handling of many aspects of financial affairs I admire, whose absence from this debate I certainly regret and whose return to this House we all want to see as early as possible.  The Budget he presented on this occasion is not a particularly good one.  It has several major deficiencies which I propose to outline at some length.</P>
      <P>The first point I would make in respect of the Budget generally is that that there seems to be a feeling in the House that we will have another one next autumn.  Frankly, I am not terribly worried.  There has grown up in Ireland and in these islands an idea that there is something peculiarly sacrosanct about annual budgets.  To make any decent Government projection for capital expenditure or, in terms of taxation, of buoyancy on a strict annual basis is extremely difficult and at times almost impossible.  Therefore, if we are to have a Supplementary Budget, as I rather suspect we will have next autumn&mdash;all the indications of that development are embodied in this Financial Statement&mdash;then I do not think we should be unduly worried.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance presumably jointly preparing this Budget proceeded to attack inflation strongly and wrongly.  With a great show of rhetoric and conventional economic jargon&mdash;with political admonitions to everybody&mdash;the Budget attacks inflation with strong words, with stern, gritty, Irish attitudes.  But I am afraid strong words are not in any way matched with policies or given to us in association with policies.  Therefore, we have strong words and only a token attitude towards a disinflationary policy.  That perhaps is the major sin of omission in the Budget, which presumably was jointly prepared by the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I, therefore, regret that I must classify the Budget as being singularly unimaginative.  The Labour Party regard it as being a rather shoddy piece of general juggling with little major or overall national benefit.  I do not think it reflects the abilities of the Minister, and many of us are quite convinced Deputy Haughey has ability when he <Col N="1953" /> applies his mind fully to the problem. Anybody who had hoped in this Budget to see a reforming Government showing major initiatives will be disappointed. They will find visits to Dáil Éireann and this Chamber in the next few weeks rather dreary.</P>
    <P>This year, of all years, we should be planning the economic strategy of the seventies, bearing in mind that in the sixties we did achieve a real and welcome degree of economic advance. This non-election year would have been a singularly good time for the Government to define their own general economic strategy in anticipation of the mid-seventies and the second half of the decade.  That the Budget has been so opportunist, so generally pragmatic and so conventional is a matter of considerable regret, because it must be accepted in this House and nationally that the Budget is the most important single political and economic indicator in any given year.  Therefore, the Government should have made more of the opportunity offered by the Budget than merely announcing some marginal income tax changes.  I know we all benefited to the tune of £12 a year, but when one deducts from the £12 the anticipated 10 per cent increase in the cost of living generally in the next 12 months and when those of us with families deduct from that the reduced income tax allowances for children and take into account the full impact of the turnover tax, we are left, after the juggling, with no real benefit. There has been a great to-do about very little.  I would have hoped that, instead of marginal income tax changes which do not benefit the lower paid worker to any great extent, the Government could have reduced the impact on lower paid workers.</P>
    <P>Entering the seventies we do not know the Government's total objectives. We have no conception of the kind of society which the Government are seeking to create in this country as we enter the seventies.  Certainly, we have had little indication of how the Government propose to manage the economy.</P>
    <P>We have been fortunate enough to have had indications from the professional <Col N="1954" /> staff of the Department of Finance.  This is a staff which certainly in the sixties have become very competent and effective in economic and one might say quiet political expertise.  We are aware of their ideas and their general attitude in their comments in the review of 1969 and the outlook for 1970 which is incorporated in the third programme review.  We have the official Civil Service analysis of what might be done during the early seventies. However, apart from a reiteration of this on the part of the Taoiseach and some of his Ministers we have had no indication from the Fianna Fáil Party of how they propose to manage the economy.</P>
    <P>Perhaps they have been managed for so long by the public servants that at this stage they are prisoners of the public service.  In that context we might be thankful that the public service is so competent.  However, I have not noticed on the part of Fianna Fáil or, indeed, on the part of the Taoiseach, any great sense of political innovation over the past ten or 12 years in terms of the management of our economy. Indeed, rather has the Taoiseach blown with the wind in a very polite, nice and competent manner and the wind happened to be blowing favourably during the sixties.  However, I do not think we have seen any test of real economic steel within him or within the bulk of his Cabinet.  I am always inclined to mark down the Minister for Finance, Deputy Haughey, as something of an exception; in that context he is far less accident prone than some might be prepared to suggest.</P>
    <P>Coming to the general economic position we are faced with two factors, the first being that the economy, excluding the current major inflationary crisis, has gone through a decade of exceptional progress.  I side very much with the Minister for Finance in his statement that 1969 was the final year of a decade of exceptional progress, a decade which opened with the country very heavily dependent on the agricultural sector, on agricultural exports and which witnessed the transformation of the country's economy into an expanding and increasingly industrialised <Col N="1955" /> one.  One could not but acknowledge the growing strength of our economy during the 1960s and this is a matter of profound importance in trying to overcome this serious inflationary problem facing the country.</P>
    <P>I do not for a moment suggest that the economy in 1960 could have taken the beating that it is now taking because in 1960 it would not have possessed the economic resilience to have been able to absorb that kind of critical situation.  It must be acknowledged, too, that in real terms our gross national product grew by almost 50 per cent over the years from 1960 to 1969 while industrial production almost doubled during that time.  In 1959 over 35 per cent of the labour force were engaged in agriculture, whereas only 24 per cent were engaged in industry in 1959.  Today the numbers engaged in industry exceed those engaged in agriculture which means that more of our labour force are in better paid and more productive jobs whose average hours of working have fallen and that unemployment and emigration have been reduced.</P>
    <P>These are unequivocal and undisputed facts.  I do not attribute any exceptional competence to the Fianna Fáil Party for that out-turn of the decade.  I have my own reservations about the impact of Mr. Lemass in the mid-1960s when he &ldquo;flogged&rdquo; the 12 per cent.  A great deal of our current inflationary trend can be traced back to that time.  He did that in a moment of mental by-election aberration and it had profound repercussions in the late 1960s which are with us today too.</P>
    <P>However, during that period there was available to members of the House, who unfortunately never bothered to read it, the advice given in the First Programme for Economic Expansion and the second and third programmes.  I rarely meet Deputies who read those documents or who have taken any interest in any of the reports of the NIEC.  I always remember when the Committee on Industrial Organisation were trying desperately to produce reports of a tentative nature in the early 1960s the blank incomprehension <Col N="1956" /> which Members of this House displayed towards many of these documents.  I must say I place far greater store on the reports of people like Deputy FitzGerald&mdash;who is treated in such a cavalier and snide manner by, shall we say, the more simple members of the Fianna Fáil backbenchers&mdash;the late Jim Larkin, in terms of his contribution to the NIEC, Mr. Whitaker, Mr. Murray, Mr. Paddy Lynch, Mr. Louden Ryan, Mr. Charlie McCarthy, Mr. Donal Nevin, than on many of the ineffectual reports brought in by successive Ministers for Finance.</P>
    <P>They did not bother during the 1960s to follow the detailed advice offered on the question of an incomes policy and on inflation by the NIEC and ever since we had the interim report on the second programme on the 17th January, 1964, right up to the report on an incomes and prices policy on the 20th February, 1970. Admittedly, all this may be regarded by members of the Cabinet as having been unduly influenced by people like Deputy FitzGerald who participated in the preparation of these documents and as a result it is said certain members of the Cabinet refused to pay sufficient heed to the warning contained in those documents, in the 27 reports of the NIEC which were available to Members of this House.</P>
    <P>One recalls the hostility shown in this House by members of the Cabinet towards, for example, the report on and arrangements for planning at industrial level.  One recalls the hostility displayed in this House by Fianna Fáil towards the comments on <i>Investment in Education</i> and the implications of that report.  In particular, one wonders how Fianna Fáil managed to stay in power when one recalls the report on industrial growth centres issued by the NIEC.  To neglect to mention these facts would be to give less than due regard and due recognition to those who have been advising the political leaders of this country and who frequently have not been particularly thanked for their work.</P>
    <P>I challenge the general complacency of the Government towards the social aspect of the Budget.  I am always amused at the hosannas and general clapping and ruaille-buaille from the <Col N="1957" /> serried rows of Fianna Fáil backbenchers when they come into this House, literally only once a year, on Budget day.  I saw people here yesterday those whom I did not see, literally, since 2nd July, 1969.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I recall a saying by a fellow socialist of the old brigade which should have stirred the imagination of the Government on this Budget.  The late Aneurin Bevan used to say that socialism is the language of priorities.  I suppose that is what this House and politics are all about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is considerable complacency and smugness in this House in relation to social priorities.  If an increase is given to old age pensioners and a comparable amount to non-contributory pensioners and social security recipients it seems to be the thinking that this is the way henceforward one should continue to operate.  Its lack of impact on the budgetary situation is almost laughable.  In addition to having a Current Budget and a Capital Budget I suggest we should have a separate Social Budget which would include particulars of all expenditure on the social services as well as, on a comparable basis, the taxes required specifically to finance them.  The <Col N="1958" /> phrase &ldquo;Social Budget&rdquo; may sound gimmicky: this subdivision is essential. It will eliminate many of the platitudes into which too many of our Budget debates degenerate.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the goodwill expressed from all sides of the House towards annual handouts, as though we were a political Santa Claus giving annual handouts to people in a slightly patronising and almost paternal political manner, I personally detest this approach, exemplified by the contribution of Deputy Burke today, rather than one of people obtaining their basic rights on a contributory wage-related basis.  In the light of the £5 a week the old age pensioner will get under this Budget, from a date later in the year, we tolerate standards of social benefits that are an affront to the conscience of this country.  Certainly they are an insult to politicians of a progressive democracy.  They are a mockery of the ideals expressed in the Proclamation of 1916 and of the democratic programme outlined in the first Dáil.</P>
    <P>We are told by the Government we cannot afford better social services. With a gross national product running well over the £1,000 million mark, with an economy that has grown so strong in the past decade, with a dramatic general buoyancy of revenue in recent years, I am quite convinced that, since this can be done in the main only through taxation, we must be prepared to pay more in order that our sick, our aged and our people in want may enjoy greater material standards than otherwise they would have.</P>
    <P>This basic political principle should be accepted.  It is only hypocritically implemented in this Budget.  Until such time as we accept that principle we are being quite ineffectual in our budgetary provisions.  I do not accept that the 2½ per cent increase in turnover tax particularly solves the problem. I am amazed at the lack of imagination on the part of Deputy Haughey and the Taoiseach.  We are now faced with a very serious situation in which any future attempts to realign the taxation system will be impossible.  The impact of extra turnover tax on future <Col N="1959" /> attempts to introduce a prices and incomes policy will be great.</P>
    <P>The increase in turnover tax will lower morale and will have a substantial impact.  It will cause a ripple throughout the economy.  So far as the Labour Party are concerned we consider that this Budget has been singularly unhelpful towards the implementation of an effective prices and incomes policy.  On that ground alone the Budget stands indicted.  It does not help us in assuring the workers that the Government are acting generously or sincerely.  The increase in the turnover tax is no contribution whatever towards meeting the warnings issued by the NIEC and the Central Bank and underlined by the staff of the Department of Finance itself.  I quote now from the NIEC report on the economy in 1969.  One will see the effect of the turnover tax.</P>
    <P>The magnitude of the increase in consumer prices which could occur this year is alarming.  If it materialised, it could seriously damage competitiveness and therefore put many existing jobs in jeopardy and erode one of the basic conditions for the future growth in output and employment.  It would create new social tensions because many social categories could not be adequately insulated from its effects.  On the external side, even given the present level of external reserves, the risks associated with the deficit of £90 million are unacceptably large. Our reasons for this conclusion are the extent of State and State-guaranteed borrowing which occurred last year; the likelihood that it might be very difficult to borrow abroad on the same scale this year; the uncertainties connected with capital flows; the fact that the balance of payments has continously deteriorated since the end of 1967; the dangerous expectations that would be consolidated by maintaining the inflationary momentum through 1970 and the serious problems that these would create for the economy in 1971 and 1972.</P>
    <P>A British Chancellor of the Exchequer&mdash;even <Col N="1960" /> the most tight-fisted and reluctant Labour Chancellor that one could find in Britain in recent years&mdash;faced with a conclusion of that nature from his own economic advisory organisations would surely regard the Irish 2½ per cent turnover tax with a rather wry smile.  Either one means what one says in terms of economic reforms or they are not worth the paper they are written on. This Budget repudiates and disregards the warnings given to the Government which one would have thought would have been heeded substantially by the Minister and the Cabinet.</P>
    <P>It is incomprehensible to me that the Taoiseach, on behalf of the Minister for Finance, should have been so explicit about the difficulty facing the economy and yet so inactive and inconsequential about it in the Budget. The Taoiseach said:</P>
    <P>A surplus of £15 million in 1967 gave way to a deficit of £22 million in 1968; last year, the deficit was about £60 million.  This year, despite a small improvement in the first quarter, the deficit could be substantially higher.  This trend has grave implications for the economy. Unless we abate the excessive increases in domestic consumption and costs, the gains of the past decade and our potential for further progress in the seventies could be put in jeopardy.</P>
    <P>That is not a statement of somebody who imposes an extra 2½ per cent turnover tax.  It is a rather serious comment on the part of the Taoiseach. He does not seem to have taken his own confession to heart on this occasion. The Taoiseach said:</P>
    <P>This year, we must make a start towards this objective by ensuring that the deficit does not exceed £50 million.  To attempt deliberately to achieve a much smaller deficit this year might involve excessive disruption in the economy.</P>
    <P>One finds admonitions in the report of the NIEC, in the Financial Statement and in the statement made by the Department of Finance itself.  This year of 1970 will go down as the year of admonitions of a serious nature and warnings, which the Budget ignored. <Col N="1961" /> In the <i>Review of 1969 and Outlook for 1970</i> it is stated:</P>
    <P>In the remaining three-quarters of the year productivity per man-hour in manufacturing industry rose by 2¼ per cent over the corresponding period of 1968.  As hourly earnings increased by 13 per cent between these two periods unit wage costs deteriorated by about 10½ per cent. This increase in unit wage costs which was more than double that in British industry in 1969 was an undesirable development following the relative stability of Irish wage costs in the two preceding years and, if maintained, could seriously impair the ability of Irish industry to sustain the expansion of output upon which the growth of the economy mainly depends.</P>
    <P>I take this comment from the review because it is mild by comparison with some of the harsh statements in it. There are, then, these two reports. Indeed we have had a plethora of reports from the NIEC in recent weeks, all of them extremely welcome and invaluable in a pre-Budget period.</P>
    <P>In NIEC Report No. 27, there is a further statement on an incomes and prices policy.  I am putting these on the records of the House because I think they should be there if the Minister comes back here in October with a supplementary budget.  Then, even if Deputy Haughey's eyes are less hooded than they normally are and he is much more calm in the handling of criticism, he will have to face these comments recorded in the House.  On page six of Report No. 27 there is this comment:</P>
    <P>In 1969 money incomes rose again by almost 11 per cent, the volume of production by 4 per cent and over-all prices by around 7¾ per cent.  The deficit in the balance of payments on current account is expected to have been in excess of £60 million.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has reiterated this and has accepted the report.  I do not think there is any need on my part to quote the views of the Central Bank: it is sufficient to record that so anxious generally was the bank that its views should be put on public notice that <Col N="1962" /> the relevant passage was published before the regular bulletin was issued. The views of the Central Bank, of the NIEC and the comment made by the Taoiseach coincide in general.</P>
    <P>One is faced with the fact that the sole response of the Government and their sole reaction has been simply to increase turnover tax by 2½ per cent. I might quote the Taoiseach at page 62 of the Financial Statement as stating that in his view the turnover tax is the fairest method of getting so large a sum.  Generally, one might ask if any Cork man could but smile blandly when reading so simple a statement.</P>
    <P>It may be repetition on my part, because it was referred to by Deputy Tully and by the Fine Gael spokesmen, but the Taoiseach went on to say that the rise in prices attributable to the proposed increase in turnover tax should be little if anything in excess of the 2½ per cent, that is to say, 6d. in the £.  All I can say is that the Taoiseach must be carrying around a couple of shovels of halfpennies in his pockets because anybody conscious of the fact that the halfpenny has been abolished and conscious of the 2½ per cent increase on unit prices, and allowing for the impact of a further 6d. in the £ on consumer prices generally, can only regard the Taoiseach's statement with cynicism.  One can say that cigarettes will go up by 2d. per packet. Personally I would have preferred a straight budgetary 2d. on cigarettes rather than have the cascading effect of the turnover tax, and I do not think the Minister for Health would have been too perturbed if the Minister for Finance had acted in that manner.</P>
    <P>Then you come to the application of the increased turnover tax to stout, petrol and other commodities, and when one bears in mind that currently the master bakers are looking for an extra 2d. or 3d. on the loaf of bread, exclusive of turnover tax, one finds that the overall net effect will be a 3 per cent, a 3½ per cent and eventually even a 4 per cent increase.</P>
    <P>This is rather a stupid thing for the Government to do at this point of time, even in terms of public reaction. <Col N="1963" /> The reaction will be that after 1st May there will be continual allegations that the cost of living has once again gone into orbit, and, naturally and understandably, there will be allegations that pensioners and housewives are suffering most and that all this has been done by deliberate Government action in introducing a 5 per cent turnover tax.</P>
    <P>The tax itself, of course, is not generally defensible.  There is a preoccupation on the part of the Government to extend indirect taxation.  I do not know whether that is caused by the fact that members of the Cabinet have been so long earning ministerial salaries so far above those of workers in transportable goods, who take home £22 or less per week, or that they think that it is not likely that the full 2½ per cent will be imposed on the totality of their salaries.  Presumably they will leave some of their salaries in the bank; possibly they will invest some of it.  A similar opportunity is not afforded industrial workers who, on average, rarely earn more than £22 per week in large urban areas.</P>
    <P>Therefore, it is true to say that the broadly based turnover tax covers many necessaries of life in a discriminatory manner.  The lower the income, the greater the incidence of tax. Perhaps it may seem almost gratuitous to Members of the House that such elementaries of life are being repeated since they were fully argued in 1963 at the time of the introduction of turnover tax.  However, the Government must accept that this particular taxation imposes an additional burden on all lower paid and middle income groups.  It certainly bears no relation to the capacity of any particular family to pay tax.  These are basic objections to the inherently inequitable approach in this Budget.</P>
    <P>This turnover tax will automatically increase the cost of living and, consequently, will give rise to demands for increases in wages and salaries with all the serious implications that such demands can have in relation to cost and in relation to the competitive position of the country.  It is foolish to put on this extra 2½ per cent in turnover <Col N="1964" /> tax at a time when we are so much concerned about the general competitiveness of Irish exports and when stability of prices should be considered to be the prime objective of the Government.  It is a stupid move on the part of the Government deliberately to increase prices on a wide range of consumption.  What the Government have done will have undesirable economic consequences.  It is important to know that in relation to Budget reaction, a spokesman for the Irish Congress of Trade Unions deplored the increase in turnover tax and said this meant that retail prices during the coming year could now be expected to increase by ten per cent.  He said that this action by the Government cannot be regarded as a contribution towards an incomes and prices policy. He went on to say that one expects that the underlying motive in the choice of turnover tax is to begin an aligning of turnover tax with the rates of added value tax in the Common Market.</P>
    <P>My view is that the Government should have had more patience and that they should not have been so preoccupied by the added value tax implication of the Common Market. In that regard we might take note of the experience of Italy or that of France.  The Government might take a leaf from the book of General de Gaulle in relation to the line he took when he got himself into trouble in relation to his general value added taxation policy.  They might have stopped short of imposing general taxation on the lines suggested.</P>
    <P>If I have been excessively vocal in terms of criticism of the turnover tax, I consider that criticism to be deserved because this is another big step away from the principle that ability to pay should be the primary consideration governing tax policy.  This basic aspect of taxation has been almost completely forgotten by the Government. At page 15 of the Budget statement, Deputy Haughey says:</P>
    <P>In December the Taoiseach announced that, in the Government's view, increases in overall income in 1970 should be kept within a limit of 7 per cent.  He suggested that, <Col N="1965" /> in this year in new agreements, the increase should be limited to about 30s a week per adult male worker.</P>
    <P>The only comment I can make on that is that in view of the general increase in prices together with the increase in the rate of turnover tax the Taoiseach will have to have a critical review of his concept of 7 per cent.  To say any more than that would be almost irrelevant because that kind of proposition will not have the approval of industrial workers who are faced with increases in the prices of normal commodities.</P>
    <P>On page 13 of the Minister's statement we read:</P>
    <P>The Government are increasingly concerned about the position of the lower paid and weaker sections.</P>
    <P>  Further on in the statement we are told that the proposals which will shortly be announced are evidence of the Government's determination to ensure that the weakest do not go to the wall in this process.  The Minister for Finance proclaimed 1969 as the year of the lower paid worker but I do not think there is anything in this Budget to suggest that particular approach on the part of the Government in relation to the lower paid workers.</P>
    <P>Admittedly, the lower paid worker gets a relief of about 4s 9d a week in terms of income tax but that is no particular exposition of increasing concern on the part of the Government for workers in this category especially when one realises that in terms of general relief, I and others will gain £12. Therefore, the Budget is unimaginative and inconsequential in terms of its making any major impact on the earnings of lower paid workers.  I do not wish to labour this point beyond its due role in the Budget Statement.</P>
    <P>I have waited patiently for the past two or three years for the Government to introduce some measure to deal with a piece of taxation that arose from the NIEC physical planning report No. 26. This report was available in the second half of 1969 and there seems to be no good reason why the recommendations made in that report could not have been implemented in Government taxation policy.  The report pointed out <Col N="1966" /> that there was a growing demand for sites in major urban areas and for property within these expanding areas. The report points out:</P>
    <P>The increase in values may be caused by a community's growth or may depend on whether or not a variety of services is provided by some community agency; the benefit accrues to the owners of land and existing property.  When existing owners take their capital gains by selling their land or property, there is a transfer of money from the purchaser to the seller associated with increases in the prices and rents of houses and other buildings.</P>
    <P>The report then goes on to make a very strong statement indeed:</P>
    <P>The arguments against the enjoyment by individuals of gains created by the community's efforts are as much moral and social as economic. Such gains hit at a basic tenet of any philosophy of incomes policy&mdash; namely, that there should be some recognisable relation between continuing efforts and productivity on the one hand and reward on the other.  These capital gains breed cynicism and envy and engender expectations of monetary rewards that cannot be realised outside the narrow field of speculative dealings. These reactions are the greater because the gains and their effects on house prices and rents are widely known and there is a widespread acceptance that they cannot be justified. The case for the community appropriating at least a part of the increment in land and site values has already been recognised in the Finance (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1968, under which income tax is charged on profits arising from the business of dealing in or developing land.</P>
    <P>It goes on to recommend:</P>
    <P>...that further steps should be taken to ensure that at least a substantial part of the increment in land values following new urban development should accrue to the community at large.  The introduction of a betterment levy, i.e., a charge in respect of the increase in the value <Col N="1967" /> of land arising from central or local government action, presents considerable difficulty.  A procedure for consideration is that followed in Craigavon and other similar developments in Northern Ireland as well as in new towns in Britain.</P>
    <P>Were I, or any other member of the Labour Party, to talk in the same terms as the NIEC about the community appropriating at least a part of the increment in land and site values we would be branded as dangerous.  We would be denounced at every chapel gate.  I suggest that the Minister for Finance, Deputy Haughey, has had considerable experience in this field. The Taoiseach is aware of the development. The Minister for Local Government is equally well aware of the implications. We in the Labour Party believe that a land development tax or a land betterment tax should have been introduced in this Budget.  The impact of such a tax from the point of view of total State revenue might be marginal. I would not suggest such a tax as an alternative to the 2½ per cent increase in turnover tax, but I firmly believe such a tax should have been incorporated in the Budget.</P>
    <P>The report goes on to say:</P>
    <P>In the case of Craigavon an order was made vesting the full area required for the new city's development...in the Minister for Development, the land to be taken up by the Craigavon Development Commission as required.  The compensation to be paid was fixed by reference to the market value, at the vesting date in 1966, of the land in its existing use, subject to allowance being made for such increases in its value as seemed likely to occur without the full Craigavon development. Interest is paid at 8 per cent for the period between the date of vesting in 1966 and the date when compensation is settledelthis procedure ensures that the full increment in land values after the vesting date accrues directly to the community itself.</P>
    <P>NIEC then suggested that a similar procedure could be applied here for new developments by local authorities <Col N="1968" /> or for new towns.  They pointed out that this would require legislative change.  They went on to say:</P>
    <P>As an interim measure, while the need for statutory change is being explored, local authorities should continue to be encouraged to acquire land at its existing value well in advance of their need and of the announcement of their development plans; it would also be desirable if a means could be found to speed up compulsory acquisition procedures.</P>
    <P>The only comment I have to make on that, apart from expressing my very deep disappointment that there was no effort made to incorporate in this Budget any of these proposals, is that the alleged outward-looking Fianna Fáil Party, the party which is to transform the country in the 'seventies, has certainly not lived up even to its own pretensions in this Budget.  The growth centres have yet to be designated.  It is inevitable that Fianna Fáil property speculators, and other property speculators, too, will take a very keen interest in the hinterlands of these centres with a view to making a capital gain.  It is time we took steps to prevent that kind of evolution.</P>
    <P>I know there will be snide comments from Fianna Fáil, or from some members of it, at any rate, about the suggestion that a capital gains tax should be introduced.  We, in the Labour Party, would like to see a development tax on land.  Comparing our tax structure with Britain's the result is unimpressive.  In Britain, six new taxes have been introduced in recent years: corporation, capital gains, betting, selective employment, land betterment and special investment levy.  All these have been introduced and none of them has had the same regressive impact as the turnover tax itself.</P>

      <P>I shall continue very briefly to develop the point I was making last night.  Every primary school has a traditional catchment area and if you are to claim that children from other catchment areas could be included in the possible future attendance at a different school, obviously it would not be very difficult to make figures available which would show that school was entitled to a certain number of teachers and would be able to maintain them.  I do not think I need go further: this is obviously a very unrealistic approach.  In regard to the general question of amalgamation, we shall continue as heretofore to have consultations with all concerned, parents, managers and teachers, and will endeavour as best we can to give as much satisfaction as possible to all concerned.  I should add that obviously no matter how long discussions are carried on somebody must ultimately make a decision and that decision must be made in the interests of the children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of parent/teacher/ manager committees, the desirability of such committees in connection with the working of our national schools is receiving growing support among parents, managers and teachers.  As I have said on a number of occasions, the Catholic hierarchy have expressed approval of this development and <Col N="1970" /> have counselled managers of Catholic national schools on the advisability of establishing such committees.  A statement issued to the Press by the conference of bishops puts it this way:</P>
    <P>The Bishops approved of some broad principles for the formation of manager/teacher/parent associations for primary schools.  The object of such associations is to help facilitate the involvement of parents in the work of the schools particularly as regards the religious and moral foundation of the children and to encourage communication and co-operation between parents and managers and teachers without prejudice to their respective functions.</P>
    <P>Many national schools among our Protestant people are long familiar with local committees established in connection with individual national schools.  Such advisory committees would undoubtedly be highly beneficial to the efficient working of our national school system.  Teachers would find in such contacts with the parents powerful aids not only in matters of discipline and improvement in the children's performance but also in an increased understanding of the personality of the individual child.  This would obviously be of great assistance to the teacher in deciding the teaching approach which would be appropriate to each child and it would lead to a lessening of the tensions and frustrations in both pupils and teachers which I think is the greatest single difficulty encountered by both.</P>
    <P>The parents' aid could be fruitfully enlisted in many areas, the supervision of homework and the securing of punctuality on the part of the pupil. This would create an attitude of understanding and co-operation between parents and teachers and pupils and would inevitably lead to a happy atmosphere in the school and this would be the real foundation for fruitful work.  Both managers and teachers would benefit from the activities of such advisory committees in the help they would give in providing extra facilities for extra-curricular activities and provision of additional finances for local projects of an educational nature. I think this is particularly essential in <Col N="1971" /> relation to the introduction of the new curriculum.  It should be remembered that it is the very essence of such committees that they should be local and truly representative of the parents of the children at school, that they should be voluntary and as informal as possible. It should also be remembered that such committees would and should have no control over the purely professional work of the teacher in the school nor should they try to usurp the functions and authority of the managers.  On the other hand, the opinions of such committees on the working of our national school system would be a valuable source of information when educational policy comes to be discussed at a national level. Again, as I have already done, I strongly advocate the formation of these committees.</P>
    <P>In speaking of the new curriculum last night I forgot to mention one matter which I think I should now mention.  Deputy Desmond asked if copies of the new curriculum would be available to Deputies.  As soon as they are prepared they will be circulated.</P>
    <P>I should now like to refer to school management.  In our approach to an assessment of the managerial system we must be quite clear that our objective is to arrive at the type of educational structure which would best serve the needs of our primary school children.  We should not change for purely doctrinaire reasons.  The managerial system, by and large, has served the country well and the majority of our people have confidence in it.  It ensures the close integration of moral, religious and secular education which undoubtedly corresponds to the wishes of all the people whatever their religion may be.  It commands the confidence and respect of the teachers and I feel that they, more than others, are in a position to judge the efficiency of the system.</P>
    <P>It is true that where a large number of people are involved, as in the case of school managers, there are likely to be individuals who may not be as efficient as others in the discharge of their duties.  This is a human situation but to condemn the system because <Col N="1972" /> of the shortcomings of a few would be a very unwarranted generalisation. We would have no guarantee that whatever system would replace the present system, if we were ever to consider changing it, which I have no intention of doing, would work any better.  I am pretty certain we would find that in any system we tried to develop some people would be more attentive to their duties than others.  However, that does not mean that the system cannot be improved, or that an effort is not being made by those concerned to improve it.</P>
    <P>Changes and developments are taking place.  Patrons and managers of our national schools have shown in recent years that they are fully aware of the demands which a changing system of education will make and is making on the task of governing schools and they are equipping themselves to meet these demands.  Where appropriate younger and more vigorous men are being appointed as managers. Advisory courses and councils for managers are being set up.  The Catholic clerical managers have established a central bureau with wholetime officials who deal specifically with problems of managing schools and bringing about a better and closer liaison between the managers and the Department.</P>
    <P>As I have already mentioned, the Catholic Hierarchy have counselled the managers throughout the country to establish voluntary committees to secure the greater co-operation of the parents.  I might add that there is already, of course, participation of parents, teachers and managers in a positive and meaningful way.  I am referring to the school reports which are now furnished yearly to the parents on the progress of their children.  Of themselves these bring the parents and teachers and managers more into contact with one another than ever before.</P>
    <P>As I said at the beginning, I am avoiding a doctrinaire approach.  We want what is best for our children and not just something which satisfies a theory or a doctrine.  The managers are adapting to the needs of modern education. I have pointed out the ways in which they are doing this and, in relation to the manager/teacher/parent <Col N="1973" /> committees, we are getting more co-operation than ever before.  The more people we can involve in education on a voluntary basis the better.</P>
    <P>I should like to say a few words now about disadvantaged children.  A number of these disadvantaged children are being educated in our schools but their childhood experiences have in no way prepared them to participate in the normal school classes in the way that would be demanded of them.  Of course, this places them in a rather unfavourable position in trying to keep pace with their more fortunate classmates. If one adds to this the lack of parental encouragement and the possibility of limited intelligence, it is easy to understand why school life must seem so alien to them and why many of them are to be found in the weaker sections of the class.</P>
    <P>In order to investigate this problem a project jointly sponsored by the Department and the Van Leer institute is at present in progress in the Rutland Street School.  I had the pleasure, as Deputies are probably aware, of officially opening this centre yesterday. A team consisting of a doctor, a psychologist, a nurse, social workers and specially selected teachers, is participating in this project.  A group of children of a specific age, home background and so on is being taught by teachers who are using the most modern teaching techniques in a modern school setting.</P>
    <P>At entry each child is given a medical examination and a psychological assessment, the results of which are taken into consideration when planning the child's subsequent education so that he can derive the maximum benefit from it.  The approach here is geared specifically to the disadvantaged child and it encompasses numerous every-day activities which very often have been neglected in the child's early upbringing. The ultimate aim, of course, is to apply the findings to the education of children in similar projects throughout the country.  I will deal with this later and give Deputies more details of what is involved.</P>
    <P>Despite the fact that the new primary school programme was designed for all children, it seems reasonable to <Col N="1974" /> hope that it will help to introduce under-privileged children in particular to aspects of life which they might never otherwise experience, for example, nature study, social and environmental studies, arts and crafts, and so on.  We should be encouraged by the fact that the new curriculum is designed, as I said yesterday, to be sufficiently flexible to allow each child to progress at the pace best suited to himself and to achieve satisfaction and success at his own level.</P>
    <P>This is accomplished by means of the most modern teaching methods: group teaching, project work, group work, and so on.  It counters the now obsolete attitude that each child in an age group was expected to be in the same class and to progress at the same rate as every other child in the same age group.  It is obvious that this new approach takes realistic cognisance of the disadvantaged child who was left behind formerly since he usually could not keep up with his more fortunate fellows.  He may now hope to receive instruction which is especially tailored to his specific needs.  While this programme obviously is not the whole solution to the problem, I would hope that it will help in some way to offset the apparent discrepancy in performance and progress between disadvantaged children and their better-off companions.</P>
    <P>At post-primary level we are also making available educational guidance by teachers who have attended the pupil guidance courses organised by the Department.  I will deal with that in more detail later on also.  In relation to this particular aspect it is envisaged that in consequence of these guidance teachers being provided pupils will be more aware of the opportunities which are available to them when they leave school.</P>
    <P>It is also envisaged that a greater number will enrol for further courses which hitherto they may not have known existed.  I think this applies in particular to pupils whose parents have not got information on job and study opportunities and who are not sufficiently interested in their children's future to seek this information.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1975" /> The Rutland Street project was mentioned by a number of Deputies and perhaps they would be interested in knowing what is involved.  In 1967 the Department was considering what special measures could be put into effect to help national schools in the Rutland Street area to overcome the particular difficulties under which they were working.  Early in 1968 it became known that funds might be available from the Van Leer Foundation in Holland to enable a project, on a more extensive basis, to be put into operation.  The present project commenced in 1968 and it will run for a period of five years.  The total estimated cost is £180,000 and this includes teachers' salaries which will be borne jointly by the Department and the Van Leer Foundation.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the project is, first, to endeavour to offset the educational disadvantages of culturally deprived children in the area and, secondly, to obtain information which would help in remedying similar problems in other parts of the country.  The principal features of the project are the provision of a pre-school centre with special educational facilities for children aged from three to four years.  I officially opened this centre yesterday, although it has been in operation for some time. Such a project is helpful in making contact with the parents, which is a very important factor.  When speaking at the official opening yesterday I congratulated the parents on the co-operation they gave and are giving in this project and I should like to repeat my praise for them in this House today. The project would not have been possible without their whole-hearted co-operation and assistance.</P>
    <P>The next step is the integration of the pre-school centre with the existing infants' school in order to form one educational unit.  Finally, there is the evaluation of this project in whole and in part so that we can decide how we can assist other children throughout the country as well as the children in the Rutland Street area.  As a similar project has not been carried out elsewhere in this particular way it is also possible that useful information will <Col N="1976" /> be available to help other countries also.</P>
    <P>This project is directed by a steering committee comprising the school manager, a representative of the Department, a representative of the INTO, a representative of the Dublin Health Authority, a sociologist, an economist and a catechist.  The staff of the project is as follows: a project leader who is an inspector seconded from the Department, a research director&mdash;and in this case we have got the part-time services of the director of the research unit of St. Patrick's Training College&mdash;three teachers, whose number will be increased to six this year, three social workers, a nursery nurse and a secretary.  The part-time services of a Dublin Health Authority doctor and nurse are also provided.</P>
    <P>Another important aspect of the project is that special facilities include the provision of hot midday meals and generous educational equipment.  There is an experimental curriculum in operation at the pre-school centre at the moment and eventually we shall be able to provide a continuing curriculum to suit the children when the necessary research has been completed. This research is being carried out.</P>
    <P>At the moment a group of 90 children are enrolled and this number will be enrolled each year during the five-year period.  The infants' school will be drawn into the project after some time.  The evaluation of this project will enable the Department to decide whether any or all of the special measures should be continued at the end of the project period and what is learned there will be of value to us in other areas.  I have given those details so that Deputies will know exactly what we are doing.</P>
    <P>In my speech on the Supplementary Estimate last month I mentioned I had been in St. Conleth's Reformatory, Daingean, for a day to see how things were operating.  I neglected at that stage to thank the manager of the school and all those who are working there for all the excellent work they are doing.  At the time I said I was very interested in these children because I thought our main objective should be to try to help them while they were in the reformatory to reach <Col N="1977" /> a stage where they could be integrated into society when they left the reformatory. I felt we should do everything possible to ensure that they would not lapse back into the situation in which they had been prior to being sent to the reformatory.  I have been studying this matter since and, as I mentioned in my opening statement, I have made some changes.  We are providing more teachers and I think that, with the larger staff and the better pupil/teacher ratio, we will make considerable progress.</P>
    <P>I have also decided that one of the Department's psychologists will be assigned on a full-time basis to the three reformatories in Daingean, Kilmacud, Co. Dublin, and in Limerick and to the preventive Centre at Finglas which will be opened this year.  This centre, which is in the course of erection at the moment, will be a residential centre for delinquent boys. It could also function as a remand home.  The preventive centre will provide accommodation for 46 junior pupils from 10 to 14 years and 25 senior from 15 to 17 years for periods of not less than three and not more than 12 months.  Only first and second offenders will be referred to this centre.</P>
    <P>The aim will be to investigate the causes of each boy's delinquency and to try to correct their attitudes and behaviours again through suitable programmes of education and counselling and also by the involvement of social workers in the home environment while the boy is at the centre and in after care.  I think this will be a very important work and will help very considerably to remedy the situation in which these boys find themselves.  The remand home will accommodate 14 boys placed on remand by the courts for periods up to two weeks.  While these boys are on remand they will have psychiatric, psychological and educational assessment as well as suitable educational and recreational activities.</P>
    <P>On my Supplementary Estimate I spoke on the question of special education for mentally handicapped, physically handicapped and itinerants. Therefore, I do not intend to go into any further detail now except to express <Col N="1978" /> my appreciation for the exceptional work being done by the people of my Department in this field.  They are not only doing this as a job of work; they are involved personally in it.  I have no doubt that the strides that have been made in this field&mdash;and very considerable strides have been made in it in recent years&mdash;are due to the energy and enthusiasm put into it by the people in my Department who are responsible for it.  It is a matter in which I have a particular interest, possibly because of the fact that one of the John of God homes is in my own constituency.  I learned a lot from the work being done in that home over the years I have been in public life.  As I have previously mentioned in the Dáil, I should like to see all children in these categories catered for to the greatest possible extent.</P>
    <P>Deputy FitzGerald made reference to research which is alleged to have shown that there is a significant difference between English and Irish school children especially in relation to their ability to read English.  I think he said this difference amounted to 17 months in reading ability and that this was entirely due to the amount of time being spent in our schools on Irish.  It is alleged also that 40 per cent of the school time is spent on Irish.</P>
    <P>I want to make it quite clear that 40 per cent of the school day is not spent on Irish.  In fact, the suggested allocation in the new curriculum for Irish is very much lower than this, and this has come about because we now have very considerably improved teaching methods in relation to the Irish language.  To attribute the apparent disparity there is between English and Irish school children in their reading ability to the time factor is to ignore the fact that none of the tests employed were designed for Irish school children.  This, of course, rules out to a considerable extent the accuracy of any such test.  Furthermore, our schools until recent times had a very inadequate supply of suitable reading material.  This latter factor, which is at least as significant as the time allocation in its immediate results, was far more significant in its remote effects on reading habits and tests, and this <Col N="1979" /> has now received a great deal of attention from my Department.</P>
    <P>In co-operation with the city and county librarians a very satisfactory scheme, which is now in operation in about three-fifths of the country and which is gradually being extended to the whole country, will ensure that an adequate supply of interesting and stimulating reading material will be available in all our schools.  Ready access to suitable books has meant that children are now reading twice or three times as much as they had been reading previously.  They are now enjoying and cultivating a real taste for reading. The school time devoted to English and to other subjects which are taught through the medium of English together with the additional support which English gets through our school education on the radio and on television and social contacts, in my view, is quite sufficient to achieve an adequate standard in that language.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to go into any detail on the revision of the teacher training system.  I have dealt with it to some extent in my opening remarks, but in the course of the debate Deputy FitzGerald commented on what he said was a fall in the standards of those entering the training colleges.  The average number of honours in the leaving certificate obtained by entrants to the training colleges are as follows: 1967, 4.6; 1968, 4.1; 1969, 4.0; and 1969, 4.8 for girls.  We have no figures available for the other two years in relation to girls, but I am convinced that a slight fall in the case of the men can be explained by the fact that an extra 20 per cent were admitted to the college.  I believe also that neither the four honours in the case of the men nor the 4.8 honours in the case of women should cause us anxiety in regard to standards.  I should like to point out also that the applications for entry have increased by 33? per cent for men and about 20 per cent for women this year.</P>
    <P>The Deputy also said that if St. Patrick's Training College had taken in 100 extra students seven or eight years ago we would now have a greater number of teachers available.  We could <Col N="1980" /> not do that because the new college was being built at that time and maximum use was already being made of existing facilities.  The increased accommodation which subsequently became available is reflected in the large number of teachers who have qualified over the last six years.  During that period a total of 3,473 teachers qualified as compared with 2,802 during the preceding six years, an increase of over 100 teachers a year which amounts to 20 per cent in the six-year period.</P>
    <P>We have had complaints about overcrowding in classrooms in Dublin and, as I told Deputies in reply to their questions, we are endeavouring to combat this problem by training more and more teachers.  I would point out that we are training more teachers this year than ever before.  We have extern students attending St. Patrick's Training College and other training colleges for the first time.  By this means, together with our policy of amalgamation for small schools in rural areas, we are hoping to overcome the problem.  It is obvious that the steady growth of Dublin, with consequent increased enrolment in primary schools, is bound to create additional staffing problems; but, as I have said, these problems are being tackled.  During the five-year period from 1963-64 to 1967-68 enrolment in primary schools in Dublin city increased by almost 10 per cent while the number of teachers increased by 18 per cent.  I think these figures show that we are facing up to this extremely difficult problem.</P>
    <P>A complaint was also made that we are not preparing for the new curriculum by redesigning our schools, but in anticipation of curriculum changes the planning and furnishing of our primary schools underwent radical changes as far back as 1962.  Perhaps the most significant change was the increase in floor space per pupil from 11 square feet to 15 square feet.  This is a very substantial improvement because it means that the area of a standard classroom has been considerably increased. In new schools storage space has also been considerably increased and the heavy cumbersome desks have been superseded by lighter stackable tables and chairs.  These will facilitate the working of the new curriculum. <Col N="1981" /> Further modifications have been made to recent plans in order to provide even larger classrooms and more storage space, and we are also providing large general purpose rooms in our bigger schools.  These are proving invaluable in relation to the new curriculum activities, which cannot easily be carried out in ordinary classrooms. They are particularly useful for arts and crafts, music and physical education and also for the showing of educational films.  Many of our larger schools are also provided with a library.</P>
    <P>I am trying to keep my reply in an orderly fashion by moving from primary to post-primary education.  I think, then, that I should now take up the question of the transfer of pupils from primary to secondary or post-primary schools.  Psychologists, sociologists and educational researchers all agree that there is no one age which can be regarded as being a suitable age for all children to be transferred from primary to secondary schools.  The physical, emotional and intellectual development of children of 12 years of age covers such a wide range that it would be administratively impossible to have each one transferred at the time ideally suited for his own particular needs. Decisions therefore have got to be made on the balance of advantages and disadvantages and when my Department was coming to a decision on this it had to take a number of factors into consideration.</P>
    <P>At the age of 11 there is a transition from the level of concrete operational thought to that of formal operational thought which suits the changing teaching methods and approaches to learning which are encountered in second level education.  It is also true to say that the majority of children at 12½ years of age are emotionally and physically more akin to children of 14 years of age than they are to children of 11 years of age. This is especially true in the case of girls.  The primary school is organised so that each teacher is responsible for teaching all aspects of the curriculum to one class or group.  This type of school organisation fosters a link between the child and the teacher and <Col N="1982" /> this has proved eminently suitable to the social and emotional wellbeing of young children as well as to their intellectual development.  The class teacher can most effectively teach the integrated type of curriculum which suits primary school children up to the age of 12½ years, but the increasing depth of knowledge and the widening range of interests beyond that age, together with the need for teaching modern languages and science, call for a degree of specialisation which can best be provided by a team of subject teachers in a school where the organisation differs radically from that of the primary school.</P>
    <P>When arriving at the age that they thought proper for the transfer to post-primary school the Department took these matters into consideration.  They also took into consideration the educational research which was carried out in relation to this particular matter in other countries.  I shall quote from a few of these reports.  The first is the Plowden Report in Britain.  I quote from paragraph 385:</P>
    <P>The arguments in favour of 12 or 13 as the age of transfer are fairly evenly balancedel But on nearly every count it seems to us that the balance of advantage is just with 12 year old transfer, that is to say transfer in the September following the child's twelfth birthday, which gives a medium age of 12 years 6 months on admission to a secondary school.</P>
    <P>Now I quote from paragraph 4.5.4 of <i>Primary Education in Wales:</i></P>
    <P>There are therefore advantages and disadvantages in any age of transfer which is decided on.  The balance of advantage seems to be with median 12 years 6 months, which we have accepted as desirable as the long term aim.</P>
    <P>I have two quotations here from Scotland&mdash;one from <i>Primary Education in Scotland</i> and one from the report of the Scottish Council for Research in Education.  I quote from <i>Primary Education in Scotland,</i> H.M.S.O., 1965, page 218:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1983" /> The conclusion from all the available evidence must be that as yet no good reason has been adduced for changing the age of transfer in Scotland.</P>
    <P>I now quote from <i>The Transition to Secondary Education,</i> report of the Scottish Council for Research in Education, page 94:</P>
    <P>In the context of the present organisation of primary and secondary education in Scotland, our findings favour the present transfer age of 12.</P>
    <P>It is, of course, true that in some countries the transfer age is lower but there are so many other details involved here that they are not comparable.</P>
    <P>In the past the age of transfer was closely bound up with selection for secondary and vocational schools.  With the introduction of the transfer system of second level education it is possible to consider the age of transfer and the age of selection as two separate matters. Transfer need not involve selection when the transfer is to a comprehensive type of school and the selection then can, in effect, be deferred until the age of about 15.  The steady progressive nature of child development suggests that there should be no sudden or abrupt change involved in the transition from primary to post-primary education and study of recent changes made here in curricula for primary and post-primary schools will reveal a very conscious effort on our part to achieve this objective.  The senior classes of primary schools are gradually introduced to the various subjects as separate disciplines while, at the same time, the junior classes of post-primary schools occupy themselves with projects which bridge the gap between the disciplines. The terms &ldquo;primary&rdquo; and &ldquo;secondary&rdquo; or &ldquo;post-primary&rdquo; are coming now to mean the first and second stages of a continuous process of education.  The development of this particular attitude will mean that as time passes the age of transfer will lose much of its significance. It would probably be true to say that this is somewhat in line&mdash;I am not speaking of the actual age of transfer&mdash;with what has been suggested <Col N="1984" /> by Deputy Desmond, that we should not be concerning ourselves with education in separate compartments.</P>
    <P>This was borne in on me forcibly yesterday when I was opening a school in Rutland Street.  Children will be attending this school from the age of three and it struck me that the manner in which they were being educated at that stage would have an effect on their whole lives.  In this sense education is a progressive thing.</P>
    <P>I shall now refer briefly to teachers' salaries.  I have already dealt with this matter in my opening statement and I do not propose to add very much to that.  I made reference to the various disputes in relation to teachers' salaries. A number of Deputies also made reference to these disputes in what I can only describe as a most responsible manner.  I do not propose to dwell on this matter except to point out that solutions come readily to people who do not know all the aspects of what is involved.  Unfortunately for me I must find a solution which takes account of all the intricacies.  In other words, I must find a solution that is a real solution and not something that contains in itself the germs of future discord among teachers.</P>
    <P>I now propose to deal with a number of matters in relation to post-primary schools.  I should like to give the Deputies up-to-date information in relation to the comprehensive schools, to co-operation and pupil guidance but before dealing with that I want to say a few words on the question of corporal punishment.  From previous statements I have made at Question Time in reply to questions and supplementary questions I have made my position clear but for the record, perhaps, I should restate what I feel in regard to this matter which, as Deputy Desmond and others have said, is a very emotional one.  I will try, in what I have to say, to approach it as objectively as possible.</P>
    <P>Progress reported: Committee to sit again.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Tuesday, 28th April, 1970.</P>
