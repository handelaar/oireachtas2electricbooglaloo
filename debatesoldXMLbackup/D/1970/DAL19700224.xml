    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I said I am prepared to enter discussions&mdash;I thought it was Deputy Murphy who wanted me to repeat it.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Oh, he distracted the Deputy.  I see.  I am prepared to <Col N="1380" /> enter into discussions with the authorities in London or Belfast if it should appear to be timely and if it would appear to be conducive to promoting co-operation and goodwill between the people of Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach satisfied with the progress of reform in the area or has he noted the growing strength of reactionary forces in the Unionist Party?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I replied to the Deputy on those lines on 4th February.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach think that the situation calls for any meeting with Mr. Wilson to get an authoritative viewpoint from him, a correct assessment of the progress of reform in the area?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The situation does not warrant the Taoiseach's seeing Mr. Wilson now, is that the idea?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Oh, no.  I did not suggest that at all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am just saying that it is not timely just now.  I do not think it would be in the best interests of what the Deputy and I would like to achieve.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Taoiseach give any evidence of continuing interest in the problem in the area?  The Taoiseach has just said that he sees no point in meeting Mr. Wilson.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say I did not see any point.  I said it would not be timely just now and I do not think it would produce the results that we all desire to achieve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach satisfied that there is a similar continuation of interest in the British Government in the problem?  Is he satisfied that on their part, there is a realisation of the vital importance of preventing a right wing takeover in the north and that they are prepared and that they understand how serious this could be for peace in the north and, indeed, in this country generally?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not true.  I did not ask him.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that is true.  If the British Premier thinks it is opportune and timely I think he would see me.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The House is somewhat puzzled about how the Taoiseach can say that he is well-informed on the present approach of the British Government to the policy. As Deputy FitzGerald has said, they have been in continuous touch with the problem now for some months&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to my reply to questions addressed to me in this House on the 4th February in relation to recent live register returns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1383" /> Industrial expansion in Waterford is proceeding steadily.  Prospective employment in new industries and expansions of existing industries established in Waterford in 1969 will total over 400 jobs.  Three factories are under construction with a prospective employment potential of another 400 jobs.  Factories, as yet unallocated, are under construction in the industrial estate and more land has recently been purchased to extend the estate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that 200 people have become, or are about to become, redundant in Waterford?  Would the Taoiseach agree that Waterford is not as booming a city as the Government would like to paint it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware that 200 people are about to become redundant.  There has been a closure of a factory in which 12 people were employed, 11 of whom have been reemployed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I can state categorically that 200 people have become, or are about to become, redundant in Waterford.  Is that a picture of a booming town?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that if I were as hopeful and confident about employment in other parts of the country as I am about Waterford I should be be very satisfied.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Parliamentary Secretary if he would indicate the extent to which this substantial increase may be attributed to the failure of the Government to implement an incomes and prices policy?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Parliamentary Secretary inform us in respect of such commodities as meat and butter, enjoyed every day by the constituents of Dublin South West, if he considers increases in the region of 15 per cent over the past two years in the prices of such essential living commodities as a satisfactory performance on the part of the Government, particularly in the field of price surveillance and general price supervision in the country?  Are the Government so complacent as to think that a family can live in South West Dublin on £18 a week and have meat every day?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 to 9 together.</P>
      <P>There is no generally accepted definition of autism.  The term is used to describe a particular illness but is also used to cover a number of different mental illnesses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1387" /> There is no register of autistic children or adults and at present statistics of the total number of persons in this country in need of psychiatric care, who might be described as autistic, are not available.</P>
    <P>Two residential units have been specifically provided for the treatment of mentally ill children, including autistic children.  One is at St. Loman's Hospital, Ballyowen, County Dublin, the work of which is complemented by a day-centre at St. Kevin's Hospital.  The other is St. Paul's Hospital, Beaumont, Dublin.  Forty children, including ten pre-adolescents are being cared for in the unit at St. Loman's Hospital, of whom nineteen are from Dublin city and county and twenty-one from areas outside Dublin.  Admission to this unit has for some time past been restricted to children from the Dublin area. Accommodation for twenty-four children has been provided at St. Paul's Hospital which has recently opened. Eight children have so far been admitted, all of whom are from areas outside Dublin.  There are twenty-four children attending the day-centre at St. Kevin's Hospital, and six attending at St. Loman's on a day-basis.  It is anticipated that twenty children will later attend for day-care at St. Paul's Hospital.</P>
    <P>Seven children are on the waiting list for admission either to the residential unit at St. Loman's or the day-centre at St. Kevin's Twenty-seven applications have been received for admission to St. Paul's, some of which have not yet been assessed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister not agree that the diagnosis of autism is a rather specialised field of medicine, that people suffering from this disease require special treatment and should not be put together with what we call mentally retarded children?  Would the Minister not also agree that all facilities are centred in Dublin away from the provinces where most of the people live.  The whole approach of the Minister's Department to this question has been very poor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been the policy of the Department to secure residential <Col N="1388" /> accommodation and it is necessary to find people willing to accept teaching in those institutions.  It is not always possible to locate residential institutions in places where the children may be near their parents.  This difficulty is also experienced in other countries. The Deputy may think he is an expert on autistic children; I do not pretend to be one, but I have read accounts of this and there is, in fact, disagreement about what constitutes an autistic child.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not an expert on autism but I know that autistic children need specialised care, different to that required for mentally retarded children.  Will the Minister say why admission to St. Loman's Hospital is reserved for people from Dublin?  Are the people from the country to be treated as second-class citizens?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already indicated to the Deputy that steps have been taken to provide residential care for children from the country and we have recently had the opening of an extension to St. Paul's Hospital, Beaumont.  If the Deputy reads the reply in detail he will find that progress is being made.</P>

    <P>I shall, subject to the approval of the Minister for Finance, be making regulations under section 52 (2) of the Health Act, 1970, empowering health boards to make available, without charge, in-patient care for children with certain long-term diseases and disabilities, including mental handicap.  It is <Col N="1389" /> intended that the regulations will come into operation on 1st April, 1971, the date on which the new health boards will take over the operation of the health services from existing health authorities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Proposals for the provision of a new kitchen, stores and dining accommodation have been approved.  The buildings are to be erected on a site at present occupied by some existing buildings at the rere of the hospital including the boiler house and laundry which are to be replaced. It will not be possible to commence work on the new kitchen and the other approved accommodation until the site has been cleared.  The planning of a new central boiler house to serve St. Columba's Hospital and other buildings in the vicinity is in the final stages and planning is expected to be completed in about three months. Tenders can then be invited for the work which it is expected will take about nine months to complete.  It is not the intention to provide a new comprehensive laundry building as it is expected that laundry services for St. Columba's Hospital and other health institutions can be provided far more effectively on a centralised basis.</P>
      <P>Sketch plans for accommodation for nurses at St. Columba's Hospital were submitted to the Department last October.  Because of cost implications it was necessary to prepare revised plans.  These were submitted on 13th instant and are being examined.  A decision will be conveyed to the health authority at an early date.</P>

These missions usually involve maternity cases to which the flying squad ambulance is sent, coronary emergencies and major accidents.  In any particular case, the question whether a doctor travels with the ambulance depends on a number of factors such as the nature of the emergency, whether a doctor is already at the scene and whether a doctor is readily available at the ambulance station.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. Blaney) Neil T. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. Blaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been in constant touch with farmers in north-east Donegal and am fully acquainted with their opinions and their problems. Among the resulting benefits to farmers have been the introduction of a support price for oats, improved marketing and higher price for potatoes and priority in disease eradication with marked improvement in livestock prices.  Certain parishes in the area have been designated as special areas for agricultural development purposes. In addition, many measures introduced in western areas generally are of special importance in north-east Donegal. Among these I might mention the mountain lamb scheme, derating, the small farm (incentive bonus) scheme and the concessions to smallholders under the social welfare code.  Increased attention has been given to the provision of supplementary non-farm employment opportunities and new emphasis has been focussed on the problems of this and similar areas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is not on time and material here but, nevertheless, his question is more succinct than those I have been getting.  Yes, I have been meeting people who were representative of the farming interests in my county.  I have met the mountain sheep people for whom we have been doing a good job as I have just been trying to point out to the House.  I have also been meeting a member of the NAC whose invaluable advice has been available to me and whose organisation which, when it was operating and up to the time it was strangled, were doing very good work for Donegal and other counties.  I have also been meeting representatives of the committees of agriculture which I regard as being very representative of the farming community of any county. I have met these frequently not only at local level but at national level also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have also met a number of people who have served on many of our useful boards in Donegal north-east during the years, namely, the ACC representative, the potato export board representative, a member of An Comhairle Olla, a member of the Grain Board and some others who have had an opportunity of making known, where they can count, the views and requirements of the farmers in Donegal.  These meetings, together with my efforts and the efforts of my Fianna Fáil colleagues in Donegal, have had the effect of improving very considerably the outlook and lot of the farming community <Col N="1393" /> over what they enjoyed in the past, particularly under Governments headed by the people now sitting on the benches opposite.</P>

      <P>Ireland is represented at and participates in the work of both bodies.  The Agriculture Committee was set up by GATT at the end of 1967 with the objective of removing or reducing barriers to trade in agricultural products.  Much of its time since then has been devoted to the basic groundwork of compiling detailed reports and statistics about international production and trade in the major agricultural products.  The committee is now moving from the stage of identification of the problems involved to the stage of seeking acceptable solutions.</P>
      <P>The working party on dairy products, which was also set up at the end of 1967, has been exploring the possibility of achieving agreements for minimum export prices for dairy products, especially butter and skim milk powder.  So far, progress has been made in the case of skim milk powder, a draft agreement on which is at present being considered.</P>

      <P>Details of the average weekly carrying capacity since 1965 of scheduled service cattle boats are not available in my Department.</P>
      <P>At the beginning of 1965, scheduled shipping services to Britain for cattle were in operation from Dublin, Cork, Waterford and Drogheda.  Due to the closure of Fishguard as a cattle landing place and to very limited use of some of the other routes, scheduled services for cattle have since been discontinued in a number of cases and are now in operation only from Dublin to Birkenhead, Holyhead, and Glasgow. There are also at present weekly cattle sailings to Britain from Sligo and Wicklow.  I am advised that the cattle boats operating on schedule from Dublin on the cross-Channel routes have a combined carrying capacity of over 3,600 cattle and could take, with normal sailings, over 10,000 cattle per week.  This carrying capacity seems likely to continue to be available for the next few years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The concept of re-organisation, which involves amalgamation and rationalisation, is now generally accepted by the creamery industry and the majority of co-operative creamery societies have been giving the matter serious consideration. Notable progress has been made by some societies and in the case of the Dairy Disposal Company, I have given approval for negotiations in certain cases for the appropriate transfer of some of the company's creameries.</P>
      <P>I appreciate that the question of amalgamation is one which requires careful examination by creamery societies from the social as well as from the economic aspect and in an effort to assist societies which may have problems about the merits or de-merits of particular proposals I have decided to set up an independent group which would examine such proposals from the national, social and economic viewpoints.

      <P>Yes, the last time they sought to see me.  I decided that, because of the overall considerations, as distinct from purely local considerations, and from the economic and <Col N="1400" /> social aspects, it would be well to have some group which could be regarded as neutral in so far as this examination would be concerned to examine into the proposed amalgamation and advise me on it before it was either thrown out or put into operation, the idea being to examine the actual proposed amalgamation at any given point and not to make new proposals on how to do the job.  We have had enough of those.  This is to examine the matter in the actual details of its application.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister consider £12 a sufficient inducement to a dairy farmer to go into beef production?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it was ever held out to be that because, as the House will recognise, no one case may be quite comparable with another. Undoubtedly the £12 will be a help to those who switch from milk production. Whether it is sufficient to induce farmers to get out of milk and into beef is another matter.  It was never intended to be a sufficient inducement.  It was intended to help those who were thinking of going into milk, but who had not made up their minds, and those producing milk who were thinking that they would, perhaps, be just as well out of it.  We had these two categories in the milk end of it in mind when we devised this scheme.  Of course, over and above that, perhaps sufficient justification for the scheme on its own, is the fact that, if the question of the milk situation had never entered into this, the £12 scheme would be well justified as an encouragement to the production of more beef as such.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will agree that there are some farmers who as a result of the recent phased increase in the price of creamery milk now stand to lose and, if the beef subsidy scheme was sufficient to induce them, there there would be a change?  Is the Minister further aware that a dairy cow costs the Exchequer approximately £27 to subsidise and, therefore, there is a case to be made for an increase in the beef subsidy from £12?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already made out all this sort of sums.  In fact, I could give the Deputy quite a few more interesting ones.  This is not <Col N="1402" /> answering the Deputy's own question, which I think he is attempting to do. Twenty-seven pounds per dairy cow, on average, is low.  We pay more than that, probably nearer to £35 per cow, which gives added weight to the point the Deputy is making.  It does not follow that it is, in fact, in the best national interest to give an equal sum to take a man out of milk production and put him into beef production because there are people who have not been in milk enjoying the £12 under this scheme and who would be entitled to enjoy the £27 or the £35 if it were raised.  They are quite a number of thousands and the herds number hundreds of thousands that were never producing milk.  Would the Deputy have us provide a scheme as an alternative to milk production for the milk producer and ignore the beef producer who has never been a problem in so far as milk is concerned?  If we were not to do that, this would cost us immensely more than the Deputy seems to think.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I just say that every utterance and every action of this Government in these recent years and, indeed, for years past, would give an assurance to the dairying industry that their future will be at least as good as their present and, perhaps, a lot brighter and that there is no basis for the suggestions by some inspired people that the dairying industry is finished or that it is on its way out or that the Government are trying to kill it.  This is totally and absolutely the reverse of what the Government, in fact, are endeavouring to do and are doing very successfully at this time because, as I indicated in reply to Questions Nos. 25 and 27, in this year we are very likely to exceed the targets set as many as five years ago for milk out-turn by the dairying industry.  We are most likely to do it and if anybody wanted to bet on it, I would say that he could safely do so in favour of its turning up.  More than that nobody can say in regard to the likely out-turn of milk in a given year but we are on target, in fact, slightly above, in the present year and we are likely to be above it next year and that target was not set yesterday or the day before. It was set over five years ago when milk out-turn was somewhere in the region of 300 million gallons a year instead of the 500 million odd that it has reached in the meantime.  This should be an assurance, and I hope it is taken as an assurance by the dairying industry, that we are with it, as we have been right over these years in building it up to what it is and that its future is as good now as it may have been seen to be five or two years or even one year ago.</P>

      <P>I reject entirely that there is any penalising of anybody in the milk industry.  I particularly reject the suggestion that any penalty falls <Col N="1407" /> on the efficient farmers.  On the contrary, they have been helped to that high degree of efficiency by the kindness and consideration of successive Fianna Fáil Governments during the years.  Fianna Fáil have built the efficient farmer up so that his net profit is greater than he ever thought of enjoying in the disastrous year of the Coalition, 1956, when cows as well as people were leaving.  A real difficulty here has been a problem which elsewhere has been regarded as being impossible of solution.  We have been trying to get more cows while, at the same time, because of the depressed nature of dairy produce and the market therefor, we have been trying not to have too much milk.  This is a rather difficult question and the Government have been and are doing everything possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Foley</NameTxt>
      <P>When I reported progress I was referring to water and sewerage in County Dublin and I had paid a special tribute to the Minister for Local Government for sanctioning so readily tenders which had been submitted in the years 1968-69 and 1969-70. In relation to work which has been commenced, I want to cast some aspersions on the contractors who are carrying out the work on behalf of the county council and Dublin Corporation. Recently I had to approach a contractor who was laying a 24-inch water main from Clonshough, along by Baskin Cottages and crossing the fields to Dublin Airport.  The road itself is quite narrow, 15 to 18 feet; it is known as Baskin Lane or Clonshough Lane. Permission was granted to the contractor to close the road after 1st February.  The contractor went about his work and the road was closed from <Col N="1415" /> 17th January.  Although this is in the county council area it is the corporation who are laying the main.  I asked the corporation to survey this area and to get the contractor to put the road back in reasonable repair.</P>
      <P>Anyone will accept that when development is taking place a certain amount of disturbance will be caused but the people in this area were stranded from their homes for days because the contractor refused to put any kind of surface on the road which he had dug up.  The contractor waited until 5.40 each evening to fill in the road so that he would not waste time and would not have to pay overtime. This is grossly unfair on the part of the contractor.  There is going to be more of this.  There is another instance of it at Howth Junction Cottages and I shall come to that later.  All this contractor seems to be interested in is getting on with the work and he disregards the people involved.  I do not want to name the Clonshough contractor here because it would be grossly unfair but if the Minister is not aware of his name I will submit it to him.  The Minister should withhold the rest of the financial contributions from the contractor involved in this case until the road is put in reasonable repair.  At one time there was a 9-foot fall in the road and the contractor did not even bother to put a light on it. Surely there is a danger to the people in the area and particularly to the people who use this road to get to Dublin Airport.  I would ask the Minister to do something about this because we have failed.  The contractor seems to ignore not only public representatives but the corporation and the county council as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I mentioned Howth Junction Cottages. The Minister might not be aware that the corporation are taking a portion of land from the people who live in a group of 12 cottages at Howth Junction-Kilbarrack.  We have asked the corporation on numerous occasions to put some kind of a road in to these cottages and have failed.  To save the corporation's skin along comes the contractor to widen the road and lay a sewer, and this has been the excuse <Col N="1416" /> for the past two years.  During this period people have had to wallow through five or six inches of mud, particularly during the frosty and snowy weather.  I brought a corporation official out to this area; he was very courteous and agreed to look into it, but there is still no proper surfaces leading to these houses.  I would ask the Minister to receive a deputation from the people concerned.</P>
    <P>The county council have shown willingness to build houses in County Dublin.  However, I referred last Thursday to the defects of the county council system and to the fact that the county council have had land for over two years in Ballyboughal, and Garristown and other places.  They have held land in those areas for four or five years, and in one case for eight years, without making a move in regard to it. There are people living in huts and hovels and the county council are not making use of the means available to provide houses for these people.  The NBA should be brought into Dublin County Council to build houses in unserviced areas where the county council have refused to build them. There is no need for searching for land or negotiating.  The land is available and all that is required is that somebody would go about the matter in a workmanlike way.  I am sure these people could be housed very shortly. Private developers can buy land, go through the formalities of getting planning permission and be working on the site in about eight months.  The county council plan seems to be to buy land well in advance.  In some cases they have bought land up to eight years in advance of building.  Land should not be left idle while people remain unhoused. The housing list is growing all the time but the county council are not assisting the people.  The NBA should do something about the position.</P>
    <P>I would like to bring the position of the Collinstown cottages to the Minister's notice.  The occupants of these cottages were informed by the county council, and also by the Department of Transport and Power, that they would be re-housed in Turnapin Lane or elsewhere.  That was eight <Col N="1417" /> years ago.  The late Deputy Seán Dunne was representing County Dublin at that time.  When I came in I took up the cause of these people. The plight of these people has been investigated on one occasion on behalf of the county council.  The officials of the Department of Transport and Power have not visited the area.  The fumes from the jets, which run 55 feet from the last dwelling in the row of cottages, are blown through those houses and are very noticeable.  I would like to ask the Minister for Transport and Power to stand in one of those houses while a Boeing is taking off.  If the Minister knew how bad the fumes are in those houses the occupants would be re-housed by the county council within two or three weeks.  I called a meeting of the people in those cottages and they consented to go to Santry Avenue.  I must compliment the Minister because sanction has been given for the building of houses in Santry Avenue to assist these people.  The county council refused to extend the water supply from the end of the road, which is only 275 yards from the last cottage, into the cottages.  They refused six years ago, last year and three weeks ago.  They said it was unnecessary to spend money on the supply because the people were to be re-housed.  It is unjust that these people should be deprived of water and I hope they will be compensated by the local authority.  The people in these houses have had only one contact with the local authority and that was eight or nine months ago.  The local authority should negotiate with the people now to see what water supply is needed in the cottages.</P>
    <P>The progress of the county council is impeded by virtue of the fact that the county council are under dual managership.  The county council should have a separate individual representing them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesmondFoley" hpid="Mr. Foley Mr. Foley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foley</NameTxt>
      <P>Such an individual could be called an assistant manager. A position could be created for someone who would have sole responsibility for the Dublin County Council with particular reference to housing, water <Col N="1418" /> and sewerage.  The Dublin County Council, who are a body with a large amount of land under their control and with great responsibility, should at least be given a separate identity, manager-wise.  I would advocate that an assistant manager be given to the Dublin County Council to look after their responsibilities, as has happened in the past.  This worked well.  It was not a specific nomination but an assistant city manager took particular interest in the provision of houses in County Dublin.  I would like to see this practice continued on a specific basis. The position of the Dublin County Council should be clarified.  The city and county manager should not be involved in the county's affairs.  I am not casting aspersions on the present man who has filled the job adequately. He has been trying to control and satisfy two local bodies who do not pull together very well&mdash;Dublin Corporation and Dublin County Council.</P>
      <P>I have been dealing with group water schemes and I would ask the Minister to look into the matter.  I have had no difficulty whatever with the Department of Local Government regarding these schemes.  The engineers and officials involved were more than ready to meet the local people at any time.  They have been at meetings up to 8 or 9 o'clock at night.  We have some successful group water schemes in County Dublin.  The officials from the Department were ready to assist in every way.  The county council should have a specific involvement in these schemes.  They should have responsibility for them.  They should do part of the secretarial work.  It is a good thing to have local people involved in these schemes but they should be helped by the local authority.  There is too much involved for people without a public representative helping them.  They are entitled to organise without the help of a public representative. They are looking for something to which they are entitled.  The grants are given by the Department and are available but the local authority should have some specific involvement in them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The local authorities have not been sufficiently aware of the need for community <Col N="1419" /> centres.  They have not responded readily enough to the needs of the public in the big built-up areas. Many people have come to live in County Dublin in the last ten years. These people brought with them growing families in need of specific types of care which cannot be given readily at home and is not given in the schools.  It is the type of care which is needed after school hours.  We have no facilities in County Dublin for giving children this type of care to avoid the hazards we read about of children taking drugs and such.  How can we blame them if they fall into such habits when we are not looking after them and when we do not show responsibility for them by providing well-equipped community centres so that they have a place to spend their leisure time?  The Dublin County Council have not planned specifically for community centres.  Large open spaces are usually allowed go wild before somebody decides exactly who will take them over.  Eventually they are taken over and some of them are kept very well.  No community centre of any great note has been erected by the Dublin County Council.  The time has come when this matter should be tackled in a vigorous manner.  The local authority should set about building community centres as soon as possible, otherwise we will have a great problem on our hands with regard to our youth.  At the moment our young people have not such facilities.</P>
    <P>A few years ago parks were allowed go wild by the local authority, but at present I think the position is a little better.  The local authority have now taken over most open spaces and parks, but builders are being allowed get away with too much.  They squeeze in as many houses as possible and leave only a small open space.  In many cases we find that just as the development has been finished, the required amount of open space has not been left by the developer.  There is not a lot the Minister can do at that stage, but in the planning stage it should be made quite certain that a desirable amount of open space is left available. In places like Ashtown and the Navan <Col N="1420" /> Road area we are in a dilemma with regard to open spaces.  There is not sufficient open spaces where the children can play any games.  In one case, they are left with a mud pond to play on.  From his point of view, of course, the developer did nothing wrong: he left an open space.  He left a pond for the children to play in, but whether this can be classified legally as an open space I do not know.  The developer should be compelled to leave ground which at least can be used as a playing pitch or some place where a community centre can be erected.  In this particular place in Ashtown the space left is fit for nothing.  It would have to be drained, resurfaced and soil spread on it before it could be used.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully referred to the Swords Road.  I emphatically blame Dublin County Council for this matter, although Deputy Tully expressed doubts about the Minister's innocence with regard to this.  I have been listening to talk about the by-pass for Swords for the last 12 to 14 years, but nothing concrete has ever come out of it.  I do not think any definite proposal has been put to the Department in regard to this by-pass.  Deputy Tully said there was a shortage of staff.  Possibly, that is right; but there is no shortage of outside consultants.</P>
    <P>Dublin County Council have employed an outside consultant in regard to the Swords Road.  This road is a hazard not alone to people using it but also to the people living on it. You cannot put your nose out a gateway on the Swords Road without seeing a big truck or a car doing over 60 miles an hour.  I was on that road today and the amount of traffic was enormous.  The problem is particularly bad between 4.20 p.m. and 5.20 p.m. each afternoon.</P>
    <P>The county council have made haphazard efforts to straighten this road and to acquire land adjacent to it, but nothing positive has been done.  It is no wonder the people of Swords are kicking up about it.  The people in Balbriggan and elsewhere are concerned about what is to happen to their town.  Why is a definite proposal not put to the Department, sanction sought and the necessary land acquired?  All <Col N="1421" /> the farmers on the road are saying that the by-pass is to go through their particular place and the county council are saying it is going through some other place, but nothing specific is being done.  Let us hope that within a very short time the county council will come up with some definite proposal and dispel the lack of knowledge on the part of the people of Swords in regard to the by-pass.  If this by-pass were started it would be of great value to the road users in that area. I hope when this proposal comes before the Minister there will be no delay as far as he is concerned.</P>
    <P>Caravan sites are common nowadays. On the Swords Road you can see them one after the other.  Where the county council widened the road at the Coachman's Inn there are itinerant caravan sites on the right and I noticed one on the left this morning.  Those sites are growing in numbers and in size.  There is no legal method of removing those people, because they simply set up somewhere else.  Deputies have been speaking about this problem in this House for years.  They have spoken about how to facilitate them and house them.  It is a good idea that they should be housed.  The Minister is most sympathetic to the housing of itinerants and has urged all local authorities to house them as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>It is very unsightly to see itinerant sites on main roads and it is only right that facilities should be provided for them on backroads, or an special sites allocated just outside towns, or in the middle of towns if they want it that way.  Those people deserve a great deal of sympathy because of their way of life. Most of them have inherited this way of life, but today there are some who have not inherited it.  They just live in caravans to avoid the rent and rates system and adapt themselves to that way of life.  I know of two caravans on the Rathbeal Road and the people concerned are not itinerants.  They simply live in caravans.  Some place should be provided for those people so that they can be taken off the main roads.</P>
    <P>The maximum loan of £3,000 is becoming <Col N="1422" /> inadequate.  The price of housebuilding is going up from day to day. Deposits are climbing higher and higher, and consideration should be given to raising this loan ceiling.  The Minister should, if at all possible, if financial commitments allow, consider raising it to £3,500.  The wages ceiling for individuals to qualify them for a loan should also be increased to £1,500.  We have many people who fill up their forms falsely to try and qualify for a county council loan.  The ceiling is definitely too low at present. Although people are earning quite a lot, the standard of living has increased by that much more.  Facilities should be given to enable these people secure county council loans and grants without having the scrutiny we have had over the last year and a half. Apparently there has been a standstill on supplementary grants.  It is next to impossible to get the council to qualify an individual who has lived all his life in the county but, on marriage, had to move to the city for three or four months, perhaps, awaiting a house.  The difficulty is in getting such a person to acknowledge that he is a native of County Dublin, even though he has a letter from his parish priest to that effect.  I think the ceiling should be increased to £1,500 in the case of applicants and to a maximum of £3,500 in respect of the loans for which they qualify.</P>
    <P>The standard of public lighting in County Dublin is deplorable from several points of view.  Taking any outlying areas in the county or even areas such as Clondalkin or Palmerstown, any large built-up area, we find there is a light here and 100 yards away another wooden pole with &ldquo;a bit of a candle&rdquo; on it and perhaps the same a further 100 yards away on a bend.  The county council have sanctioned lights for these areas but responsibility does not lie completely with the county council.  The council have made provision for these areas in one way or another but the matter has gone to the ESB and this is where the crux arises. The ESB have, or had up to a couple of weeks ago, no time to deal with county council lights and, as a result, the people must walk the streets in <Col N="1423" /> semi-darkness and the motorists must put up with facilities such as they would get in a small country village.</P>
    <P>It is wrong that the ESB should get away with it when lights sanctioned by the local authority have not been erected.  If they cannot do the work the local authority should have been notified two or three years ago to that effect.  Then the local authority could local authority should have been notified two or three years ago to that effect.  Then the local authority could have organised its own lighting section, as the corporation did.  The county council must now do that but it is so late that practically everybody is hounding the council and blaming them because the general standard of lighting is bad.  The first thing on the agenda at any residents' meeting in County Dublin is local lighting and public representatives can only say that lighting schemes have been sanctioned, to which they reply: &ldquo;We heard this three years ago.  Why do the county council not carry them out?&rdquo; The local authority is blamed, I think unfairly, because the blame should rest on the ESB who have fallen down on the job.</P>
    <P>I deplore the discrimination in graveyards under the control of the local authority where there are £15, £10 and £5 graves.  I do not know how anybody can justify this when people are buried in the same soil in the same churchyard.  Why should a £15 grave have priority over a £5 grave?  There should be no need to have a situation in which John McEvoy, who has a £15 grave, is buried inside the gate where everybody will see the grave, while poor Harry Crosby is buried at the bottom of the graveyard in a £5 grave where nobody will bother about him and where the grass is not even cut.  Perhaps some of those buried in £5 graves would have more claim to a £15 grave if we only knew the truth about them.</P>
    <P>The whole system should be changed and these despicable notice-boards inside local authority graveyards should be removed.  If a notice indicating who is to be contacted in regard to graves is required, then it should be in the form of a small white notice board, not one of these huge black boards giving the charges of £15, <Col N="1424" /> £10, £5, the area and the location.  That system should be abolished.  A rate should be struck which would apply to all and that rate should stand and so avoid having people seeking a £15 or £20 grave, as is the case in some areas.  I realise this does not particularly involve the Minister, since I do not think he makes any great contribution towards the burial of citizens, but he must contribute in some way to the county council and they, in turn, must allocate money to the purchase of graveyards.  I should like to see some definite action in regard to this practice which I think is despicable.</P>
    <P>Finally, a great deal has been said about the differential rents by a number of Deputies, including Deputy Treacy, possibly some Fine Gael Deputies and some of my own colleagues, including Deputy Burke. It is obvious from the attention the matter received that we have had representations about it.  Differential rents have got a good deal of adverse publicity in the press and it is clear that there is something amiss with the differential rents B. scheme.  I agree that differential rents are necessary, that the strong must pay for the weak, but I also hold that we should have two different applications of the B. scheme.  First, the rent should be assessed either from month to month or from week to week, because if a man has worked overtime or long hours or shift work for which he has got extra remuneration he finds at the end of the period that he is faced with an unexpected bill of £23 or £24 for rent.  I have had people from the Ballymun area coming to me with these rent bills wanting to know why they are so high.  They do not know how they have been assessed.  That is easily calculated but they ask why were they not told about this when they were actually working overtime and why does the bill come when the overtime is finished and they are back on a flat rate and unable to pay.</P>
    <P>The Minister should request the corporation to assess the rent on a weekly basis so that the tenants would know exactly what they would have to pay each week in respect of their earnings.  Secondly, if at all possible, overtime, or at least portion of it, <Col N="1425" /> should not be taken into account for differential rent purposes.  I admit this is difficult for the corporation to do because, as I said, I agree with the principle of differential rents, but the idea of taking overtime completely into account should be done away with.  These people should get some leeway.  Their local authority should recognise that most people who work overtime do not do so because they love work.  Nobody enjoys his work so much that he wants to spend 12, 14, or 15 hours at it.  He likes to come home to his family.  Most people work overtime for a specific reason&mdash;to buy furniture or to buy clothes for children going to Confirmation or First Holy Communion.  They are being given no help whatever.  As soon as they work overtime the big sledge of the differential rent comes down and a very large slice of what they earn is taken away. The result is that nobody wants to work overtime now.  There are broken homes because people cannot pay the backlog of rent with which they are assessed weeks after they have been on overtime.  We are now asking tradesmen to take up second jobs. They are doing this to try to pay the backlog of rent.  I would ask the Minister for Local Government in all his wisdom to give careful consideration to the fact that these people in Ballymun and in other areas would like to see a change from the system of differential rent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Foley has spoken for a considerable length of time and with an intimate knowledge of the problems and difficulties we both meet in north County Dublin. The principal fault I have to find with his account of things is that the impression he wishes to convey is that everything could be put right by the county council but that they are deliberately failing to do it in County Dublin and that Deputy Foley himself and the Minister for Local Government have been directly responsible for any worthwhile improvement that has taken place in housing or anything else in north County Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is easy to criticise.  Deputy Foley's attitude in this regard is due to the fact that he has never spent an hour <Col N="1426" /> in a local authority in his life.  Before I went into the county council I felt the same.  I felt that I could move mountains if I was in there.  Now, when I have spent some years on a local authority, I see all the difficulties with which a member of a council is confronted. I see that it is extremely difficult to get even small problems solved and let me say to the Minister for Local Government that it is not because of this coalition element in Dublin County Council.  When it comes to trying to rectify problems every member of Dublin County Council, regardless of what party he belongs to, wishes to see improvements taking place.  There is no question of one group of members looking for houses and another group preventing them from being built.  The fact is that most of this can be traced to a shortage of money, to a shortage of staff and to the refusal of the Department of Local Government to pay the necessary staff. The whole system of local government is wrong and the Minister and Deputy Foley know it.  This long sing-song over a period of hours is meant to convey that the entire fault rests with the members of Dublin County Council and that all these things could be solved if they were willing and anxious to solve them.  This is great cod and this is an impression that I want to put right on the record.</P>
    <P>The Minister's opening statement is not, in my view, the normal statement of a Minister introducing the Estimate for his Department.  As I see it, it is nothing more or less than a 67 page Fianna Fáil history of local government as seen through the eyes of a Minister who is completely unmoved by the deplorable conditions under which many thousands of our people have to live, conditions of deplorable overcrowding and squalor.  That long series of figures and statistics is meant to prove to the people that Fianna Fáil have a wonderful record.  All this is said and written to show the wonderful job they are doing and their concern about people's conditions.  The fact is that the performance of the Fianna Fáil Government over the past 10 years is the worst in the whole of Western Europe in housing and particularly in local government housing. <Col N="1427" /> Nobody can deny this.  We have a backlog going back to the late fifties when we had four or five years when no houses were built.  We were told in the Second Programme for Economic Expansion that we had enough houses built, that we could sit back.  This is the job we are meeting now.  It is a job we are not able to meet, a job we cannot find the money to meet.</P>
    <P>Deputy Foley expressed satisfaction and so did his colleague, Deputy Burke, with the number of houses being built in County Dublin at present. When Deputy Burke is in the county council he is not satisfied and he was not satisfied when he went, with the other Fianna Fáil members of the county council, to weep on the Minister's shoulder without telling the other members of the council, and to complain about the housing situation in Dublin.  Here we have in the evening paper a photograph of Deputy Burke and his colleagues going to the Minister and we have the Minister telling them that there is a poor prospect of finance for housing.  I quote from the <i>Evening Press</i> of Thursday, January 22nd, 1970:</P>
    <P>Government help for local authorities&mdash;many of which are struggling to make ends meet&mdash;will continue to be very tight during the coming year, the Minister for Local Government, Mr. Boland, warned last night.</P>
    <P>I quote also from the <i>Evening Press</i> of 2nd February, 1970: The heading reads: &ldquo;A Disastrous Shortage of Housing&rdquo;.  It goes on:</P>
    <P>Dublin County Council's housing record has slumped disastrously during the last year and, as a result, a tragic shortage of accommodation has developed, according to a confidential report circulated to councillors.</P>
    <P>Further down there is a sub-heading: &ldquo;A Sad Story&rdquo;:</P>
    <P>Figures supplied to councillors in the report show a sad story of families who have, in many cases, had to wait years for help.</P>
    <P>Of the people on the housing list no less than 102 have been there for more than six years.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1428" /> Of the rest 45 have been on the list for six years, 84 have waited five years, 105 have been four years looking for a home and 152 have hopefully waited for three years.</P>
    <P>Many of the families involved have a large number of children. Thirty-three of the applicants have more than six children, another 34 have six children, 47 have five children and 96 families have four children.</P>
    <P>This is the situation about which the Minister, Deputy Foley and Deputy Burke are satisfied when they were speaking here.  They are not satisfied when they are in the county council or go out to the constituency.  Everybody is criticised except the Minister and the Deputies themselves.  All these houses would be built only for the obstruction.  That is downright dishonest and something I resent.</P>
    <P>I spend endless hours, in common with other members of the council, urging every possible effort to be made to build more houses.  I have been doing this since 1955.  To say that any member of the council is responsible for the present situation is absolute rot.  All of us want to see houses built and they are not being built in sufficient numbers.  The only thing the Minister can suggest to the deputation that go to see him is that we should sell some land we have and from the money, perhaps, we could build houses. Everybody knows that land for housing sites is not bought by having the money in one's first when buying it.  It is bought by borrowing.  You do not realise money simply by selling a bloc of land; you merely pay your debts because you cannot rob Peter to pay Paul in this kind of way.</P>
    <P>The fact is, we have not got the money or the staff.  We have advertised endlessly for staff and cannot get them because the salaries are not good enough.  When there was an arbitration award it was held up for 12 months and for the first time in the history of the country it was put before a special review board who reviewed it downwards.  We send work out to consultants and they fiddle along at their own pace, they keep their own businesses <Col N="1429" /> working&mdash;which they are perfectly entitled to do&mdash;and they do our work quite slowly.  When the result of their efforts comes back to the council it has to be examined by the professional people there and there is another delay; it has then to go to the Department and there is a further delay.</P>
    <P>We will never have any speed in the production of housing or in development generally so long as we have this endless trek to and from the Department. In every housing report you take up you read that it has gone to the Department, that plans have been prepared and sent for approval.  When the plans are returned the council are informed that there must be modifications to them and work is then started on this aspect and they are again submitted to the Department.  Plans for house design are submitted and they are returned by the Department with the request that they be revised and in due course they are re-submitted.  I consider this is a deliberate brake that is being used by the county council when money is scarce.  Instead of saying to a local authority &ldquo;you know as much about building houses as we do and you have your own architects&rdquo;&mdash; and, incidentally, for the 1,700 housing applicants in County Dublin we have one architect and one vacancy for a grade II architect but we pay three times the price to outside consultants who do our work in their own time&mdash; the Department insist on continuing this whole crazy procedure and we cannot possibly hope to get any satisfactory results from it.</P>
    <P>The Minister should take a very serious look at this situation.  There is a very heavy demand for housing in urban areas, particularly in the city and county of Dublin.  People are leaving the rural areas because there have been no Government plans for rural development and, consequently, we have this rapid movement into urban areas as there are no job opportunities available to people in rural Ireland.  There has been no policy for rural Ireland and now we are reaping the reward with this deplorable overcrowding.</P>
    <P>We built 136 houses in County Dublin last year.  We can give a long <Col N="1430" /> list of statistics about the number of houses at planning and various other stages.  There are even more people in need of houses than the actual list of applicants shows because to know the real position about applicants in any area you must wait until you have a group of houses built and then people come from all areas because they see a prospect of getting accommodation. Prior to the erection of the houses people consider it is not worth their while even applying because they know others have been on the waiting list for six or ten years and, therefore, they consider it futile to add their names to the list.</P>
    <P>In my view 1,726 is not a proper estimate although the officials in the county council say this is higher than the actual number needed.  About 84 per cent would qualify on the basis of housing need.  Over the years members of the council have considered that a certain number of houses were needed while officials and the Department thought a different number would be required.  I have a clear recollection of the position in Lucan where we decided we needed 85 houses.  The Department decided we needed 40 and when the 40 were built we had 110 applicants.  This under-estimation is the picture all over the place and how one can fight it I do not know.  You employ professional people, they give their opinion and the members of the council can only oppose it; they cannot say &ldquo;if you do not change that to the figure we think correct we will sack you&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It is obvious to anyone with common sense that the increase in population in the Dublin area is quite fantastic.  We received an estimation in the county council recently of the increase in population for 15 years from 1961 and we were told that it is going to increase by 590,000 people.  If we have not solid, decent planning to meet this influx of people complete chaos will be created.  We have these difficulties arising in regard to local authority housing.  At the moment we have a large site area but this does not mean that we can go ahead and build, even if we had the money, because we have not got the services.  However, we can <Col N="1431" /> claim&mdash;and the Minister may have this as a statistic&mdash;that we have this area of housing sites.  I am not condemning the Minister for buying the land because a local authority, particularly in a growing area, should have housing sites for at least ten years ahead.  We have services for sites in some areas but there are quite a few areas where this is not so.  I commend the Minister for purchasing land and having the sites available but we have not done nearly enough in this regard.</P>
    <P>We have reached a peculiar situation in connection with the purchase of land.  We are holding up private housebuilding to a considerable extent in that the corporation and county council are vigorously looking around for land which it is intended will be serviced in the next five or ten years and they practically freeze all the land in the area.  The private purchaser cannot buy because if there is any prospect of servicing he is simply told &ldquo;Hands off, we need this&rdquo;, and the point has been reached that small, private builders cannot obtain site land.  The Minister said in the course of his statement that some site land has been provided for private builders.  I have had experience of this matter recently.  A small builder wanted to buy 14 acres and an attached dwelling but he was told by the corporation &ldquo;Hands off&rdquo;. He then came to me and asked me if he was to get out of business.  I told him that the manager had informed me the land in question could be let to private builders and I asked this man to come to see the manager.  We went and saw the manager and the housing manager and they said &ldquo;If you are prepared to build houses according to our specification and at our price we will give you the site land&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>That man's reaction to the offer was &ldquo;I am damned if I am to work for the corporation because this is telling me that I must work for the corporation.  I have come up all the way, having worked hard in the building trade.  I saved money and started on my own as a builder.  I have never advertised a house in my life because I did not find it necessary to do so <Col N="1432" /> but I designed and built houses.  If I am not to be allowed to design and sell my own houses, they can keep the land and get out of building&rdquo;. That is reasonable enough in its own way.  I would say that local authorities should build houses at a modest price and within the reach of those who do not have a lot of money.  That overall requirement could easily be set.  In fact, the Minister is now trying to get that in another way by limiting the loan and grant facilities for houses costing up to £6,000 and less.  Perhaps, this will take charge of that matter. I do not know whether there has been any change in this attitude.</P>
    <P>The present position is that the corporation have acquired land for which they are not able to pay.  They have told people that they cannot sell the land to anybody else and that they are offering a price that is well below the price that one would expect an outside builder to offer.  The corporation put a compulsory purchase on the land thereby sterilising it.  The same applies if an inspector of the Land Commission sets foot on a farm. That is not fair and it is upsetting private building.  I know that a number of builders have already left Dublin to build in neighbouring counties because of these difficulties about site land.  The Minister should look into this question to ensure that at least houses of a certain type could be built without this difficulty about competition with local authorities.</P>
    <P>The Minister has said that, perhaps, public ownership should be considered but he has indicated this would create a great deal of difficulty.  I agree that it could but there is no doubt that the sky cannot be the limit in building land prices.  I have often said that it would be good if local authorities bought all land for development and that there should be a ceiling for such land.  This element of competition would be eliminated if there was only one purchaser. The position at the moment is certainly not satisfactory.</P>
    <P>I could go on, as Deputy Foley did, giving the present position in County Dublin with regard to housing requirements for the various areas and so on. Incidentally, some of the records given <Col N="1433" /> by Deputy Foley were six months old and the position has changed somewhat since then.  However, as far as we are concerned, the housing application list is becoming longer instead of shorter.  We are simply being told that there is not sufficient staff and when members of a council are told that they are up against a blank wall.</P>
    <P>If we are to meet the backlog within a reasonable time in County Dublin we must build about 500 houses each year.  We would have to do this to catch up with the 1,700 applications but there is a shortage of money not only for local authority houses but, more particularly, for SDA loans and grants.  The Minister does not seem to appreciate fully the special position of County Dublin in relation to this matter.  The allocation being given to us is much too small even by comparison with other local authorities having comparative demands.  In the three months from October to December, we received applications from 152 persons.  In order to meet these applications we would require £450,000 more than what we got.  We had reached the stage in County Dublin, where after the first five months of the year, we had no money for SDA loans or grants.  This is a deplorable situation. We were forced to tell people whose applications poured in every day that there was nothing we could do, that we did not know when money would be available.  We had a situation which had never arisen before in which the county manager was forced to go out hat-in-hand on the highways and byways to look for money because the building societies obviously did not want to meet him for some reason that I cannot understand.</P>
    <P>The building societies do not wish to give finance to the local authorities for this type of housing.  I have here a list of the conditions laid down by the societies and I am not very clear on those.  The Minister has agreed that local authorities would guarantee loans under certain conditions but when they go to deal with the building societies they are told of all sorts of ridiculous conditions.  For instance, one condition is:</P>
    <P>The lender shall have the right to <Col N="1434" /> refuse any application for a loan without giving any reason.</P>
    <P>I should like somebody to explain that condition to me since the money coming from the building society will be guaranteed by the local authority.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Denis Francis Jones">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>The conditions, contained in a report from the county council dated 4th February, describe the terms under which the building societies are prepared to lend money to the county council.  Another condition is that:</P>
      <P>The county council shall, wherever practical, require applicants to give collateral security for loans and shall furnish full details thereof to the lender with the application for a loan but the lender may refuse to accept such collateral security without assigning any reasons.</P>
      <P>A person who would normally be eligible for an SDA loan, if the money were there, has now to enter into an arrangement with the building societies and produce collateral.  There has to be another means test.  There must be a close examination of a man's means before there is any decision on his application for a loan through this sort of arrangement in which the building societies and the insurance companies are indemnified by the local authority against loss.</P>
      <P>Why we have to accept these conditions beats me.  When I spoke rather severely against this the manager threw up his hands in holy horror and said: &ldquo;All is lost.  We will go back and all these unfortunate people who have been waiting indefinitely, and this is their only hope, will be left without any loan from any source.  The Minister has not got the money.  We have not got the money.&rdquo;  Now we have an arrangement here whereby it may be possible to get the money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Condition 9 states: The applicant for the loan shall contribute from his own resources at least 5 per cent of market value except in the case of a county council tenant who is surrendering possession of the county <Col N="1435" /> council dwelling to the county council when the minimum contribution shall be 1 per cent of the market value. On the face of it, this looks reasonable but the question that will arise is how is market value to be determined or whose opinion of market value will be accepted?  It is not apparently related to the cost of production.  Surely, in a new house, it should be related to the cost of production.  But there is no such arrangement.  To me, this is an extremely unsatisfactory position. There is, too, the question of legal costs and so forth.</P>
    <P>The Government have no money for SDA loans and people are in the unfortunate position that they must accept building society loans, with fluctuating rates of interest, with a shorter repayment period and consequently heavier weekly outgoings. Many people are not able to meet these weekly outgoings, which range in most cases from £7 to £10 per week. In order to meet that sort of commitment a man's wages would need to be very high indeed.  I think this is meant to provide, in the main, housing finance for a greater number of the package deal type of houses in the county. Originally the deposit on these houses ranged from 150 to £200; the upper limit was £300.  The deposit is now £500 to £600.  This is quite a substantial deposit but it is, of course, nothing to the deposits that have to be paid on houses generally.  In most cases there is a gap of £1,000, and more, between what the prospective tenant can obtain by way of loan and grant and what he actually has to pay for the house. I do not know how this problem will be solved.  There has been an increase in housing grants but that increase does not measure up to the increase in cost as a result of the wholesale tax and the turnover tax.  That amounts to about £130.  The increase given is £75. It is no good the Minister or the Government pretending they have met the situation.  They have gone part of the way in giving back part of the money they have taken by way of taxation.  But it is only part of the way.</P>
    <P>Housing grants were fixed in 1948.  Only in the last couple of months have some slight changes been made, <Col N="1436" /> totally inadequate changes, and the difficulties in which people find themselves now arise because of the poor performance of the Government in relation to housing during the past ten years.  Nothing was done for five years. Because of that you have large numbers all over the country clamouring for housing accommodation.  The money is just not there to build houses for them. Deputy Foley complained about caravans, the itinerants' caravans and the caravans of decent working people who cannot find the wherewithal to house themselves.  The local authority is unable to house them.  This is eloquent evidence of the failure of the Minister and his Department.  I am not blaming the present Minister in particular.  I think he is doing his best in the circumstances, but he talks about wiping out the deplorable legacy of overcrowding.</P>

      <P>Deputy Foley spoke about the limits for loans.  I do not know how long back the limits were fixed at £1,200. If we up the limits we simply have not got the money to meet the situation. The first in will be lucky.  For the first five months of the year in Dublin County Council we have money, for the remaining seven we have none.  The list piles up and the applicants are going around looking for accommodation which is not available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Difficulties arise about supplementary grants.  For years there were a great many difficulties but I think most of them have been ironed out now.  Of <Col N="1437" /> course, the only way in which to have money for supplementary grants is by making the rate high enough.  I believe in increasing the rates for supplementary grants.  There are other elements in the rates in regard to which I do not believe in increases.  There is a reasonable system operated in the case of supplementary grants.  In some cases in the past people who were entitled to these grants did not avail of them. These were people buying houses through a building society or an insurance company.  It was believed you had to apply for your supplementary grant before the end of six months, but there is an arrangement now whereby a person is notified, irrespective of where he gets his loan, of his right to a supplementary grant within certain limits.</P>
    <P>Of course, there is a residence qualification. There must be a residence qualification, at least for some years, except in certain circumstances.  Deputy Foley claimed responsibility for many things.  I claim responsibility for this: I took up the cases of persons who had to move, not of their own volition but because of their type of employment, from one county to another.  A member of the Garda Síochána would be in that position and there are others who would be similarly affected.  These people do not require a residence qualification in order to get the supplementary grant.  That is only right and reasonable.  However, if a county were to disregard residence qualification completely for the supplementary grant there would be an influx of people from other counties that might not pay supplementary grants.  Therefore, something must be done to limit that type of movement.</P>
    <P>We were speaking about caravan sites.  Generally speaking, there is a great resistance to caravan sites.  There is some sense in that because you could build up caravan slums.  There is a case for having caravan sites diversified throughout a county with, perhaps, conditions as to the period for which people could remain there. In this way some sort of accommodation would be available for persons who want to get married and to remain in a caravan pending the availability of other accommodation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1438" /> I now want to deal with the question of the Ballymun flats because I think this is important.  Ballymun is paraded before this House as the greatest intervention ever on the part of the Department of Local Government to solve the housing needs.  I want to give it as my personal opinion and to put it on the record of the House that it was the greatest disaster that ever took place. In this country there is the lowest density of houses per acre in the whole of Western Europe with the exception of Norway and Sweden and we had to solve our housing problem by building skyscrapers in Ballymun, by putting families of six and seven children in flats 12 and 14 storeys high.  The Minister is out of touch.  He should talk to people who have intimate association with the people in Ballymun.  He should talk to Deputy Foley who goes occassionally to Ballymun and ask him what these people think about their accommodation in Ballymun.  He should talk to the priests who are in touch with the people there and ask them what they think about Ballymun. It was a great disaster and one of the greatest mistakes made by local government in my memory.  The same number of conventional houses could have been built easily within the same time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask any Deputy what is a married man rearing a family to do with five or six children ten storeys up from ground level?  The husband is out working during the day and his wife has to prepare meals and care for the children.  How is she to let those children down to play?  They must be kept in that flat until they are old enough to go out by themselves.  When is that?  Will they be ten, 12 or 14 years of age before they get to know what it is to play in a playground? This is the type of accommodation we are providing for Irish people.  Are we not building up trouble for the future by this unnatural system of housing? There is no necessity for it.  Yet we are proceeding with it.  We are doing it in Cork and Waterford.  The Minister applauds this as one of our great efforts.  Now we have gone to the point where we are not describing them as homes but are calling them units of accommodation.  The people will be numbers too.  They will not be normal family people.  They could not be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Foley talked at length, and rightly, about the importance of recreation facilities and community centres, places for children to play and the neglect that there has been in this matter.  Whom did he think he was criticising?  I agree entirely that there has been deplorable neglect in the provision of playing space for children. The first paly space in front of the able to use is the space in front of the kitchen window where the mother can look out at him or her.  I do not know how a Minister could be proud of what has happened in Ballymun.  I doubt very much if the Minister is proud of it but he feels obliged to <Col N="1440" /> applaud what his predecessor has done.  It is too bad that he should have expressed his intention to continue this type of building for the future.  There is another type of housing which I want to mention.</P>

      <P>I shall now deal with the rehousing of soldiers who are over-holding Army accommodation.  This is quite a problem for certain local authorities.  The Minister for Local Government and the Minister for Defence should combine to solve this problem.  There is a great reluctance on the part of local authorities to house the people concerned.  I do not know what the position is.  I do not know if they are entitled to the full subsidy if they house these people.  They should be entitled to it.  As far as I am aware, the Army establishments pay substantial rates and they are consumers in the local authority area over the years. I think this should be settled because there is a great deal of difficulty in the Army about unfortunate people who have given long periods of service and who, when they come out, are not wanted by anybody including local <Col N="1442" /> authorities.  This is a shocking reflection on the country as a whole.  It may have been raised in the House already. I suggest that the two Ministers concerned should get together about it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to speak about the provision of swimming pools and recreation centres which were referred to, and rightly so, by Deputy Foley.  The minimum is being done.  It is a matter of extreme importance for all young people that these natural environments should be provided where they can go for healthy open-air recreation.  If we had them there would be fewer flick knives and fewer dangerous people of all sorts.  I am afraid this is not being taken sufficiently seriously.  A local authority may from time to time provide a site but it is left there and nothing is done about it.  It all goes back to shortage of money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had a Minister for Local Government who used to say: &ldquo;There is no scarcity of money.  Build all the swimming pools you want.  The money <Col N="1443" /> is there.&rdquo;  Of course, it was not.  At least the present Minister is honest enough to say: &ldquo;If I give you the money for a swimming pool there will be fewer houses.&rdquo;  That is true up to a point but the time arrives when one can justify the provision of a recreation centre or a swimming pool.  There is a hard and fast rule but there must be areas here and there where something can be done.  We should give up codding about all the amenities we are prepared to develop when we know we cannot do anything about them.</P>
    <P>While speaking about staff earlier I wanted to speak about the arbitration business.  I said that arbitration as far as pay is concerned fell down, that it was pushed aside and a special body brought in to modify what the arbitrator had found in favour of local authority employees.  Now a circular has been sent out by the Department of Local Government.  It is dated 4th February, 1970, and it relates to the setting up of a secretariat, more or less, to prepare cases for the staffs of local authorities for increases of pay and for improvement of conditions generally.  I can see the need for something of this sort.</P>
    <P>It is stated in the document that it is too much to expect of a manager or others in local authorities that they should find the time to prepare their own cases to go before the Department, and so forth.  According to the circular, it is proposed to set up a body to do this work.  I find fault with one aspect of it.  The circular states, on page 2:</P>
    <P>The Minister has therefore sought and secured the approval of the Government for the introduction of legislation under which it will be possible for him to establish a corporate body whose main function will be to provide such services as may be required by local authorities (represented by county and city managers) in proceedings under the Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme and also in Labour Court proceedings involving local authority employees.</P>
    <P>This is what I find fault with.  Why should the Minister appoint the people who will make the case on which he <Col N="1444" /> has to pass judgment?  Surely this is dictatorship of the worst possible type. Even Deputy Andrews would agree, and he believes in dictatorship.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Who believes in dictatorship? The Deputy is reflecting his own thoughts, not mine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>The circular states that the corporate body will be run by a board to be appointed by the Minister, the members to include county and city managers.  The board would engage the necessary staff, secure the accommodation and office equipment required, <i>et cetera</i>.  The corporate body would be a relatively small organisation. They would, of course, be handpicked people who would bring judgment to bear on the case being made. I have never read the likes of it before.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is intended that the activities of this body will be financed by contributions from county councils and county borough corporations, not from the Government, but the Government will appoint members of the committee, will select the people who will be preparing the applications for improved conditions and increases in salaries and wages.  This is one document which I hope will be thrown out by all concerned and not brought back in a hurry.</P>
      <P>I did not finish my reference to housing all the people.  I wanted to say a word about itinerants.  All of us sincerely expressed concern about them.  We should be so concerned but the plain fact of the matter is that I have yet to come across people who want them on their doorsteps and I think part of the trouble has arisen through the decision that the best way to deal with the problem is to have large encampments of itinerants in the first instance and then to graduate them from these encampments.  In a couple of cases where this system has been set up it has worked reasonably well but only after most serious objections by some people in the area concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Dublin County Council we considered <Col N="1445" /> this in considerable detail and the policy of the council was that each parish in the county should be asked to take two or three itinerant families, a site should be provided and all the welfare services should be brought to bear on these people who should be integrated into the settled population. That policy was passed, but the manager of the county council continued to operate on the basis that the only way to manage the thing was his way.  When you have the manager and the officials taking this attitude it is very hard to get anything done.  I am not intentionally criticising individuals but here a commission were set up to consider this problem and their findings were published.  We all know it has gone on for several years and the progress that has been made in the housing of itinerants has been very poor indeed. The total number of itinerants is very small having regard to the size of the country and we are seeking to isolate these people and not integrate them into society by putting them into colonies of this kind.  I am totally opposed to it.</P>
    <P>The Minister has more or less issued a veiled threat that if local authorities do not do something soon about it he will.  He should have done something long ago.  As Minister for Local Government he should feel he has the responsibility to say: &ldquo;Put so many families there, there and there.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is quite a different thing for the local public representative who has to meet the people.  The Minister has not. He is not a man who meets them an awful lot.</P>

      <P>I have the <i>Evening Press</i> here which talks about Deputy Foley and the Minister insisting on a public inquiry about the allocation of houses, the houses in question being in Malahide.  We were working on a points system agreed by the county council and sanctioned by the Minister for Local Government.  It is fair to say that the officials of the county council omitted to include a small number of houses they felt were not within the housing district.  Instead of the people concerned going to the officials and saying this area should be included we had big headings in the paper to the effect that Deputy Des Foley and the Minister for Local Government were going to rectify this deliberate and deplorable wrong in Dublin County Council.  Nobody wants to wrong people who want a house.  The need should be the yardstick and not politics or who knows who.  The sooner we get things firmly established the better.</P>

      <P>We have spoken about sanitary services and the need for extending them.  The Minister for Local Government has stressed the importance <Col N="1449" /> of extending these services so as to remove the scarcity factor in the cost of building lands.  There has been a great sing-song about the fact that at last we are bringing water to north County Dublin.  After 32 years of Fianna Fáil Government we have this heading in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> of 22nd February, 1970: &ldquo;Shocking treatment of Dublin women.  Denied water in their homes.  Baths for Ministers but not for the people.&rdquo;  Then we hear this nonsense about what has been done about sanitary services.  I think it was Deputy James Dillon said here some time ago that after 25 years agitation in County Dublin Moses struck the rock and Deputy Paddy Burke found water for the people in north County Dublin.  They are this short distance from the capital city and the Government are starting to give them water and sewerage, and there is a vast acreage of the rural part of County Dublin where for years we could not build a house.</P>
      <P>We could not build a house because the Minister for Local Government says: &ldquo;You cannot build a house unless you have the services and I cannot give you the services.&rdquo;  I said it was the policy of the Department and the Minister not to build unserviced houses.  The Minister gave an emphatic &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  He was partly correct because this was the policy in 1965.  This was the policy notified to the local authorities that year.  The present Minister is opposed to this policy and he has done what he can to try to get potentially serviced houses built or even if that is not possible if there is a rural need to get those houses built without services.</P>
      <P>St. Margaret's is a typical example. We have 60 applicants and the parish priest is trying to keep the community together where everybody wants to be housed.  The push has all the time been to shove them into Swords, shove them into some area but get them out of the country because it is easier to provide services in those areas.  The policy has been to forget about rural Ireland. It is because of that policy that we are in the present position where we cannot house the people who are flocking into the city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also asked a question from the Minister's predecessor as to who had <Col N="1450" /> the last word in deciding whether a septic tank type of drainage was permissible or not.  I was told quite definitely by the Minister that it was the responsibility of the chief medical officer.  I asked: &ldquo;Can nothing be done about this?&rdquo; He said: &ldquo;No, he has the last word.&rdquo; I do not know whether the position is the same today as it was then.  We certainly have that sort of difficulty still.  The Minister has only partly solved it in some areas by showing that he had quite a definite interest in getting those houses built in those areas but it took that sort of ministerial pressure to get houses built where they were being resisted by people.  I do not think the Government see the size of the problem facing them here.  It is estimated that it will take £11 million for water and drainage inside the next ten years in County Dublin.  There is no advance estimate of future needs and there is no budgeting to see where this money will come from.</P>
    <P>The position is even worse when we talk about roads.  We will face an impossible situation in Dublin city in the very near future because there is obviously no planned arrangements for meeting this problem and solving it.  I remember about six or eight months ago attending a meeting with the management of CIE to discuss this problem and they indicated the enormous loss of hours they had from the point of view of their buses.  This matter affects every business man and everybody who has to use the roads.  There is no plan for the future and no proper reservation of land.  There is no decision as to whether we should have a fast transit system or what we should do about railways, underground or overground. We have rapid development of the airport but we have no solution there for transport.</P>
    <P>We talk about the north road but we are playing about with that, as Deputy Foley said, for so long that it is hard to remember when it started first.  We have only recently decided that portion of it should be a motorway.  There is no point in blaming the county council for those sort of problems or blaming the corporation either.  At Question Time once I recommended a top level get-together between the Department <Col N="1451" /> of Local Government, the Department of Transport and Power and the Department of Finance with a view to setting up a body that would decide future plans and requirements, get the necessary surveys made and arrive at the necessary decisions about the amount of money which would be spent over the next 10 or 15 years on this problem.</P>
    <P>The professional men engaged in planning and coping with those problems say: &ldquo;Look, we are just working in the dark because we do not know what the Government have in mind.  It will take £40 to £50 million for this work but we do not know when it will be spent.  It is very important when it will be spent.  We have to know if we are to make the necessary reservations and make the necessary planning decision to keep routes open and to know where we are going but there is no top level consideration of this extremely difficult problem which is facing the people here in the very near future.&rdquo; This must be one of the very few cities where there is no traffic plan.  It is quite obvious that we have no such plan here and no decision about the future.</P>
    <P>This prompts me to say something about planning and planning difficulties. Dublin County Council and local authorities have no power to stop unauthorised development in a reasonable time.  Something will have to be done about it.  Legislation to deal with this problem must be introduced.  Ten or 12 caravans are rushed to a site. They are left there without proper sanitary or site arrangements but nothing can be done to stop it.  We can tell the person responsible to stop but he need not.  Subsequently he sends in an application for attention.  This can take up to a couple of months to be dealt with and then the local authority can say: &ldquo;No, we will not give you permission.&rdquo;  He will then appeal to the Minister.  He has a right to wait until the appeal is decided.  All this time Rome is burning and the man is putting in more and more totally unsuitable unauthorised buildings.  We have no power to deal with that matter.  This is a shocking defect and one which should be dealt with as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1452" /> Legislation will be required to deal with the rights of adjoining owners.  I know I cannot advocate legislation but those problems present endless difficulties. The county council is criticised if there is unauthorised development and the question is asked as to why the county council permit this.  They can do nothing about it because it takes so long that all those problems are there facing the people until they are sick and tired looking at them.  Our planning legislation is very defective.</P>
    <P>I was glad to hear Deputy Foley suggest that appeals should be taken out of the Minister's hand.  It is a pity he did not speak in favour of our Bill when we brought it before the House to do just that.  He did not do it on that occasion but now he sees for himself that the thing is all wrong.  I hope something will be done shortly to overcome this difficulty.</P>
    <P>The roads of the country are becoming totally inadequate for the traffic they are called on to carry.  In County Dublin almost every mile of road is a main road having regard to the volume of traffic it is carrying.  In spite of that fact we do not get one penny from the Department by way of county road improvement grants.  Everybody knows the area of County Dublin which is now urbanised.  You have a situation in which Dublin Corporation have an urban road improvement grant.  Dún Laoghaire borough have an urban road improvement grant but we have no county road improvement grant.  It is like the free fuel scheme&mdash;some benefit from it and others do not.</P>

      <P>The county council cannot do anything about this because they are not allowed.  I thought the Deputy would know this.  That is the position.  We have the same position in <Col N="1453" /> relation to the county roads in County Dublin.  We do not get any money and consequently nothing is being done, or at least, the minimum is being done because the cost must be borne by the rates.  Work is being done on some roads throughout the country where the traffic is not a fraction of the traffic carried by the County Dublin roads. Our county roads are breaking up because of the volume of traffic on them. Some decision will have to be arrived at soon.  We are short of engineering staff to do the necessary planning.  We are waiting for a road authority to take over the main arteries.  Dublin County Council have been criticised particularly in regard to the Naas road. Land acquisition on the Naas road presents immense difficulties.  There are many legal difficulties about such acquisition and that is the reason why the work has not been done.  Shortage of staff is also a contributory factor. We are losing staff because outside interests can pay them more.  Under the local government system ability cannot be recognised.  There is no method by which a man of outstanding ability can be rewarded.  An engineer is paid the same money whether he is outstanding or not.  The County Dublin roads are becoming totally inadequate.</P>
      <P>I have spoken on many matters.  I have not criticised just for the sake of criticising.  I know the problems.  I am a member of a local authority and I should know the problems intimately. I meet the people every day.  I know why the improvements are not being carried out as rapidly as we would like. Shortage of money and shortage of staff are important factors, coupled with deplorable neglect over the years.</P>

      <P>In the financial year 1966-67 the number of houses completed was 11,000.  Since that year there has been an increase in the annual number of houses completed of roughly 1,000 per year.  In the year 1969 14,000 houses have been completed. I have gathered figures which approximate to the figures given by the Department of Local Government.  The Minister is to be congratulated on the annual increase in the number of houses completed.  In the early part of the <Col N="1454" /> 1960s the housing figures were not so impressive.  In 1968 13,000 houses were completed.  In that year 14,400 houses were started.  We must compare our housing figures with those of other countries in order to get the housing problem here into perspective.  We must national income is the same as our own with the figures for housing here.  The best yardstick by which to gauge the overall performance of the Department of Local Government with regard to housing is the number of houses completed per 1,000 of population.  Today we have all been given a copy of the OECD Observer, No. 44, February, 1970.  In that copy statistics for dwellings completed per 1,000 of the population are given.  These figures mainly refer to the year 1968.  There are a few instances where the figures are for 1967.  Without delaying the House unduly, I should like to give the figures for different countries in Europe and in other parts of the world. The houses per 1,000 of population completed in Austria were 7.0; Belgium; 4.1; Canada, 8.2; Denmark, 9.2; Finland, 7.9; France, 8.5; Germany, 8.4; Iceland, 9.0; Ireland, 4.0; Italy, 6.3; Japan, 11.8; Netherlands, 9.7; Norway, 8.8; Portugal, 5.7; Spain, 7.6; Sweden, 12.7; Switzerland, 8.6; Turkey, 4.7; and the United Kingdom, 7.7.  In 1968 we found ourselves firmly at the bottom of the list, below such countries as Spain, Portugal and Turkey which have an income per head below ours. Our figures are below those of the United Kingdom.  The much maligned Labour Government in Britain have produced nearly twice as many houses per 1,000 of the population as we have produced in this country.</P>

      <P>Listening to Dublin Deputies one might think there is only a housing crisis in the city.  As a rural Deputy I know this is not so.  The problem is as bad, if not worse, in certain parts of County Wicklow.  The situation is rather serious.  We in the rural areas are inclined to be overlooked because of the proximity of Dublin to all the sources of communication. For a county with a small population, <Col N="1455" /> Wicklow has a very serious housing problem.  The Minister should appreciate this fully.  There are four county council areas there at present and at the end of March, 1969, there were 460 qualified applicants seeking houses.  There were a similar number in the three urban areas of Bray, Wicklow and Arklow.  At present there are approximately 1,000 families in need of houses in County Wicklow. If we look at the prospects of these people who are in need of immediate housing&mdash;I have approached the local authorities regarding the possibility of these people being housed&mdash;it turns out that not more than 60 houses will be built in the four county council areas in Wicklow in the coming year.  There are 460 qualified applicants but only 60 of them can be accommodated in the next year.  By the end of that time the number of qualified applicants will have increased substantially.</P>
      <P>In Bray things are a little better and it is hoped to have about 170 houses completed.  The number of applicants is about 300.  In Wicklow it is expected that 22 houses will be completed.  They have not been started yet.  I wrote to Arklow about the housing position at the same time that I was in touch with Bray and Wicklow but they did not reply and have not replied yet.  That was some months ago.  I shall shortly be in touch with them again.  I have, however, a cutting from this week's <i>Wicklow People,</i> dated Saturday, February 21st, and on the front page there is a headline saying: &ldquo;Why NET Cannot Get Top Men&rdquo;.  Underneath it says:</P>
      <P>The lack of suitable houses in Arklow is defeating the efforts of Nítrigin Éireann to attract senior staff, a spokesman for the Company told the Urban Council meeting on Friday night.  Mr. Alan Fewster, Deputy Factory Manager, said: &ldquo;The Company is anxious to provide reasonable quality houses as soon as possible&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>We can definitely say the position in Arklow is as serious as in any other part of County Wicklow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Prospects in other parts of the county are not good for people who <Col N="1456" /> want to be housed in the near future. New industry in Arklow is causing concern and, as I have shown, the need for more houses.  In Avoca, with the reopening of the Avoca Mines, obviously there will be great pressure for housing sites and houses in the area.  Not one house has been built there by the local authority since 1957 and at present there is need for at least 20 houses to fill the needs of inhabitants in the area.  With the influx of staff and workers to the mines, accommodation is not there and will not be there in the coming years unless the local authorities are given money to embark on what we called for already, a crash programme of building, not only in one area of Wicklow but all over.  In Rathnew 12 houses were recently completed but at least 40 people are looking for those houses.  In Newtownmountkennedy where houses were completed about two years ago, at least another 50 applicants are on the housing list.  In Kilcoole where a mere eight or ten houses were completed there is a waiting list of 20 people.  These are a few of the areas in County Wicklow to which I am drawing the Minister's attention.</P>
    <P>It is considered that the Dublin housing problem is particularly grave but I know nowhere outside Dublin in which the housing position is as serious as in County Wicklow.  In the beautiful village of Enniskerry there is also a grave housing problem.  It was intended to build 12 tenant-type houses and 20 purchase-type houses for the people of Enniskerry in a townland called Kilgarron.  The 20 purchase-type houses were advertised and applications invited.  There was no shortage of applicants and soon the list was full.  People were asked to provide a deposit of £100 towards these houses so that they would be included on the list.  In a number of cases the deposit was forthcoming in a lump sum and in others it was paid in smaller sums of £20 or £10.</P>
    <P>A circular sent out from Wicklow County Council gave the estimated price of those three-bedroom, terrace-type houses of about 800 square feet as £2,430 in April, 1969.  The successful applicants were given to understand <Col N="1457" /> that the houses would be completed by the summer of 1969. Unfortunately, because of problems arising with the builder and site problems these houses have not been built and are only at a very early stage of erection at present.  The builder has left the site and the houses must be built by direct labour by the local authority.  The 20 families who hoped to move into those houses last summer are outraged at the situation because they have been living in bad, overcrowded housing conditions for a long time.  The grievance is all the more justified because they are now told that these houses will cost over £3,000. It is conservatively expected that the price will be £3,300 when completed, an increase of between £800 and £900 on the original figure.  In the literature originally distributed it was stated that the price was subject to alteration because of increased costs but can anybody justify an increase of about £800 in a period of less than a year?  The new figure was given out some months ago.</P>
    <P>If the Minister is not already aware of this situation&mdash;I think he should be, because the people of Kilgarron have been in touch with the Department&mdash; he should make himself aware of it and, perhaps, ask one of his officials to go down to Wicklow County Council and get details of this problem.  It is not just the fault of local officials in Wicklow, the fault of the builder or the increase in prices over the past year.  There must be something basically wrong to result in an increase of about £800 in a year.  The successful applicants for these houses do not know where to get money to pay for them if they are completed.  It was first estimated that they would pay at least £5 a week in all to cover repayment of loan, ground rent and rates.  It is now estimated the figure will be about £6 10s for the same house.  The upper income limit for SDA loans is £1,200.  The income of many of these people does not come near that figure.  For people earning £15 to £20 a week to have to pay £6 10s on just one item of their household budget is wrong.  The Minister should make inquiries about this scheme and find out what has gone wrong and ensure that nothing like this <Col N="1458" /> ever happens again in Wicklow or in any part of the country.</P>
    <P>A circular, dated 14th February, 1969, was sent to all local authorities from the Department of Local Government. It is Circular No. N. 1/69 and it is headed &ldquo;Capital Cost of Local Authority Housing&rdquo;.  In the circular the Minister, in order to conserve the limited capital which he says he has for housebuilding, suggests ways to spread out the money and make it go further.  One would imagine that this was quite a laudable thing to do in order to see that more people are housed for the same money but reading this circular and the suggestions made to the local authorities one wonders.  Since it comes from the Department of Local Government I am sure it is more than a suggestion; it can be construed as a direction to do a certain thing.  I quote from the first paragraph:</P>
    <P>While the Minister is reluctant to call for any general lowering of standards, he must, however, insist, for the time being, that plans for all new schemes should be designed in general accord with the minimum standards of accommodation etc. laid down in this Department's circular letter No. N 1/64 of the 28th February, 1964.</P>
    <P>In these opening words the Minister asks that the very minimum standards be applied to local authority building and in order to explain this he goes on to give the headings under which these economies can be made.  He mentions site selection and the density of housing per acre.  I quote:</P>
    <P>Generally schemes should be built to the maximum densities permitted. In special cases where it is felt that the general environment will sustain higher densities, proposals may be submitted for higher than normal densities by local authorities.</P>
    <P>This is a terrible document to send out to local authorities in this day and age.  We are told about the increased prosperity in the country and yet here we have a document telling local authorities to crush more houses into smaller spaces, to use less land for sites, to push as many people into as <Col N="1459" /> small an area as possible in order to save a few shillings.  There must not have been anybody like John Ruskin in the Department when they turned out this document.  He said: &ldquo;When we build houses let us think that we build them forever.&rdquo; I cannot see people in future years, if we become even more prosperous, putting up with a house frontage of 16 feet as suggested in this document.</P>
    <P>It also advises that almost all semi-detached dwellings should be avoided; limited use should be made of narrow fronted houses; terrace-type houses should be built rather than detached or semi-detached houses; houses without front gardens should be built where suitable and where other parking arrangements for cars are available; front garden walls should be omitted; there should be only wire and post palings between houses and the houses themselves, four bedroomed houses, should not exceed 950 square feet.  At present the SDA house has a maximum area of 1,400 square feet or just under that.  A four bedroomed house of that size is not a huge house. My own house, built a few years ago, measures 1,100 square feet.  It is a three bedroomed house and one of the bedrooms is quite small.  I cannot understand how one can have a four bedroomed house of 950 square feet if the rooms are to be a decent size. The circular says that three bedroomed houses should not exceed 800 to 850 square feet.  This document will reduce not only the standard of houses but the appearance of housebuilding in the future.  It is a pity it had to be circulated.  It also suggests ways of making the ESB wiring more economic. I consider this a rather risky suggestion.</P>
    <P>I hope that the Minister will find that we have got over this period of restraint and return to even the type of houses that were built in the 1960s. The Minister in this document cites houses in Bray as an example for other local authorities to view.  If he means the houses in Everett Park, in Palermo, he should go back and look at them after only one or two years and see the condition of these houses <Col N="1460" /> crashed together and the gardens which have no walls and see where timber was used where stonework would obviously have been better.</P>
    <P>I should like to move to water and sewerage schemes with particular reference to my constituency and to point out the great lack of these services in the County Wicklow.  The last speaker said that within 15 miles of Dublin there is a lack of water and sewerage in his constituency.  I can say that a lack of water and sewerage in the constituency of Wicklow is the rule rather than the exception outside the urban areas.  Eight or nine years ago the regional water supply scheme for Ashford which serves the villages of Ashford and Rathnew and the townlands around there and is also a supplementary scheme to the Wicklow town scheme was started.  It supplies unlimited water in that area.</P>
    <P>In Ashford itself, where the scheme runs through the village, there are very many houses without either water or sewerage services.  In Killiskey, a village in the parish of Ashford, a scheme was put forward three years ago to bring water from the regional supply only a half a mile away and this was turned down as not being high enough on the priority list.  Each year it has been put forward by the local county council and a reason is always found why nothing is done: it has become too expensive, water would have to be pumped up a hill to the village and so on.  Every year the people of this parish look to their Deputies and county councillors to get a water supply from the unlimited supply available half a mile away.  The unfortunate people of Killiskey have been told by another Minister that they cannot even have a public telephone in their village.  In these days, when we hear so much talk about civil rights, we should remember that 26 miles from the capital city people are denied basic necessities of life.</P>
    <P>Another scheme in Rathnew/ Cronakeary has been shuttled back and forth to the Department of Local Government for the past nine years. There is no great problem about fall or anything else.  It is only about one mile from Rathnew.  A number of <Col N="1461" /> farmers there were hoping to get a supply from any scheme that connects with Rathnew, but in these nine years they have been unable to get a water supply.  In reply to a question I asked the Minister for Local Government last week he said that the money was needed for other and more urgent necessities inside and outside the county.  No doubt, urgent necessities exist.  However, these people have been waiting nine years since the regional water supply scheme was put into operation half a mile away.  As ratepayers they were promised water would be brought to their area, but nothing has been done and apparently will not be done for some time to come.</P>
    <P>These are areas hoping to get their water supply from regional water schemes, but the only hope for most of the county is group water schemes. The idea that people living close to one another should come together and, with the help of grants from the Government and local authorities, provide water supply schemes is an excellent one.  I have had a number of inquiries about these schemes but I do not know what to advise people.  I am aware of cases where they were started and had to be abandoned because after much time had elapsed nothing was done and no progress was made. I know of one area in the southern part of my constituency beside Carnew, called Toomacork.  It is a village on a small hill outside Carnew, but there is no hope of its being connected to any regional scheme.  However, 40 house-owners in that area decided they would try to get a group water scheme and they held their first meeting on 14th November, 1967, when they sent in their application forms and were advised an inspector would be sent to give them details of what would be required and instructions about the needs that would have to be met.  A gentleman from the Department called on them on the 24th February, 1968&mdash; by coincidence exactly two years ago&mdash; and he told the residents to set up a committee, appoint a secretary, make arrangements with the local bank regarding the cash that would be needed and so on.  Between that date <Col N="1462" /> and the present some meetings have taken place with the Department but, as yet, no channel has been opened and no pipe laid.</P>
    <P>It may be said that this is the problem of the local committee.  I shall quote from a letter I received from the secretary:</P>
    <P>The inspector informed us that we would have to hire an engineer or architect to draw the plans for the proposed scheme.  This we did and after a number of weeks someone in Local Government stopped this man from drawing the plans but they did not inform us.  After some time I asked him what was keeping him with the plans and only then did I learn that Local Government had stopped him.  We had to apply for tenders for excavation work which we received on the 15.10.'68.  Contracts for the building were received on the 4.11.'68, and we kept doing as we were asked.  We had been told some time previous to that to have a water test done and this we sent&mdash;the date of the receipt was the 15.5.'68.  After a year elapsed we were informed we would have to have another water test taken.</P>
    <P>Therefore, when people ask me about water supply schemes what can I tell them?  It is the only hope in a number of areas.  If there is a shortage of staff in the Department something should be done about it.  If inspectors are in such short supply that they must look after a county like Wicklow and then next week be transferred to County Meath, the only answer is to increase the number of inspectors so that this very necessary work can be proceeded with.</P>
    <P>In County Wicklow we have become noted for the increase in the number of planning appeals submitted to the Department of Local Government.  In 1967 there were 58, in 1968 there were 68, and last year the figure was 112 appeals.  We are also, unfortunately, becoming noted for the number of cases where section 4 has been invoked by members of the council in order to reverse some of the local decisions on house building.  There are a number of reasons for this and they <Col N="1463" /> have been mentioned by my colleague from West Cork, Deputy Murphy. Because County Wicklow is a particularly beautiful part of the country we are told we must be very careful about the development that takes place. We are very much aware of the necessity to be careful about the type of buildings erected in County Wicklow. We know it is a county that depends to a great extent on its appearance and scenic beauty to attract tourists from the city.</P>
    <P>We are also aware that people in the Department of Transport and Power sometimes decide to build power stations in some of the most beautiful parts of the county.  It has been held by people in County Wicklow that they have been defacing some of the most beautiful landscapes in the area with buildings, pylons, wires and so on.  However, it must be accepted by the people that if this is the only place in which such development can take place, and since there is such a great necessity for developing our national resources, then unfortunately, this development must take place in that area.  We are being told that every effort is being made to minimise the spoliation of the surroundings in the Vale of Glendalough and in the Wicklow Gap area.  I hope that this will be so.  When people wish to build houses on their own land, or to sell sites to others who may wish to come to the county, or just to erect holiday accommodation there, people from outside dictate to them where the development should take place and how it should take place.  I might point out that parts of County Wicklow are as poor and as much in need of special incentives and investment as are parts of the west or south west It is a big blow to a person who has a bit of land which is of no use for agricultural purposes to be told when he gets an opportunity of selling that land for anything up to £1,000, that he cannot sell and that an objection will be made to any development in the area.  He is told that by somebody who drives down there in a big car.  Deputy Murphy has suggested that these people who object to persons selling such land should be made pay some <Col N="1464" /> compensation to the individuals concerned. This is something which the Minister might consider.</P>
    <P>The results of appeals, particularly appeals heard by way of public hearing, should be speeded up.  I know of a case in Ashford where a bungalow was being built in a secluded area but it was found, after planning permission had been granted, that there was right-of-way through the garden which would have to be maintained.  Therefore, the person concerned decided to have the bungalow built a few yards down the lane.  He reapplied for permission only to find that the person who lived on the opposite side of the road objected to the building of the bungalow.  That appeal was upheld and there was a public hearing.  That public hearing took place in November last but no word has as yet been received as to when the builder may start to build or, even, if he will be allowed to build.  The builder has asked me to find out if the result could be speeded up.  He must know whether it will be necessary for him to lay off men or whether he can keep them for another few months.  If he cannot proceed with the building, these men will have to go.  It is rather odd that the person who objected was not a person from the area but somebody who owns a house there and sets it for many months of the year and who would not be affected in any way by the development.</P>
    <P>Mention has been made by Deputies on all sides of the House of the fire fighting service.  I wish to offer my congratulations to everybody concerned, whether on a permanent or part-time basis, with this service.  In Wicklow most of these people are employed on a part-time basis.  There have been requests both from the Government side and from this side of the House, that the retainer these people receive should be free of tax. It has been pointed out that this would not impose any great burden on the Exchequer.  This suggestion, if carried out, would be a gesture of appreciation of the wonderful work being done by these men both in their own time and when they must leave their work.  Not only do these men fight fires but they <Col N="1465" /> are available to carry out many other tasks.  For instance, in County Wicklow they are often called on to rescue people who fall in the mountains or who fall from a cliff into the sea.</P>
    <P>There is a problem in Wicklow at present about which there appears to be some confusion.  It is the question of the upkeep of courthouses by the local authority.  There appears to be some conflict as to who should pay for the upkeep of these buildings.  I do not know whether this matter has been dealt with in the Devlin Report, but I am sure that the county manager and the councillors in Wicklow would gladly ask him to hand over that responsibility to the Department of Justice because at the moment the job is either not being done at all or is being done very badly.  In last Saturday's issue of the <i>Wicklow People</i> there is the headline:</P>
    <P>Council's attitude towards courthouse &ldquo;absolutely disgraceful&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This was the remark of the circuit court judge when he was attending last week.  The newspaper report continues:</P>
    <P>Over the past few years, the Council has refused to provide money for repairs to courthouses, despite repeated requests.  Their refusal is on the grounds that the Department of Justice should be responsible in this matter and they should foot the bill.</P>
    <P>Repeated requests have been sent to the Council for improvements to be carried out at Wicklow Courthouse.</P>
    <P>At the November sessions of the Circuit Court, Judge Deale directed the Co.  Registrar to request the Council to remove the dock, but there has not been compliance with this request.</P>
    <P>It is not only in Wicklow that they have problems.  They also have problems in Rathdrum and Bray. Justices have complained about the conditions.  There have been complaints about the toilet facilities in Rathdrum. After some months these were improved, but for quite a long number of months no court was held.  I understand <Col N="1466" /> the toilet is again out of order. Several requests have been received by the council from Bray.  The district court office staff there could do with additional accommodation but the council have refused to expend any money on the provision of such accommodation. This situation should be remedied.  If the local authority are responsible they should get on with the job of putting the courthouse into a proper state of repair.  If they are not responsible then the Department should get whoever is responsible to carry out the work.</P>
    <P>Last winter the Minister&mdash;I imagine in order to save money&mdash;did something that was rather mean to the very weakest section of the community, those unfortunates on unemployment assistance.  He refused to allocate any money for special employment schemes before Christmas.  The Minister justified his refusal by saying that, because of increased prosperity, there was no great need for these schemes.  For the last 40 or 50 years these schemes were looked forward to by people as a way of having a few extra &ldquo;bob&rdquo; to make the festive season a little bit more like a festive season.  Last year the number in receipt of unemployment assistance rose by something like 2,000.  I hope the Minister will have another look at his decision and if the unemployment figures are in and around the same figure in the next financial year I hope he will feel justified in once more allocating money for these schemes.  This money goes to those most in need of help and most in need of something wherewith to provide themselves with a little Christmas cheer.</P>
    <P>A Bill was passed recently for the relief of rates.  The criticism we made of that measure still stands.  The relief given has to be paid for by the other ratepayers some of whom may be only marginally better off than those receiving the relief.  The Minister should have another look at the situation to see how this relief is working out and who is getting it.  It is left to the local authorities to classify those in need of relief. Because of financial pressures local authorities will naturally keep any relief to the minimum.  I would ask the Minister to examine the situation.  As far as I know it is optional and local <Col N="1467" /> authorities may opt to give the relief. There is urgent need for a complete revaluation of the whole country.</P>

      <P>A small problem has arisen in regard to agricultural abatement.  There are very few instances of it.  I refer to workers who had to leave their employment because they were called up for service with the Army during the emergency last year and in some instances farmers have lost the agricultural abatement because the workers did not have the stipulated number of days.  This problem should be resolved.  It has arisen through no fault of the worker or the farmer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are all concerned about death and injury on the roads.  In 1968 the figure was 447 killed.  In 1969 it rose to 462.  It was pointed out that, though this represents an increase, it is a smaller increase, something like three per cent, than the increase in previous years, which ran at around seven per cent.  Everybody welcomes the measures the Minister has taken&mdash;speed limits, the breathalyser, better signposting and so on&mdash;to reduce the toll of deaths and injuries on our roads.  Any measure the Minister takes designed to reduce the numbers killed an injured will be applauded by everybody in this House. One of the ways in which deaths and injuries might be reduced still further would be by better lighting, particularly of streets in urban areas.  Some experts hold that good lighting reduces accidents by over 30 per cent.  There are different views as to what constitutes good lighting, but if good lighting can bring about an improvement in the accident rate, then this is <Col N="1468" /> something to which immediate consideration should be given. From street to street in this city the lighting varies. From town to town the standard of lighting differs.  Some areas are progressive and have modern-type lighting. In other areas little action is taken to improve lighting standards.</P>
    <P>Another means of reducing accidents would be to improve the condition of roads.  The main roads in my constituency have always been remarkable as being particularly good.  The engineers there have paid great attention to the condition of the roads and introduced some novel improvements with a view to making them safer.  One engineer visited Germany on several occasions and brought back some of the ideas in operation there.  He will probably be remembered as the man who introduced matchsticks on the Wicklow roads.  The idea was taken up by other local authorities and used to indicate dangerous corners.  This simple device is clearly visible at night and is very useful on wet evenings when it is particularly difficult to identify danger spots.</P>
    <P>Driving in modern traffic conditions is no recreation and is the cause of great stress.  Most accidents occur because of stress.  It is stated that blood pressure can increase by 30 per cent in urban traffic and that the pulse rate can increase by as much as 40 per cent in the same situation.  Anybody who drives constantly on the Bray Road will certainly believe this to be quite possible and anybody who has to drive in this city on occasion will know that it is certainly possible.</P>
    <P>I travel on the road between Dublin and Bray several times a week.  I suppose there is no other road in the country that carries the same volume of traffic and that has had as little done with it over the years.  There are a few good straights that were built some years ago at Loughlinstown and other points but they are very short and afford the only opportunity to a driver to pass out convoys of lorries which are constantly on that road.</P>
    <P>Deputy Browne spoke at length about the Bray Road.  I read recently that the part of the road within the <Col N="1469" /> constituency of Dún Laoghaire/Rathdown was being given special attention. I am sure that will be appreciated by everybody who travels from the southeast.</P>
    <P>The Minister is also to be congratulated on the road safety programme introduced in schools.  Visual aid charts have been distributed.  I suppose road safety is best taught at that level and the visual aid charts, with the help of the teachers, must have an effect in heightening children's awareness of the danger in crossing roads.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned that there is still some difficulty in having the school warden system extended to all schools. This is regrettable because school wardens are doing a very good job, particularly in urban areas.  The need for them was brought home to me only today.  I had to visit a child of six years of age who was knocked down by a car outside the national school in Arklow.  He was very lucky.  He has survived a very nasty blow from a car and is recovering.  If there had been a school warden there, this accident might not have happened.  Children of that age need the greatest attention. Children may be taught the rules of the road and the drill for crossing the roads&mdash;look right, look left and look right again&mdash;but when they come to an intersection they think that by saying this little slogan the traffic will automatically stop.  They do not take into account the fact that they must look while they are saying these words. Children of that age who are coming from school unattended need a little more than instruction on charts.  School wardens can serve a very useful and necessary purpose.</P>
    <P>Once again I should like to appeal to the Minister in regard to a local problem and one which also affects Dublin.  I refer to the dissolution of the Bray Urban Council.  In the spring of last year the Minister dissolved the Bray Urban Council and the Dublin Corporation.  He showed great daring and political acumen in doing that before the general election.  The dissolution may have appeared necessary from his point of view.  An urban council is the housing authority, road authority, sanitary authority, library <Col N="1470" /> authority and rating authority for the urban district.  An urban council is not the health authority.  I would imagine I am right in saying that.  It has no say as to the amount of the health estimate or as to how it should be spent but must accept it.  It was this that the urban council in Bray objected to.  It was because they refused to accept the direction of the Minister that they were dissolved.  I could say to the Minister: &ldquo;You have made your point now and since you have been victorious in the general election, why not be magnanimous and reinstate both Dublin Corporation and Bray Urban Council?&rdquo; Democracy cannot be favoured by having huge areas unrepresented in their local councils.  The problems of these areas can be voiced properly only by local representatives. Anybody who thinks that an urban councillor has any great power is fooling himself because the amount of money that the council is responsible for spending is but a very small proportion of the actual income of that authority. They are mainly there to exert influence on how money can be spent. There are certain duties which they must do, like striking a rate, or they can be dissolved.</P>
    <P>The Minister should at this stage consider restoring democracy to both Bray and Dublin by reinstating both councils.  One of the problems in Bray that has been overlooked because there has not been enough local pressure in recent months is the state of the harbour there.  It is not one of the 27 harbours under the Department of Transport and Power: the Department of Local Government are responsible. Anybody who has been in Bray and who has seen the harbour will say it is a disgrace in one of the foremost tourist towns in the country.</P>
    <P>There is also a problem of coast erosion in the Bray urban area which needs immediate attention.  Had there been an urban council in Bray in recent months this would have been voiced more strongly.  Since there is not. I ask the Minister to accept from me that coast erosion in Bray is serious, that he should take a look at the problem in consultation with experts in the area and that he will relieve <Col N="1471" /> from anxiety the many people who live on the seafront.</P>
    <P>As I have said, Bray is a tourist area and in my view it has not had the attention from the Government that many areas in the west and south have got.  For instance, money has not been made available for Bray on the scale of Salthill in Galway.  The town, from the north to Old Bray Head, has a rundown appearance.  I am prepared to say this without fear of being criticised. There is need for investment in that area to bring back to Bray the tourists who have not been coming there in recent years.  I do not wish to go into tourism on this Estimate but I wish to impress on the Minister that amenities are dwindling and crumbling in the area.</P>
    <P>I suppose most of the pressing problems could be solved by one commodity, money, and honestly I think the Minister is being too soft with his colleagues in the Cabinet.  Others seem to get money for their schemes, whether education, health, justice or defence. That is why I wonder if the Minister for Local Government is being as generous to his colleagues now as he was when he drafted the new constituencies, leaving himself in a precarious one and giving them safe ones. I ask him to take note of what I have said in the last hour or so, particularly in regard to road safety, rural sanitation and housing.  I particularly commend those three in the coming months.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's brief was a record from many points of view: from the amount of information given, the fact that more houses were built and more money was spent on them than ever before.  A dozen or more aspects of local government were examined and analysed in it and proposals made for a better system. Speaking as a member of Dublin Corporation, which has been abolished, I wish to avail of this opportunity to examine the whole structure of local government before Bray and Dublin councils are reconstituted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is 800 years this year since we got the system of local government which we still exercise.  We have <Col N="1472" /> altered it in various ways, developing it in many respects and worsening it in others.  At the moment we have a great opportunity to bring in an effective system of local government, strengthening and altering the whole structure so that there will be greater opportunity for the people to benefit both from a political and a physical point of view.</P>
    <P>When the Minister abolished the Dublin and Bray bodies last year he was severely criticised, but if one man has been proved right it is the Minister. I am judging this on the reaction, or the non-reaction, of the people in this city to the abolition of the Dublin City Council.  I speak as a former lord mayor and a member of the abolished city council when I say that most of the people in the city could not have cared less when the council was abolished. There was no tremendous agitation to bring them back.  There was certain political capital made out of it but in the general election which followed the abolition of the council, only one city council member was elected to the Oireachtas who had not already been a Member, and he was a nominee of the Government.  This indicates that the attempts to make political capital out of the refusal to strike a rate in Dublin failed miserably.</P>
    <P>I mention these points to show that our system of local government has not been held in any great affection by the people, particularly in this city, and it is incumbent on us to ensure that when the Dublin Council are reconstituted they will be a new type of body.  I have in mind a body like CIE. At the time of their dissolution, the corporation had too little power to be effective.  I suggest the setting up of bodies in cities throughout the country on an electoral vocational basis.  These bodies should have some power.  At the moment, although CIE can decide which bus services will run to which places and there is nobody to say &ldquo;boo&rdquo; to them, a local authority must get ministerial sanction for the slightest action.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I hope that when the Minister comes to reorganise local government he will give us bodies with some teeth and bite in them to work on behalf of the people.  One of the <Col N="1473" /> greatest weaknesses in the Dublin City Council was revealed when contentious planning applications came before the members.  Usually it was decided not to make a decision at all or to refuse the application, leaving it to an appeal to the Minister.  That is not good for local politics.  By the time the new council have been appointed I hope planning legislation will have been improved to fit in with the new scheme so that we will have an effective city council.  I hope the people will be given an opportunity of voicing their opinion through the ballot box on the election of a new council, and I hope the Minister will give them something worthwhile to vote for, apart from the members.</P>
    <P>Would the Minister tell us when he is replying whether the Dublin Corporation and the city commissioner are in order in issuing eviction notices, rates demands and so on in the name of the lord mayor, aldermen and burgesses when these people do not exist any longer?  I do not mind taking kicks when I am a member, but I regard it as unjust to send out notices in our names or with our titles when we do not have the power to do anything about this, and while we are denied the right to use the titles which the city commissioner uses for us.</P>
    <P>Apart from the housing problem I suppose one of the biggest problems facing the country is the rating problem. The biggest snag about rating is that the expenditure is unrelated to earnings.  Most other forms of taxation can be avoided.  If there is an increased tax on drink one can drink less; if there is an increased tax on cigarettes one can smoke less; or one can refrain from going to the cinema or dancehall.  With rates the statutory figure is struck and, whether one has an income or not, it has to be paid.</P>
    <P>Many Members here have examined the whole rating system and made suggestions to lessen the burden on people. Two years ago some of us here suggested that the Dublin rates could be reduced by 24s in the £ if the rates remission were taken away from the State, the ESB and other such bodies and if the rates remission of the two universities in Dublin were spread <Col N="1474" /> over the whole country.  At the same time a cry went up to take the health charges off the rates.  While that would lessen the rates on individual householders it would increase taxation generally for them.  I would make a suggestion to the Minister which may help.  The Minister could withdraw the rates remission from the commercial and industrial undertakings I have mentioned; then take the health charge off in respect of the ordinary residential ratepayers while leaving it on the industrial and commercial interests, and the balance could be met from the Central Fund.  This would result in a substantial burden being removed from people who cannot afford to pay rates at the present level.  I know the Minister's Department has examined this whole position but I think my suggestion is worth considering.</P>
    <P>The English local authorities have carried out a colossal investigation into the whole rating system and reported: &ldquo;We can offer no real substitute to the present system.&rdquo;  Apart from the fact that the health charges are not on the rates in England, the English system and our own are practically identical, and they say there is nothing to put in its place.</P>
    <P>An effort was made last year to give rates remission to pensioners and other people like that.  It has not worked out very well so far because in Dublin each application is being scrutinised so much that it will take a long time before all the applications are decided. We shall be well into the next financial year before this happens, but the demand for rates will still be pressed on.</P>
    <P>Some heat was engendered here this evening by mention of the housing situation in Dublin.  This is an emotional subject.  One Member said here the Dublin Deputies gave the impression that this was the only place with a housing problem.  I do not think Dublin Deputies of any party believe any such thing.  However, they do resent people speaking on the housing problem who are too lazy to do their homework.  It maddens many Dublin Deputies, particularly on this side of the House, when someone speaks here on the housing problem and pretends he is speaking from some informed <Col N="1475" /> sources when after a while it is obvious he does not know what he is talking about and merely wants to make capital out of it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Clinton accused the Minister of all kinds of things, and mentioned Ballymun in particular.  The Ballymun scheme was undertaken to relieve a tremendous shortage at the time, and it succeeded.  I believe that in two years time we shall have wiped out the big backlog of housing.  Let the Minister who had the foresight to initiate it and the Minister who followed it through take whatever credit is going for this.  This scheme will go down in the history of this city as a real breakthrough in housing.</P>
    <P>It is very easy to say that high rise flats are unsuitable for families.  The ideal situation would be if we could provide a good house with a nice garden and all modern amenities, but it is not so easy to achieve this.  Every city in the world has high rise flats. Personally I do not like them, but I like them better than the tottering tenements and the slums in which people are forced to live, and which gave Dublin at one time the unique, if horrible, distinction of having the highest infant death rate in Europe. Thank goodness that rate has now dropped to minimal proportions, and housing is one of the big factors in bringing this about.</P>
    <P>Ballymun is criticised and it is said that people are unhappy there, that they want to be transferred out of it. People want a transfer out of every scheme.  There are very few people who live in the area in which they want to live.  In a city like this one must accept what one can afford and the best that can be done for oneself. Ballymun is like what Ballyfermot was some years ago.  Ballyfermot used to be scoffed at, and some people would not hear of Ballyfermot.  There are not many people running out of Ballyfermot now because there is a settled community there.  There is a good, thriving, prosperous community there the same as in Coolock and in other places.  Ballymun will be the same.</P>
    <P>The Minister also mentioned Ballymun <Col N="1476" /> in reference to an accident in London where some flats collapsed in a place called Ronan Point.  He said that accident was caused by an explosion. I mention this because it will give people living in high type flats a little solace and a guarantee that they are not living in danger.  The Ronan Point flats are not the same type of flats as have been built in this country. It is amazing that the Ronan Point flats were allowed to be built.  Some architects even condemned them beforehand and one London borough council would not allow them to be built in their borough.  They are what is called a hanging flat and are quite different from the flats in Ballymun or any of the other flats built here, like St. Michael's Estate, which is somewhat similar to Ballymun or perhaps even nicer.</P>
    <P>I mention this point because I saw questions here after the Ronan Point collapse in which the Minister was asked if this could happen at Ballymun. The Ronan Point flats in London and the Ballymun flats in Dublin are two totally different types of construction and it would be impossible to have happen in Ballymun what happened in Ronan Point.  As soon as one flat went in Ronan Point, those on top just slid down after it and unfortunately killed some people.</P>
    <P>In reply to those who say we are doing nothing about housing in the city: the programme on the 1st of this month, which is the latest figure I can get, shows there were just 3,000 dwellings under construction.  Remember, the effective waiting list is 4,000 plus another 4,000 on the unapproved waiting list.  In the coming five years&mdash;it could be even greater if we keep up this momentum&mdash;we will provide 20,000 dwellings.  The population of this city is increasing so much that the housing figures we have up to now may do for the next four or five years, but they will have to be greatly increased in the future.  We are, I feel, heading for a great population explosion. The average age at which people in this city marry is 22.  It has dropped dramatically in recent years. People are now getting married much younger and are demanding a higher <Col N="1477" /> standard of housing.  This perhaps is a good thing, but we must always try to keep a sense of proportion in dealing with housing.</P>
    <P>Nobody has yet invented instant housing and until they do we will have this time lag from the time the scheme is prepared, the land acquired and all the necessary regulations gone through and the time the flats and houses rise.  There is also the fact that unless the economy is sufficiently buoyant&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the big problems in housing today is the fact that land is scarce and dear.  Efforts have been made in this city to re-build the centre of the city.  We must intensify those efforts now because economists tell us that it is bad economics to use arable land for building.  In this city there are lots of spaces which could be built on and which Dublin Corporation are building on.  Perhaps in the new legislation the Minister might introduce a new form of subsidy, as he has done in the case of high rise flats. He might perhaps give a higher subsidy for city areas such as Dublin, Cork, Galway and Waterford where land values are very high but where services already exist.  Although you might spend more in one direction, you would recoup it in another.</P>
      <P>We are on the way to getting the housing drive into higher gear.  We are making provision for the increase in the population of the city and we are offering to young people a good start in life by providing them with housing. There is one part of Dublin, the City Quay area, which has been denuded of housing for various reasons.  Because of lack of planning many years ago it became a commercial and industrial centre and the dwellings were forced out of that area.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>The City Quay area is an old part of Dublin.  We think it should be preserved for the simple reason that there are schools and a church there.  The population in that area is 5,000 approximately.  It could be a good district and is very convenient to the city.  People could live there instead of being sent to the outer suburbs.</P>
      <P>In the last Budget the Minister for Finance introduced a tax on office buildings.  I do not know how effective this move has been.  Where permission is given for a huge office building a tax should be put on it in order to get the developers to agree to build so many square feet of housing for every square foot of office building they erect.  In this way we could ensure that each office development had its counterpart in houses somewhere in the city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1480" /> The housing of old people has been stressed very much.  We have an obligation to rehouse old people in a proper manner.  Last week a blind man was rehoused by the corporation because he had been driven from his home by thugs.  There was also the case of an old woman living alone who was terrorised by people.  Eventually she died.  This may be a matter for the Department of Justice.  The houses for the old should be built in a special way with a special atmosphere in which old people could live their lives as fully as possible without being terrorised by thugs.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to differential rents.  This differential rents scheme is a good one but like most good schemes it has certain weaknesses.  Take the case of a man with a young family, none of whom is earning.  He may work overtime to have more money for clothes for the children or for their education.  At the moment the system penalises him by taking one-sixth of his overtime into consideration in reckoning rent.  I would ask the Minister to examine this aspect of the differential rent system.  Perhaps, he could devise a scheme under which a man with young children should be allowed to earn overtime without having anything taken into consideration in fixing his rent.  If his children are earning it would not be so important because the family could afford the extra money.  A young man rearing a family should be given some little help until his children are old enough to help themselves.</P>
    <P>The Minister has shown how keen he is to have some solution to the itinerant problem.  Are we going the right way about it by setting up these camps?  We are putting the itinerants together but they are still a separate part of society.  We are all very keen on solving the itinerant problem provided it is not solved near our own homes.  The time will come when the itinerants must be fully integrated into our society.  They will become good citizens, living like other people.  Until then, we must have settlements like the one at Labouré Park at Ballyfermot. Families have been taken away from their roadside tents.  We must go <Col N="1481" /> further.  The itinerant children are begging in the streets of our city.  They are objects of pity.  This should not be so.  The children should not be exposed to the dangers in the streets.  Their parents should not allow them to beg like this.  If our social services are not adequate to deal with this problem they should be augmented.  The young children should be kept off our streets.</P>
    <P>The Planning Acts have always been a target for much criticism.  Every person who is refused planning permission is inclined to blame the local authority or the Government.  I do not see how we can have a national planning policy unless there is some ministerial control.  The Minister will be criticised for his decisions or his lack of decision.  It is better that the Minister should retain control of planning authorities because he has been elected by the people.  Any other body who might take over this job would not have been elected by the people.</P>
    <P>Planning today invites the attention of many people in our country.  Deputy Kavanagh spoke about the number of applications in Wicklow.  He gave his idea of how planning has changed.  The Deputy gave a figure for the huge growth of the application rate in Wicklow and showed how the people are becoming more urbanised.  The Deputy has a point.  Much more attention must be given to each application now.</P>
    <P>The Minister's Department is also concerned with pollution.  Since the beginning of time there has been this problem of pollution.  It will, of course, become greater and greater with modern living involving not only motor cars but jet planes.  In our city it is very sad to see our rivers being polluted in some cases by industrial effluent but in others by people using the rivers as refuse dumps.  Unless we take steps now to preserve amenities, whether beaches, rivers or fields we shall be too late.  Now is the time.  The problem is world wide.  Apart from what I may call ground and water pollution there is also pollution from the air and this must constitute a great means of spreading disease.  It makes living in a city almost intolerable at times.  This is a problem that science, which created most of it&mdash;or the abuse <Col N="1482" /> of science&mdash;must solve.  Our efforts in that direction must be intensified before the position becomes worse.</P>
    <P>The Minister's figures for road accidents were heartening in that where we formerly had an increase of seven per cent, the increase last year was about three per cent.  This is good but not good enough and the time has come when we shall have to embark on lavish expenditure on roads in the city.  Day-by-day traffic on these roads increases and they cannot stand up to it without continuous care.</P>
    <P>Two Deputies already spoke about the Bray road which starts in the area I represent.  I am aware of the nightmare it is to road users from Donnybrook to Bray whether motorists or pedestrians.  It is almost impossible for pedestrians to cross this road especially in the Nutley area.  Despite pleas by myself and other people in that area for traffic lights on this road the authorities will not erect them.  There is one set near Donnybrook which has been there for a number of years.  I do not know the accident figures for this road but it is a very dangerous road which contributes a yearly quota of fatal accidents.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to give this road high priority in road planning for the whole country.  If, as we are told, there will be a ten per cent increase in the number of vehicles each year one can imagine what traffic will be like in two years time unless we improve our roads to meet the situation.  Perhaps the Government could be more generous to the greater Dublin area as regards grants for roads. A huge sum is taken in by the Road Fund each year but this is no longer sufficient and we shall need extra grants.</P>
    <P>Some years ago it was suggested that we should have highways leading to and from the city.  While we should start by having a ring-road we must make firm decisions now to create major thoroughfares in order to siphon off traffic from the city more quickly. That would solve one part of the problem, but the problem of the roads in the suburbs and of older streets will remain.  This is a headache because road widening in the city may mean the demolition of many houses.  We <Col N="1483" /> cannot afford the houses and neither can we afford not to deal with the traffic problem.  The Minister and his advisers have quite a big problem on their hands in regard to roads, apart from housing or anything else.</P>
    <P>Again, I want to commend the work of the school wardens in the city.  I like to think it was myself and other members of the Fianna Fáil Party in Dublin Corporation who initiated the warden scheme which was first adopted there and later copied throughout the country.  These wardens are doing great work protecting children's lives. Every year most speakers ask the Minister to provide more swimming pools and I repeat that plea although in the past two years a number of new ones have been provided in the city. At least six have been built.  One was provided by the corporation and another by private enterprise or by the Vocational Education Committee with Government help.  In a city of 750,000 people more swimming pools are needed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>It depends on circumstances. If it is a youth club they get special rates.  If you or I went there I suppose we would pay about a shilling or two.  I might point out that in Lurgan in the Six Counties they pay about seven and six.  We are making progress in regard to pools but not as much nor as quickly as we would like.  I hope in the coming financial year the Minister will be able to make more money available to provide at least two more pools in the city.  I do not want this done at the expense of any other part of the country because these pools are <Col N="1484" /> necessary in all parts of the country whether they are near the sea or not. I will conclude by making an appeal to the workers, the management and everybody concerned in the cement strike to make their best efforts to end this strike which is causing unemployment and will also hit the housing drive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to speak about the Buchanan Report which has been frequently mentioned in this House but has not really been debated up to now.  I think we should give it some consideration in this debate.  The history of this report is one of the most depressing instances of Government procrastination that we have had in the sixties, a period in which, quite evidently, the pace of economic events as a result of the economic growth secured in this period, has clearly over-strained both the political and administrative resources of the Government and has created a situation in which the decision-making capabilities of the Government and their advisers have not kept pace with the needs of the situation.  I cannot feel that a period of seven years considering a problem, at the end of which no decision is reached or where the decision, judging by Question Time today, is deferred almost indefinitely, is anything other than an example of non-Government of the most objectionable and unfortunate kind from the point of view of the future of this country.</P>
      <P>There are, of course, divided views on this report.  I have a very strong view on it.  I am aware that different views are held and I think in all parties there are divergent views depending on, perhaps, local interests and pressures. The one thing that is unforgivable is not that people do not agree with the report or adopt its recommendations automatically. There is no reason why they should.  The report may not necessarily produce the best solution in every respect.  What is unforgivable is that such a length of time has been allowed to elapse during which there has been total inertia, lack of any decision, during which the country has drifted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1485" /> Let us take it back to the beginning. I think from recollection&mdash;and I cannot be more than a few months out&mdash;it was about the end of 1962 that the Committee on Industrial Organisation turned its attention to this problem. Certainly during most of 1963 one of its committees discussed it and it was then discussed in the general committee itself.  There was within the committee a substantial agreement on the matter.  It is true that one group of public servants had a somewhat divergent view but in the process of discussion the arguments for creating development centres in parts of the country other than Dublin so as to attract the growth of industry away from Dublin and to secure a balanced growth of the economy through industrial growth in the country as a whole, were so cogent that even those in the committee who had doubts at first were persuaded.</P>
    <P>At the end of 1963 the committee published a unanimous recommendation on this subject, a unanimity which included the views of officials of the Department of Industry and Commerce and the Department of Finance, of the trade unionists, of the representatives of industry who were there, all of whom had given long consideration to the matter and had heard all the arguments vigorously debated.  There was no question of one side of the case only being put; it was a long and vigorous debate and they came down unanimously in favour of a policy&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGeoghegan" hpid="Mr. Geoghegan Mr. Geoghegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Geoghegan</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, I do not want to interrupt the Deputy but I do not think the Buchanan Report has been discussed in the House although it has been mentioned by Deputies in passing.  The Minister at Question Time today said that this matter was being examined all the time.  I will bow to the ruling of the Chair but I feel that this is opening up a new debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be astonished to find I was out of order in discussing the Buchanan Report on regional development on the Estimate of the Department responsible for local and regional development.  The mere fact that the Government have not taken a decision can scarcely rule <Col N="1486" /> out debate.  That would, indeed, be a new Parliamentary principle introduced and one which I do not think the House would readily accept.  I think I am relevant.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>If I anticipate my conclusion it might help the Leas-Cheann Comhairle to see the extent to which what I am saying is relevant. What I am trying to do is to trace the history of the proposal to establish growth centres as a part of the regional development policy, a proposal which led eventually to the establishment of the Buchanan study group by the Minister for Local Government which presented its report to the Minister who has for the last 18 months been sitting on it and not taking a decision.  It seems to me that in tracing the history of this proposal and showing for how long it has been delayed by the Government as a whole and for how long decisions on it have been delayed by the Minister who is responsible and who commissioned this report, I am relevant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The CIO reported at the end of 1963. The report was published in January, 1964.  What was the Government's reaction to this clear-cut unanimous recommendation by these divergent interests and people with different viewpoints who felt that industrial development could be better achieved and the country's economy made to develop more rapidly and in a more balanced way to the advantage of areas outside Dublin if a policy of growth centres were adopted?  The Government's decision was referred to another committee. That committee took a year to report and when it reported, possibly to the Government's discomfiture, it also reported with absolute unanimity on the matter&mdash;the people the Government had themselves chosen to consider <Col N="1487" /> this particular matter, most of them civil servants but one or two from outside the public service.  They did not agree with one recommendation of the CIO, in fairness.  They did not agree that there should be special grants in growth centres.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <P>It had not even struck me that legislation was required. Certainly, I was not going to advocate it.

    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Denis Francis Jones">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chair is concerned to ensure that the debate on the Estimate is kept to the administration of the Department by the Minister over the past 12 months. A reference to documents like this, provided the Deputy does not produce arguments that would call for legislation&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think anything I have to say relates to legislalation. What I am concerned with is the failure of the Minister to take a decision over the past 12 months on this matter and the fact that this follows against a long background of Governmental failure, in which the Minister participated as the Minister principally concerned, to take decisions on this matter.</P>
      <P>This new committee reported at the end of 1964.  The Government, including the Minister for Local Government, sat on its report for eight months and then announced that they accepted growth centres in principle but that the choice of growth centres other than Waterford and Galway, the latter having been added partly at the instance of the NIEC&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Denis Francis Jones">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chair would like to know if the <Col N="1488" /> Deputy is dealing with governmental responsibility rather than ministerial responsibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Chair will allow me to complete that sentence I will come precisely to the Minister. What was decided was that no choice of other growth centres would be made until growth centres emerged from the studies to be commissioned by the Minister for Local Government.  That was in August 1965 and the Minister, although this matter was almost three years old, waited for a period of 15 months before commissioning the studies out of which were to emerge the growth centres upon which a decision would eventually allegedly be based.  In October 1966 he commissioned the Buchanan Report.  Less than two years later Buchanan reported.  It seems a long period but in view of the massive scale of the report which I have here, without its appendices, and the extraordinary amount of work involved it is not an excessive period. What is excessive is the intervals of non-decision by the Government and by the Minister in particular which preceded the setting up of the Buchanan study, the period of 15 months waiting to take a decision to set up a study upon which decisions were to be based and the period of a further 15 months which has now elapsed since the committee reported in September 1968.</P>
      <P>The Minister then sat on this report until May, 1969 when, for reasons best known to himself and not hitherto explained, he published it, without announcing any decisions of any kind or without explaining what he had been doing with it in the previous months.  Since May 1969 a further nine months have elapsed during which we have still no decision of any kind from the Minister.  The Minister did in opening this debate make a reference to this matter.  He said&mdash;and I welcome this statement&mdash;they could not expect to establish a true balance in the future between the population in the east and in the south and west nor could they expect to attract development away from Dublin unless they built up really strong towns in other areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1489" /> That is what the Minister said in opening this debate.  This is the nearest we have got to any kind of clear decision or endorsement of this principle. When the Minister was asked today what was happening about this matter his reply&mdash;of which I have no record now&mdash;seemed to say that not only had no decision been taken in 15 months but that no decision was needed and there would not be any decision but that we would drift indefinitely. Up to this point we have had a total lack of decision by the Government but there was always the hope that at some point in this seven years saga the Minister would eventually make up his mind.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I was endeavouring to give my impression of what he said. I listened carefully but there was some noise.  I asked a supplementary question to clarify the position and the Minister made a further reply out of which it emerged that he felt there was no need to have a decision.  He assured the House&mdash;and I am not misquoting him on this because we had quite a discussion on it for some minutes&mdash;that State bodies like CIE did not have a problem in planning ahead without decisions being taken.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chair is in some difficulty in regard to this matter.  The Deputy seems to be enlarging the scope of discussion with his reference to Question Time. In regard to the Estimate before the House, matters of general policy do not properly arise unless the Minister himself has widened the scope by reference to it in his brief.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I have quoted from a newspaper what the Minister said.  He has made a general statement endorsing the growth centre principle and I suppose after seven years that is a great step forward.  However, what he has not done is to take a decision on the recommendations in the Buchanan Report and it seems to me <Col N="1490" /> that it was the duty of the Minister in the carrying out of the functions of his Department during the 12 months we are reviewing to take a decision in this matter.  His failure is a clear example of maladministration and I submit I am entitled, even if other speakers before me have not referred to this matter, to speak on it, to refer to the recommendations in this report which were published by the Minister in May last, which have not been hitherto discussed in this House except peripherally in relation to other matters.  This matter can only be discussed on the Estimate of the Minister for Local Government who is the Minister who commissioned the report, to whom it was submitted and who has failed to act on it.  I shall be guided by the Chair if it is felt improper for me to pursue this matter but I am in doubt on what other Estimate I can take this matter up.  It is an example of maladministration on the part of the Minister for Local Government and it is within the scope of his Department.  It is true that in earlier examples of maladministration the Government as a whole were responsible but I am now dealing precisely with the responsibilities of this Minister and this Department in this year, in the action he failed to take on the recommendation he received on the report he commissioned.</P>

    <P>In this report recommendations are made, the effects are quantified, and a clear estimate is made of what would be the consequences of carrying out these recommendations and of not carrying them out.  I think I am in order in referring to this and in challenging the Minister in replying to this debate to reconsider his announcement today that he did not see the need for any decision on this matter.  This report, if adopted, would in the terms expressed therein result in very considerable changes in the population of many local centres in this country&mdash; changes in population not only by comparison with the present but with what the populations of the centres would be if these decisions were not taken.  By failing to take a decision on this matter the Minister is holding up a whole series of important decisions in his Department, as well as in other <Col N="1491" /> Departments, which are essential to the proper development of the different regions of the country for whose administration he is responsible.</P>
    <P>If I may take the example of CIE, it is inconceivable that they could prepare concerted, well-thought-out, long-term plans for the development of its system which is built on an axis&mdash; the main-line Dublin to Cork with a spur to Limerick&mdash;if they do not know whether the Minister for Local Government plans to adopt this report which would increase the population of Cork to 250,000 people and in the case of Limerick increase the population in the Limerick-Shannon-Ennis area three-fold.  It seems clear to me that any body concerned with transport facilities, planning ahead for five, ten or 20 years would have to know whether this doubling or trebling of the population of these centres was going to take place or whether the Government was going to reject this report and adopt some other policy. They would need to know whether a policy of drift, of allowing Dublin to grow, combined with a policy of limited, dispersed development of small industries scattered throughout the country and inadequate to meet our employment opportunities, was going to be followed.  From what the Minister has said it would appear that what the Government have in mind is to avoid this political nettle, so that Dublin will continue to grow at more than two per cent per annum, so that part of the country will relatively decline and much of the country decline in absolute terms, and far from developing major centres in Cork and Limerick and another half-dozen centres in other parts of the country, including an increase of the population of Sligo of the order of 65 per cent, this policy of drift will continue.</P>
    <P>How can a transport company plan for the future when it does not know whether this programme is to be implemented? How can the corporations of Dublin, Cork and Limerick make long-term plans, reserving land for industrial housing development, if they do not know whether their population is to rise by 50 per cent, to be doubled or trebled?  No decisions of a long-term <Col N="1492" /> character can be taken.  The size of a sewerage or water supply scheme cannot be decided and if the authorities go ahead and take a decision without knowing whether the Buchanan recommendations are to be accepted they may introduce a scheme far too small, which would be more costly per unit than the bigger scheme which might be required for the larger areas envisaged in Buchanan.</P>
    <P>In respect of transport and industrialisation nothing can be decided, no firm decisions can be taken and no planning can be undertaken beyond a very short period in the absence of a decision from the Minister.  For the Minister to tell this House that no problems are created by the lack of decision and to imply that no decision is needed, is scandalous and for that to happen after a period of seven years of buck-passing, of setting up committee after committee, of letting nine months intervene between each committee and of letting periods of 15 months elapse without taking a decision on the recommendations is a peculiarly scandalous example of the Minister's ineptitude and political lack of courage.</P>
    <P>All these things need to be said: they are entirely relevant to this debate and the people of this country in the next 20 years will not readily forgive the Government if this policy of drift continues. This report is entirely in line, although, of course, much more precise in its quantification and its local proposals, with previous recommendations of the CIO and NIEC and it has backed them up in this matter.  We are entitled to know from the Minister on what kind of advice he is basing either his decision to take no decision or his decision to reject these proposals.  Who are these experts who know so much more than the civil servants in the various Departments who have sat on these committees, so much more than people like those from the Shannon Free Airport Development Company who were represented on these committees, so much more than trade unionists and industrialists who were on these committees and who were all unanimous, so much more than the expert Buchanan team and who, knowing this, are apparently advising that the Buchanan Report is wrong <Col N="1493" /> and that the NIEC are wrong but who will not tell us why they are wrong or where they are wrong.  What answer are they giving?  We are entitled to know what is the policy and on what it is based.  We know the arguments in favour of the Buchanan policy.  These arguments may be open to challenge but I would like to hear that challenge. I am quite prepared to hear that the Buchanan Report has defects.  I can see some defects in it myself but the defects I see with my limited knowledge of the report cannot fundamentally affect the validity of the general structure of the decisions.</P>
    <P>It may well be that the Minister has available to him expert advice of a kind unknown to the rest of the public service or unknown to the Buchanan team.  Perhaps this advice is leading him to a conclusion different from that of the team, but if there is a different conclusion let us hear it. Let us hear where Buchanan went wrong.  We are entitled to hear these things before we accept either an adverse decision or, worse still, a non-decision on the matter.  So far we have heard nothing apart from a hint from the Minister for Industry and Commerce that something has happened since the report was published which he cannot disclose but which changes the conclusions.  I cannot conceive anything which might have happened since then to fundamentally change the conclusions although it could affect the qualifications of these decisions in respect of one particular centre or centres.</P>
    <P>We cannot go on indefinitely setting up committees to produce reports to be sent to committees that produce reports to be left without even a statement from the Government as to whether they favour the recommendations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I suggest that we are half a year older and more deeper in debt?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>If we were only half a year older one could accept it but we have had about 15 half-years of this.  What is at stake here is fundamental.  Let us be clear about what we are discussing.  The Buchanan Report suggests that, on their calculations&mdash;nobody <Col N="1494" /> has produced any criticism or variation of them&mdash;and if their policies were adopted in the period ahead up to 1986, the population of the eastern half of Ireland, if one were to draw a line down the centre of this island, would rise by 409,000 or 22½ per cent.  However, the Buchanan Report suggests that if present policies are pursued the population of the eastern half of the country will rise but only by 63,000 or six per cent.</P>
      <P>Perhaps they are wrong.  Perhaps the Government have reason to believe they are wrong but to my mind the report of an expert committee of this kind, a committee selected by the Minister and well selected, should not be ignored.  The Minister's decision to appoint this team rather than to have separate teams for each region of the country was an excellent decision. It might have been better if it had been taken earlier instead of having two regional reports first but it was a good decision and I congratulate the Minister on it.</P>
      <P>However, that decision having been taken by the Minister or by his predecessor, these recommendations are produced and these estimates are given, but if the Government do not agree with them they should do so openly and not just ignore the whole matter.  What the Buchanan Report says, and they give reasons for saying so, is that, if their recommendations are adopted, 72,000 more people will have jobs in this country by 1986 rather than if present policies are pursued and those 72,000 people would, of course, have dependants so that the population of this country would be raised by 140,000 above the level it would reach on the basis of present policies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Can we in this House afford to ignore such recommendations?  Can anybody carry on his conscience the ignoring of such recommendations by people who know their job and who have produced a very comprehensive report?  Are we entitled not just to reject this with argument but to ignore it and to carry on as if the point had never been made?  Can we turn down the possibility of these extra 140,000 people?  This is what we will do if <Col N="1495" /> the Minister for Local Government is not prepared to discuss the recommendations or to say whether there should be a decision.</P>
    <P>Again, if we divide the country down the centre we will realise that there will be gains and losses in both areas. The implementation of the recommendations would mean an increase in population in one area and a reduction in the other.  According to the report, two-thirds of the loss of population in certain rural areas will be concentrated east of this line.  There are areas in the eastern part of Ireland in which there will be 38,500 fewer people if these recommendations are accepted, while in the western half the areas adversely affected will be affected to the extent of only 19,000; but what about the benefits?  Three-quarters of the benefits of these recommendations would accrue in the western part of the country.  The Buchanan team estimate that for the increase of 143,500 in population in the western half of the country, there will be an increase in the eastern half of 55 per cent.</P>
    <P>Very often, people in this House are vociferous about the western and eastern parts.  They tend to confine the west rather narrowly to Connaught but when I speak of the west I am speaking of the whole western part of the country, lest there be any misunderstanding between the western and the eastern parts.  So much is said in this House about the loss of population in the western area, about the need to preserve rural Ireland and about the problem of Dublin expanding so rapidly at the expense of the rest of the country, but yet there is silence on the recommendations of the Buchanan Report.  The Minister's silence on these recommendations is indefensible.</P>
    <P>There is much more in the report. Recommendations are put forward as to why it is necessary to have decentralised development in growth centres. Recommendations are put forward giving the reasons why these growth centres, if established on a sufficient scale, could attract industry which we do not now attract.  Our present policy in this regard is not designed to attract industry to the country on a large scale.  It is true that we have been <Col N="1496" /> successful to a significant degree but we could become more successful in attracting smaller or medium-sized industries.</P>
    <P>We have been a little too successful, perhaps, in attracting industries employing female labour.  We have not hitherto, though I think the project in Sligo may possibly be the first, had any industry employing large numbers of male workers comparable with any of the dozen industries Northern Ireland has attracted.  The reason why we have not attracted these industries is that there is nowhere to put them, no place with the resources in water, sewerage and housing.  Our policies have been directed to bringing in industries small enough to fit into the limited environment we have.  Our population is dispersed and the number of unemployed in absolute terms is small in most areas, though it is quite a high percentage, and we tend to bring in industries small enough to mop up these small pools of unemployment, industries which will not be so embarrassing as to create problems from the point of view of housing, water, sewerage, and so on.</P>
    <P>I exaggerate.  Of course, the Government have brought in some industries big enough but, on the whole, the industries have been small and, on the whole, we have not set out to attract large industries.  It would seem to me that one good reason for not doing so is that there is nowhere to put them, because of the embarrassment that would be created if we did get them. Anybody who talks to those concerned with industrial development knows how true this is and how much of an embarrassment a really large industry, such as those which Northern Ireland has attracted, would be for us because of our total failure to plan and prepare for them.</P>

      <P>I am not at all demurring to that.  The incentive scheme has been excellent.  On the whole, the incentives are good, though there have been criticisms here.  The Opposition endorses them, but it is no good having incentives to attract industries if the industries cannot get the water, the sewerage or the workers because there are no houses for workers.  It is not the Department of Industry and Commerce which is at fault.  It is the Department of Local Government because of its failure to provide the facilities without which we cannot get the industries we need.  If I were in the Department of Industry and Commerce I would be pretty frustrated with the Department of Local Government and I would go so far as to say that there are people in that Department who are frustrated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>These are some of the points that need to be made.  Perhaps it is futile to make them but, when the Government fail to intervene, as they did in this instance, then they should be indicted.  At times we may be too harshly critical of the Government but when they are doing something they ought to get some credit.  I do not think one can be too harshly critical of the Government not doing things in an area in which decisions are so badly needed and I trust that by my remarks here tonight I may, perhaps, provoke some kind of reaction ultimately from the Minister.</P>
      <P>The Minister's Department is one which has a reputation for excessively rigid and bureaucratic control over the local authorities, for whose activities it is in a general sense responsible.  I think it was the Maud committee in Britain which, having examined the position in seven countries, said in Ireland the system of control was much the tightest anywhere of any of the countries it had examined.  We need to consider why this should be so and I think the Maud committee has received support from the Devlin group which, if I recall correctly, quoted from the Maud committee on this very point.  In the Devlin Report it is stated that:</P>
      <P>Within the Department of Local Government, there is a dual structure of administrative and technical skills. In each of the main functions, the administrative sections have the responsibility for decisions; the technical staff have a mainly advisory role.</P>
      <P>The report goes on to say:</P>
      <P>It could delegate more responsibility to local authorities and exercise less rigid control.</P>
      <P>It adds, and I must quote this in all fairness:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been a trend towards delegating more to local authorities during the past ten years, and to cutting out particular controls, generalising sanctions, and freeing local authorities to operate within reasonably  <Col N="1499" /> wide limits of autonomy.  The Secretary has expressed his hope to see this trend emphasised even more, so that the time and energy of the Department could be directed to a greater degree into positive, constructive thinking and action.</P>
    <P>They add, somewhat tartly, I think:</P>
    <P>There is an opportunity to continue this trend; a substantial degree of central control still exists, which results in delay and duplication, frustration of initiative and complication in long-range planning.  In our view, the model to aim at might be the degree of operational discretion given to the non-commercial state-sponsored bodies which would become executive units under our proposal.</P>
    <P>That would bring me into the whole question of the Devlin Report concept of how these non-commercial, state-sponsored bodies which would become executive units would operate.  The report goes on to say:</P>
    <P>Local authorities could already be given more general powers to act in the interests of their areas, subject to appropriate safeguards.</P>
    <P>That is to say, local authorities could be given more general powers even without implementing this proposal in the report with regard to non-commercial State-sponsored bodies.</P>
    <P>The report further states:</P>
    <P>The current application of the doctrine of <i>ultra vires,</i> together with the specific terms in which local government statutes tend to be drawn, encourage rigid control over local authority activities by the Department and deter local authority initiative. In a number of other countries, local authorities operate successfully within a general competence to act for the good of the community.</P>
    <P>In other words, their Governments trust them.</P>
    <P>Similar powers could be extended to local authorities subject to such specific limitations as were considered necessary.  Block sanctions <Col N="1500" /> could be substituted for the detailed financial and technical control of individual projects.  Control systems involving duplicated approval for individual schemes should be eliminated when general approval has already been given.  Where technical controls are abandoned, the Department should establish standards to which local authorities should be expected to adhere.</P>
    <P>The report also recommends that, over a period of time, the role of departmental inspectors should change from control to that of providing expert technical advice in a consultative or staff capacity.  Other recommendations include the elimination of the practice of surcharge which, the report says, is rarely upheld on appeal and, at any rate, alternative sanctions exist with which to discipline local authority officers.  &ldquo;Few other European countries employ the system.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>These are some of the points made in this report and it is clear from these and from other sections of the report that there is this problem of excessively rigid control and duplication of functions because, in another part of the report, there is reference to approval being required four times at different stages of the same proposal. Excessively rigid control is particularly marked in the Department of Local Government and, remembering the extent to which it exists in the public service as a whole, that is saying something.  It is true, the report says, that this situation has been ameliorated over the last ten years and it is only right to recognise that fact, but ten years is a long time in which to half-introduce an administrative reform.</P>
    <P>I would hazard a guess, without being too close to the subject, that if one assessed the whole problem in 1960 of what needed to be done, I doubt very much if what has been done so far represents even one-third of the changes that are required.  The pace of change is much too slow.</P>
    <P>We need some kind of breakthrough here to a different system of administration altogether which involves trusting local authorities&mdash;mark you, <Col N="1501" /> trusting them subject to a system of inspection, a system of standards, but, subject to that, trusting them.  Any system that involves seeking approval, not once, but two, three or four times for the same project at different stages of development is a system which is clearly unduly cumbersome.  I am not saying that there is no reason for it. I have never yet found an administrative procedure which could not be defended and was not defended by the officials concerned as being needed for certain reasons, but when one examines these reasons one finds that the reasons may derive from an excessive emphasis on accountability and quite inadequate emphasis on efficiency or, indeed, on any kind of local democracy, as we are speaking of local government.</P>
    <P>There is room for great change here. I hope the Minister will do something about it.  I am a little special because he gives the impression in the way he approaches problems of a man concerned to maintain a good deal of control and power in his own hands.  I am sure that doing so he feels he has good reasons.  We all tend to feel that we know best.  We all tend to be bad at delegating&mdash;some of us are worse than others.  I have a slight feeling that by comparison with some other Ministers the Minister for Local Government is worse at delegating rather than better. I am therefore a little pessimistic about changes being made of the kind indicated as required by the Devlin Report, but not completely without hope.  I would hope that the Minister would come to this House fairly soon with other members of the Government to tell us what they are going to do about Devlin, what they are going to do about the general recommendations and what they are going to do about particular recommendations affecting their Departments and I would hope that at that time we would have something constructive from the Minister on this subject.</P>
    <P>I want to turn now to the subject which has dominated this debate, and I think rightly, although I have tried to introduce other subjects too&mdash;the subject of housing.  I think rightly because there is no doubt in my mind that this <Col N="1502" /> is at this moment our greatest and most urgent social problem.  Deputy Moore made a number of good points, some that I might not agree with, and he said very properly that you do not solve this problem overnight, that houses do not grow on trees, houses take time to be built, plans take time to be made.  I am aware of this.  I am also aware of the point repeatedly stressed from the other side of the House, somewhat defensively but understandably from a Government in the present situation as regards housing, that housing costs are rising, that already a significant portion of the Budget is devoted to housing, that there are many other requirements that have to be met, that the Government are doing their best.  We have had all these arguments.  There is obviously some merit in them.  Clearly, housing is expensive.  Clearly, the cost of providing this country, and this city particularly, with the housing it needs is something that would tend to overstrain our resources unless we are prepared to cut back somewhere else.</P>
    <P>In advocating more houses in tune with most other people on this side of the House, and indeed with some on the other side of the House, I am not failing to recognise this fact.  I am not, I hope, being unrealistic as an economist in speaking here on this subject as a politician.  But, there are times when social needs are of such a character, such a magnitude, such an intensity, that they demand to be met even if this means some short-term economic loss. On the whole, the balance of policies of the Government between social and economic in the years from 1958 to 1963 was probably appropriate to that period.  It was possible validly to criticise the Government of that time for inadequate attention to social issues but at the same time in the situation in which the country was at the end of the 1950s it was right that the Government should give a particular priority to economic growth until we could get some kind of sustained economic growth under way.  To concentrate exclusively or almost exclusively on social policies, on social capital investment, could be to create a situation which would be self-defeating, in which growth would be halted and further <Col N="1503" /> social development made impossible and the emphasis which the Government put on economic growth in that period, although it could be argued to be excessive and there are many who will disagree with me, seemed to me to be not too unreasonable and possible to justify.</P>
    <P>What cannot be justified is the slowness with which the Government have reacted, in fact up to this point their failure to react, to the changing situation. Once the economy had got off the ground and once it was moving forward, it was right that the Government should adjust their sights; it was right that their priority should shift; it was right that they should begin to consider much more seriously the inadequacy of social provisions, particularly in areas like housing.  If the Government have to have some system of priorities in allocating resources, if they are going to give more resources to one, they give less to something else. It was right that in the period since 1962-63 the Government should be prepared to shift resources from areas, perhaps to the disadvantage even of economic growth in those areas, to social requirements which became increasingly pressing.</P>
    <P>This was all the more right because the very economic growth being achieved in those years was itself creating social problems because, if you do secure economic growth, if you do manage to get an economy moving at three or four per cent per annum, if you do stabilise&mdash;perhaps increase&mdash;the total population and the work force slightly and if you certainly increase the population and the work force in the towns and cities, then you are building up for yourself social problems of great magnitude unless soon after you start this process of economic growth you start making adequate provision for this purpose.</P>
    <P>It is the peculiar characteristic of the Fianna Fáil Government that while they were quick to spot the need to shift the emphasis to economic growth in the late 1950s&mdash;and had I been in the House on these benches at that time I would have had to congratulate them at the time, although it might have been politically embarrassing to <Col N="1504" /> do so, on that shift&mdash;they have been quite extraordinarily slow in unlearning that lesson and in readjusting their sights to our social needs.  The time this is taking is really quite incredible. This is all the more so because this relationship between the economic and social investment is so close that, the Government having failed to recognise the social needs created by economic growth, having failed to shift resources into social investment in the period when it was needed, this lack of social investment is now one of the main constraints on economic growth for the reasons I have mentioned before: because of the fact that we do not have the water supplies and sewerage, that we do not have the housing for industrial workers and therefore cannot attract the industries, and that when a new industry comes, instead of it being a boon, sometimes it is far from being a boon &mdash; it may be a boon to the workers&mdash;it may pollute rivers, it may create slum conditions because there are no houses and more workers come to live in an area where there are not enough extra houses for them. Instead of being something advantageous to us, it can even become something which, for the time being at any rate, has harmful consequences because of the failure of the Government to adapt to this new situation.</P>
    <P>One of the more striking failures here, one which is only gradually and painfully being adjusted, still inadequately, has been the failure to recognise the need for quite long-term planning in the provision of the basic infrastructure of water supplies and sewerage&mdash;sewerage above all.  The provision for the sanitary services has been quite extraordinary.  I think I am right in recalling that in the Second Programme whoever drafted it made quite substantial provision for sanitary services, water supplies and sewerage, that the financial provision made was much greater than previously and, while perhaps not adequate, was certainly a significant advance.  Somebody somewhere in the public service in 1963 saw the need to step up investment in this area but I am afraid that somebody else somewhere, or some other people somewhere, never got around to spending the money and so year after <Col N="1505" /> year throughout the Second Programme you had your figure of whatever it was &mdash;£3 million or £4 million&mdash;set aside for this purpose, half spent&mdash;half spent year after year.  Somebody somewhere lacked the vision of the man who put in the figure in the first instance and made no plans to spend it.  That was despite the fact that anybody who knew anything at all about the problem of Dublin knew that if Dublin was to expand it would be necessary to build the drainage system along the Dodder; that this was going to take a long period&mdash;probably the figure that has been mentioned of six or seven years from the point of planning to the point of completion&mdash;and despite the fact that everybody knew after 1962 that the population of Dublin was growing and would continue to grow and that it could not be catered for in housing unless this drainage was provided. Nothing was done.</P>
    <P>Earlier, the planning that should have taken place did not take place and we are now in a position, as a result of the absence of developed land in the hinterland of Dublin, that the price of land has rocketed and that people engaged in speculating in land are profiteering for two reasons.  One is because the Government have made provision for and are putting in services, and owing to our economic system the profit accrues not to the public but to the owners of the land; the second is that all those people are making more money because the Government have put in services and, because of the artificial price of serviced land, prices have rocketed. One of the persons who has particular expertise in this sphere has given figures, and has given them to an official body, to the effect that the value of land in the hinterland of Dublin has been raised from £1,500 to £5,000 by the failure to provide adequate services for land.  The idea that the cost of a house should be increased by several hundred pounds because land is serviced or is not serviced seems to be ludicrous, one of the most peculiar examples of economic lunacy I have ever heard of.</P>
    <P>There is the question of responsibility because of the lack of planning foresight.  There are those who had not <Col N="1506" /> the foresight to spend the money that was furnished by others who had the foresight to allocate it, so we are in the position that we have the price of land rocketing to levels which are quite indefensible.  This is something which is peculiarly the responsibility of the Department of Local Government. That Department have only recently woken up to the real importance of this.  It is only in the last year or so that the magnitude of the problem seems to have struck and there has been a gradual improvement, a gradual provision during the last three years. However, I emphasise that this has been gradual.  The real gravity does not seem to have got across until a year ago.</P>
    <P>This is the background to our housing problem, not so much to our present housing problem as to our future problem.  Because it has had an effect on the cost of building houses by increasing the cost, it has meant that the resources available have to be spread more thinly and that some of the capital available for housebuilding has to be spent not on the building of houses but on paying speculative prices for the land on which they are to be built.  Apart from that, there is the failure to make provision for the future housing progress.  All this has meant that while fewer houses are being built more money has gone to the speculators.</P>
    <P>I feel I must deal with the Government's past housing performance and first of all I wish to put a few figures on record.  There has been a lot of confusion in the House about housing and both sides have contributed to this confusion.  We have all tended to select the figures which suited us best.  It is an occupational hazard but I think it is true to say that the Government are less scrupulous than we are.  I therefore feel I should put the full picture before the House, not a selective one but with the good and the bad sides.  It is important that we should get this on the record.</P>
    <P>Giving the figure for 1947-48, I point out that it does not include conversions. The number of houses built in that year was 1,602.  That was perhaps in no way to the discredit of the <Col N="1507" /> Government at that time because very clearly the resources for building houses were not available at that time, building being at a low ebb during the war.  What was astonishing in retrospect, and it is one of the most remarkable achievements of any Government, is that within three years the number of houses built jumped to 12,305 from 1,602.</P>
    <P>I do not mention that figure solely to recall the particular success of a particular Minister of a particular Government but we have heard a great deal in the House from Deputies Foley, Dowling and Moore about this, that and the other, about 1957-58 when they were trying to catch up.  We must remember that in those days the wealth of the country was much less than it is now&mdash;it was about 60 per cent&mdash;and the astonishing thing is that a Government could increase housing from 1,600 to 12,000 in three years.  In that context I fail to see why the most a Government in a country which is 40 per cent better off can do is to increase housing from 5,000 in 1962 to 13,000 today.  It has taken them more than twice as long to increase the number of houses by half in a country 40 per cent better off.  I do not think anybody in the Government benches who has been making statements would claim that that is comparable.</P>
    <P>In a year after that for which I have given the first figure, the Government were out of office.  In comparing these figures one has to allow a year after a change in Government.  Allowing for this year, 1952-53 reflected the culmination of the housing drive of the inter-Party Government, and in that year 14,050 houses were built; contrary to the assertion of Deputies Moore, Dowling, Foley and others, in this year we are still 1,050 houses short of what was achieved in 1952-53.  In the years following that, housing declined somewhat. There were 9,800 built in 1955-56 and we recovered to a new but a low peak of 10,070.  There was then a sharp fall following the economic crisis.  What has happened since then? Over a period of years up to 1963-64, the Government increased housing to 7,400 and in the following years to <Col N="1508" /> 10,900, leading to the present figure of 13,000.</P>
    <P>These increases are useful and welcome in themselves and the Deputies on the other side of the House are welcome to take credit for the increase in housing that has taken place.  However, they are not entitled to speak as if this has solved our problem or is even adequate to maintain housing at the present level.  They are not entitled to obscure the issue either by saying housing is now at a record level or that they cannot build up housing any quicker without overstraining the economy, when, in fact, without overstraining the economy, in that period 1947-48 to 1950-51 housing was pushed from 1,600 to 12,300.</P>
    <P>There is no political advantage to be gained from the figures, and there is certainly no national advantage to be gained in pretending that housing is now at a record level or in pretending that you can only build your housing up painfully at 500 or 1,000 a year. Let us take the figures over the last five years in a country which has secured a rate of economic growth averaging 4¾ per cent over the last three years: 10,855 houses in 1965-66; 10,584, a slight fall, in 1966-67, the year of the last economic difficulties; 11,567 in 1967-68; 12,583 in 1968-69; and an estimated 13,000 in the present year, the expansion slowing down.</P>
    <P>That is not a very impressive growth rate in a country whose economic growth rate has been quite satisfactory over this three year period.  Another point which can be made on this housing record and one which is never sufficiently stressed even on this side of the House where we could properly and usefully stress it, is the total failure to develop the local authority or public housing drive.  What have the Government done even to achieve the totally inadequate growth in housing? It has encouraged, fairly effectively, speculative house building, but it has done so at the expense of public authority housing.  Let us have a look at what the inter-Party Government did in a few years in relation to local authority housing: it increased it <Col N="1509" /> elevenfold: 1947-48, 729; 1950-51, 7,787.  The figure fell after that and it fell throughout the period of the Fianna Fáil Government and, it must be said, too, throughout the period of the following inter-Party Government. In recent years it has recovered but to what?  To 4,500.</P>
    <P>In a country where we are 40 per cent better off than we were 20 years ago, we build 40 per cent fewer houses. The level of housing is no higher than 20 years ago, about 3,000 speculative-built houses and 3,000 fewer local authority houses.</P>
    <P>Therefore, in this country which is better off by 40 per cent we are squeezing the poor.  This is how we use our wealth, forcing them to buy houses they cannot afford.  All of us in this House know what pressure there is on people who cannot afford it to buy houses, what enormous efforts have been made by people living on small wages to save up sums like £500 and the burden of the repayments they have to carry because they have no hope of getting a house.  In Dublin a man has no hope of getting a house until he gets married.  If he has a child he has still no hope of getting a house unless he is &ldquo;lucky&rdquo; enough to live in a condemned house or a dangerous building.  In those circumstances a man with one child may get a house.  In the ordinary way, in my own area anyway, I have not yet succeeded in finding a case where somebody with one child has got a house.  I have to go back to these people and say: &ldquo;You are living with your in-laws, parents, six brothers and sisters, in a three-roomed flat.  Have a baby and then you will get a house.&rdquo;  It is a delicate thing to say to people at the best of times but it is humiliating to have to say that in a country like this to people living in those conditions.</P>
    <P>How can we justify, 20 years afterwards, building 40 per cent fewer houses when we are 40 per cent better off and when as a result of that neglect and that inhuman policy, people are forced to live in these conditions of overcrowding in which they can manage to have two children?  How they can manage to conceive a child, <Col N="1510" /> never mind having it and bringing it up in these conditions does not bear imagining, living in rooms of 800 cubic feet as I was in three nights ago, a double bed, no room on one side and just room to slip by a cupboard on the other side; to get in and out of the door was extremely difficult. The parents had one child in a pram and the other child was in hospital. I have a certificate here giving the reason:</P>
    <P>This is to certify that in my opinion this infant has suffered as a result of a very disturbed home situation. The baby's symptoms can be directly related to this.  In my opinion rehousing is absolutely essential and urgent here.</P>
    <P>There is also a certificate in relation to the mother and the condition of her mental health as a result of living in this room and in a position of conflict consequently with her in-laws.  The doctor says the baby will be kept in hospital until these people can be housed because he fears for the life of the baby if the baby remains in these conditions.  How can the Deputies opposite speak so complacently here&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>In what context would I not admit it?  I have never tried to distort the economic situation in that sense for the purpose of party propaganda.  What I indict this Government for is not the failure to achieve economic growth&mdash;even though inadequate to our needs; we still have 15,000 people emigrating&mdash;but the fact that, having achieved that by 1962-63, they totally failed to face up to the implications of that or to do anything about the social implications, and, as a result, opportunities for further growth that could have been created if adequate social provision had been made, have been lost.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>That is legitimate. The Deputy has his viewpoint and I look forward to hearing him on that subject.  Let me get back to the actual housing situation because we have now lots of facts and figures.  Up to recently much of the discussion had to be rather airy-fairy and justifiable allegations were made from this side of the House but we could not prove them.  We can prove them now.  We have got several documents.  We have got the Housing White Paper, <i>Housing in the 70s</i>, when the Government finally disclosed their hand and we have got the census of population, housing volume, 1966, which must be, although it is not, perhaps, easy for the layman to read, one of the most remarkable factual indictments of Government policy <Col N="1512" /> which has been produced in this country.</P>
      <P>Let us look at the White Paper and consider its assessment of our needs. The White Paper says that in 1967, I think in the second quarter, the local authorities assessed the number of unfit houses in this country at 35,000 or 5 per cent of the total.  The White Paper suggests this is too low and points out that 24 per cent of our houses are over a century old, 160,000, that 58 per cent of them are over 50 years old, 392,000.  It also points out that this figure of 35,000 is not high in relation to other countries.  In other words, on international comparisons it is clearly too low.</P>
      <P>Despite this the White Paper, having appeared to come clean on this point, then reverse engines and accepts the figure of 35,000 on the grounds that 133,000 houses have been reconstructed. No reason is given for this; no calculation is shown which would lead one to conclude from the reconstruction figure of 133,000 that, in fact, the position is as good as the local authority figures suggest.  I think the White Paper was right in saying that the local authority's assessment is too low.  I think they were right in referring to the age of houses and right in making international comparisons.  I do not think they were right in dismissing their own evidence, which they had I must say very honestly produced, on the grounds of the number of houses reconstructed. Perhaps, I am wrong in saying that but as they do not give any reasons for it it is very hard for me to accept their argument.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They then deal with multiple households. At the time the White Paper was published the Government had the census; we had not.  Those who prepared the White Paper selected certain figures.  I do not mean they were selective in the sense that they suppressed something but there are certainly many other figures which they did not publish and which I will come to later which I think are highly significant.  They told us correctly that in the 1966 census 24,600 households had more than one family in them. What they did not say&mdash;I am not suggesting they were called on to say it, but it is an interesting point to mention <Col N="1513" /> at this stage&mdash;is that this was an increase of 2,400 or 11 per cent on the figure for 1961.  They did not comment on the fact that the housing backlog had so increased that those families doubled up had risen in number by 11 per cent.  However, I will come back to that again.</P>
    <P>The White Paper arbitrarily estimates on the basis of the social groups to which those households belong and the areas in which they live that the effective need for dwellings for them, the double households, may be about 10,000&mdash;15,000 of those 25,000 families who doubled up, whose numbers increased by 11 per cent or 2,400 in the previous five years for the lack of housing in this country, are just wiped out by a stroke of the pen.  I should like a little more of the reasoning on this. I should like the Minister in reply to tell us how the 15,000 were wiped out. I should like him to tell us on what basis of social groups or areas the of social groups or areas the people who are living in 15,000 families doubled up together were simply decided to be all right, happy the way they were, no need to do anything about them and the 25,000 figure reduced to 10,000.  Nothing that I know of housing here in rural or urban Ireland suggests that such a reduction in the figure of doubled up families is justified in arriving at housing needs.</P>
    <P>On overcrowding the White Paper says that on the criterion of two or more per room there are 59,500 overcrowded.  They say, I am sure rightly, that 4,000 of those are multiple families.  They have been counted already, not only counted but discounted, mark you from 25,000 to 10,000, so they reduce it to 55,500.  It is an interesting point arithmetically that had the two calculations been done the other way round this would not have happened.  If they had taken the overcrowding first and then dealt with the multiple households those 4,000 would not have been put in and then reduced by 60 per cent so even the order in which the calculations are made here affects the result.  Anyway this figure is put at 55,500 people in families two or more per room other than multiple families.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1514" /> Mark you, the White Paper also does not say&mdash;perhaps there is no need for it to say it but again it is an interesting addendum&mdash;that the consensus of population shows that the decline in the number of people two or more per room which had gone on throughout the life of this State and which had led to a reduction in the proportion of families in this condition from 37 per cent in 1946 to 17.8 per cent in 1961 had been halted.  They do not mention the fact that this improvement in our housing conditions, the gradual elimination of families living in conditions of two or more per room which was such a feature of housing throughout the history of the State and particularly in the period 1946 to 1951, stopped from 1961 onwards and there was virtually no reduction in this figure.  When one makes an adjustment for the people in respect of whom no information is available it looks as if that percentage fell from 17.8 to 17.05 only in 1966.  The improvement in overcrowding, a feature of the previous 15 years was reduced by three-quarters per cent in the 1961 to 1966 period.  That is not mentioned in the White Paper but it is relative to the figures which the White Paper gives.</P>
    <P>However, having arrived at 55,000 families overcrowded two or more per room other than multiple families the White Paper makes the remarkable statement, although if one thinks about it one can make some sense out of it, that the overcrowding is caused by large families rather than small dwellings.  One might think at this point that the White Paper would go on to advocate the introduction of the pill but it does not actually take that turn.  What it says instead is that 40,000 of those 55,500 overcrowded dwellings can be dealt with not by rehousing the families but by enlarging the houses.  It does not say how it arrived at 40,000 houses to be enlarged; it does not say on what basis it decides that 40,000 can be enlarged.</P>
    <P>Anybody who knows the kind of conditions in which people are living, the high proportion in Dublin, for example, who live in flats which are not readily capable of enlargement and the number who live in little houses <Col N="1515" /> where there is no room to enlarge the house backwards or forwards, upwards or any other way, could hardly think that, of the 55,500 overcrowded families, you could cope with 40,000 of them by enlarging their houses.  I would have thought those overcrowded families are so much concentrated in Dublin, and so many of them are in flats alone that it is inconceivable that, between flats and the houses which could not be enlarged even if one could provide the money, it would be possible to enlarge 40,000 of them.</P>
    <P>In any event, having decided that this problem of 40,000 overcrowded families can be met by enlarging houses the White Paper marches on, but it never comes back to the question of how you enlarge the houses and where the money is to come from.  There is no plan for enlarging them; there is no money provided for enlarging them. The enlargement programme is simply something that is introduced as a happy way of getting rid of 40,000 overcrowded houses, so you do not have to rehouse them.  To my mind, if you are going to say that the problem is large families rather than small dwellings whatever that means in this context, you will have to do something about enlarging the houses.  The White Paper is totally defective in this.  By this happy knack of defining the problem in terms of large families rather than small dwellings and enlarging those dwellings, whether they be in blocks of flats or in little rows of houses back to back, the White Paper gets rid of the 40,000 of its problem and says there are therefore only 15,000 families who have to be re-housed. It arrives at the figure of 15,000.  On this basis it says that there are 15,000 families in dwellings of not more than four rooms, which on the basis of their occupancy rate could be regarded as severely overcrowded.</P>
    <P>Overcrowding is defined as two or more persons per room.  Suddenly, by waving a magician's wand, the problem is resolved by introducing a new unspecified criterion of sever overcrowding. What is severe overcrowding?  I have tried to find out.  I do not think I can find out.  The White Paper has <Col N="1516" /> accepted two or more persons per room as an indication of overcrowding. It has arrived at 59,000 on that basis.  Suddenly the criterion is changed.  It seems to mean now something like almost three persons per room is the criterion.  There were, in fact, in 1966 11,000 families living in four or less rooms, three or more persons per room, which is close enough to 15,000.  There is a definition of severe overcrowding somewhere in the Department of Local Government but they do not produce it here.  It is something like 2¾ people per room. By a sleight of hand, when it is found that two or more persons per room produces too many overcrowded families, they change the rules of the game. Hey presto, 4,000 people are all right. They will be dealt with by enlarging the houses instead.  They do not have to provide money or planning for this. Presumably the people will do it themselves in their spare time.  With the new criterion of 2¾ persons per room the figure is cut down to 15,000.  There were various ways of solving the housing problem.  Statistically, this is ingenious but it does not provide much comfort to the people living in the houses.</P>
    <P>We have now reduced the figure of 25,000 multiple households to 10,000 and the 55,500 overcrowded families have been reduced to 15,000.  When one includes the unfit dwellings a figure of 59,000 is arrived at.  That is the number of people needing rehousing. I am dubious about all this.  I would have thought that of the 25,000 multiple households 15,000 are likely to need rehousing.  This is not an excessive figure.  It may be low.  Making a rational adjustment of the other figures it will be found that instead of 59,500 houses the true requirement, so far as I can make it, is perhaps 105,000 to 110,000.  Taking each of these figures and re-working it on a more rational basis I would conclude that the figure is probably 105,000 to 110,000.  This is a matter for argument. I would not be dogmatic about it.  I have shown fairly conclusively that 59,500 is a fake figure.  I do not mean it has been consciously faked but people faced with what seems an impossible problem of rehousing must <Col N="1517" /> tend to take an optimistic view, the most sanguine view they can, and try to arrive at a figure which there is a hope of meeting sometime on the basis of the resources they are prepared to allocate.</P>
    <P>That is where the difficulty and the weakness lies.  Accepting the Government figure of 59,500 as against a true figure of probably 110,000, what are the Government going to do about it? Let us consider the housing plan.  Let us see how rapidly this backlog is to be dealt with.  Let us accept 59,500 even though it is an underestimate.  The White Paper says it estimates that 6,000 houses will become unfit each year.  The number of houses needing replacement each year is about 6,000. The local authority figure was 4,250. The White Paper says that should be higher.  In the 1964 White Paper the figure is 7,000.  This has been reduced to 6,000 on the grounds that the gross loss of houses between 1961 and 1966 was only 6,000 a year.  That is a bit naïve.  That looks back to a period during which the failure to build houses led to an intensification of overcrowding and to an increase in Dublin of 35 per cent in the number of families doubling up together.  They say that the number of houses which became unfit or were abandoned was only 6,000 in that period.  People had to go on living in the houses because houses were not built.  The Government make a reduction in the figure to 6,000 a year because they made it impossible for people to abandon these unfit houses. There was nowhere else for the people to go.  The Government have used this as the basis for planning for the future. This is the kind of planning done in the Department of Local Government. The 1964 figure of 1 per cent which is in line with international practice &mdash;it was based on international practice at that time&mdash;is the figure which should be used.  The reduction to 6,000 should be rejected.</P>
    <P>What about the new households? The local authorities gave a figure of 6,250 new huseholds per annum.  The argument is that the number of married couples increased by an average of 4,400 annually between 1961 and 1966.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1518" /> This is likely to rise to 5,000 a year in the current five year period and maybe to 7,000 a year in the mid-seventies. It is said that the projections support this estimate.  This calculation is not explained at all.  The increase in the number of married couples is not explained.  It is not clear what the figures are based on.  No calculation is given.  Between 1961 and 1966 there were 14,900 marriages a year on an average.  We are told that when there were 14,900 marriages a year the number of married couples went up by 4,400.  The other 10,500 represented wastage of couples falling out of the population through death.  In 1969 the marriages were 20,000.  We have not the complete figures yet but the figures up to the end of September last indicate that 20,000 people were married in Ireland last year.  This rate has been rising by 1,000 each year for the past three years.  For 1970 the figure will be 21,000.  It will continue rising, probably to 23,000 or 24,000 marriages a year by the mid-seventies.</P>
    <P>There is no reason to expect that the deaths of married couples will go up or that married couples will emigrate in large numbers.  The wastage figure for 1961/66 of 10,500 couples disappearing each year is one which is going to continue. It seems clear that if in that period there were 14,900 people marrying and a wastage rate of 10,500 there were 4,400 people requiring houses.  It seems clear that in 1970 with 21,000 marriages and 10,500 wastage there will be need for 10,500 new houses because the number of married couples in the country in the course of 1970 will increase by 10,500.  I cannot understand how the Department of Local Government arrived at a figure of 5,000 of an increase.  The increase in the number of married couples is now running at the rate of 10,000 a year, not 5,000.</P>
    <P>One can accept a certain element of error, of optimism and of underestimation in Government estimates of this kind but I cannot accept a marginal error of 100 per cent.  Perhaps I have missed something.  Perhaps there is some abstruse point in this calculation that I have failed to grasp.  Perhaps the Government have some reason to <Col N="1519" /> believe that the wastage rate of married couples is rising rapidly, that they are dying or emigrating.  There may be something in the demographic picture that I have not understood, but we require an explanation here.  I do not think the Government can throw out figures like this in a period when the number of marriages per annum has increased from under 15,000&mdash;the average for the 1961-66 period&mdash;to 20,000 last year and certainly 21,000 this year.  When you have had a 6,000 increase in the number of marriages between the 1961-66 period and the year 1970 I do not think you can say this means that the annual rate of increase in married couples will be up by 600.  It will not; it will be up by 6,000 in that period.  I think there is a basic miscalculation there which fundamentally affects the whole housing situation.</P>
    <P>The White Paper suffers throughout from this defect.  It is written as if for children.  It is clear and simple, but it does not explain anything.  It makes statements of this kind with no justification. There are no calculations.  There are appendices but they are not relevant to the calculations.  It is the kind of document that was all very well in this country in the 1940s or 1950s, perhaps, but the science of statistics and methods of quantification have changed a good deal since then and it is not good enough to trot out these figures with no explanation and tell us that within a period when the number of marriages has gone up by 6,000 each year the increase in married couples has risen by only 600 and give no reason for it. If there is a reason we should be told. The basis of the White Paper is unconvincing.</P>
    <P>What housing do we need now? It seems to me that, taking the year 1969, for replacement of houses we need 7,000, not 6,000; for the increase in the number of married couples in 1969&mdash;looking backwards now and not forwards&mdash;we need 9,500.  We need 16,500 houses for new households.  The Government make an allowance then of 1,000 for migrants.  It says there is no way of knowing what the figure is and throws in an estimate.  I have <Col N="1520" /> no way of knowing either and I accept the estimate.  So I add on 1,000 for the migrants and that makes 17,500 houses needed in 1969 just to keep up with current demand, not to solve any backlog.</P>
    <P>One must deduct something for houses that are repaired, unfit houses brought back into repair.  The Government allow 1,000 for that and, rather oddly, also allow 2,000 for dwellings falling out of use and not needing to be replaced.  The only way a dwelling falls out of use and does not need to be replaced is if somebody dies or emigrates.  I cannot quite reconcile this figure with the 1,000 for migrants. However, the Government make an allowance of 3,000 for houses that are repaired and houses that do not need to be repaired in some parts of the country because of migration.  It seems to me that if 1,000 extra houses are needed for migrants then they can only be emptying 1,000 houses in other parts of the country, not 2,000.  But I accept the figure 3,000 and I am prepared to say that another 17,500 houses are needed and that you can knock off 3,000 for houses that are repaired and for dwellings falling out of use and not needing to be replaced.</P>
    <P>That brings us down to 14,500 houses needed in 1969 for the increased demand in that year.  How many were built?  Including conversions, 13,500. That figure assumes that the cement strike does not disrupt house building. I am using financial year figures for house building because these are the figures the Government use and I am assuming that house building continues. If it does in 1969-70, when, accepting the Government's estimates as regards houses repaired and falling out of use, we would need 14,500 houses to keep up with the increase in demand, we will have built 13,500.  The Government's contribution to getting rid of this backlog of 59,500 houses as is estimated&mdash;over 100,000, as I estimate it&mdash;was minus 1,000 in 1969.</P>
    <P>What they have done with a totally inadequate housing drive is to add to the backlog, as they have added to it in every year throughout the 1960s.  If we did this kind of calculation back <Col N="1521" /> to any of these years I am certain from going over the figures carefully that in every year of the 1960s, with the possible exceptions of 1966-67 or 1967-68, the backlog has grown and, apart from anything being done to reduce this backlog which has been built up by the neglect of the Government, all that has happened is that it has been increased annually so that on their estimate we now have 60,000 needed for the backlog as well as what is needed each year to cope with the greater demand.  What are we getting for that backlog?  Minus 1,000.</P>
    <P>What conclusions can one reach from the White Paper which, by the way, claims that only 9,000 houses are needed for replacement, that there is a surplus and that therefore they are reducing the backlog by 4,000 at the present time?  I think I have shown how inaccurate that is&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>

    </P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The White Paper suggests that only 9,000 of the houses being built are needed to cope with the current demand and that there is a surplus, therefore, of 4,000 a year and that the backlog of 59,500 is being reduced by 4,000 a year.  I think I have shown fairly objectively and without exaggeration that in fact this is not the case.  This case rests first on writing down the 7,000 a year figure in the 1964 White Paper for houses becoming unfit to 6,000 and totally miscalculating the effect of the increased marriage rate.  It seems that in this White Paper no real account was taken of the increased marriage rate which has pushed up the marriage rate from less than 15,000 a year in the 1961-66 period to 20,000 this year and certainly 21,000 next year.  Because of this miscalculation, instead of the present rate of building of 13,000 houses plus 500 conversions yielding a surplus of 4,000 houses or so to reduce this backlog it is not meeting the current demand and the backlog is growing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is the Government's claim? Based on a combination of these spurious calculations&mdash;the calculation that <Col N="1522" /> the backlog is only 59,500 when it is actually over 100,000 and that the number of houses needed to cope with each year's current demand is only 9,000 when it is, in fact, 14,500&mdash;the Government arrive at the magnificent conclusion that, if they keep going as they are, they will deal with the housing backlog in ten or 15 years.  That is the phrase in the White Paper, which holds out very little hope for people without houses in Dublin.  It is based on two spurious calculations, a gross underestimation of the backlog and a complete failure to grasp the rate at which the increased demand is growing, to grasp the fact that the current house building rate is not even meeting the present demand not to mind eating into the backlog.  It fails to grasp the fact that the backlog is increasing as time goes on and is not being reduced. Even on that basis, taking something like 40 per cent off the true backlog figure and knocking another 14 per cent or so off the rate at which the housing demand is growing each year, the most the Government can offer is that they will clear the backlog in ten or 15 years.</P>
    <P>I do not know how they had the effrontery to come to the House with a White Paper which they had faked only to that extent.  If they were going to fake the White Paper the least they could have done was to do it decently and offer some kind of prospect that at sometime in the lifetime of this Government or the next the problem might be solved.  Mark you, there is a very interesting footnote to offer reassurance to these people.  I hope it is being read in the blocks of flats in Pearse Street and Ringsend.  It says: &ldquo;This does not imply that people living in unfit or overcrowded housing would have to wait ten or 15 years for rehousing. Both local authority housing and a significant proportion of private building result directly or indirectly in eliminating the most urgent type of housing need.&rdquo;  We are not told how long they will have to wait but we are told they should not think they will have to wait 15 years, maybe somehow they will get their houses before then. That is the most Fianna Fáil can offer the people of this country, the people <Col N="1523" /> of Dublin and at this moment particularly, the people of South West Dublin.</P>
    <P>Let us look at what has happened in the last few years, at the actual record of increased overcrowding, increased numbers of multiple families crowded in together, actual figures from the census of population.  I challenge anyone on the Government benches to refute any fact or figure I put forward or suggest that they are selective or do not represent the true picture.  I have already pointed out that in the period 1961 to 1966 in the country as a whole the number of multiple family households, those houses or dwellings where families are jammed in on top of each other, increased by 2,400 or eleven per cent.  In Dublin, where the great bulk of this occurred, the number of such households increased by 35 per cent.  This is a measure of the incredible neglect of housing in Dublin, of the total failure of this Government in that five-year period to do anything to meet the demand.</P>
    <P>As I pointed out at Question Time recently, this five-year period began four years after Fianna Fáil came into office so these jibes and jeers about what the Coalition did are irrelevant. I have already showed that in three years the first Coalition increased the number of houses built from 1,600 to 12,300 so I do not think it is fair to claim that the position in 1957 had any relevance to what happened in 1961.  The whole blame for the housing neglect from 1961 onwards must fall on this Government, no residual consequences of anything that happened under any previous Government had any relevance to it.  By 1961 this Government, had they put their minds to it and really been concerned with the problem, could have got house building up, as the first Coalition Government did, to a figure of 12,000 or 13,000.  In fact, they did not bother to do anything of the kind and the actual level of housing at that time was only a fraction of that figure.</P>
    <P>In 1961, after four years of Fianna Fáil Government, the number of houses built was the second lowest since the <Col N="1524" /> war, 5,626.  How many local authority houses?  It is a record, a record at the bottom, the lowest figure since the end of the war, 1,238.  That was after four years of Fianna Fáil Government, four years during which the alibi of the Coalition was often trotted out in this House.  Because they allowed the local authority house building to fall from 3,500 to 1,238 in those four years, because they failed to do anything about housing as a whole, because the total number of houses built was only 5,626 in 1961 and because in the years following that they failed to make any great impact on the problem and housing rose hardly at all&mdash; because of that during this five years of Fianna Fáil rule, starting four years after they came into office, overcrowding in Dublin increased drastically and the census figures show that the number of families in this condition increased by 35 per cent.  The number of families doubled up together rose from 4,000 to 6,650.  That was in the middle of a period of Fianna Fáil Government.  It is no good talking about 22 houses being built in one ward and 24 in another, as Deputy Dowling did recently.  That has no relevance.  Of course houses have been built, but how many and how adequate? The adequacy can only be decided by looking at the census figures and seeing how many people were forced to move in with their in-laws, how many people had to double up together, how many families had to live in a ratio of two or three to a room.  These are the hard facts and figures behind the housing problem in Dublin about which we hear nothing but complacency from the other side of the House.</P>
    <P>Let us look at the number of large households.  Large households are a consequence of inadequate housing where families must double up. Between 1961 and 1966 the number of households of 12 or more people went up by 31½ per cent.  One may say that means nothing, but let us go back. In the period 1926 to 1946 the number of households of 12 or more living together dropped by 9 per cent.  Between 1946 and 1961 the number rose slightly by 3 per cent.  In the next five years the position is totally reversed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1525" /> The number of families of 12 or more living in one house increased by 31½ per cent in the country as a whole.  Let us look at the families of eleven.  In every previous intercensal period the number fell, but in this period it rose by 12 per cent because of the overcrowding. Between 1961 and 1966, if one takes every size of household from five upwards, the number increased.  All these had fallen between 1946 and 1961 and there was a trend towards smaller households as people moved out from in-laws and were provided with houses of their own.  When Fianna Fáil got into office that trend was reversed for the first time in the history of this country since the war.  That is the fact of Fianna Fáil housing policy.  The result of this is that, for the first time, the average family size went up&mdash;not because people were having more children but because families were forced to live together.  Between 1946 and 1961 the number of people living two or more to a room dropped.  This is the number of people used in the Minister's White Paper as a crude criterion of overcrowding.</P>
    <P>The proportion of people living in these overcrowded conditions between 1946 and 1961 dropped from 37 per cent to 17.8 per cent.  However, this decline as the housing problem was being resolved during this period by whatever Government was in office&mdash;and both contributed to it in different ways &mdash;came to a virtual halt and between 1961 and 1966 the proportion of people in overcrowded conditions dropped from 17.8 to 17.05 per cent, which is scarcely a drop at all.</P>
    <P>What about the cases of three persons per room, the severely overcrowded, even by the Government's own criterion?  In 1946 there were 15.2 per cent families living in these conditions. As a result of the housing efforts of the various Governments, most of all the first inter-Party Government, this proportion was reduced to a tiny fraction by 1961&mdash;3.6 per cent.  One would have thought it would be easy for a Government in the following five years of rapid economic growth to get rid of this last 3.6 per cent but that did not happen.  The process of reduction in the proportion of severe overcrowding <Col N="1526" /> stopped and, by my figures, adjusting for the cases where information is not available, the percentage fell from 3.6 to 3.45 per cent, which is no reduction. The whole process of getting rid of overcrowding which had gone on throughout the 1946-1961 period came to a halt after 1961 under Fianna Fáil. We have had no further improvement and there has been an increase of 35 per cent in Dublin in the number of families doubled up together.  That is the result of five years of Fianna Fáil housing policy.</P>
    <P>In Dublin, the number of families living three or more per room increased by 3,200 or 10 per cent.  In the rest of the country the number declined, but in the Dublin area where houses are most needed and to which the Minister should devote his attention, the number of severely overcrowded families increased enormously.  This problem, which had been virtually wiped out by previous Governments, suddenly reared its head again and grew and expanded in Dublin.  Let us look at some of the areas without naming them&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Let the Minister hear me and make his comments later. Two-thirds of the areas in Dublin in which overcrowding was already severe in 1961&mdash;that is, areas in which 20 per cent or more of the people were living two or more per room&mdash; experienced a worsening of overcrowding with a greater proportion of people living in these conditions in 1961 to 1966.  What an incredible record for any Government in a period of economic growth, when the wealth of the country rose to a level never previously attained.  Whatever Fianna Fáil did with the increased wealth, they certainly did nothing about housing.  They were prepared to let people rot in increased overcrowding in our capital city.  In two wards more than half the families were, according to the census, living in overcrowded conditions and, indeed, more than a quarter of the families in these two wards were living in conditions of three or four per room.  In 1966 several hundred families were living in conditions <Col N="1527" /> of six or more per room after those five years of Fianna Fáil housing and there were even eight cases&mdash;there were only two in 1961&mdash;with 11 or more people per room.</P>
      <P>Those are the statistics; that is the indictment.  I am sorry the Minister was not here for the whole of my speech; he only heard the tail-end of it.  Behind those statistics&mdash;and we must remind ourselves of this&mdash;lie the appalling human problems involved. Problems like the case in part of my constituency where during the election campaign I called on a house and I was ashamed to have to ask for a vote. In that house there were the parents and five children: they had two rooms, one upstairs and one downstairs.  In January, 1969, part of the ceiling caved in and they had to move to the other room&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Let us stick to the human problem and keep politics out of it.  The walls of the house I have <Col N="1528" /> been referring to, in the month of June, were rotten with damp.  The family picked up the linoleum to show me and there was a pool of water underneath. There were two single beds on this floor which were literally floating.  The family lived for five months in that room: some of the children were farmed out to neighbours who looked after them but the parents and two children slept in that room.  Some time later the family moved upstairs and for months they slept in the room where the ceiling had collapsed.  I asked an official of the dangerous buildings section to come and see it but they said it was not dangerous.  The wind and rain came in but it was not dangerous because, if the ceiling did fall on them, it was so light it would not hurt them.  Therefore, it was all right that they should continue living there as they did not rate any priority under the Dangerous Buildings Act.  I pressed the case for these people. They cannot move to another area because this man is on shift work and one week in every three he must be at work at 4.30 a.m. and one week in every three he leaves work at 4.30 a.m. The family cannot move out to Ballymun, Coolock or Inchicore.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the point. They were given an offer of accommodation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I realise that in the area in which these people live there has not been any housebuilding in the past few years.  As a result of the Minister's decision in relation to housing in the City Quay area and his neglect to provide the funds necessary, there has not been any housing.  It is only rarely that a house becomes vacant in this part of Dublin.  In fact, it is so rare that I am bothered only every couple of months by somebody ringing me up to say there is a house vacant.  However, it is remarkable that, when a house does become vacant, there are other people apparently so much worse off that this family remains at the bottom of the queue and 14 months afterwards they are still without a house.  I rang the corporation again recently to press the point that surely some houses must have <Col N="1529" /> turned up in this period and not many people could be so much worse off that they would get priority over this family, but it appears that in this area there are other families whose conditions are so much worse that the relatively few houses that turn up must go to them.  Apparently this family is so well-off compared with the rest that they are left without accommodation&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Without knowing the name of the people concerned, I can tell the Deputy they got many an offer of accommodation and did not accept it and the Deputy knows that also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>In this period of 14 months they have not had an offer of accommodation anywhere within or near this area.  Would the Minister explain how this man is to get in by public transport from an area such as Ballymun or Coolock to get to work every day?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, others who can afford cars like the Minister can, even if they do not have a chauffeur to drive them, but the people I refer to are not living in such conditions. I doubt if they can afford a bicycle, much less a car. They have lived in these conditions for 14 months.  The house is perfectly clean because they keep it in an extraordinarily good condition, apart from the ceiling which falls in but which they continue to sweep up. However, the smell of damp walls and of water lying under the linoleum is something that remains with one for a long time after leaving.  Nothing has been done to provide adequate housing in this area.  This case is not rated as a priority because, apparently, there are some people worse off.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also know of a case of a woman who was deserted by her husband 13 years ago and who had two children. Dut to various misunderstandings, she was on the waiting list for 13 years. Each time she was told by the corporation to put her name down for a house in a particular area she was <Col N="1530" /> later told to change it to another area: she always had her name down for the wrong area.  This was nobody's fault but happened because she was enmeshed in the system.  Eventually somewhere nearby was found for her. The whole system is so bureaucratic, the problem is so immense and the pressure on those trying to deal with human problem of this kind is so great that, even when houses are available, those people who appear to be entitled to them do not always get them.</P>
    <P>This cannot be justified.  As an economist, I know that money does not grow on trees.  I know it is no good saying that we build more houses and not face the financial consequences.  The Government's priorities are entirely wrong.  Even if there was no human sympathy on the other side of the House, which there is because almost all Deputies have to face these problems, I would have thought that sheer political calculation would have suggested that something drastic should have been done to deal with the housing problem during the past ten years.  I have already indicated how far we are from reducing the backlog &mdash;it is still increasing by about 1,000 a year so that it may now be in the order of 100,000 houses&mdash;as well as coping with the current demand.</P>
    <P>Surely it must be possible for people on the other side of the House to face this problem?  How can they ignore it? I know that the Government must balance different commitments.  I know how painful it must be to have to say &ldquo;no&rdquo; to some socially desirable or necessary project because some other social project takes priority or because investment is needed for some industry to provide economic growth out of which social benefits can come.  I am aware of the difficulties, but I am simply saying that other social needs, great and dreadful though they may be, can get priority over housing.  I do not know how the Government's decision in this regard can be justified.  I know that misallocations can be justified because judgment is needed in these matters, but in regard to the housing problem, which causes so much human misery, surely a higher priority would be justified?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1531" /> I have here some figures published by OECD which I have not yet looked at but from which I shall pick a few at random to see how we compare with other European countries with regard to dwellings completed per 1,000 inhabitants.  For the year 1968 the figure for Ireland was four per 1,000 inhabitants.  There is no other country in that category.  Portugal with a standard of living very much lower than ours, had a figure of 5.7; Spain, whose standard of living is much lower than ours, had a figure of 7.6, nearly double our figure; Italy, where the standard of living is slightly higher than ours, had a figure of 6.3; Turkey, where the standard of living is only a fraction of ours, had a figure of 4.7; Austria, where the standard of living is perhaps a quarter higher than ours, had a figure of seven.</P>
    <P>How can anybody looking at these figures fail to see that this country gives the lowest priority to housing of any country in Europe?  There is no necessity to say that the explanation is because so many people emigrate. Emigration is irrelevant in this matter. For the past ten years the population has been increasing.  All credit to the Government for that, but no credit to them for failing to make available houses for the people for whom jobs have been provided in that period.</P>
    <P>How can the members of the party opposite defend such a policy?  I am appealing to them in the hope that some of them at a private party meeting will put pressure on the Minister in this regard.  We are building per head of the population only half the number of houses that are being built in Northern Ireland and we see what is happening there.  They regard the number of houses being built as grossly inadequate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>We do not burn them down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a community which is so similar to ours in social composition&mdash;for example, in family size and so on&mdash;and they regard the number of houses being built as totally inadequate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we look again at the figures for Europe we will see that Sweden, <Col N="1532" /> where a standard of living two and a half times ours is enjoyed, have a figure of 12.7 per cent per thousand of the population.  The priority given for any of these countries is much higher than ours.  Here we have a situation of continued neglect, a situation in which there is overcrowding and doubling-up of families, as the census figures show.  The spurious figures of the White Paper, when examined very carefully, show that it will be necessary to build almost 100,000 houses to catch up with the backlog.</P>
    <P>Surely those Deputies who, like myself, call on these families must find 11 or 12 people of mixed sexes and mixed family relationships sleeping in a flat of three rooms, including the livingroom.  City Deputies, in particular, must be aware of these problems and, as I said, I do not know how they can stand up here and defend Government policy on housing.  Let them be decently silent here if they wish, but let them speak up at the party meetings.</P>
    <P>If Fianna Fáil are to have any shred of reputation as regards concern for our people they will have to produce another White Paper, a White Paper drastically increasing the number of houses to be built and drastically changing the whole approach to housing.  I hope this will happen.  It would, no doubt, be politically preferable for this party if the Government were to go on neglecting that kind of situation, the situation that is building up now in Dublin, with all its consequential distress.  No doubt it would help us and the Labour Party to win a few seats but I would prefer to do without those seats if the Government really got to grips with the situation and I would prefer to give the Government a bit of credit for solving the problem. That is why I am addressing myself to the Deputies opposite; they may defend the Government's policy here but let us hope that when they go into the party rooms they will say what they think. They cannot defend the indefensible. They cannot honestly face their own constituents in those areas in which overcrowding is so much worse than it was five years ago.</P>
    <P>Something must be done about housing.  Of course there is agitation <Col N="1533" /> about housing, agitation to which people have attached themselves for political reasons.  Do not let the Government dismiss this as entirely spurious.  The reason why agitators have attached themselves to housing as an issue is because they know where agitation pays.  They have an instinct for it.  They know the area of sensitivity. They know that if they pick on this, since the Government is doing nothing about it, and if they can arouse people on a real issue they can get sympathy from people other than those of their own political persuasion because all classes are concerned about this.  The agitators know this is a good issue.  Let us beware of giving opportunities for this kind of agitation to develop.  But, when we see it, let us not reject it and say that these people are spurious and are agitating for political motives.  The fact that they are doing it for political motives is the real test.  That is why they pick on housing.  It is right we should concern ourselves with a problem which, if further neglected, could well breed that agitation which could be damaging to the country for years ahead.</P>
    <P>That is all I have to say on the subject.  I apologise for having thrown so many figures at the House, but they are necessary.  They need to be put across.  They need to be seen and understood. They are the facts.  I do not think I have too much to apologise for. Human statistics and statistics of human misery represent an aggregation of human misery and a reality.  I do not think there is too much I need apologise for and, even if there are more than people can take in, they are on the record for people to read.  I hope they will read them and will draw from them the conclusion I have drawn.  As a result of this debate and other debates here I hope the Government will become alert and give housing the priority it deserves and I hope that, in setting their social priorities, they will not neglect the solution of this problem.</P>
    <P>There are other aspects one could criticise, aspects in which the Government may not be so sensitive as in this.  Let us hope this debate will contribute in some way to the alleviation at least of this problem.  We are sent here by our constituents not just to <Col N="1534" /> complain about particular problems in local areas but to represent their real interests and try to effect the changes needed for their benefit.  If a particular debate and opposition proves fruitless, if, no matter what facts and figures one puts forward, or arguments one adduces, nothing is done, then you create a frustration in the parliamentary system, a frustration which is dangerous.  Debates should produce some results.  Very often a debate does.  I think it is not appreciated outside this House that debates do produce results.  The Government may, when faced with criticism, try to pretend that the criticism is not true and may argue against it.  This does not mean that the criticism has no force. After a decent interval the Government do adjust their policy and it is my hope in this instance, where adjustment has been so belated, that this debate will lead to some adjustment.</P>
    <P>One other matter in relation to priority.  I have raised this by way of questions.  Because of the priority system in Dublin Corporation a family of four living in one room may find itself not eligible for rehousing while a family of three living in three rooms, with a greater total space, may find it is eligible for housing because of overcrowded conditions.  I was not impressed by the Minister's reaction when I raised this matter; he threw across the floor of the House the remark that it was a Fine Gael or a Labour Corporation which introduced the regulation. I do not give a damn who introduced it.  I am sick of this business that some party was responsible for some inhumanity or other in the system.  It does not matter who is responsible.  That is not relevant.  What we are concerned with is putting the matter right.  When reading through the debates one finds time wasted on these fruitless allegations across the floor as to who is responsible for what, usually irrelevant, usually wrong factually, particularly when there is such a time lag between decisions and their implementation.  That sort of thing does not reflect much credit on the House.  It is much more important that the Minister should address himself to solving the problem rather than trying to make political capital out of <Col N="1535" /> it.  I thought the matter needed to be raised and I asked the Minister to look into it.  I think the Minister will look into it.</P>
    <P>I raised another problem to which I think he should address himself.  I refer to the priority that attaches not to total overcrowding but to the number in the family to be rehoused. I recognise that this is in some way connected with discouraging subtenants, but it does not make sense to me and whatever thinking there was behind it originally is no longer relevant.  It is only confusing the situation.  There is something absurd in the fact that a family of four and a widowed mother living in a four-roomed flat with three bedrooms is entitled to rehousing in advance of a family of three, parents and one child, living with parents and seven brothers and sisters in a two- or three-roomed flat.  How can one explain the situation to people?  They tell you that so-and-so got a house and there are only five in a four-roomed flat.  What possible defence can we put up when faced with that kind of thing?  I appeal to the Minister to look at this regulation to see how it can be changed.  It is bad enough not having houses but, whatever houses we have, let us at least give them to those who need them and re-allocate them in some better way than we do at the moment.  I would ask the Minister to see if he can make any change in that.  These are practical and real problems which can be dealt with by the stroke of a pen.  It will not mean that any extra houses will be built but, if we make better use of the houses there are, we can at least reduce the quantum of human misery. It will not cost anything in the capital programme.  Let us do that much pending something being done about the capital programme.</P>
    <P>Finally, I was shocked to read what the Minister said in his opening speech on this debate: he said the money that would be provided in the capital programme would not be sufficient to meet the increase in the price of houses.  The arithmetical consequence of that, as I have tried to point out at Question Time, is that the total volume of house building&mdash;not the number <Col N="1536" /> built&mdash;will be reduced if prices rise by 8 per cent and the capital programme by 6 per cent.  In that kind of relationship the total volume will fall by 2 per cent.</P>
    <P>That is an undeniable fact.  The Minister has announced in this House, in this situation we now face, that he is going to cut the house building programme. Now, he is trying to do something about this.  Faced with a shortage of capital, I give him credit for the fact that he is trying to minimise the human hardship caused and so he is reducing the size of houses for grant purposes so that out of this smaller volume of house building we can at least get the same number of houses.  I think that is probably the right answer to a wrong situation that should not be allowed to arise.  I say that because I do not like it as an answer.  I am conscious of the fact that all our house building and flat building here seems to be based on the assumption that Irish families are the same size as English.  Nobody seems to have yet woken up to the fact that we have twice as many children as the English do and that, in fact, to build houses which are two bedroom or three bedroom as maximum is quite inadequate for the kind of families that sometimes exist.  I am not saying that all our houses should be bigger, only that some of them should be and that when you do get large families of 15 in a house&mdash;somebody came across 16 in a house in Ballyfermot the night before last&mdash;clearly we need some houses built bigger, and I think the Minister in making this change in the size of houses, given that if he is not going to provide the money, this is the best way out of it, he ought to consider building into this some provision that certain larger houses are built by the corporation to accommodate larger families even if for the grant size private speculative house he is reducing the size.</P>
    <P>I want to come back to this question of reducing the amount of money available. Is it not an astonishing thing that the first word we have of next year's capital programme, the first word of what it will contain, is a reduction in housing?</P>

      <P>The depth of the Deputy's care for the housing situation can be seen from the nature of his intervention.  We have here from the Minister a statement that the most the Government can hope to do will not even meet the increase in costs and, consequently, the volume of local authority house building is going to be reduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>That is different from what you said a minute ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Not in any way. The volume of local authority house building is going to be reduced&mdash;the volume of local authority house building which, may I remind the Minister as he was not here when I first said it, is now 40 per cent lower than 20 years ago.  In a period when the national output, incomes and living standards have risen by 45 per cent we have reduced local authority house building by 40 per cent.  That is the achievement of the Government&mdash; 4,500 local authority houses and not a hope in hell of increasing it, compared with 7,500 houses 20 years ago at the height of the house building programme of the first Coalition.  That is Fianna Fáil's performance.  What are they going to do with the 4,500 now?  Is it going to be increased?  No. They will not provide even enough money to cover the increase in costs in the year ahead and the volume will be reduced and they are going to try to meet this, apparently, by building smaller speculative type houses so that <Col N="1539" /> there will be some kind of increase in the number of speculative type houses built to match the decline in the number of local authority houses built.  That is the Government's policy.</P>
      <P>Is it not an extraordinary thing that the Government have come in here and have chosen to announce that the first great achievement of the capital programme for 1970-71 is a cut in local authority house building?  That is what we have got.  I would have thought that when the Government were looking around for something to cut and looking around for the first thing to announce, they would have shown a little more sensitivity to the situation in which our people are living in this city today and in other cities and towns in this country than to pick this as the first cut to announce and the first part of the capital programme to announce.  I suppose we should congratulate the Minister for coming clean. He did not need to say this.  He could have come into this House and done his usual stonewall act, pretending everything was well.  For some reason &mdash;perhaps, he is converted, on the road to Damascus&mdash;he has come out and told us bluntly the position.</P>
      <P>I suppose he is due credit for telling us but certainly he is not due any credit for accepting this.  I do not suggest that it is his idea.  I do not suggest that the Minister for Local Government went to the Minister for Finance and said: &ldquo;Please, I do not want enough money this year for the increased cost of house building.  Do not bother to give it to me.&rdquo;  I know the Minister has been fighting his corner for more money for housing but he cannot have fought very hard and I suppose his whole defensive attitude in this House and the complacency he and the other Deputies have shown has created a climate of opinion in his own party that when he goes to the Minister for Finance he can hardly say: &ldquo;There is an appalling housing situation which I have to tell the Dáil about.  Please give me enough money for it.&rdquo;  His whole case has been undermined by the defensive and stonewall tactics he has adopted and by the complacency of the other Deputies in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1540" /> This may explain why housing is being cut or maybe it is that next year's capital programme is something in which everything is being drastically cut and that housing has got off lightly, that the Minister's efforts have been so successful that housing is only being cut a little bit while everything else is being cut enormously.  Perhaps, that is the picture we are going to get.  You can take your choice.  I do not know what is in the capital programme.  I do not know whether housing is the first thing to be hit because the Minister is no damn good in fighting his corner or whether housing is only being slightly cut in a programme that is being torn to ribbons.  We will know in a month's time after the Dublin south-west by-election but, may I point out, before the Kildare by-election.  I do not know what the background to that is but the fact is that we know now the local authority building programme, which is 40 per cent lower than 20 years ago, in a country 40 per cent better off, is to be cut and that that is what the Government think about the priorities required for housing.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister, apart from the pleasant little interruptions we are having now, in his closing speech to develop this theme a little further, to tell us precisely how many local authority houses are to be built next year as a result of his inability or his colleague's, Deputy Haughey's, inability, to provide him with enough money even to cover the increase in costs of house building.  I would like him to tell us is it to be 4,300 or 4,200 or 4,000?  By how much is the local authority housing programme to be reduced as a result of this?  We deserve some information on that at the end of this debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>And you will get it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister having introduced this subject and having come clean on the principle of the thing at the beginning, could legitimately give us some of the details of this cut at the end and, perhaps, tell us to what extent his reducing the size of speculative grant-aided houses will compen sate for this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1541" /> It is a peculiar characteristic of our system that we rely so heavily upon speculative house building that only one-third of our house building is house building by public authorities. In Northern Ireland, which we criticise so much and so rightly in the matter of housing allocation, two-thirds of the houses are provided by local authorities and one-third by speculative builders.  The ordinary working man who in England or Northern Ireland or, indeed, in continental countries can expect to get a house, not necessarily with an enormous subsidy, but get a house probably with some kind of assistance from the Government, through local authorities, in this part of <Col N="1542" /> the country is forced to buy it for himself, not with any assistance that would eliminate the need for a deposit, but forced to save up hundreds of pounds and then take on repayments that can amount in many cases, even if he is a skilled worker and well paid, to one-third of his wage.  That is the kind of situation we have created although there was a time 20 years ago when our housing programme was adequate to our current needs.</P>

    <P>In accordance with that provision, national schools have been distinguished by the commissioner as being of a public nature and occupied for the public service.  Secondary or other schools which are under private ownership and control are not distinguished on that ground, although some secondary schools run on a charitable and non-profit-making basis are distinguished on the ground that they are used for charitable purposes.
