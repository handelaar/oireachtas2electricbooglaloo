      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I should begin by sympathising with the Opposition in the efforts they have to make to keep this debate going, as they have succeeded in doing, for one day over the full month.  I made my opening statement on February 11th but by dint of herculean efforts by the joint Opposition Whips and Deputy Hogan they succeeded in keeping the debate going.  I am aware that the intention was to try to prevent me from making my reply until after the Easter Recess as they succeeded on another occasion in preventing me from replying until after the Christmas Recess.  That was two years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I particularly sympathise with their efforts last Thursday.  We all know that <Col N="146" /> on Thursdays the call of the home fires exercises a very strong influence on rural Deputies and of course last Thursday in addition there was the call of Bolton Street where the returning officer for Dublin city was engaged in the laborious and tedious task of elucidating the fact that the voters of Dublin South-West constituency had, by their votes on the previous day, endorsed the policy of the Government and in particular endorsed the policy in regard to local government and the substantial progress made in every aspect of local government which, as Deputies opposite know, was made the prime issue in the by-election campaign. Despite the efforts of the Opposition Whips a number of Deputies, apparently, insisted on going over there to try to convince themselves that all their efforts might have succeeded in confusing the voters.</P>
    <P>Over the last few days practically every Deputy in the Opposition benches that the Whips succeeded in whipping in had to begin his contribution with the words: &ldquo;At this stage there is nothing new to say.&rdquo;  Of course the fact that there was nothing new to say did not inhibit them in the task imposed on them of trying to delay the proceedings of the House.  I was particularly interested yesterday in the efforts made by the Fine Gael Whip to facilitate my colleague in Dublin South County, Deputy O'Higgins.  Deputies were sent in and sent out, told to sit down and told to go out again in order to try to facilitate him but all to no avail; he could not be there that day. That is nothing unusual.  We know that the Deputy finds it difficult to be here except for the odd half-hour.  Even the man who was held in reserve for the past fortnight, Deputy Enright, has lost his chance today&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is much more interesting than the Minister's opening speech.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>In times of danger, temptation and affliction Deputy Enright was there and now the effort has finally petered out.  I think it was the prospect of having to sit here not only on Thursday but also on Friday that finally brought about the collapse <Col N="147" /> of this great effort by the Opposition Whips.  During the past few days I have had some sympathy for the Fine Gael Whip who appeared to be carrying the whole business on his shoulders.  However, when we appreciate that in the earlier part of this campaign Deputy Cluskey succeeded in getting all but five of his party members to contribute, it must be realised that he made an effort beyond the call of duty and Deputy Burke's efforts did not measure up to the same standard.</P>
      <P>It was no mean achievement to keep the debate going at such length, particularly in view of the demoralising defeat the Opposition parties suffered last week in Dublin South-West.  Was it a defeat?  I do not know if the professors have yet decided whether anyone won that election.  Some hours after the returning officer had declared the results I left the professors locked in deep discussion to try to decide for themselves whether anyone had won the election.  Now that they have actually heard the newest and youngest Deputy speak in the Dáil they may have come to the conclusion that the returning officer was right and that the oracle, Professor Chubb, was wrong.</P>
      <P>Aontaím le cuid mhór den dearcadh a nocht an Teachta Ó Beaglaoich nuair a bhí sé ag caint agus go mór mhór leis an méid a bhí le rá aige maidir leis na Gaeltachtaí.</P>
      <P>Maidir le forbairt phleanála sa Ghaeltacht go mór mhór tá sé ina aidhm naisiúnta na limistéirí seo a chaomhnú mar Ghaeltachtaí.  Is ionann sin agus na daoine agus na teaghlaigh sna Gaeltachtaí a chaomhnú, a mhéadú agus a neartú.  Má táimid chun iarracht ar bith a dhéanamh chun an aidhm náisiúnta seo a chur i gcrích ní féidir plé le ceisteanna forbartha sna Gaeltachtaí de réir na gnáth-phrionsabail pleanála amháin.</P>
      <P>Caithfear sna háiteacha sin ach go h-áirithe tosach áite a thúirt do phrion-sabail eile do leas mhuintir na nGael-tachtaí thar leas eacnamaíoch na tíre i gcoitinn agus thar ceisteanna i dtaobh taithneamhachtaí agus a leithéid sin. Forálfar gur mar sin a bhéas sé amach anseo sa Bhille nua pleanála atá ar chlár na Dála.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="148" /> Áiteacha iargcúlta iad na Gael-tachtaí i gcoitinn faoi mar adúirt an Teachta Ó Beaglaoich.  Áiteacha cois farraige is mó atá iontu agus áiteacha i measc na sléibhte is ea cuid acu ach áiteacha iad uilig a bhfuil áilneacht nádúrtha ag baint leo.  Bheadh cosc, no geall le cosc, ar fhorbairt gheilleagrach sna háiteacha seo de réir na gnáth-phrionsabail pleanála ach chun an aidhm náisiúnta a chur i gcrích tá géar-ghá le forbairt ghéilleagrach sna háiteacha seo.  Caithfear, dar ndóigh, gach iarracht a dhéanamh chun áilneacht na n-áiteacha seo a chaomhnú agus na taithneamhachtaí atá iontu a chaomhnú.  Ach b'fhéidir go bhféadfaí an dá phrionsabal seo a réiteach le chéile mar mhaithe le muintir na h-áite féin agus is ar fhorbairt eacnamaíoch na h-aite féin is ceart an cinneadh a dhéanamh.</P>
    <P>Tá sé soiléir mar sin gur do Roinn na Gaeltachta agus do mhuintir na Gaeltachta trína n-eagrachtaí féin is ceart éisteacht agus ní do thuairimí Bhoird Fáilte, An Taisce nó eagraíocht ar bith den sórt sin i gcás iarratas pleanála sa Ghaeltacht.</P>
    <P>Cuirim i gcás dá mbeadh tairiscint ann a chuirfeadh obair mhaith sheasmhach ar fáil do chuid mhaith de mhuintir áite sa Ghaeltacht agus nach bhféadfaí é chur ar siúl gan áilneacht nó taithneamhacht éigin a loit nó a laghdú, ansin bíodh is gur cailliúint do thionscal na cuartaíochta ina iomlán é is ceart a thúirt faid atáimid cinnte go raghadh sé do leas na háite féin&mdash; go gcuirfeadh sé obair sheasmhach ar fáil san áit do mhuintir na háite.</P>
    <P>Ní hionann sin is a rá nach ceart gach iarracht a dhéanamh chun taith-neamhachtaí agus áilneachtaí na Gaeltachta a chaomhnú ach caithfear smaoineamh i gcónaí ar leas na háite. Is féidir áiteacha áilne eile sa tír a chaomhnú tré fhorbairt a chosc iontu agus í a dhíriú go dtí áiteacha níos oiriúnaí as tír ach ní mar sin é don Ghaeltacht.</P>
    <P>Aontaím mar sin leis an méid a bhí le rá ag an Teachta Ó Beaglaoich maidir le fadhbhanna pleanála sna háiteacha sin.  Dar ndóigh, nocht sé na smaointe céanna maidir le Contae Chiarraí ina iomlán agus is féidir liom <Col N="149" /> na tuairimí a bhí aige a thuiscint ach, mar sin féin, tá sé soiléir go gcaithfimid na prionsabail phlanála seo a chur i bhfeidhm sa tír i gcoitinn mar mhaithe le tionscal na cuartaíochta agus chun a chintiú nach ndéanfar loit ar áilneacht na tíre i gcoitinn.</P>
    <P>One point brought out in this debate is that the procedure for calling speakers creates a significant imbalance in regard to Deputies from different sides of the House.  This convention that binds the House to call speakers in rotation, in accordance with parties, irrespective of the number of Deputies in a particular party, should be revised in order to give all Deputies an equal opportunity.  We had a total of 50 speakers in this debate and, because of this convention and the desire of the Government not to bog down the business of this House, there were only 17 speakers out of the 50 from this side of the House while this peculiar convention gave the opportunity to speak to 33 Members of the Opposition.  It is obviously time that this convention was revised so that we may have here a more balanced discussion.</P>
    <P>This debate has highlighted some facts and, in particular, the tremendously wide range and the national importance of the services administered by the Department of Local Government, together with the general realisation of the potential of the Department as an influence for both social and economic development and, I am glad to say, the deep and genuine interest of many Deputies on both sides in the process of local administration. It also emphasised, of course, the fact that there are a number of Deputies who treat everything as a vehicle for political playacting.  However, there was a degree of objectivity displayed by some Opposition speakers and I want to acknowledge this early on because it is possible that the necessity to demolish some of the nonsense put forward by certain Deputies may prevent me from dealing adequately with the more constructive contributions of others.</P>
    <P>I want to make it clear, at the same time, that I recognise that there were certain constructive contributions from <Col N="150" /> the opposite side.  It is, in fact, a measure of the objectivity of the approach of some of the Deputies who spoke, but not by any means all, that criticisms and initiatives for change should have come from members on the Government benches and that some Deputies opposite had the moral courage and honesty to commend certain aspects at least of the Department's work.  The maturity displayed by some Opposition Deputies highlights the reactionary approach of some others, the outstanding example of which was the contribution by Deputy Dr. FitzGerald, who can see in a debate of this sort only another platform from which to deny and belittle the real achievements of the present administration, achievements of which Opposition Deputies are well aware.  As usual, there were many&mdash;this is something I have come to expect&mdash;personal attacks and many criticisms, some of which I shall in the course of my reply reject or counter and others about which I shall not bother at all.</P>
    <P>I want to start off now by accepting one particular criticism.  Deputy Treacy described my opening speech as an unimaginative speech.  This I accept.  It was intended to be factual, not imaginative, and I think that goes too for all the speakers from this side of the House.  There was no imagination used; they spoke of a factual situation.  I certainly concede the palm for the exercise of imagination to the Opposition. I concede it, without a contest, starting with the principal opening spokesman for the Labour Party, the Deputy from South Tipperary, who set the pattern of ignoring fact and relying almost completely on fertile imagination.  Not alone do I plead guilty to basing the policy of my Department on factual rather than imaginative considerations but I continuously bear in mind the object lesson of the disaster that resulted from the last Coalition period, when imagination prevailed.  My strongest determination is that this will never be allowed to happen again, certainly not in so far as the Department of Local Government is concerned.  The administration of that Department and of the activities conducted under the auspices of that Department will be based on <Col N="151" /> factual rather than imaginative considerations.</P>
    <P>My opening statement, therefore, owed nothing to imagination.  Everything in it is verifiable.  The projections for the future are realistic and capable of achievement.  Where housing is concerned they are related on the one hand to a factual and reasonable assessment of accumulated and prospective needs, which were outlined in the White Paper published last year, <i>Housing in the Seventies,</i> and, on the other hand, they are related to a realistic assessment of the capacity of the economy to provide the money necessary for financing building activities and to the capacity of the building industry to carry out the actual construction work necessary to achieve the ambitious housing targets we have set ourselves.  They are also related and take cognisance of the primary essential of ensuring that sufficient capital continues to be available for the further economic expansion without which improvements in any sphere of local government just will not be possible. The fact that my opening statement was based on these considerations is something for which I make no apology.  I fully accept the accusation that my opening statement was unimaginative. That is what it was intended to be.</P>
    <P>I also accept Deputy Tully's assertion that one would think, sometimes at any rate, that Fianna Fáil Deputies and Opposition Deputies were talking about different countries.  I agree with that. Here, again, Fianna Fáil Deputies were talking of this country as it exists, of its problems and of the capacity of the community to set about solving these problems while the Opposition, adopting the imaginative approach advocated by Deputy Treacy, the Labour Party spokesman on this subject, were talking of a situation existing only in their own imaginations.  We, in Fianna Fáil, talk of the country as it is.  The Opposition talk of the land of their heart's desire, which is a land of abject misery, degradation and despair.  It is not the country we have here.</P>

      <P>The Minister visited the caravan sites not only in his own constituency but in the constituency of Dublin South West and the people in the constituency of Dublin South West, within the last week, had the opportunity of deciding whether or not to accept this imaginative portrayal of the country, which the Opposition Deputies paint, or whether to trust the evidence of their own eyes and they decided to endorse the Government's policy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>They decided to reject the suggestion of another crash programme in regard to housing.  That is one thing the people keep telling Opposition Deputies: they do not want another crash programme because they never again want to see the housing programme crashing in ruins to the ground as it did when the Opposition parties last got their hands on the country's affairs.  They never want to see that happen again.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>They have told the other parties that at election after election. They have said: &ldquo;Never again, never again.&rdquo;  So long as the Deputies go before the people advocating a repetition of those methods, of that mishandling of the country's finances and that criminal mishandling of the housing situation we will always be returned to these benches over here. Keep it up.  The longer it is kept up the better for us.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I will tell Deputy O'Higgins that if he can find time to come back here about 4 p.m.  I should be dealing with that about that time. <Col N="153" /> I do not know whether Deputy O'Higgins has a brief or not, but I expect to be dealing with that subject shortly after Question Time.  It may take longer to reach the subject if Deputy O'Higgins cannot contain himself and persists in prolonging matters now.  The Deputy was not able to be here at 10.30 a.m. to prolong matters as he had planned.  The best efforts of the Fine Gael Whip, with the able assistance of the Labour Whip, could not succeed in arranging for Deputy O'Higgins to be facilitated.  I suggest that it may not be too late for Deputy O'Higgins to employ himself as he usually does.  Even if the Deputy went to the Four Courts now he might get a brief and employ himself usefully rather than come in here to disrupt the activities of this House when he found it impossible to drag himself out of bed to be here early.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Last night I was particularly interested in the activities of the Fine Gael Whip and of the Fine Gael Party in trying to facilitate Deputy O'Higgins.  It was one of the things which made it possible for me to retain my sanity while Deputies were coming in here repeating themselves. Frantic efforts were made to arrange matters so that, on the few fleeting occasions when the Deputy found it possible to come in here, he would be facilitated in making whatever contribution he wanted to make so desperately that he has come in here this morning.  I do not know when <Col N="154" /> Deputy O'Higgins was seen here in the morning before.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Before I go on to deal with some of the other points which were raised in this debate, I should deal with Deputy Fitzpatrick's contention that because I concern myself with political effort at election times I am not qualified to be Minister for Local Government.  Perhaps I should not bother with this at all.  We are all here because we are politicians.  I wish to plead guilty to taking part in elections, both general elections and by-elections. The most recent by-election in which I took part has been, as the majority of them are, a very successful one from my point of view although the professors have not decided yet whether it was successful or not.  I have not seen them here since then.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I will come to the Estimate, but I want to get these things out of the way first.  As the Deputies on the Fine Gael and Labour benches know, a large part of this debate was not concerned with any aspect of local government.  It was concerned with my personal suitability or unsuitability for the post.  In view of the fact that this is such a grave cause of concern to the Deputies I <Col N="155" /> am entitled to deal with it.  One of the points raised was that because of the fact that I take part in political activity I am unfit to be Minister for Local Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>That was Deputy Fitzpatrick's contention.  I take part in these by-elections and during every one of the campaigns I meet Deputy Fitzpatrick also taking part.  If I am not qualified because of the fact that I am a politician to be Minister for Local Government, what does he qualify for himself?  Deputy Dr. FitzGerald also takes a prominent part, but not quite so constructive a part as Deputy Fitzpatrick.  Deputy Dr. FitzGerald seems to specialise in the organisation of squads of undergraduates for the purpose of removing Fianna Fáil publicity in the various areas in which elections are being held.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>When I did not kick the Deputy I did not kick or hit anyone. The real complaint is not that I involve myself in politics, or that my <Col N="156" /> colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, involves himself in by-elections, but that Fianna Fáil are so successful at by-elections.  In so far as I am concerned their complaint appears to be that, when I am hit, I hit back.  Deputies opposite will find that out for themselves.  Having failed by attacking Fianna Fáil on a national scale I can see there is a concerted attack to try to annihilate individual Ministers.</P>

      <P>In taking notes in this debate, particularly in the early stages, I did not always take a note of the Deputy's name; I put things down as &ldquo;Labour&rdquo; or &ldquo;Fine Gael&rdquo;.  Of course I should have had more sense.  I should have realised that it is a difficult thing to put anything down as a Labour view or a Fine Gael view.  I should have known from past experiences that there would be contradictions.  In fact I find it just as difficult to establish what is the Labour view on any particular point as did the people of Dublin South-West.  Therefore, I may, in dealing with some of the points made, refer to something as being the Labour viewpoint.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to assure those Members of some of the other sections <Col N="159" /> of the Labour Party that when I do that I do not intend any insult to them.  I do not intend to insult Deputy Cruise-O'Brien if I happen to refer to something Deputy Treacy said, or Deputy Michael Pat Murphy, as being the Labour Party view.  That will not be intended as a personal affront to Deputy Cruise-O'Brien or any member of his section of the Labour Party.  For instance, so far as the Buchanan Report is concerned I made the mistake of thinking that the views of the Labour spokesman, or at least the person I understood to be the Labour spokesman on local government, Deputy Treacy, were the views of the Labour Party and when I referred to that later in reply to supplementaries raised by Deputy Desmond, at Question Time, it was made quite clear to me that that was a big mistake.</P>
      <P>At column 677, volume 244, of the Official Report for 11th February, 1970, Deputy Treacy, speaking about the proposed regional development organisations, said that as members of local authorities they had already given some consideration to these proposals and he went on to say:</P>
      <P>Many of us felt that in some way these proposals were tied up with and were part of the Buchanan Report.  The Minister has confirmed our opinion in this respect by his statement here this evening.  The idea of the establishment of regional development organisations is an integral part of the Buchanan Report. Most of us in this House have expressed our horror and dismay at what would happen to our country if the Buchanan Report were implemented in its entirety.</P>
      <P>He went on to say:</P>
      <P>It might seem to be economically wise to adopt the Buchanan Report but many of us feel that it can and will have disastrous social consequences if implemented.</P>
      <P>At column 694, he continued:</P>
      <P>Many of us believe the Buchanan Report to be alien to the needs and aspirations of our people.  It is something which is being imposed on us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I say, in my innocence, I made the <Col N="160" /> mistake of looking on that as the official Labour point of view but when I mentioned this to Deputy Desmond on 24th February, in reply to supplementary questions, it was hotly denied. I said:</P>
    <P>I am aware that the Labour Party have announced their total rejection of the report.</P>
    <P>Mr. Desmond: We have done no such thing.</P>
    <P>This was the type of difficulty I was up against.</P>

      <P>If Deputy Cruise-O'Brien waits he will hear that.  The point is that I want to apologise in advance if I talk about something as the Labour point of view which Deputy Cruise-O'Brien does not accept.  I just cannot discover what the Labour viewpoint is on any subject.  Despite the fact that the Order Paper has started to bristle with Private Members' motions signed by the whole 17 phalanx of the Labour Party, or those elected to the Dáil as the Labour Party, it is obvious from this debate that this loud protestation of unity of purpose is deceptive.  It is not easy for the uninitiated like myself to be clear as to what faction of the Labour Party each individual member belongs. It is not even clear how many different factions there are in the Labour Party. I can identify, on a chronological basis, I suppose, the majority of those whom Deputy Cruise-O'Brien describes as poltroons&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>No, I want to explain that in referring to the Labour Party I was misled by these motions in the names of 17 Members and that this will lead me into making mistakes during my reply to this debate and that I do not mean to insult anybody by ascribing views of some of the other sections of the Labour Party to him.  As I said, I would not be so harsh as to apply the term &ldquo;poltroon&rdquo;&mdash;the full definition of which was given by my colleague the Minister for Justice&mdash;to Deputy Corish, Deputy Tully, Deputy Treacy, Deputy Spring and the other members of the former Labour Party who survived the advent of Deputy Dr. O'Brien and his colleagues. I do not think the fact that one member of this section described his concept of socialism as the activities of the St. Vincent de Paul Society and the Irish Wheelchair Association qualifies him for the description &ldquo;a mean-spirited, worthless wretch&rdquo; or &ldquo;craven&rdquo; but I suppose the title given to this section of the Labour Party by Deputy Dr O'Brien as the &ldquo;Poltroon Party&rdquo; is just about as suitable as anything else but those who were here pre-1965&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I will conclude these observations by saying I realise that it is somewhat unfair to lump together all these varying views representing the whole spectrum of socialism from the activities of the St. Vincent de Paul Society and the Irish Wheelchair Association in Limerick to the thoughts of Chairman Mao in north County Dublin and north east Dublin as the views of the Labour Party but I was misled by this All For One and One <Col N="162" /> For All attitude proclaimed by these motions in the names of the 17 Labour Members.</P>
      <P>It is confusing enough to have Deputies contradicting one another in this way but it is even more confusing when the same Deputy contradicts himself, as Deputy Treacy so often does.  The classic example was in the debate on this Estimate the last time it was debated in this House which was two years ago when he contradicted himself in successive sentences. At column 1424 of volume 231 of the Official Report Deputy Treacy said: &ldquo;The differential renting system is a vicious one.  We in the Labour Party have always supported the principle of the differential rent.&rdquo;  This year he was not quite so blatant in his contradiction of himself as distinct from his contradiction of his colleagues but at columns 670 and 674 of the Official Report of the 11th February he condemns the system which he asserts compels thousands of people to live in tenement dwellings but at column 700, the next day after he had slept on it, he changed his tune and tells us that: &ldquo;There are very many tenement houses in the heart of this city which could and should be reconstructed and which could and should have provided homes for the people of the heart of the city&rdquo;.  Tenements are to be condemned and tenements are to be preserved.  Again, we have him attacking building societies and shortly afterwards saying that he would like to see special assistance given to them. However, I do not want to go too deeply at this stage at any rate into Deputy Treacy's particular idiosyncrasies.</P>
      <P>This debate was so wide ranging that it would not be practicable for me to deal with all the questions that were raised and all the criticisms voiced or to correct every erroneous statement. I have taken note of every genuine point that was raised.  I shall mention some of them, others I probably shall not, but I can assure the Deputies who made genuine points that they will be attended to.  There are some specific criticisms with which I propose to deal at greater length.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The greater part of my opening <Col N="163" /> statement was taken up with housing and most Deputies followed this example but there is one matter that I would like to dispose of before I go on to deal with housing which was a subject on which very many erroneous statements and speeches were made indeed.  The matter I want to deal with was touched on by certain Deputies&mdash; Deputy Desmond, Deputy Dr. Brown and Deputy FitzGerald.  It is the question of a planning permission granted on appeal in Dublin city which has received a lot of publicity most of it of a very misleading kind.  In view of the fact that it has been mentioned here and that a number of Deputies have taken an active part in the promotion of agitation in this regard I feel I should deal with it.  I did notice that on this occasion when they can be answered, most Deputies, even those who did take an active part in street agitation in regard to this, refrained from promoting the present agitation with regard to this particular planning application.  I can only deduce that the bogus and unjustified nature of this has at last penetrated and that they would prefer to forget that they had been associated with the incitement to lawlessness which has been fostered without reference to the principles of right and wrong by some of what are called the media of communication or else that their enthusiasm has been dampened by the knowledge that on this occasion they can be answered.  I remember this matter being raised here on the Adjournment and the attitude was somewhat different, when it was known that the Minister was confined to ten minutes for his reply and when the Opposition Parties demonstrated their allegiance to the principle of free speech by ensuring that even those ten minutes would be denied to the Minister, that he was effectively prevented from making even the briefest reply to the unfounded allegations that were made.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of Deputies in this House follow the lead of An Taisce and other bodies like that who have been claiming that they see inconsistencies in planning decisions made both by me and by planning authorities.  It must be agreed that in many cases the ultimate decision on a planning application or planning appeal is a matter of opinion.  Opinions vary and there have been cases in which the opinion either of the planning authority or of myself has not coincided with that of An Taisce. Apparently this is regarded by certain Deputies as a crime but contrary to the deliberate and false impression so sedulously fostered by An Taisce such cases are comparatively rare and, unlikely as it may seem, from discussions that I have had there are many cases in which Deputies from all sides of the House have committed this crime of disagreeing with An Taisce.  In fact, Deputies have made representations to me on appeals to reject the view of An Taisce.  In the vast majority of these cases I have gone against public opinion as presumably expressed by the public representatives and have upheld the An Taisce view but, of course, this is concealed from the public.</P>
      <P>I wish to make it clear that the fact that certain bodies are designated as being suitable and competent to give advice, to offer comments on planning matters and to enter appeals in certain cases, particularly where the question involves amenities, does not mean as they seem to think that they have been given the function of deciding these matters.  However, it is recognised that they are likely to have certain competence to advise from one particular and important aspect but from this one aspect only whereas the Minister is required to take all aspects into account and not just the viewpoints of An Taisce and these other bodies. Strange as it may seem, there are on occasions other views which are strongly and honestly held.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Surely Deputies, particularly those representing constituencies in which large areas are designated as areas of high amenity, can realise how unfair it would be to provide, as these people demand, that decisions should be made by a group who are interested only in <Col N="165" /> one particular aspect and who have no regard for the local economy or for the exigencies of the landowner involved in a planning application?  In fact, two Deputies from the Opposition side of the House, Deputies Begley and Timmins, who represent constituencies such as this, showed in the course of their remarks that they would not relish these people being given the power that they are demanding.</P>
    <P>If these people could bring themselves to consider the whole matter objectively, in the realisation that they are not necessarily infallible and that there are considerations other than their wishes to be taken into account, they would realise how unreasonable it is to expect 100 per cent success in the different planning applications in which they are involved.  If they would pause for a moment to consider all the appeals in which they have been involved, they could not but see that their views have been upheld much more often than not.</P>
    <P>It would appear to me that both Deputies Begley and Timmins have realised that this is the position and that there has been a certain amount of frustration in some of these local authority areas because of this.  If these people would be a little objective in looking at this matter they would realise that in many cases the upholding of the An Taisce viewpoint meant over-ruling the planning authority and in some cases, it could be said, flouting democracy by reversing a decision that was formally and publicly taken by the elected representatives themselves and which, therefore, presumably reflected public opinion.</P>
    <P>Deputy Timmins and I think Deputy Begley, also, referred to the fact that elected representatives have, on many occasions, taken decisions themselves and have taken the responsibility of making decisions by the use of section 4.  In many of these cases I have upheld an appeal by An Taisce or by Bord Fáilte or, more usually, by both. If these people would look objectively at the matter they would see the dishonesty of their approach in the odd case where it has been held that other factors outweighed the particular aspect of interest to them and, in particular, they would see the blatant hypocrisy <Col N="166" /> in their putting forward a case that it is sacrilege to give a decision which is at variance with the planning authority decision when they, themselves, frequently demand and obtain such a reversal of the decision given by a planning authority.  I may say that in any appeal of any significance that has come before me, eminent professional planners have put forward diametrically opposed views on one side or the other just as eminent counsel put forward diametrically opposed views every day in the courts of law. I am satisfied that I have available to me the best planning advice that is obtainable and I am completely satisfied that that advice is given to me in a thoroughly objective way.  The ultimate decision to be made by me on these appeals involves weighing all the different considerations against one another.</P>
    <P>With regard to the allegation of inconsistencies in the matter of planning decisions, it occurs to me as being peculiar that An Taisce, for instance, never think of critically examining their own attitude to different planning appeals from the point of view of consistency or the appearance of consistency, and, particularly, of comparing their attitude in cases in which the applicant is closely associated with a prominent An Taisce personality with their attitude in cases that are free from this type of complication.</P>
    <P>Of course, I can understand that the consortium of belted earls and their ladies and left wing intellectuals who can afford the time to stand and contemplate in ecstasy the unparalleled manmade beauty of the two corners of Hume Street and Stephen's Green may very well feel that the unskilled amateurish efforts of Mother Nature in the Wicklow Mountains are unworthy of their attention.  Indeed, it may be that the Guinness nobility who pull the strings to which the Georgians dance may consider that as long as the private mountain amenities of Lough Tay and Lough Dan are preserved free from the intrusion of the local peasantry and uncultured mob, it is all right to permit an architect closely associated with a prominent An Taisce personality to intrude a manmade building in an unspoiled area like Glenmalure.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="167" /> However, it is not unreasonable to expect a body like this, officially dedicated to the preservation of amenities of all kinds, to be wide enough in their scope to consider the humble, unpretentious attractions of Glenmalure as well as the magnificent splendour of the corners of Hume Street and Stephen's Green.  Indeed, from the point of view of the national heritage there are people who would think that the preservation of the street scape containing the national headquarters of Fine Gael is not any more important than the mountain headquarters of Fiach McHugh O'Byrne.</P>
    <P>In dealing with various appeals I also get an opportunity of observing apparent inconsistencies and I often find it difficult to refrain from a slight feeling of disillusionment when remembering the stout defence of amenity that was put up when some local uneconomic landholder proposed to make some profitable use of part of his holding of rock and bracken, I see a bland acceptance of the proposed intrusion of the abomination of abominations, a human habitation, into an unspoiled area like Glenmalure, because if there is one cardinal principle of the An Taisce code it is that the one thing which irreparably destroys the unspoiled nature of a rural area of amenity is any evidence of the existence in the area of <i>homo sapiens</i> in addition to the indigenous flora and fauna.</P>
    <P>In so far as Georgian Dublin is concerned I personally agree that it is desirable to preserve as much as is feasible of the Georgian area of my native city.  For myself, I dislike much of modern architecture and I will give whatever assistance I can so long as it does not entail any diversion of scarce capital resources from what I consider the more important matters of housing and sanitary services.  I agree also that there are many examples of Georgian architecture outside the city of Dublin which are well worth preserving if possible and I also accept unreservedly that this is part of our national heritage, but it is part only.  Ireland existed and was building up a national heritage before the Georgian era and who knows <Col N="168" /> it may yet be decided that this process did not terminate with the end of that era?  I have, because I have bowed to the inevitable in certain cases where I insist the battle was already lost, been assailed by those people as being maliciously and vindictively bent on destroying our glorious national heritage. This is not true.  Despite the antics of those people I appreciate the national importance of many of the examples still extant of this type of architecture and I will do all I reasonably can to preserve that.  But when it comes to public money, whether provided by the taxpayer or the ratepayer, as would be the case in this particular instance, there must be priorities.  Certainly, in so far as the Minister for Local Government is concerned, there must be priorities.</P>
    <P>I make no apology whatever for saying that the physical needs of the people must get priority over the aesthetic needs of Lord and Lady Guinness and Deputies Dr. FitzGerald, Dr. Browne, Desmond and all the other Deputy Doctors that we have.  I make no apology for saying that, desirable as is the preservation of old buildings of architectural merit, while I am Minister for Local Government and while the needs of the people for housing, water and sewerage services remain unfulfilled, not one penny of the capital allocation that it is possible to make available to my Department will be spent on such preservation, desirable as it is.  That is not to say that every possible effort should not be made to conserve as much as is feasible of this part of our national heritage for as long as possible.</P>
    <P>I thoroughly approve of voluntary efforts to do this and, as I said, I will do all I can to help, but it is well that the position with regard to public money should be clearly understood.  I do not think it is unreasonable to expect people who expound so continuously and so unctuously about our national heritage to appreciate that there are other components of our national heritage of importance to other people and to accept that all the different aspects go to make up the whole.  In this respect it may not be without some significance that some of the more rabid <Col N="169" /> and aggressive proponents of this particular aspect of our national heritage are also prominently engaged in the attempt to try to eliminate the most fundamental component of our heritage, which is the national language, without which we can have no national heritage at all because we will have no nation.</P>
    <P>The fact of the matter appears to me to be that it is not so much our national heritage as such that some of those people are concerned with as in retaining the relics of &ldquo;auld dacency&rdquo;, nostalgic reminders of the days of gracious living in the salons and drawingrooms of those Georgian houses at the expense of the slaveys and lackeys subsisting in the somewhat less gracious basements and back lanes.  I think the impressive facades of those Georgian houses, the sweeping staircases, the fine stucco work, the Adam fireplaces and so on are well worth preserving but I think it is no harm to remind people who make a fetish of those things and who yearn after the days of gracious living that they denote that each example also involved a dark and gloomy basement and an insanitary back lane hovel.</P>
    <P>An Taisc strike their breasts at the enormity of reversing a decision of a planning authority but they appear to have an infinite capacity for ignoring and, as I said before, sedulously concealing from the public the knowledge of such things as the outcome of their own appeal to me to reverse the decision of the planning authority, as in the case of the permission given by Dublin Corporation for the Central Bank to disrupt the skyline of the southern bank of the Liffey with a modern skyscraper. However, it seems to be obvious that we can expect at least one case like this to be made an issue of each year in this dishonest campaign by those bodies with, of course, no recognition for the many cases that are decided to their satisfaction.</P>
    <P>It is no harm to detail the actual facts with regard to this eighth wonder of the world, the twin achitectural masterpieces at the corner of Hume Street and Stephen's Green.  Here are the facts.  At a time prior to the publication, and, indeed as far as I <Col N="170" /> know, prior to the existence of even a draft Dublin development plan, an application was made to the planning authority for outline permission for the erection of an office block on the sites of Nos. 46, 47, 48 and 49 Stephen's Green and No. 1 Hume Street.  This group of buildings comprises within it one of the sacred corners of Stephen's Green and Hume Street.  No. 46 Stephen's Green forms one of those corners and No. 1 Hume Street adjoins it.  This application was made in accordance with the statutory procedure. Notice of intention to make the application was inserted in the newspapers.  For all I know it was possibly inserted in the <i>Irish Times.</i> I would not be a bit surprised if it was. The result of this application which was made to the planning authority and not to the Minister was that the permission sought was granted and it was granted by the blessed and holy planning authority itself, not by the Minister.</P>
    <P>Here the mystery thickens.  When this permission was granted, and despite the fact that the intention to apply was published in the papers, and despite the purchase at a public auction of three of the houses involved known as the Dominican Hall, the statutory right of appeal to the Minister was not exercised by anybody, not by An Taisce, not by Bord Fáilte, not by the Dublin Civic Group and not by any of the cultured Deputies and Senators of this Parliament.  All those stood idly by while the planning authority, not the Minister, and the Dominican nuns handed over this component of our glorious national heritage to be despoiled by a vicious developer.</P>
    <P>I agree this is hard to imagine in view of the present sanctimonious hullabaloo, but it is a fact.  These people&mdash;Deputy Begley knows them well&mdash;who are so vigilant in defence of amenities if John Joe Moriarty proposes to build a small house for himself within an ass's roar of the Ring of Kerry, stood idly by while permission was granted and consolidated for a modern Irish architect to pit his poor skill against the unchronicled genius who designed the two splendiferous corners of Stephen's Green and Hume Street.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="171" /> After the statutory period for appeal had passed, a valid and uncontested permission existed for the demolition of these houses, including one of the sacred corners of Stephen's Green and Hume Street.  This was a decision in which no iconoclastic Fianna Fáil Minister had hand, act or part.  It was made by the planning authority and formally acquisced in by An Taisce, Bord Fáilte, the Dublin Civic Group, Fine Gael, Labour, the Guinness aristocracy, the cultured Deputies of the House, the Dublin City Council of illustrious memory, Senator Sheehy Skeffington, Telefís Éireann, Uncle Tom Cobley and all, including those noted defenders of our Georgian heritage, the ever-faithful custodians of the houses in their own care in Great Denmark Street, the Jesuit Order.</P>
    <P>In the absence of a development plan, and there was no development plan in Dublin at that time, the only way in which a member of the iniquitous class of developer can establish what will be permitted in an area is by applying for outline permission.  These miscreants who in the 20th century are following the example of the uncultured wretches who in earlier times tore down our heritage of clay and wattle masterpieces and replaced them by hideous modern brick edifices applied for and obtained outline permission in accordance with the law.  They naturally felt they had discovered what would be allowed in relation to the area in question.  They felt it reasonable to assume that there was absolutely unanimous acceptance of this decision.</P>
    <P>After all, if the planning authority and the noble custodians of our national heritage do not know their own mind, who can be expected to know it?  I certainly think it was reasonable to assume that a formal statement had, in effect, been made that this area of Stephen's Green, including the corner of Stephen's Green and Hume Street and at least a part of Hume Street itself adjoining Stephen's Green, was suitable for this type of development which, of course, was already taking place in other parts of Stephen's Green.</P>
    <P>I do not see how anybody could have <Col N="172" /> been expected to deduce from this that what was desired by all these conservationists was the creation of a lopsided entrance into Hume Street&mdash; that one corner was to be redeveloped and the other corner was to be preserved for the delectation of posterity. In any case, it is now evident that the developers in this case, with their valid uncontested outline permission, did not succeed in properly interpreting the An Taisce mind and they clearly had every reason to believe that they had the all clear both from the planning authority and the preservationists because prior to applying for outline permission in respect of Nos. 46, 47, 48 and 49 Stephen's Green and No. 1 Hume Street, which is the southern corner of Hume Street and Stephen's Green, they had received a written assurance from the planning authority that the other corner was not affected in any way by land use reservations.</P>
    <P>They then proceeded to acquire this property and on receipt of the outline permission for the south corner, they proceeded to acquire the remainder of the property in so far as it was possible. In fact, they succeeded in acquiring all the property concerned except No. 1 Hume Street, which is owned by the State and the short term interest expiring in 1980, in No. 46 Stephen's Green.</P>
    <P>They then submitted detailed proposals for development at one corner of the sites covered by the outline permission and in addition No. 2 Hume Street, and the other corner which involved the sites of Nos. 44 and 45 Stephen's Green and Nos. 19 and 18 Hume Street, all of which were covered by the written clearance given by the planning authority.  They submitted their proposals for detailed development, but lo and behold, the planning authority, which had given formal official permission for the redevelopment of Nos. 46, 47, 48 and 49 Stephen's Green and No. 1 Hume Street as a result of which three of these houses had been demolished, and had given a written statement clearing Nos. 44 and 45 Stephen's Green and Nos. 19 and 18 Hume Street, now issued a draft development plan recommending No. 46 Stephen's Green and Nos. 1 and 19 Hume Street for preservation and <Col N="173" /> scheduling other houses already cleared by them for preservation.</P>
    <P>Having done that, the planning authority refused permission on the ground that their development plan was contravened.  This provision for preservation covered a total of seven houses.  Remember, the planning authority themselves, with the concurrence of the preservationists&mdash;I want to emphasise that: with the concurrence of all the preservationist bodies&mdash;had already granted permission for the demolition and the redevelopment of two of these seven houses and had cleared all except one of the remainder in writing, while at least five of the seven houses were known to be structurally defective and in some cases were officially classified as dangerous buildings, and in all probability the other two are also in bad condition. Of course, the possibility of another collapse of Georgian buildings, as in Fenian Street, is of no concern to these people.</P>
    <P>It is freely admitted that this reversal by the planning authority was in response to pressure exercised by the present agitators.  In view of the earlier events to which I have referred, I think it is appropriate to consider the ethics, first of all, of this pressure resulting from the change of mind of An Taisce and the other bodies concerned who suddenly declared the proposal they had already sanctioned to be a national sacrilege, and, secondly, to consider the ethics of the present agitation.</P>
    <P>If these buildings are of such outstanding importance as to justify confiscation by force from the legal owners at the behest of An Taisce, is it not beyond question that in neglecting to appeal against an actual decision given by the planning authority to permit demolition and redevelopment, these noble custodians of our heritage, in fact, had sold the pass?  If their present contention is true that these buildings are of such importance as to justify forceable confiscation from the owners, then they clearly failed in their duty to protect our national heritage at the appropriate time, and it was at that stage that the battle was lost.</P>
    <P>Surely, in view of this, one must <Col N="174" /> ask the question if their action since then is honest dealing, or is it duplicity intended merely to distract attention from their own dereliction of duty.  I should like to ask some of the Opposition Deputies who have taken part in this agitation if fair play enters into this matter at all.  Is it their contention that because a person can be classified as a developer, which, of course, is an iniquitous occupation, he may legitimately be duped into incurring heavy expenditure and then be kicked in the teeth?</P>
    <P>As far as I am concerned I hold no brief for this or any other developer &mdash;they can look after themselves as far as I am concerned&mdash;but I do have a sense of right and wrong and I say that the company, developers though they may be, have been clearly wronged and I say that the agitators having been either negligent or of a different mind&mdash;I do not know which because they did not tell us&mdash;at the time when it was feasible to achieve the objective they now claim to have in mind.  I say they have since then played an unfair, underhand game and that they are now, with the connivance of Members of this House, engaged in an open act of piracy in seizing property that does not belong to them.</P>
    <P>The question of compensation in a case like this would fall to be decided by an arbitrator.  I do not presume to say whether or not the claim of £355,000 against the ratepayers of this city, which was mentioned, would have succeeded.  I leave it to people to form their own opinion on the basis of the principles of common justice which cannot constitutionally be withheld from anybody merely because he can be classified as a developer.  Deputies may interpret the reasons for my decision in this matter as they wish.  Not surprisingly, in view of the normal attitude of the Opposition, and in view of the promptings they have received in this case by An Taisc and their allies, some ignoble motives have already been imputed to me.  These I deny. There are other possibilities.</P>
    <P>It could be, for instance, that I believed in the principle of fair dealing. It could conceivably be that my <Col N="175" /> assessment of the relative importance of the different planning principles was subconsciously affected by concern for the overburdened ratepayers of this city who are apparently to be given no opportunity of saying whether or not they are prepared to accept the imposition by An Taisc and by a group of pampered students of an increase amounting to 2s 6d or 3s in the £ on their rates in order that they can continue to repair daily to gaze in raptures at the beauty of the corners of Stephen's Green and Hume Street.  I have no way of knowing whether or not the ratepayers of Dublin are prepared to pay this amount for that pleasure.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, it could be that I concurred with the original opinion of the planning authority and of all these preservationist bodies and that the reasons that induced their about-face passed me by.  It could be that I considered it appropriate that dangerous and derelict office buildings should, in the prevailing circumstances of excessive demand on the available supply of capital, be replaced efficiently and economically rather than that they should uneconomically be patched up.</P>
    <P>It could be that I believed that the architectural profession in this country has not deteriorated to the extent that some members of the profession insist that it has and that I believed it was not impossible that a modern Irish architect might display some degree of taste and appreciation of an important site in redevelopment.  There are many other possible explanations of the reasons behind my decision but, in fact, I did no more than uphold the original and universally accepted and, indeed, endorsed decision of the planning authority.</P>
    <P>If there is, as is now belatedly contended by the ever-vigilant custodians of our national heritage, a grave loss of amenity involved in the replacement of these old dwellinghouses which are no longer acceptable as such or no longer capable of continuing as offices, then I accept no responsibility for it. The responsibility clearly rests with these people themselves.  The only time I could have reasonably and <Col N="176" /> effectively intervened was when the outline permission was granted.  The perservationists themselves withheld that opportunity from me.  Therefore, if there is culpability in this matter, it clearly rests with An Taisce and their allies.  I certainly accept no responsibility whatever for it.</P>
    <P>After all, could we not try to get some consolation from the situation? Some of us here may yet survive to see another George ascend the throne of Merrie England.  If so, maybe the buildings that will be erected here, or some other future glass and concrete egg-boxes as they are described, may eventually qualify for the description &ldquo;Georgian architecture&rdquo; or perhaps the architect concerned in this case might be induced to call into consultation whoever is responsible for the architectural masterpieces in the area of the city bounded by James's Street, Watling Street and Victoria Quay.</P>
    <P>With regard to this whole question of the preservation of decayed and decrepit houses which, although of architectural merit, are no longer functionally suitable, the position of the Minister for Local Government is that, unlike the Opposition and unlike these aesthetic hi-jackers, he cannot afford to operate in water-tight compartments. He is painfully aware that, despite the ever-increasing national resources, capital is very far from unlimited. He is aware that pressure for capital for all different purposes far exceeds its availability.  He must therefore take cognisance of the fact that demands for capital expenditure for different purposes are in competition with one another.  Therefore, expenditure on the retention of buildings, whose sole value now is aesthetic rather than utilitarian, whether this expenditure is on their restoration or on purchase and compensation, due to a change of mind by the planning authority, or on both, can only be at the expense of the number of houses which could be provided for the amount of money involved.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dr. Browne said that £40,000 is not a lot of money.  He may not think it is a lot of money but I do.  I find it very hard to come by for the purposes of my Department.  If, as some people have said, £50,000 or <Col N="177" /> £100,000 for the restoration of one of the houses is all that is in question&mdash; I think this must be more than doubtful&mdash;then what is being demanded is that we build from 17 to 34 houses less.</P>
    <P>If, as some people will think more likely, a further sum of up to £355,000 in compensation is entailed, then the lords and ladies and their colleagues are demanding, for their own aesthetic pleasure, a further reduction in output of up to 120 houses. Therefore, anything up to 150-odd houses are to be forfeited to pander to the aesthetic needs of a small selfish minority.  If the cost of restoration and conservation of the other houses is also to be incurred, as would seem inevitable, if these aesthetic bullies are to have their way, then there is no knowing how many fewer houses for people in need these people are demanding. I can say that this will be done over my dead body.</P>

      <P>This whole agitation has, I think, quite obviously been induced and conducted by fraud, falsehood, concealment and misrepresentation. As an example of this, I invite Deputies to read the leading article in the <i>Irish Times</i> of 6th February, 1970. I can find only one way to describe this particular article.  It is a tissue of untruths in regard to facts and of crass ignorance in regard to planning application procedures.  I have given the facts of this whole saga.  About two weeks previously this paper, in common with other dailies, had carried a large and expensive advertisement outlining the various steps that had occurred in the matter.  One would surely expect a paper which had taken such an active part in the agitation and such an active part in encouraging the breaking of the law and the confiscation of private property to have at least checked the veracity or otherwise of the statements as to facts that were made in the advertisement which they published and to have contradicted them if they were found to be wrong.  If they did check the veracity of the advertisement which they published it is obvious that they decided to ignore the facts established by their inquiries. The facts are as I have given them, <Col N="178" /> but I shall quote now from the article entitled &ldquo;Hume Street Again&rdquo;, which was published in the <i>Irish Times</i> on 6th February, 1970:</P>
      <P>In 1966, following representations from Dublin Corporation and voluntary bodies, planning permission to the Green Property Company was refused, and assurances were given by Mr. Gibbons, then Parliamentary Secretary, that the properties would only be developed in line with the Dublin plan.</P>
      <P>That short statement contains at least three falsehoods.  It also displays the complete ignorance of the writer with regard to the procedure for obtaining planning permission which he purports to be writing about.</P>
      <P>First of all neither Dublin Corporation nor any other planning authority makes representations about planning permission in their area.  In fact, it is to them that applications are made and by them decisions are given.  In this particular case it was by Dublin Corporation which, this paper said, made representations in 1966 that the 1966 decision in regard to these properties was made.  It is only in the event of an appeal that the matter comes before the Minister for Local Government and in this case, as I have already pointed out, there was no appeal.  We are told that voluntary bodies also made representations in 1966, but this again is untrue, Voluntary bodies or individuals may appeal against decisions on planning applications but that did not happen in this particular case.  The third falsehood is the statement that &ldquo;planning permission to the Green Property Company was refused&rdquo;.  This is blatantly untrue because planning permission was granted and nobody appealed against it.  As I have pointed out, these are all facts which were within the knowledge of the editor of the <i>Irish Times</i> but still we have these three falsehoods in this one short sentence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What happened in 1966 was, in fact, the reverse of what the Lord High Editor of the <i>Irish Times</i> has said. Application was made by the Green Property Company to Dublin Corporation for planning permission.  This fact was published, as I have said, probably in the <i>Irish Times</i> itself, and permission <Col N="179" /> was granted by Dublin Corporation, and no appeal was submitted to the Minister by voluntary bodies or anybody else.</P>
    <P>Further on the writer proclaims that there is a Dublin development plan and that this is one fact which sticks out like a sore thumb.  This again is untrue. Despite many years of great effort there is still not a Dublin development plan in existence.  A large number of objections to the latest draft development plan are still under consideration and some of them are, in fact, reported in the papers today.  In 1966 there was not even a draft development plan in existence.  Of course, this true fact, does not, as the editor of the <i>Irish Times</i> says, stick out like a sore thumb for the simple reason that the media of communication have deliberately concealed it.  The draft plan published afterwards, which has now been superseded, scheduling some of these buildings and recommending others for preservation was published by Dublin Corporation after they themselves had given permission for the demolition and redevelopment of some of the houses concerned and after this permission was confirmed and consolidated by the failure of any interested party, voluntary body or anyone else, to give the Minister the opportunity of remedying the mistake that the planning authority had made if, in fact, it was a mistake.</P>
    <P>Even this was not enough falsehood to cram into one article furthering this dishonest campaign.  The editor goes on to say :</P>
    <P>What was sinister was to discover the company actually demolishing the premises in anticipation of ownership.  To put it plainly: it would seem that the company has come to an understanding with the authorities and knows that it can proceed to speculate without risk at the expense of the city.</P>
    <P>This is a most deliberate and clearly malevolent falsehood.  The only houses there that are not in the ownership of the company are No. 1 Hume Street, which is owned by the State, and No. 46 St. Stephen's Green in which, while owned by the company, the State still has a short-term interest <Col N="180" /> expiring in 1980.  No attempt has been made to demolish either of these two houses and this dastardly allegation that the Government has made an arrangement for the company to permit demolition of their property in anticipation of ownership must be as definite a falsehood as was ever published by a newspaper.  It speaks eloquently of both the standards of the paper and the methods by which this whole matter has been misrepresented to the public. These are facts which the editor of the <i>Irish Times</i> could have verified if he was interested in the truth and should have verified since he himself had published an advertisement giving the facts a short time previously.  There is a clear indication in the article of his own lack of journalistic standards and a clear indication of a deliberate decision to resort to falsehood in order to promote thoroughly unjustifiable agitation.</P>
    <P>To sum up in this matter, I accept that there is a substantial body of opinion which would like to see as much as is feasible of Georgian Dublin retained and certainly sufficient to retain a sample of what Georgian Dublin looked like.  I accept that this is an important and enlightened body of opinion and I personally agree with their objective.  I accept also that these people have by now, when it is too late, decided that it is important to try to retain the structurally defective buildings at the corners of St. Stephen's Green and Hume Street, although the principal building in Hume Street itself, the hospital, is not a Georgian building at all.  I accept that they consider this to be sufficiently important to absorb capital resources which can only be provided at the expense of the housing and sanitary services programme.  I have no hesitation in giving it as my opinion that these people are in the minority, although they are an exceptionally vocal and articulate minority with access to the media of communication which other people have not got.  I am perfectly satisfied that the vast majority of people are not prepared to condone the diversion of a significant amount of the limited capital available for public purposes to this particular purpose, although the majority in this <Col N="181" /> case, as in the case of other issues such as whether or not they should be allowed to go about their business without interference and obstruction by every group of cranks who want to prevent them from doing so, have not got access to the media.  I reiterate that, while I am Minister for Local Government, and while available capital continues to be in comparatively short supply, none of it will be utilised in this way.</P>
    <P>Most Deputies who spoke dealt with the matter of housing which I would say is the principal and most vital activity of my Department.  It featured largely in my introductory statement. As I say, most Deputies devoted the major part of their contributions to this important subject.  Because of the tenor of the Opposition speeches on this topic I feel it necessary to make two brief categoric statements at the very outset.  First I want to say that the array of figures with regard to housing that I presented to this House a month ago on 11th February was not false or misleading.  As I said already, the figures were not imaginative; they were factual in every respect. They were accurate and they presented the factual position in the city and in the country as a whole.</P>
    <P>I put it beyond the capacity of the Opposition to deny with any sincerity that there has been genuine and continued progress in the matter of housing, that we have been building more houses and maintaining a higher level of reconstruction, repair and improvement works on existing houses than ever before in the history of the State and that, if we postulated an even higher level of building in this new decade we are starting on, our record as a Government, and especially during the past ten years, proves that when we set housing targets, however ambitious they may seem, we will achieve them. This is of course, because we do not operate in watertight compartments. We do not make the unpardonable and indeed criminal error of concentrating entirely on the spending Departments of the State to the neglect of the Departments whose responsibility it is to ensure that the capacity of the economy to continue to make possible large-scale and increasing expenditure.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="182" /> The second point is one which it should not be necessary for me to make but there have been positive and repeated assertions which I cannot ignore.  As emphatically as I can, therefore, I must refute one of the false statements made by Deputy Treacy, and echoed by Deputy FitzGerald and by a number of other Deputies, that in regard to housing needs I have been complacent.  If Deputy Treacy had had sufficient interest in the subject of the debate to listen to my opening statement, or even to read the first few pages of it, he would be aware that I made it clear at the very outset that I did not want anyone to think I was satisfied with progress and also that I was fully conscious of the continuing need to maintain the programme of building in order to eliminate our legacy of overcrowding and of unfit housing.</P>
    <P>How that can be described as complacency I do not know but, in case anybody might be misled by this assertion. I want to say that no Member of this House is more conscious than I am of the true extent, the nature and the consequences of the present housing needs, and no one is or will be less complacent than I until we are in sight of the Government's primary housing objective as stated in the White Paper published last year, which is to ensure that, as far as the resources of the economy permit, every family can obtain a house of good standard at a price or rent they can afford.  I regard this as an absolute and very urgent priority to such a degree that I am prepared to accept the unpopularity of severely limiting expenditure on such eminently desirable things as swimming pools and other amenities.</P>
    <P>Let me make this as clear as I can. I regard the housing situation here and particularly in this rapidly expanding city as of very serious proportions.  I regard it as justifying a major effort by the community to grapple with it but, at the same time, it is no more than factual to say that, serious as the situation is, and urgent as it is, it is a much improved situation.  It is this fact&mdash;the fact that it is improved and improving&mdash;that is annoying the Opposition.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="183" /> The intention in introducing the Supplementary Estimate was to afford the Dáil an opportunity to discuss the recent and current operations of the Department of Local Government. This was the framework of my opening statement.  I had hoped that Deputies would also address their attention to what is happening and what, in their view, should be the future direction of the Department of Local Government.  I regret therefore that one protracted contribution to the debate will compel me to follow the example of the Deputy concerned and hark back over 20 years to correct the impression of events presented to the House by Deputy FitzGerald.</P>
    <P>Deputy FitzGerald suddenly discovered&mdash;and only lately so far as I can see; possibly it was some of his students who discovered it for him&mdash;that there was a census in 1966 and that it contained some lovely sets of figures for him to play with.  His excitement at this discovery I can only compare with that of Keats on looking into Chapman's Homer when he felt like some watcher of the skies when a new planet swims into his ken.  Unlike stout Cortez and his men, Deputy FitzGerald did not remain silent upon a peak in Darien.  Instead, his reaction was to burst into a flood of rhetoric liberally interspersed with selective figures from this census which he suddenly discovered.</P>
    <P>The fact is that I explained all this on the last Estimate debate two years ago.  Admittedly Deputy FitzGerald was not here then but, still, it is on the records of the House.  I did not specifically relate it to the census report but I explained the position.  I explained how it arose and how it was dealt with.  I could at any time have given him this information with regard to the situation which existed up to four years ago and which he has suddenly discovered to his great joy.</P>
    <P>My predecessor.  Deputy Blaney, now Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, could have given it to him, because it was the realisation of the situation that was developing, the reasons for which I will soon show, that prompted the White Paper which was issued by Deputy Blaney in 1964 and which was, <Col N="184" /> of course, prepared in 1963 when this situation, which Deputy FitzGerald has now discovered four years after it has disappeared, was developing.  It was this realisation that prompted the White Paper in 1964.  It was this realisation that prompted the expansion of the scope of the National Building Agency which had been set up a year or two previously and which prompted the initiation of the Ballymun scheme in order to supplement the maximum output of Dublin Corporation.</P>
    <P>Deputy FitzGerald as we now know &mdash;and as most people know&mdash;is fascinated by figures almost I think to the extent of being mesmerised into believing that they substantiate his own preconceived ideas.  He sees them as columns of lovely little black digits which, if no one is allowed to contradict him&mdash;as when he has sole access to the columns of some of the newspapers&mdash;can be made to show whatever he likes.  He can come in here and talk about £360 million and, when it is pointed out to him that £36 million would be more like it, he says that is all a matter of the position of the decimal point: change the decimal point and it proves the same thing.  Of course it proves the same thing when you make it prove what you want to prove.  But here, unlike when he is writing in the newspapers, Deputy FitzGerald can be contradicted.  Figures have no meaning unless they are properly interpreted and unless they are associated with all the relevant considerations. There is no point in talking about so many thousands of houses unless one appreciates, what a house is and how it comes into being.  I will show clearly that when it comes to housing statistics Deputy FitzGerald is a complete and absolutely shameless fraud.  Being completely divorced from reality he sees these figures as something to be tossed around, to be juggled with, pick one here and there and use it to prove whatever he wants to prove.</P>
    <P>His whole contribution also displayed his abysmal ignorance of housing as a practical proposition.  I accept his ability to select appropriate figures to appear to substantiate an opinion already formed.  I accept he can juggle <Col N="185" /> with a set of out-of-date statistics in isolation from the other relevant facts without which they have no meaning. However, his trouble is that in acquiring his detailed knowledge of these selected statistics of situations that existed in the past, he neglects to acquire even a nodding acquaintance with current facts, and in the course of the veritable &ldquo;Niagara&rdquo; of numbers, aggregations, factors, totients, estimates, statistics and permutations which the Deputy cascaded upon the House, I gather that he proved to his own satisfaction, although his own published words are to the contrary, that house building was suddenly galvanised into action in 1948 with the advent of the first Coalition Government, that it burgeoned for three years, revived temporarily in 1954 for another three years, but since 1957 has never succeeded even in keeping pace with obsolescence and new family growth. This is, as far as I could gather, the proposition that Deputy FitzGerald tried to establish in all this torrent of figures he visited upon the House, and this is the proposition which I intend to disprove.</P>
    <P>We have a new <i>pons asinorum.</i> Starting off with the assumption that Coalition Government equals housing progress, he comes to the conclusion that Fianna Fáil administration equals inertia.  QED. Unfortunately it is necessary to disillusion this twentieth century Euclid.  Instead of concluding with QED this proposition of his should conclude with another phrase which is frequently employed by Euclid, the phrase &ldquo;which is absurd&rdquo;, and from which conclusion Euclid was wont to deduce that his original assumption was wrong.  Of course, Deputy FitzGerald's original assumption is as wrong as wrong could be, and it was on this original assumption that he based his manipulation of these figures.</P>
    <P>The fact of the matter is, as some of the Opposition Deputies actually admitted, that the houses completed in any three-year period are not an indication in themselves of the enterprise of the Government or the local authorities during that period; they are an indication of the activity of the previous three years.  As some Deputies admitted, it takes that long for a scheme, <Col N="186" /> which is initiated by the acquisition of a site, to come to fruition.  Therefore, the houses completed in a three-year period are really the measure of the initiatives that took place in the previous three-year period.</P>
    <P>I am unfortunately compelled to follow Deputy FitzGerald back over the 22 years that he travelled to produce his <i>pons asinorum</i>.  The Coalition Government took office in mid-February, 1948, and in the preceding month the Housing (Amendment) Act of 1948 became law, a measure which could be classed with the two other Fianna Fáil Acts of 1932 and 1966 as the most important pieces of housing legislation since the State was established. When the Act came into operation, Mr. Seán MacEntee, as Minister for Local Government, issued a White Paper on housing reviewing past operations and setting out the Government's programme for 100,000 houses over the subsequent ten years.  The spadework for that programme had been carefully done before the White Paper was issued, and the Housing Act of 1948 passed by the Fianna Fáil Government completed the preparation.</P>
    <P>In March, 1948, the Coalition Government found themselves in the fortunate position of having local authority schemes in progress comprising 3,840 houses and schemes authorised or being prepared for a further 13,094 dwellings.  A major programme of land acquisition had been organised by the outgoing administration and the stage was set for a steady run of house building to deal with current and anticipated needs.  On the private housing side the unprecedentedly generous grants provided under the 1948 Act were certain to prompt a big upsurge in building by private enterprise.</P>
    <P>This was beyond any shadow of a doubt Fianna Fáil work, not Coalition work.  The only credit that the Coalition can claim is that, unlike the pre-parations that were made at that time for economic expansion, which they scrapped when they came in, they refrained from interfering with Mr. Seán MacEntee's housing programme except, of course, by neglecting to provide for its continuity and, in particular, by neglecting to ensure that the economy <Col N="187" /> of the country would be capable of supporting it.</P>
    <P>Contrast this with the position we were left in March, 1957.  We were left with the job of salvaging the economy after the second era of Coalition Government, and I do not think at this stage there is any need for me to go into any details about that, I have an idea that the House has heard my former gracious colleague, Deputy P.J. Burke, putting the facts very concisely when he said in this House: &ldquo;There wasn't the price of a bag of cement left.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Contrasted with the 17,000 houses which were in progress or in the pipeline in 1948, only 5,524 houses were in progress or in tender when the Coalition finally departed in disarray.  The reserve of sites for future development had been run down and the building industry had been demoralised and sadly depleted by many bankruptcies, by the stop-go policies of the outgoing administration.  Building workers, some of whom had never known a day's unemployment in their lives, had to emigrate in despair, so that quite apart from the non-availability of finance and sites, building capacity in the country itself, both from the point of view of management and organisational expertise and of skilled workers, was at its lowest ebb.</P>
    <P>As regards houses actually in progress, the contractors were living from hand to mouth unable to get payments when they were due from local authorities. I remember, as a member of Dublin Corporation, that the corporation did not know, from day to day or week to week whether they would be able to meet their commitments under schemes actually in progress. Not only was the building industry demoralised but local authorities themselves were in the same condition. Housing production in the three or four years subsequent to 1957 is clearly the result of the ineptitude and neglect of the Coalition Government and it was this that was mainly responsible for the position that began to develop rapidly when the First Programme for Economic Expansion got under way and halted the unprecedented wave of <Col N="188" /> emigration that marked the last period of the Coalition Government, because the first effect of the First Programme made itself felt before it was possible to reverse the disastrous trend of the last crash housing programme we had here.</P>
    <P>Deputy FitzGerald spoke at some length about the capital implications of stepping up the present housing programme.  Again he reminded us of what happened in 1948-51.  I think, for a man with the Deputy's background. this is playing politics with a vengeance but, since he insists, let us look at what happened in 1948-51 from this point of view.  The Budget introduced by Mr. McGilligan in 1948 had to produce a total of £750,000 for the Local Loans Fund in 1948-49.  It provided £4 million for the ESB, £1 million for telephone development and £800,000 for Bord na Móna.  As Minister for Finance, he was in a position to tap a huge accumulated reservoir of war-time savings with national loans over-subscribed at a 3 per cent issue rate. In addition, Marshall Aid was available to him.</P>
    <P>The situation was completely different from that now applying where the pool available for capital works is severly limited and the State must find its capital requirements for housing and other forms of investment on a highly competitive market, internationally as well as nationally. Deputies opposite have argued that this is not necessarily so.  Deputy Dr. O'Donovan says that all we need do is tell the banks to write up their books by £100 million and to take it from them at 1 per cent interest.  I do not think it is necessary to take that kind of advice seriously.</P>
    <P>Added to these difficulties there is rising demand for more money for other vital services.  This year there is £23 million for planes and airport development, £20 million for the ESB, £7.5 million for telephones, £10 million for industrial and agricultural credit, £7 million for railways and shipping on top of approximately £37 million for local government services.  It is unrealistic and dishonest in this context to contrast the capital situation now with that in 1948 when, in fact, the <Col N="189" /> most favourable capital climate that ever existed here was so shamefully wasted by the Coalition Government.</P>
    <P>I regret that it should be necessary for me to hark back to past events in this way but Deputy FitzGerald's misrepresentations of the situation could not appear to be conceded by default.  While I have no wish to follow the Deputy so far back or to emulate his statistical display or to repeat at any length the telling facts and figures of housing progress with which I introduced this Supplementary Estimate, at the same time I intend to show that the Deputy is a fraudulent statistician.  Before doing so I want to state briefly a few important details.</P>
    <P>Since the last war about 200,000 private and local authority houses have been built and 195,000 grants have been paid to persons reconstructing existing houses or installing water supply and sewerage.  These output figures must be viewed in relation to a total national housing stock of 687,000 dwellings.  The cost of this has been over £500 million.  If you like to take a wider view, the number of dwellings erected since 1st April, 1933, to 31st March, 1969, was 284,776, which comprised 149,385 private and 135,391 local authority dwellings.  The number of dwellings reconstructed in the same period was 171,015, giving a total of 445,791 houses.  This is an indication of quite a major effort having been made over that period to improve the housing situation and reasonable progress was made in that regard.</P>
    <P>In this financial year 1969-70 it is estimated that 13,500 dwellings will be erected, 9,000 private and about 4,500 local authority dwellings and that 8,500 dwellings will be reconstructed, so that the total of new and reconstructed houses to the end of the financial year will be 477,790.  This gives an average of 13,270 houses built and improved per annum over a period of 36 years which includes 30 years of Fianna Fáil Government, an economic war and a world war and, worse still, it includes two periods of Coalition Government.</P>
    <P>Now, as I have shown, in the present <Col N="190" /> financial year the rate of production of new houses and reconstructing existing houses has risen to a total of 22,000 approximately.  The Opposition, particularly when making international comparisons, ignore the contribution made by the reconstruction of houses which is a very valuable one and a prudent conservation of housing stock which is expensive to build up. In the period since the last war more than £120 million has also been paid in subsidy for private and local authority housing to keep down rents or prices.  These subsidies from central and local taxation now cost about £13.4 million per annum.  This represents a great effort by a country with our level of income <i>per capita.</i></P>
    <P>Over the last three years local authority housing output has exceeded 4,000 dwellings annually and it rose above 4,600 last year.  Completions in the present year will be at least as high. The cost this year will be well over £17 million including expenditure on land acquisition.  As I explained, an expansion of local authority housing output is conditioned only by the availability of finance.  It is not possible to get additional capital for the purpose without taking it from other essential services.  The same position obtains in regard to men and materials.  It is obvious that we must maximise our return from the expenditure possible and the available resources of manpower and material.</P>
    <P>The primary need at present is to achieve and maintain a steady and planned increase in building output, avoiding the dangers inherent in a sudden burst of activity, followed inevitably by a period of depression when resources are exhausted.  It is clear that this Government have succeeded in doing this.  If I may use a colloquial expression, it has driven the Opposition Deputies &ldquo;up the wall&rdquo; and inspired them with a determination to try to lure us into repeating their mistakes.  I can assure them this will fail.  The Government will ensure that housing maintains its high priority in the allocation of any additional resources which may become available as the economy expands. What is needed is a continuation of <Col N="191" /> the steady and planned expansion of housing which has been achieved annually, with one minor exception when there was a slight reduction due to financial circumstances.  It is essential that the stop-go performance that marked the two Coalition interventions be eliminated.  One of the major factors bedevelling efficiency in the building industry has been this recurrence of booms and slumps.  The declaration of a housing emergency and the sudden and unnecessary diversion to house building of resources genuinely needed in other essential sectors would merely force up further the present high level of housing costs.  It would cripple the housing programme in a relatively short time by a shortage of such essential services as water supplies, sewerage schemes and roads.</P>
    <P>Other important sectors of the economy would be seriously affected also by the diversion to housing of resources urgently required elsewhere. Industrial development would be ham-strung and, in turn, manpower and other material resources would be gravely affected.  It was recommended by the Labour Party that there be a declaration of a housing crisis and a national emergency directing men and material into housing, together with the consequential measures demanded by the Labour Party Deputies.  Such a policy would merely aggravate this feature of stop-go which has bedevilled housing progress in the past and which has in the last year or two caused overheating of the building industry in certain areas and a general upsurge in tender prices for local authority housing schemes.  It would bring about a far greater slump in a relatively short time than has ever been experienced before through the cutting off of resources for other vital areas of the economy and the saturation of housing demand leading to a drastic curtailment of output.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Connell amended that to 12 months and at least he did not have the temerity to come in and repeat his assertion again. <Col N="192" /> However, the proposal is undemocratic and alien to our traditions.  The suggestion to direct labour is typical of the new element that has gained control, despite all efforts of the traditional Labour Party, and it could operate only in the context of forced labour camps as in eastern European communist dictatorships.  It is a policy that was rejected by the people of the country last June and has been specifically rejected in the last week by the voters in the Dublin South West constituency.</P>
      <P>It is quite clear that Deputy FitzGerald has not got the foggiest idea of how to interpret figures.  He was dealing with the intercensal period between 1956-61.  That was a time in which there was low output of houses, except for 1956, when the effects of Fianna Fáil initiatives in the previous period had not been completely dissipated and when the finances of the State were only commencing to disintegrate.  The low output of houses tended to cause overcrowding but we must remember we then had the highest ever rate of emigration.  It was at a rate of 100,000 people&mdash;a figure it had never previously nor has it since reached.  In the period 1954-57 we had a comparatively high number of completions of houses because of the schemes that took place in the period of the Fianna Fáil Government from 1951-54.</P>
      <P>In the intercensal period 1956-61, which is the preceding period of 1961-66 on which Deputy FitzGerald based his case, the circumstances I have mentioned obtained.  We also had in the 1956-61 period a very low percentage increase in the population of Dublin city and county: an increase of 1.9 per cent, which was one of the lowest for a very long time.  It must be obvious in view of the fact that the Programme for Economic Expansion was initiated in 1959, and that the trend was reversed from then onwards, that for part of that period the population of Dublin city and county was actually decreasing.  This same decrease occurred also in the rest of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This was the Coalition achievement: the housing deficiency was solved in this way by the high rate of emigration, in addition to the fact that there <Col N="193" /> had been a high level of completions of houses in the previous period.  However, as anyone with any contact whatever with the situation in Dublin will know, the housing deficiency was never solved.  We had this position of houses becoming available while the population of Dublin city and county was actually decreasing.</P>
    <P>We had, admittedly, a comparatively small housing output in the years following the Coalition's neglect of the acquisition of sites and their neglect to take care of the economy and finances of the country.  We also had a high rate of vacancies in local authority dwellings in Dublin which reached a level of 1,605 in 1956-57 combined with a static population.  Therefore, in this intercensal period 1956-61 as a result of all these factors we had some reduction of overcrowding.  However, this was achieved by a method not acceptable to the Fianna Fáil Government but it is one typical of Fine Gael.</P>
    <P>In 1959 the Programme for Economic Expansion was introduced.  Fianna Fáil had succeeded in restoring the economy to the stage that it was possible to introduce such a programme and this had started to develop by 1961.  In the period 1961-66, which is the period Deputy FitzGerald chose as the basis for his thesis in contrast to the previous intercensal period, we had the highest ever rate of increase&mdash;10.8 per cent, almost 11 per cent&mdash;in the population of Dublin city and county. It must be obvious to anybody who opens his eyes, or who does not keep them always glued to rows of figures in books, that this rate of increase is still continuing in the Dublin area.  With this high level of increase in population, with people coming back, with the low level of vacancies occurring in local authority housing in Dublin, combined with the fact that the new Fianna Fáil housing drive was only beginning to gather momentum after the Coalition disaster, naturally enough, in that period, the figures would show an increase in overcrowding.</P>
    <P>Here I must pause to give Deputy FitzGerald a short informative course on the practical provision of housing. <Col N="194" /> To Deputy FitzGerald housing is just a row of figures; to anyone actually dealing with the problem housing consists of structures built of bricks and mortar.  The housing process, as I pointed out earlier, involves some three or four years of hard work and planning. The first essential is to have a serviced site.  The implementation of a housing programme involves hard slogging beginning with the measurement of the requirements, decisions on programmes and, above all&mdash;this is a thing that is ignored very often by the Opposition &mdash; the mobilisation of finance, the acquisition of land, the development of that land, the designing of the houses, the drawing up of plans, the drawing up of specifications and contract documents both for site development and for the actual building of the houses.  It involves the invitation of tenders and the examination of of those tenders, the completion of preliminaries to the signing of the contract, the actual building work and its supervision.  All this has to be done before houses can be completed.</P>
    <P>It must be obvious then that the houses constructed in the period 1954-57 must have been planned and that a large part of the preliminary work in respect of them must have been done in the previous period and the construction in that period really represents the initiatives under the Fianna Fáil régime from 1951 to 1954.  Similarly, the fact that, even when the finances of the State were restored, it took some time to get the housing drive off the ground after the Coalition disaster is an indication that not alone were the finances allowed to deteriorate, not alone was the building industry decimated by the disaster that came upon it but, in addition, all the preliminary work necessary to get a housing scheme off the ground had also been neglected and the achievement, therefore, with regard to housing in the years 1957 to 1961 is a measure of the neglect that took place in the Coalition period, alleviated by the earlier initiative of Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>Another circumstance to which some Opposition Deputies referred and which, I think, in all charity they should bring to the notice of Deputy <Col N="195" /> FitzGerald, if he listens to anybody even in his own Party, and there are some in his own Party who, unlike him, have had practical experience, is the fact that when a disaster like 1956-57 strikes not alone is the industry decimated and so on and actual building capacity reduced, but local authorities themselves lose confidence and the restoration of that confidence is a slow process because local authorities get into the position of realising that demands just cannot be met.</P>
    <P>In addition to all that, here in Dublin city there was the inexplicable misinterpretation by Dublin Corporation, which then, as in its latest manifestations, had a Coalition majority, of the housing situation in the city.  Anybody who had any close contact with the people must have known that even with the high rate of vacancies, even with the mass emigration and even though the population was actually decreasing for part of the period, the housing situation was not solved but, because Dublin Corporation found it such a slow process to relet the many houses that were being returned to them, or vacated by tenants, they interpreted that position as an indication that the housing problem had at last been solved by this method of emigration.</P>
    <P>The result was that the Fianna Fáil Government had to start the housing programme, particularly here in the City of Dublin, right from scratch, or, if I may put it this way, from behind scratch.  But the programme gradually got going and this can be shown by the figures since 1961.  It could not have been got going any earlier.  The number of houses completed in the country as a whole in 1961-62 was 5,976; in the next financial year, 1962-63, it rose to 7,217; the next year, 1963-64, it was 7,831; in the next year, 1964-65, the figure rose to 9,679; in the next year, 1965-66, the figure rose to 11,255; in 1966-67, there was, as I said, a slight fall due to the international capital situation and the figure of houses completed in that year was 10,984, but there was an immediate resumption in 1967-68 of the upward trend and the figure rose to 12,017 and, in the last financial year, 1968-69, the output increased <Col N="196" /> to 13,033.  In addition to that, in the first threequarters of the financial year 1968-69, the output was 8,980; in the first threequarters of the current financial year the output was 9,930.  It is clear from these figures that there has been a continuous increase in the rate of building ever since the housing programme recovered from the collapse it suffered under the Coalition Government and this, of course, has had the effect of changing the outdated situation on which Deputy FitzGerald based his case here.</P>
    <P>As I said, we do not have to wait for Deputy FitzGerald to discover the existence of the census for the period 1961-66 in order to know what the situation was.  My predecessor, Deputy Neil Blaney, saw that the maximum effort of the local authorities here in Dublin could not cope with the combined effect of our very rapidly increasing population and of the Coalition neglect.  This position was accentuated by the collapse of a number of Georgian houses here in the city and the stringent steps taken by Dublin Corporation to ensure that there would not be any more fatalities as a result of houses collapsing upon their occupants.</P>
    <P>Deputy Blaney saw that the maximum effort of the corporation could not cope with this.  He had an assessment of the situation made and published a White Paper in 1964 setting what was then a very ambitious target of reaching 12,000 to 14,000 new houses a year by 1970.  The target has been achieved since then.  Deputy Blaney saw that the corporation could not cope with the problem, even with their best possible efforts, so he expanded the scope of the National Building Agency and embarked on the huge Ballymun project, which was additional to the maximum output of the corporation.  It is no wonder that Deputy Dr. FitzGerald stopped his discourse at 1966, which is four years ago.  This Deputy lives continuously in the past.  He lives with out-of-date statistics instead of the current facts. That is why he stopped at 1966. Apparently the Deputy is unable to appreciate the evidence of the substantial effort that is being made all <Col N="197" /> around him and the evidence of an improvement in the situation.  This situation is still far from satisfactory.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that that is why he has not appeared since the by-election. He must be working out still what the verdict was in South-West Dublin although the returning officer had not any such difficulty after he had gone through all the manipulations of the votes.  He declared the result and that result was evidenced here yesterday when a new Deputy entered this House.  The professors are still apparently working out their philosophical calculations to try to find out who won the election.</P>
      <P>The position is not as it was between 1961 and 1966.  While it is not by any means acceptable it is better than it has been at any time in the history of the State.  In so far as Dublin Corporation are concerned, there has been a substantial decline in the total number of applications on hands.  Despite the fact that the list is three years old and has not been revised in that time there is a substantial decline in the total number of applications.  Needless to say, when the list has been compiled the only way in which names are removed from it is when people are housed by the housing authority themselves.  Other people who provide their own housing still remain on the list because the corporation have no means of knowing that they are no longer seeking housing accommodation from them.  Despite that fact, and despite the rapid increase in the population of Dublin city and county, and also despite the fact that people are now getting married at a younger age in general, the total number of applications on hands in Dublin Corporation has substantially decreased.  While the situation is by no means satisfactory, it has improved. There is still need for the maximum possible effort which the community can make.  The Government have shown in the White Paper, <i>Housing in the Seventies</i>, how they intend to tackle the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="198" /> Some of Deputy Dr. FitzGerald's more down-to-earth colleagues, who have contact with their constituents, and who think of people and their conditions now rather than figures in a book referring to conditions which existed four years ago and who know about the improved position should acquaint Deputy Dr. FitzGerald with some of the facts.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dr. FitzGerald went on, having dealt in a selective way with the last census and having ignored the relevant considerations without which the figures cannot be interpreted, to deal with the White Paper and asked a number of questions which, candidly, I find rather disturbing.  The Deputy asked why was the figure of 55,500 households living at a density of two or more persons per room reduced to 15,000 households for the purpose of assessing housing needs.  The fact that a university professor, who is being paid a high salary to teach students and train them for the future, should ask such a stupid question is, to say the least of it, rather disturbing.  The Deputy tries to make out that, because there were 55,500 families in 1966 living in dwellings with an occupancy rate of two or more persons per room, this number of dwellings is needed for the purpose of relieving overcrowding, apart from any other reason.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to be rude but it is hard to describe such stupidity and ignorance politely.  This is obviously an absurd contention.  Surely even Deputy Dr. FitzGerald, divorced from real life as he is, must appreciate that if a dwelling is provided for a family living in overcrowded conditions then the overcrowded dwelling, vacated by that family, is available for occupation by another family?  If the 55,500 households mentioned in the White Paper were all families living in dwellings housing one family only, then if all these dwellings are to be replaced and 55,500 new dwellings are to be provided for these overcrowded families, as the Deputy claims is necessary, surely he can see there would be 55,500 dwellings vacant and available to meet other housing needs?  If it is maintained that there are 55,500 houses needed to relieve overcrowding, as the <Col N="199" /> logical corollary this number of dwellings must be deducted from the estimates of needs under other headings. Apparently, what Dr. Deputy FitzGerald wants to do is to rehouse these 55,500 families and simply leave the dwellings which they vacate vacant. This is an extraordinary method of meeting housing needs.  If, on the other hand, overcrowding arises from two families living in one dwelling, then only one new house is required for each two families.</P>
    <P>In fact, the truth is obviously a combination of the two situations.  There are some families who have houses which are too small for them, but these houses are suitable for other families. There are cases of two families in one house where the housing of one family eliminates two cases of overcrowding and not one.  I cannot describe Deputy Dr. FitzGerald's interpretation very politely.  It could only be made by someone who deals with figures without any effort to relate them to reality. It is recognised internationally that the problem of assessing needs of families living in overcrowded conditions is a very difficult one.</P>
    <P>I admit that it is a difficult one.  In most cases the families in these dwellings do not want to leave them and would not take rehousing if it was offered to them, so that simply building more houses will not solve this kind of problem.  It is recognised that the figure we took in the White Paper of 15,000 as representing net needs from overcrowding is a somewhat arbitrary one, but on this point it is recognised everywhere that assessing housing needs is not and cannot be an exact science, some arbitrary assumptions have to be made and all the assumptions in the White Paper are clearly reasonable ones.</P>
    <P>The reference in the White Paper to the building of additional rooms to houses, which Deputy FitzGerald also criticised, was not intended to suggest there should be a special plan or programme for this purpose.  It was simply a recognition that in many cases the building of extra rooms was the only way in which the overcrowding of <Col N="200" /> rooms could be solved since the families concerned would not be interested in accepting rehousing elsewhere. Of course, while there may not be an actual scheme or programme for this type of work there are State and supplementary grants available for building extra rooms to houses as well as State grants to local authorities for the carrying out of improvements such as building extra rooms to local authority houses.  These grants are being paid at the rate of 10,000 a year so that over the past five years about 50,000 houses have been reconstructed with this form of aid from the State.  Somebody in Fine Gael who knows something about local government should tell Deputy FitzGerald about this work which is going on.</P>
    <P>The Deputy went on to refer to the improvement in the density of occupation of houses which has occurred throughout the life of the State.  He omitted to mention that the improvement which occurred in the 'fifties, particularly in the late 'fifties, was facilitated by the very steep emigration to which I have referred and that some improvement was maintained during 1961-66 notwithstanding the fact that emigration fell in that period to less than half its former level. Between 1961 and 1966 the number of people living in a density of less than three per room increased by 5.3 per cent and the number of two or more per room fell by 3 per cent.</P>
    <P>Another question regarding the estimates made in the White Paper which Deputy FitzGerald asked was why the figure of 24,600 households comprising more than one family unit was reduced to 10,000 for assessing accumulated housing needs.  Anybody who knows anything about the structure of society here will know that the fact that there are a number of households comprising more that one family unit does not mean that houses are needed for all these households.  As indicated in the White Paper the total of 24,600 with more than one family unit includes about 10,000 households engaged in agriculture.  Of this 10,000 over 8,500 are either farmers, farmers' relatives or farm managers and it is reasonable to assume that very few in these categories are living involuntarily as two <Col N="201" /> families in one household and that in a very high proportion of cases there is no desire or need to have a second dwelling provided.  There are cases such as an old couple living with a married son or daughter, or a widowed mother living with a married son or daughter and in these cases there is neither the need nor the desire for new houses.  A further 1,100 of the 24,600 are in the socio-economic groups, higher professional, lower professional and employers and managers and in this case also it is likely that there is very little of the sharing which is involuntary. This leaves about 13,500 out of a total of 24,600.  Obviously all of the families living in these 13,500 dwellings do not want dwellings of their own.  As I said in many cases there would be parents living with married sons or daughters.  This is borne out by the fact that there was a total of 22,650 persons aged 65 and over living in these 24,600 households with more than one family unit.  Taking all these factors into account the estimate of 10,000 for accumulated need seems quite reasonable.  It may be up or down by some margin but the Deputy has not produced any evidence either way and obviously the estimate is a reasonable one.</P>
    <P>In further criticism of the White Paper Deputy FitzGerald went on to say that the estimate for annual losses of dwellings was not in accordance with international practice and that it was too low.  Obviously Deputy FitzGerald is not familiar with the statistics for annual average losses of dwellings stock for other countries. Figures were given in a document issued by the Economic Commission for Europe in April, 1967, showing the annual loss rate for a total of 22 countries.  Two countries in the table have annual loss rates of more than 1 per cent; three countries, including Ireland, have annual loss rate between 0.8 and 1 per cent and 17 countries have an annual loss rate of 0.6 per cent or lower.  I wonder if the Deputy would suggest that on the basis of these figures the estimate of 0.9 in the White Paper is unduly low.  He also said that the figure of 6,000 dwellings a year which the White Paper gives as the prospective need for annual replacement <Col N="202" /> of dwellings lost from the housing stock is too low and should be about 7,000.  However, he has no evidence on which to base this other than the Government White Paper of 1964.  This, however, does not deter him from categorically saying that the estimate of 6,000 should be rejected. He says that the period from 1961 to 1966 is not a proper period to take for assessing replacement needs because people had to go on living in unfit or abandoned houses during this period.  He does not seem to appreciate that it was during this period that Dublin Corporation conducted a most vigorous campaign in eliminating dangerous dwellings.  Here again, could some kind member of Fine Gael tell the Deputy some of the facts of life?  Surely he has some friends who will save him from himself?</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Deputy does not appreciate that 35,000 unfit dwellings are included in the estimate of accumulated needs and that these are treated as separate from the estimate of 6,000 given for prospective replacement needs.  Here again Deputy FitzGerald in his over-anxiety to display his dexterity with figures displays even more clearly his complete ignorance of the reality of the world around him and of the proper considerations to be adverted to in interpreting figures.  I do not know why I should go on at all because Deputy FitzGerald's ignorance about housing is about the most perfect thing I have ever come across.  The fact is that he just does not know what he is talking about, but of course that is no obstacle to him and he just goes on talking anyway.</P>
    <P>It was not enough for the Deputy to criticise those estimates in the White Paper for he also comes out with the statement that the White Paper's assessment of needs to meet increases in new households was much too low.  Elsewhere in his contribution the Deputy said that the White Paper was clear and simple and that it was written for children.  I may say it was produced in this way quite deliberately but nevertheless I am afraid Deputy FitzGerald has missed some of the points in it very badly.  I presume in saying that it was written for children he meant children who could read, national school <Col N="203" /> children.  As far as Deputy FitzGerald is concerned obviously we aimed too high and we should have made it intelligible at kindergarten level.</P>
    <P>He has missed the point again on the question of assessing housing needs arising from increases in the number of married couples.  First of all, he gives an incorrect figure when he says that there were 14,900 marriages a year, on average, during the period from 1961 to 1966.  Some of his students would be rapped on the knuckles for this simple arithmethical error.  In fact, the annual average number of marriages during this period was just over 16,000. He then quotes figures for the likely number of marriages in 1969 and subsequent years but conveniently does not give an average for the intercensal period, which runs roughly from 1966 to 1970, inclusive.  I will remedy his deficiency by giving this figure.</P>
    <P>The average annual number of marriages during the current intercensal period will be about 18,900.  This is about 3,000 more than the corresponding average for the 1961 to 1966 intercensal period allowing for the fact&mdash; made available to us in the report of the registrar of births, deaths and marriages&mdash;that roughly one in eight of all newly married couples emigrate each year, the effective increase in married couples in the 1966 to 1970 period compared with the 1961 to 1965 inclusive period is only about 2,500.  In other words, it is less than half the increase which Deputy FitzGerald managed to produce by manipulating figures in such a way as to compare the average for the whole period from 1961 to 1965, inclusive, with the total for the last year in the period from 1966 to 1970.  I do not know what anyone can do with a Deputy who is either so stupid and ignorant or so dishonest as this.  I cannot help wondering whether I am being foolish in taking him seriously at all, but I do say that it would naturally make anybody worry about his students.</P>
    <P>For the benefit of the Deputy perhaps I should explain that every extra married couple living in the country does not require the provision of an <Col N="204" /> extra dwelling.  Often, one or other of a couple getting married has a dwelling already or, if not, one or both of them may vacate a dwelling which becomes available for somebody else.  In both these cases an extra dwelling does not have to be added to the housing stock because of the marriage.  If the Deputy reads the White Paper carefully he will see that the figure of 4,400 quoted therein at page seven relates specifically to the increase in married couples between 1961 and 1966 and not to housing requirements.  On the other hand, the estimate of 5,000 for the 1966-67 period is specifically stated to be an estimate of housing requirements, which is a completely different thing.  This estimate of 5,000 is, in fact, some 2,000 above the corresponding average for housing requirements for extra married couples in the period from 1961 to 1966 and is ample to meet the housing requirements of the extra 2,500 married couples to which I referred earlier.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I might put it a bit more simply, simply enough for a child and, I am presumptuous enough to hope, even simply enough for Deputy FitzGerald.  As the Deputy said, the number of marriages taking place each year is going up more or less by 1,000 a year.  Over a five year period this gives a total increase in marriages of about 15,000 or an average of 3,000 a year.  When allowance is made for the number of couples that emigrate after marriage or that will not require extra dwellings the effective need becomes about 2,000 dwellings a year and this is in line with the projections made in the White Paper.</P>
    <P>The Deputy referred to a footnote in the White Paper on headship rates and said that the calculation referred to is not explained at all Maybe I should explain this to the Deputy because headship rates are recognised internationally as being, together with the basis of increases in married couples that I have already dealt with, the most reliable means of calculating housing needs arising from increases in households. In estimating needs on the basis of headship one looks at the proportions of persons of both sexes in different age groups who are heads of <Col N="205" /> households at different census dates, for example in 1961 and 1966, and applies these percentages, duly adjusted to take account of trends as revealed at the two censuses, to the population projected for whatever year one is trying to assess housing requirements. This was done in my Department using the detailed population projections prepared by the Central Statistics Office for the Third Programme and the results obtained backed up the separate figures made on the basis of married couples.  Other projections made, for example, by at least two independent experts also backed up the projections made in the White Paper.</P>
    <P>I want to refute categorically, therefore, the Deputy's assertion made on the basis of skilfully, if unscrupulously, manipulated figures that the White Paper's estimate of housing requirements represents either a basic miscalculation or an attempt to mislead. I am satisfied that the estimates are realistic and honest.  I think I have shown that every figure the Deputy tried to produce to disprove the White Paper was based either on a lack of knowledge of the situation or was a simple attempt to manipulate the figures so as to give a false result.</P>
    <P>It is hard to know where to start in dealing generally with housing.  Somebody referred to the fact that Deputy Dr. O'Connell challenged me sometime ago to resign and that he would solve the housing situation in Dublin in six months, which he later, I think, amended to 12 months.  I do not know whether I should bother about that kind of so called challenge, but I should like to point out that the method of changing Ministerial responsibility for local government matters is very well established.  It is done by means of elections.  The people vote on the basis of proposals for the conduct of various aspects of the Government's affairs.  It is not yet 12 months since the people had that opportunity and had Deputy O'Connell's projections of what he could do as Minister for Local Government in regard to housing before them and they rejected them very decisively to the tune of 18 to 75 which has now been amended to 17 to <Col N="206" /> 76.  What Deputy O'Connell has to do if he wants the opportunity of carrying out this proposal of his to solve the housing situation in Dublin city in six or 12 months is to reverse those figures. That is all he has to do.  That is what happens in a democracy.  I am assuming, of course, that his own party have already decided to give this task to Deputy O'Connell.</P>
    <P>We had the proposals of the Labour Party, or some of the Labour Parties anyway, for the solving of the housing problem before the House by way of a Private Members' Motion some time ago.  In between the disorderly interruptions of the Coalition parties, whose plans to prevent me speaking on Private Members' Motions were partially frustrated at that time, I managed, I think, to indicate the tedious, expensive and laborious process of going about the provision of houses.  I have referred to it again today so I will not go into it again.</P>
    <P>I admitted on that occasion that I had not discovered the secret methods of these people, lay and clerical, who claim to be able to provide these houses by sitting in the gutter.  During the Labour Party's motion here this occult knowledge of how this can be done was still not divulged to me. However, until such time as I am shown how to build houses without the tedious, expensive and laborious processes that I have outlined, I must continue with these traditional methods which were found to be necessary when the two Coalition parties were in Government just as they are found to be necessary now.  I pointed out that a considerable time must elapse between the starting of the process and the completion of a housing scheme and that the date of completion of a housing scheme depends on the date of its initiation.  Therefore, completions up to 1960-61 are certainly the measure of Coalition initiations, whereas completions in the period 1954-57 are the measure of Fianna Fáil initiations in the previous three years.  There can be no doubt but that the improvement in this regard from 1960-61 onwards is totally to the credit of Fianna Fáil. This substantial and continuous improvement which is projected to <Col N="207" /> improve further up to the mid-1970s&mdash; we have set ourselves this ambitious target of housing &mdash; is what Fianna Fáil policy has produced and, more important, what we are continuing to produce.  This is what the people of the country, as a whole, clearly said last June just as the people of Dublin South-West said on Wednesday last what they want.  They do not want the type of crash programme advocated, they do not want the declaration of a housing emergency that is advocated by the Opposition which would produce the crash programme that they produced before.</P>
    <P>One thing on which I should like to be clear is this.  Is the theory that the availability of capital depends on the level of production in the country accepted or is it seriously contended that this is irrevelant and that, therefore, it is not necessary to ensure that capital will be made available for economic expansion if we are to continue with a housing programme at a high level?  I ask if the availability of capital for housing is only a matter of having the will to provide it as was maintained by some Deputies here would somebody tell me what happened to the Coalition Government in 1956-57?  Not merely did they neglect to acquire sites and so on and prepare plans, but existing schemes, both private and public, collapsed.  If the state of the economy, the balance of payments position and the availability of credit are irrelevant now why were they so very relevant then?  Why did not the two parties opposite, who have put themselves on record as saying that all it is necessary to do to solve the housing programme is to declare a state of emergency, declare a state of emergency in 1956-57 instead of running for cover and leaving the mess for Fianna Fáil to clear up?</P>
    <P>Deputy Dr. Browne says he is sick and tired of the excuse that the availability of capital is a limiting factor in regard to the provision of housing.  He says that capital is available but that it is being used for buildings other than workingclass houses.  He referred specifically to office buildings but I do not think that Deputy Dr. Browne or anybody <Col N="208" /> else can show any use of public money for this purpose.  He says that the provision of workingclass housing is the purpose for which capital should be used and that, therefore, there is not any shortage of capital.</P>
    <P>Of course, Deputy Dr. Browne, speaking on the Estimate for the Department of Education, can say that capital should be used for the building of schools and colleges and on the Estimate for the Department of Health, he can say it should be used for building hospitals and clinics.  Even when discussing the Estimate for the Department of Local Government, he advocated increased expenditure on many projects other than housing, for instance, on swimming pools, roads, and practically everything else that comes within the ambit of the Department of Local Government so that even he is obviously not prepared to divert the total capital available to this purpose, important as it is.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask Deputy Dr. Browne whether houses are the only constituent of the standard of living. Would he not agree that jobs for people are necessary also and is it not a wellknown fact that employment cannot continue to be available on a high level in modern conditions without continuing investment?  It must be obvious that the availability of capital is fundamentally related to production and that it cannot increase if production does not increase and that production cannot increase if all available capital is utilised for purely social purposes.  Factories are necessary and State investment in them in present circumstances is justified.  Without this type of investment it must be obvious that the housing programme could not continue at a high level.</P>
    <P>It should be clear, also, that to divert all public capital expenditure to housing or to hospitals or schools could only result in economic disaster and, in particular, in a disastrous crash of housing activity.  Deputy Dr. Browne did make the specific allegation that enormous sums were being spent on buildings other than workingclass housing.  The fact is that in the current financial year expenditure on building, reconstructing and subsidising housing <Col N="209" /> is estimated at more than £70 million and money being spent on the construction of offices and shops, in so far as it can be estimated, is of the order of £7 million.  This does not seem to be a disproportionate expenditure on offices and shops.  As far as I know, these buildings are constructed only because they are needed and in some cases, at any rate, the rates and taxes paid on these forms of construction help substantially to pay for the subsidies necessary to provide workingclass housing.  In any event, the money spent for these purposes is not public money and there is no way in a democratic State with a Constitution such as we have in which I, as Minister for Local Government, can confiscate this money and divert it to the production of local authority houses.</P>
    <P>I should like if some of the Deputies who talk about the expenditure of money on office blocks in particular would explain to me how I could get my hands on it.  I mentioned some time ago an office block which is the highest building in this city and which, as far as I know, cost £1 million.  I mentioned this figure of £1 million which was, some years ago, under the control of an organisation with thousands of members, some of whom were adequately housed and some of whom were not.</P>
    <P>I did not go into how a small group came to be in a position to decide how the money should be expended.  I did not speculate as to whether or not it was by the same disreputable means as those by which another fund of this organisation, in addition to the use of premises and the services of paid officials who are paid to do another job, was handed over to a political party that is not supported by the majority of the members.  This group&mdash;I suppose I could say prudently&mdash;decided to invest the money in the most financially profitable way rather than what both Deputy Dr. Browne and myself would regard as the most socially desirable way.  They opted for the prestige of a skyscraper office block, some of the accommodation of which is rented to a Government Department at a rent substantially higher than that charged for nearby office accommodation provided <Col N="210" /> by iniquitous speculators.  They opted for the ostentatious luxury of the highest building in Dublin rather than the less spectacular but I would imagine the more morally satisfying project of a modest housing scheme for their own members and I could not do anything about it.</P>
    <P>I pointed out that it was not possible for me to divert this money from luxurious and prestigious office building to housing for workers.  Since then Deputies will have seen a letter written to the newspapers on behalf of the organisation concerned.  Quite apart from the fact that the Constitution prohibits me from acquiring the money for the purposes of my Department, there is the apparently infinitely more serious obstacle that to spend money in this way that I suggested would be contrary to the rules of the organisation. This more august document would prevent the money being diverted to the provision of houses for workers even for their own members.  That just shows some of the difficulties involved in diverting the money being spent for this purpose to the purpose of providing houses.</P>
    <P>I know that many a worker who pays his income tax, his social insurance contributions and his union dues every week would be surprised to discover that the rules he and his fellow-workers made for their organisation require their weekly contributions to be invested in a towering palatial office block on the banks of the Liffey and absolutely prohibit this money being used for such a humdrum ignoble purpose as the provision of houses for workers.  I would imagine they would be even more surprised to discover that although the Constitution, the basic law of the State, can be altered by a referendum, this rule apparently could not be altered.</P>
    <P>There have been allegations that there has been a slowing down of housing and in particular a slowing down in local authority housing.  Those, of course, are completely contrary to the facts.  I have given the figures but I think in this context I should repeat them.  The figures for completions in 1966-67 were 10,984; 1967-68, 12,017 and 1968-69, 13,033.  As I say, the indications <Col N="211" /> are that there will be a further increase in the present financial year because for the first three-quarters of 1968-69 the completions were 8,980 and for the first three-quarters of this year the completions were 9,930 so we appear certain to have a further increase unless the cement strike can affect the figures for the last quarter. It is doubtful if even this will produce a result giving some credence to Deputy Treacy's allegation of a slowing down in housebuilding.</P>
    <P>This trend of increasing completions of houses applies to local authority dwellings as well as to house in general.  The number of dwellings provided by local authorities has been higher for each quarter of this year so far than for the corresponding quarter last year.  Understandably, of course, the numbers provided by the special NBA projects have been somewhat less because the Ballymun scheme is now completed.  Some quite unjustifiable allegations were made with regard to local authority housing.  It was alleged that this aspect was being neglected.  Of course, this is completely unsustainable.  If a greater proportion of private houses are being built this is a reflection of the improving all round standards of living, that more people are now in a position to aspire to owning their own houses.</P>
    <P>Here there was a very marked division of opinion in the Fine Gael Party in particular.  Deputy FitzGerald complained bitterly about the iniquitous Government forcing people to buy their own houses, whereas other Deputies, such as Deputy Clinton, Deputy Timmins and Deputy Esmonde, advocated increased emphasis on this manner of providing houses, increased emphasis on people providing their own houses.  Deputy Clinton went so far as to complain about the largescale acquisition of land by local authorities, thus depriving private builders of land on which to build speculative houses.</P>
    <P>I want to controvert the blatant falsehood which was aired by some Deputies opposite that in my opening speech I predicted and, in fact, tacitly accepted a fall in the number of local <Col N="212" /> authority houses to be built in the coming year.  I did not imply anything of the kind.  To scotch those falsehoods I want to restate the position that I described in my opening remarks which were recorded at columns 590 onwards of the Official Report of 11th February, 1970.  Anybody who wants to know the truth can see from the official record that I warned of the consequences of soaring wages and price increases relative to the normal increase in capital which could be provided by the Government for public services.  I pointed out that to maintain the present high level of housing output it would be necessary to find practical economies to close the gap between the new cost levels and the available capital.  I am satisfied that there is very substantial scope for such practical economies.  In the process it should not be necessary to affect the standard of workmanship or the level of amenities in local authority dwellings. Deputies Fitzpatrick and FitzGerald who adverted to this particular matter may be surprised to learn that I have agreed to the provision of central heating in quite a substantial number of local authority dwellings during recent months.  What I cannot agree to, however, are proposals by local authorities to accept altogether exorbitant prices for their new houses.</P>
    <P>Deputy Murphy criticised me for not releasing tenders for cottages in west Cork.  I could not in conscience approve of tenders well in excess of £3,000 for rural cottages in west Cork when cottages of similar standard are being provided for Kerry County Council, only 20 miles distant, for less than £2,000 apiece or in some cases under £1,900.  The facts about local authority housing are, of course, quite different from what the Opposition Deputies have been representing.</P>
    <P>The total number of local authority dwellings completed in the year ending 31st March last was 4,613, including 1,041 dwellings at Ballymun in the special NBA project, 80 in Cork and 86 in Limerick.  There were 317 dwellings provided by Dublin Corporation for tenant purchase. The total number of local authority houses provided in the <Col N="213" /> two previous years were 4,045 in 1967-68 and 4,079 in 1966-67.  Therefore it is quite obvious there is not a slowing down in the provision of local authority dwellings.</P>
    <P>In addition, at 31st March, 1969, work was in progress on 5,839 dwellings, of which 1,024 were being provided by the NBA in their special projects. The number of houses at tender stage was 4,351 and the number at planning stage was 7,789.  In addition, sites were available to local authorities for a further 18,336 houses and 12,689 sites were being acquired.  Therefore, in addition to the fact that the provision of local authority housing has been increasing, we have a substantial programme on hands both in houses at tender stage and houses at planning stage.  Also, sites have been made available. It is quite clear that unlike the position handed over on two occasions to incoming Fianna Fáil Governments by Coalition Governments, this time an incoming Fianna Fáil Government are taking over from an outgoing Fianna Fáil Government a substantial and adequate programme of housing by local authorities.</P>
    <P>During the year 1968-69, approval was given for the acceptance of tenders by local authorities and for direct labour work to the value of £9,199,517, covering the erection of 3,769 new dwellings and site development work costing £360,870.  The average number of persons employed on local authority house construction in that year was 4,477, the figure ranging from 4,864 in May to 5,308 in October, 1968, including those engaged in NBA projects in Cork, Limerick and Dublin.  It will be seen therefore that Opposition allegations of neglect of local authority housing are completely unjustifiable.</P>
    <P>The position in the current financial year is that the total number of local authority houses completed in the nine months to 31st December last is 3,572 houses including dwellings completed by the NBA in their projects at Ballymun, Cork and Limerick. In addition, there were 189 mobile, demountable, prefabricated dwellings. At the same date, the total number in progress was 6,727, including 2,027 by the NBA and 105 emergency houses. <Col N="214" /> The number at tender was 3,855, including 594 in the Cork project.  The number at planning stage at the end of that period was 17,038, and in addition the local authorities had sites available for 22,802 dwellings and were in the process of acquiring sites for a further 11,855.</P>
    <P>Thus, all the evidence is available for Deputies to see clearly that allegations of a slowing down in local authority house building are without foundation.  To conclude on this point, I want to refer to the capital expenditure involved in local authority housing. It has risen steadily in the past seven years, the provision this year being more than three-and-a-half times the amount in 1963-64.  The figures since that year are as follows, and I speak in million of pounds: 1963-64, 4.6; 1964-65, 6.8; 1965-66, 9.87; 1966-67, 11.942; 1967-68, 14.25; 1968-69, 15.75; 1969-70, 17.35.</P>
    <P>That does not show a decrease in the provision for local authority housing nor does it show a decreasing proportion of the total capital expenditure for housing devoted to local authority housing programmes, as both Deputy Fitzpatrick and Deputy FitzGerald maintained.  To illustrate this, I shall give the total public expenditure on housing during the period, again in millions of pounds.  In 1963-64, it was 12.88; 1964-65, 15.95; 1965-66, 20.96; 1966-67, 22.11; 1967-68, 25.74; 1968-69, 29.72; 1969-70, approximately 34 to 35.  Deputies will note that in 1963-64 the proportion of expenditure on local authority housing to the total public capital expenditure on housing was slightly more than one-third and that in this year it will be slightly more than one half.  That shows there is no foundation for the allegations made by Deputies Fitzpatrick and FitzGerald that there is a decreasing proportion of public capital expenditure on housing being provided for local authority housing.</P>
    <P>The allocation of capital money for the financial year 1970-71 has not yet been finalised, as Deputies know, but I can assure Deputies Fitzpatrick and FitzGerald and others opposite that the allocation will show a further substantial increase and will effectively <Col N="215" /> refute Deputy FitzGerald's stupid and false allegation that there is a cut-down in capital for housing.  I have given those figures for capital expenditure on housing because I find the availability of capital to be a very relevant thing in connection with the carrying out of the housing activities of my Department.</P>
    <P>The Opposition approach to the whole question of housing finances is as usual simple but insincere, as is their approach to every problem.  That approach is designed to be popular to all sections of the community.  It is that rates, rents and taxes are all too high, that they should all be reduced, and that more houses should be provided.  I cannot think of any more popular policy than that.  It is no wonder that Deputy FitzGerald is tearing his hair in frustration; it is no wonder the Labour Party complain about the rejection of this policy of theirs by the people; it is no wonder that Deputy Ryan came back after the last general election and talked about the stupidity and the ignorance of the people who continually refused to snap at this gaudy bait of lower rents, rates and taxes and higher social welfare benefits, improved health services and accelerated expansion of educational facilities.  I am getting tired of telling them it is wrong to assume that the people are fools and that it is unwise to continue to endeavour to be all things to all men.</P>
    <P>However, in the confident knowledge that they are incapable of treating the electorate as intelligent, I would point out that, while it may be all right for an entertainment medium such as television to adopt the attitude that all protests are 100 per cent right, even when they are directly contrary to one another, the electorate will see through a political Party which pursues this type of dishonest approach and will continue to reject them as they rejected them no later than Wednesday.</P>
    <P>I should like to say a few words on this complaint of Deputy FitzGerald, in particular, that the Government are forcing people to buy their own houses; that we are concentrating on grant-aided houses, at the <Col N="216" /> expense of local authority houses, in order to fake our housing production. The fact of the matter, of course, is that grant-aided houses, if they are financed by SDA loans, are more expensive: they absorb more capital per house.  Therefore, if we wanted to produce the maximum number of houses from the available capital, we would produce them in the other way.  In any case, I should like to know what is the objection to people, because of the higher living standards that prevail now, owning their own houses or aspiring to own their own houses.  We have not forced people to buy houses. We help them in so far as is possible. The Deputy also objected to the sale of land by the local authorities for the provision of private houses although his colleague, Deputy Clinton, shortly after that, objected to the fact that the local authority had ever acquired this land and suggested that they should have left it there for private enterprise to acquire and build houses on it.  The Government's policy is to encourage and assist every person who can do so to provide his own dwelling and to cater for families who cannot afford to do so by public housing.  Fine Gael should make up their minds what their policy on the matter is.</P>
    <P>Deputy FitzGerald says that the country which is 40 per cent better off than we were 20 years ago builds less public housing than it did then. It is because of the fact that the country, and therefore the people, is 40 per cent better off, that the people are now 40 per cent better able to provide themselves with housing and that they are inclined to do this. Approximately 58 per cent of all persons using loan facilities provided by local authorities to people buying their own houses had incomes of £1,050 or less per annum in the quarter ended 31st December, 1969.  These are the sorts of people who, if their future was a little less secure than it is under a Fianna Fáil Government or if they doubted their intention of staying in the country, might apply to a local authority for a rented dwelling.  Instead of that, they are willing&mdash;and because of the prosperity of recent years, they are able&mdash;to gather together <Col N="217" /> a deposit and put it down for a house and undertake the substantial commitment of buying a house by way of a loan.</P>
    <P>Building societies find that their statistics show a somewhat similar trend.  Over one-fifth of all borrowers from building societies have incomes of less than £1,200 a year.  These, again, are people who, if they felt a little less secure, as naturally they would under a Coalition Government, might decide to opt for local authority housing instead.  Deputy FitzGerald apparently objects to the fact that these people are now prepared to indicate their confidence in the future of the country by undertaking the provision of their own housing.  I just do not agree that this in an undesirable trend.  It is an indication of the change that has come about in the country as a whole.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to this question of comparisons with European countries.  Deputies opposite love to get hold of tables giving comparisons with different European countries, and to interpret them without any reference to relevant considerations, in order to appear to substantiate their own favourite thesis that this is &ldquo;the most distressful country that ever yet was seen.&rdquo;  Unless these statistics are complemented by background information, they are worse than useless; they are completely misleading.  As Deputy FitzGerald should know&mdash;he has shown in his contribution to the debate&mdash;the number of houses needed in a particular country is dependent partly on the number of persons in that country who are married.  As will be seen from an Appendix to the White Paper from which he quoted, the number of married persons in this country, as a percentage of the total population, was 33.5 per cent in 1966 and this is the lowest percentage of any of the countries for which statistics are given. The country with the next lowest percentage of married persons is Switzerland with 44.8 per cent of the population there married in 1960.  Every other country mentioned has a higher proportion of persons married.  This, of course, accounts for a sizeable part of the difference in the rate of building per 1,000 of the population.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="218" /> Another reason why houses are built is that the population increases and an increased population requires more accommodation.  Here again&mdash;in this matter of rate of increase in population&mdash;this country has been at the bottom of the list though the position may be starting to change now.</P>
    <P>A fact that is always completely ignored by Deputies opposite is that the houses that are built here are among the biggest in Europe.  The average useful floor space of a house in this country in 1968 is given in the <i>ECE Annual Bulletin for Housing and Building Statistics for Europe</i> as 85.9 square metres and this is the highest of any country for which statistics are available, apart from Iceland.  It is all very well to build perhaps 100,000 houses if each house has only two rooms.  You cannot compare this 100,000 houses with, say, 20,000 houses that have six rooms each but that is exactly what Deputies opposite are doing in making this type of comparison.</P>
    <P>The contribution made to the housing drive and to the housing stock by the scheme of reconstruction grants which has been in operation here, more or less in their present form, since 1933 &mdash;longer than in any country in Europe &mdash;is also ignored by Deputies opposite. Under this scheme, houses are being improved by the addition of extra rooms, or by works to repair structural defects, at the rate of 10,000 a year, so that, in addition to the actual output of new houses, existing accommodation is being made more suitable for the persons who are living in it at quite a rapid rate.  Existing houses are being conserved by means of this work. This sort of change has been going on for a long time.  Therefore, to get a true picture of the figures, the results of reconstruction grant work must also be included in the reckoning.</P>
    <P>Deputies will see, if they look at the White Paper appendix which I have mentioned, that the average number of persons per room in the different countries in Europe is also given and with .9 persons per room on average in this country we compare quite favourably with other countries in Europe which have a higher standard of living <Col N="219" /> and a greater wealth per head of population than we have.  I admit we are not as good as the best, but this is probably a little bit higher than we can aim for just at the present.</P>
    <P>As I have said, the Opposition are always very diligent in their search for international statistics which, without reference to the different basis on which they were compiled, can be manipulated so as to support their habitual portrayal of this country as a place of object misery.  When we bear in mind the fact that the basic wages in the building industry in this country are certainly as high as they are in England, the average rents of local authority houses provide a fair measure of the level of assistance given from public funds to the housing of local authority tenants.  I have comparative figures here.  As the existence and significance of these comparative figures seems to have escaped the Opposition researchers I would like to supply the deficiency in the material available to them in order to make an objective comparison of conditions instead of the comparison made by the Opposition with its usual, traditional and deliberate anti-Irish bias.</P>
    <P>The figures I have here for the average weekly rents of local authority dwellings in England and Wales are from a publication called <i>Housing Statistics No. 15</i>, issued in November, 1969, by the Ministry of Housing and Local Government and published by Her Majesty's Stationery Office.  The average weekly rent of local authority dwellings in the Greater London area in April, 1961, 28s 1d, and in April, 1969, was 53s 9d.  If Deputies look at <i>Housing in the Seventies</i>, Table 11, on page 20, gives the average weekly rents of local authority dwellings in this country.  In 1961 the average weekly rent of dwellings owned by county borough corporations, was 12s 2d as compared with 28s 1d in the Greater London area; in 1969 the average weekly rent in county borough corporation areas in this country was 20s 2d&mdash; that figure is not actually in the table because it has become available since it was published&mdash;and that figure of 20s 2d in the city areas here compares <Col N="220" /> with 53s 9d in the Greater London area.  That figure of 53s 9d is 266 per cent more than the Irish rent and the rent increase since 1961 in the Greater London area has been 91 per cent whilst in this country the increase from 12s 2d to 20s 2d is an increase of 66 per cent.  These figures are figures of international comparison also and they certainly give factual proof of the exceedingly low average cost to the tenant of local authority housing in this country as compared with the cost to the tenant of similar accommodation under a socialist regime in England. We see the vastly greater recognition given here, in a country with a substantially lower income <i>per capita</i>, to the principle of subsidising local authority tenants both from the Exchequer and the rates.  I think the comparison shows how ill-founded the campaign against the renting system operated by local authorities in this country is because the rent contains a very much greater element of subsidisation than is the case in socialist England.</P>
    <P>I shall go on to deal with the question of the rents of local authority houses and in particular the differential renting scheme which is operated by a number of local authorities and which obviously, from the point of view of social justice, should be in universal operation.  The first thing I would like to deal with is what is described as the B scale differential rent scheme operated by Dublin Corporation.  The tendency is to portray this as a terrible draconian measure and to pretend that it applies not only in Dublin but in the country as a whole.  Of course, it does not.  The B scale renting scheme applies only in Dublin.  It is a scheme drawn up by the Dublin Corporation and submitted to me with the approval of the then Dublin City Council, whose proposals were amended substantially in favour of the tenants by me.</P>
    <P>The first point I want to make with regard to the rent of local authority houses, apart from the point I have already made about the vastly greater subsidisation to local authority houses in this country as compared with socialist England, is that the initiation of these schemes and the detailed administration <Col N="221" /> of individual differential rent schemes is a matter for the local authority providing the houses.  They are sanctioned, or approved, by me as Minister for Local Government initially and certain guidelines are laid down by the Minister as guidelines to local authorities making the schemes.  These suggest that rents should range from a nominal figure of say 2s 6d a week up to the cost of providing and maintaining a house and within this range rents are based on one-sixth or one-seventh of the income, after certain deductions have been made from that income.</P>
    <P>In Dublin the B scale rent for a new letting of an ordinary local authority house or a four-roomed flat provided since the 1st January, 1954, ranges from 6s 6d a week to 85s a week.  These rents include sums for rates up to the level the rates had reached in 1964-65.  If the rates are excluded the actual figures for rent ranges obviously from a negative sum, since the minimum of 6s 6d would be insufficient to cover the rates up to the level reached in 1964-65, to about 73s a week on average.  Now the rent based on the average cost to the corporation of providing, maintaining and administering a house now is equivalent to approximately £6 a week and the cost of a flat is substantially higher.  For example the cost of a four-roomed flat in Keogh Square, Inchicore, is equivalent to a rent of more than £10 a week and these figures do not include any sum for rates.  The fact that the maximum figure for the rent is, on average, 73s under this B scale, whereas the average cost would be £6 a week, is an indication of the high level of subsidisation by taxpayers and ratepayers many of whom are not as well housed themselves and not as well able to pay as those whom they are subsidising, particularly those who would be paying anything approaching the maximum rent.</P>
    <P>I would say that anyone who has any sympathy with the present agitation should reserve that sympathy not for those who are liable for the maximum rent but for those in between, because I would certainly agree that those people whose incomes do not justify the maximum rent in accordance with <Col N="222" /> this scheme are very hard-pressed and their outgoings must leave them with a Spartan standard of living to say the least of it.  The peculiar thing about the agitation that is going on is that it is about the maximum rent and not about the people who are not paying the maximum rent.  It is aimed, as has been admitted in an article in the <i>Irish Independent</i>, at benefiting the least deserving section of the tenants rather than the most deserving.</P>
    <P>Even if a person is on the maximum of this B scale rent he is not paying what similar accommodation is now costing or what he would have to pay for a privately rented flat.  A man with a wife and four children would, in fact, need to have an income of £28 10s a week before he would pay the maximum of the B scale rent.  With £18 a week he would have to pay only £2 10s a week plus the post-1964-65 rates which would average out at about 11s.  If a man's income falls because of unemployment, strikes, illness or retirement, his rent falls also so, in effect, the scheme is a form of insurance for those whose income is liable to fluctuate.</P>
    <P>It is worth comparing the figure of £2 10s a week plus the post-1964-65 rates increase which a man on £18 a week would have to pay, not only with the cost of providing accommodation now, but also with what he would have to pay if he were to buy a house with the aid of a small dwellings loan from the local authority.  This is not just an academic comparison.  It is a real comparison because the statistics published by my Department show that about 58 per cent of all persons raising housing loans from the local authority have incomes of £1,050 a year, which is £20 a week approximately.  A great number of them have smaller incomes.</P>
    <P>Assuming that the borrower puts down a deposit of £800 and borrows the average amount of a loan in Dublin of £2,850, his outgoing on the house, after taking into account State and local authority grants, will be over £5 a week plus ground rent, insurance and the cost of maintenance and, in addition to that, he will have to pay one-tenth of the rates in the first year, two-tenths in the second year, and so <Col N="223" /> on.  That compares with the fact that a man with £18 a week has to pay only £2 10s a week for his dwelling under this B scale rent system in Dublin, plus, as I said, about 11s a week for rates.</P>
    <P>The contention that there is something particularly draconian in the B scale rents, as such, is completely wrong.  The major difference is that the maximum rent of 73s is more in line with current costs and current incomes. Apart from this the scheme is, in fact, more favourable to the tenant. In particular, the allowances under the B scale rent system for persons with low incomes or with many children are more generous than those under other corporation differential rent schemes.  As is obvious, it is not with people with low incomes or with large families that the agitation is concerned but mainly with people who should be in a position to undertake their own housing.</P>
    <P>Many hundreds of persons have in fact opted of their own accord to go on to the B scale rent since it was introduced some years ago and have got reductions in their rents of up to 19s a week by going on to the B scale rent system.  It is probable that many more would have done this but for the fact that they were scared off from taking this very sensible step by the activities of those who are fostering this agitation including, I may say, the two evening papers circulating in this city.  The effect of the new rent scheme is concealed from the bulk of the tenants whom it is hoped to dupe into acting as pawns for those who should not be in local authority houses at all.</P>
    <P>The cost of keeping rents of corporation housing so low in comparison with what it is in socialist England is met by the State from general taxation, and by the local authority from rates. In 1964-65, in Dublin city this amounted to £1,577,000.  In the current financial year it is estimated at £3,500,000.  This is for the Dublin Corporation area alone.  Next year it will be higher again.  There is an obvious need for a differential rent scheme which allows persons to get decent housing at a rent far below the <Col N="224" /> cost.  Without this sort of system many persons who are now in good housing simply could not have got it, and many persons on the local authority waiting list could never get it.</P>
    <P>There is need for subsidies to maintain the system.  Subsidies have to be provided by the ratepayers and by the taxpayers many of whom, as I have pointed out, are less well housed than the people they are subsidising and less well able to provide the money. My concern is that these subsidies, which I agree are necessary and justifiable, should not go to persons who do not need them, and that they should not absorb money which should be used to build decent homes for the many thousands of people who are still without them.</P>
    <P>The £3,500,000 to be spent on subsidising Dublin Corporation housing in 1969-70 could build another 1,200 houses if it were available for that purpose.  The £14.9 million paid in subsidies for Dublin Corporation housing alone since 1964-65 would have built another 6,000 houses.  I have no hesitation in saying that it is unjust to subsidise people who do not need it at the expense of people living in deplorable conditions.  This, in fact, is what is being demanded.  I am confident that the many thousands of persons now living in the comparatively good accommodation provided for them by the local authority would not willingly be a party in this way to a slowing down of the drive to house those who have still not got decent housing including in many cases their own sons and daughters who may be living with them or in other overcrowded or insanitary conditions and waiting for a house.</P>
    <P>I recognise that many persons in corporation houses who pay rents which vary with income would wish to buy their own houses and so convert their varying payments into a fixed sum each week or month for purchase. I understand that the corporation are pressing ahead with their scheme to give tenants an opportunity to buy and that over 8,000 tenants have, in fact, expressed an interest in purchase.  I have also asked the corporation to take <Col N="225" /> steps to try to reduce the number of persons who fall into serious arrears with their rent through no fault of their own.  I am confident that the local authority are taking steps to this end.  I understand that they are at present communicating with the tenants on the subject.</P>
    <P>I agree that there has been, as far as my experience goes, a certain inflexibility in regard to the actual administration of this scheme and that there have been some anomalies in it. I am satisfied that the local authority is doing everything possible to eliminate these, and that is the only fault I will admit in the scheme.  The scheme itself as sanctioned by me is thoroughly justifiable and defensible on any grounds whatsoever.  The maximum rents charged are not excessive and are based on a reasonable proportion of the tenant's income after certain deductions are made.  The case was made that overtime earnings should not be taken into account.  Anyone who examines that contention will see that it has no justifiable basis.  It may be that there is a case for taking these overtime earnings into account in a different way and that possibly some proportion of them should be omitted because of the contention that there is extra expense associated with overtime earnings.  I would certainly be prepared to consider any proposals of that kind that may be submitted to me by any local authority, but I do not agree that there is any justification for asking that overtime earnings as such should be ignored.</P>
    <P>It is a great pity that articles should appear in national newspapers containing deliberate falsehoods obviously designed to foster opposition to a system of rents which enables housing to be made available irrespective of capacity to pay.  These have appeared in at least two of the national dailies and constitute, in my opinion, a cynical and deliberate attempt to perpetrate a confidence trick on local authority tenants by pretending to be on the side of the less-well-off when in reality the campaign is, beyond any shadow of doubt, a campaign by the haves against the have-nots.  If people who can afford to pay reasonable rents <Col N="226" /> for the accommodation provided for them do not pay it, then the capacity to provide adequate housing for people who cannot afford to pay for it will be reduced.</P>
    <P>There was one article which appeared in the <i>Irish Times</i> shortly before the recent by-election and was obviously published with a view to affecting the result of that by-election but which did not have that effect and which contained the most deliberate and exaggerated misstatements of fact. That newspaper demonstrated its adherence to the principle of fair play and free speech by refusing to publish a contradiction giving the facts.  For instance, it was stated in the article that these rents were based on one-third of the income whereas, in fact, they are based on one-sixth after deductions have been made.  The article states:</P>
    <P>According to their differential rents scheme they will have to pay as high as £5 13s a week when Tommy is working.  The rent is estimated as roughly one-third of his wages and this is assessed every three months.  Then 3s 6d is charged on every £1 earned over the stated amount, which does not encourage working overtime or honest declaration of &ldquo;nixers&rdquo;, and this extra bill sometimes amounting to £30 or £40 can arrive out of the blue causing further chaos in the budget.</P>
    <P>That is the type of falsehood circulated in so-called responsible newspapers which brings about this type of unjustified agitation now taking place. The maximum rent, this article in the <i>Irish Times</i> states, is £5 13s per week. It is not.  I gave the maximum rent, which includes a figure for rates up to the level they reached in 1964-65.  If there was such a maximum rent, which of course there is not, the tenant would have to have an income of £37 18s per week excluding children's allowances which in the case of the family described would be approximately £2 10 per week.</P>
    <P>There were a number of other misstatements in the article in respect of which the newspaper refused to publish a contradiction, which is a typical attitude of the paper concerned.  It is <Col N="227" /> a pity that this type of deliberate misrepresentation should go on in regard to such a vital matter as housing and thereby help to bring about an agitation which is designed to interfere with the provision of houses for those who are still in need.</P>
    <P>At other times both of these national daily newspapers complain about the level of rates and also, at the appropriate time, they complain about the level of taxation.  I have shown the substantially higher subsidisation of local authority houses here by means of rates and taxes than in socialist England, and this therefore is a demand for a still higher degree of subsidisation.  It is a demand for the higher level of subsidisation not and specifically not for those who are most in need but for the better-off section of corporation tenants.</P>
    <P>It is clear that if this campaign is to succeed, first of all, the higher the subsidisation of existing houses the less the capacity to build new houses for those who are still in need of them.  Secondly, it must surely be admitted that many ratepayers are less well able to pay their present rates and other outgoings on their housing accommodation than the people on whose behalf this campaign is being conducted by the media, which, as I say, complain so bitterly about rates and are also conducting this completely contradictory campaign.</P>
    <P>The case was made more extensively in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of 5th March. We can see from that case that not alone is this campaign aimed against those still seeking houses and against the ratepayers but it is not even for the benefit of the most deserving and the most numerous section of the tenants. It is obviously an effort to trick the great bulk of the tenants into allowing themselves to be used as pawns.  For as many years as I can remember there have been widespread complaints about the high total income alleged to be going into some houses provided by Dublin Corporation compared with the incomes of people undertaking the task of providing their own houses.  Yet, it is specifically stated here that one of the main objects of this campaign is to <Col N="228" /> ensure that no account whatever is taken of any income except that of the tenant himself.  This means that the tenant with four adult children, earning possibly substantial incomes, is to pay only the same rent and receive the same subsidy from ratepayers and taxpayers whose circumstances may in many cases be much more straitened as the tenant who has a similar personal income but has four schoolgoing children and no income additional to his own coming into the house and who has far greater expenses.  This is stated to be the main objective of the campaign and the main injustice which, it is represented, exists.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies spoke of the hardship both before and after marriage undertaken by many young couples who have pinched and scraped to accumulate a substantial deposit and who are paying the full cost of their housing, except for the State and local authority grants, which, I admit, are comparatively meagre.  They are paying this out of incomes that are in many cases less than the incomes of local authority tenants.  Certainly, in the vast majority of cases of people availing of SDA loans, as I have pointed out the income, in fact, would be less than that of a tenant who would be liable for anything approaching the maximum differential rent.  The campaign is to compel people who are providing their own accommodation to subsidise local authority houses at a higher rate both by way of rates and taxes and this is not even for the benefit of those in greatest need, for those inadequately housed or even for the tenant liable for the maximum rent on the basis of his own income.  It is for the benefit of those who, in addition to their own income, have children who no longer represent financial commitments and who have substantial subsidiary incomes.</P>
    <P>The campaign being conducted against differential rents is clearly a selfish one carried on by those who have houses themselves and, in the main, by those who have substantial incomes against those who have not houses and who have low incomes.  If successful, it must considerably reduce the housing drive, preventing people&mdash;<Col N="229" /> including in many cases, sons and daughters of those campaigning&mdash;who are living in very bad conditions, from being housed.  This is something that cannot be allowed to happen.  People who are well able to pay a reasonable share of the cost of their accommodation cannot be allowed to bully local authorities in this selfish way into neglecting housing of families still without houses for this purpose.  I want to make it as clear as I can that differential rents are absolutely essential to the housing drive which cannot otherwise proceed at anything like its present level.  Differential renting is a social welfare service making it possible to offer housing accommodation of the same quality to all those eligible irrespective of the capacity of the tenant to pay.  It is essential in common justice as it is a way of ensuring that the subsidy paid by ratepayers and taxpayers is distributed in proportion to the need of the recipients.</P>
    <P>Individual schemes and their administration are a matter for the local authority, not for me, but the Government intend to proceed with the housing drive with increasing intensity and this cannot be done without differential rents.  It cannot be done if we are to pay the same subsidy to people who do not need it as is paid to people who do need it.  The money used to build local authority houses has to be borrowed and paid back and it is repaid from three sources, taxpayers, ratepayers and the tenants.  If any of these sources dries up the housing drive must either stop or slow down.  We intend to continue with our efforts to provide houses.  This is an attempt to unload an unreasonable and unfair share of the cost of local authority housing on to the backs of those who must provide their own housing&mdash;and on to the backs of the less well off local authority tenants&mdash;and it is for the benefit, as I said, of the better-off tenant and against the less well off.</P>
    <P>Having said that, I admit that it has been my own experience that there is some unreasonable inflexibility in the actual administration of differential rents schemes generally in Dublin city. I do not think there has been adequate <Col N="230" /> appreciation of the fact that some people need help to enable them to keep up with their commitments and avoid debt.  In particular, obviously one thing that happened in regard to B scale rents is that people have, in fact, whether through not being sufficiently alive to what they should do or otherwise, found themselves presented with bills for large amounts of arrears which were really accumulated through no fault of their own.  This is something that is completely indefensible and, as I said, I understand that the local authority are now in the process of drawing the tenants' attention to what they should do in the event of their incomes increasing so as to make sure that they do not fall into arrears in this way.</P>
    <P>Once this type of anomaly is eliminated I think there is no fundamental defect in this renting scheme.  It is eminently just in regard to the maximum rents&mdash;which, remember, are maximum rents and are not unreasonable&mdash;and there is no just case for agitation on the scale on which it is at present taking place.  I think it is being provided, while it will not be possible administratively to make actual weekly assessments of rents, that tenants themselves may pay whatever extra amount would be due on the basis of any increases they obtain between periods when assessments are made. This is a simple calculation.  The deductions in respect of the tenant himself and in respect of children and subsidiary earnings have already been made: it is merely a question of adding one-sixth of the extra income to the weekly rent and this will be accepted and credit will be given for it at the next assessment.  In this way it is possible to ensure that substantial arrears do not arise.  I hope that this campaign will not proceed any further and that normality will be restored.  I am satisfied that the local authority are making every effort to ensure that the renting system is administered in a reasonable way.  I move to report progress.</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.</P>
      <P>There are ten nurse tutor vacancies at present in psychiatric and general nursing training hospitals administered by local authorities.  Temporary appointments have been made to all but one of these vacancies.  Additional posts will be created when the supply of qualified personnel increases.  The situation in regard to qualified tutors has much improved in recent years since the initiation of nurse tutor diploma courses at UCD.  I understand that 19 students, including seven nurses in the employment of local authorities, are attending the current course.</P>
      <P>The remuneration of nurse tutors, as of other nursing grades in the health services, is determined under agreed negotiating procedures which apply to local authority staffs generally.  My only function is to record or withhold approval of settlements arrived at under these arrangements.</P>

      <P>I do not consider that it would be in the best interests of our dairy products export trade that An Bord Bainne, which was established for the primary purpose of developing and promoting that trade, should become involved in the marketing of dairy products on the home market. The board has, of course, achieved significant success in connection with the sale of Irish butter and cheese on the British market, but there is still scope for the development of some of our other exports of dairy products and, in my view, the board should concentrate upon this rather than involve itself in the home market where the production and marketing of dairy products is largely handled by farmers' co-operative societies, with the participation of the State-owned Dairy Disposal Company in some areas.  Such weaknesses as may exist in the present home marketing of butter could, in my opinion, be dealt with by measures of another kind which I have already under consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton, Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>and <b>Mr. P. Belton</b> asked the Minister for Local <Col N="234" /> Government if he intends to make adjustment in B scale differential rents to meet the serious objections being raised by tenants all over the country who have been obliged to accept this scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Boland) Kevin Boland">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>Proposals for the adjustment of rents are a matter for the local authority who provide and maintain the houses.</P>
      <P>In view, however, of the publicity given to B scale rents, I think I should set out some basic facts about them.</P>
      <P>B scale rents apply to new lettings of houses or flats provided by Dublin Corporation since 1st January, 1954. They do not apply to lettings made before 28th February, 1966.  There is no scheme of the same name applying in any other area of the country.</P>
      <P>Under the scheme, the rent for an ordinary local authority house or four-roomed flat ranges from 6s 6d to 85s a week.  These rents include rates up to the level reached in 1964-65.  If the rates are excluded, the actual figure for rent ranges from a negative sum (since the minimum of the scale is insufficient to cover the rates up to 1964-65) to about 73s a week, on average.  Within the range of the scale, the tenant is asked to pay one-sixth of the combined family income, after deductions from the principal income and the income of other earners, allowances for children, certain social welfare payments, etc.</P>
      <P>To meet the average cost to the corporation of providing, maintaining and administering a house in the current financial year a rent of approximately £6 a week would be required.  The cost of a flat is substantially higher.  For example, the cost of a four-roomed flat in Keogh Square, Inchicore, is equivalent to a rent of more than £10 a week.  These figures do not include any sum for rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even, therefore, if a person is on the maximum of the B scale, he is not paying what similar accommodation is now costing to provide, or what he would have to pay for a privately rented flat.  If he is in a modern house, he is getting a rent subsidy of about <Col N="235" /> £2 7s a week: if he is in a four-roomed flat his rent subsidy is over £6 7s a week, paid by taxpayers and ratepayers.  A man with a wife and four children would need to have an income of £28 10s a week before he would pay the maximum of the B scale.  With £18 a week, he would pay £2 10s a week including rates up to the level reached in 1964-65.</P>
    <P>It is worth comparing this figure with what the man would have to pay if he were to buy a house with the aid of a small dwellings loan from the local authority.  The comparison is a real one since, as statistics published by my Department show, about 58 per cent of all persons raising housing loans from the local authority have incomes of £1,050 a year (£21 a week approximately) or less.  Assuming the borrower puts down a deposit of £800 and borrows the average amount of a loan in Dublin of £2,850, his outgoings on the house after taking into account this deposit and State and local authority grants, will be over £5 a week, plus ground rent, insurance, maintenance, <i>et cetera</i>, and one-tenth of the rates in the first year, two-tenths in the second year and so on.</P>
    <P>The allowances under the B scale for persons with low incomes or with many children are more generous than those under other corporation rent schemes.  Many hundreds of persons have, in fact, opted to go on to the B scale since it was introduced some years ago and have got reductions in rent of up to 19s a week.  This effect is concealed from the bulk of the tenants who may in this way be misled into acting as pawns for those who should not be in local authority housing at all.  Further, if a man's income falls because of unemployment, strikes, illness or on retirement his rent falls immediately, so that the scheme is, in effect, a form of insurance.</P>
    <P>The cost of keeping rents of corporation housing low is met by the State from general taxation and by the local authority from rates.  In 1964-65 this cost amounted to £1,577,000.  In the current financial year, it is now estimated at over £3,500,000.  The corporation estimate that their rent income in <Col N="236" /> the same year will be about £2,800,000. In other words, taxpayers and ratepayers are now paying more each year towards provision and maintenance of corporation housing than are the persons living in it.  These taxpayers and ratepayers include many thousands of local authority tenants on low incomes in Dublin and elsewhere.  There is need for a differential rents scheme which allows persons in need to get decent housing at a rent far below the cost.  Without this sort of system many persons now in good housing simply could not have got it and many persons on the local authority waiting lists could never get it.  There is need for subsidies to maintain the system. My concern is that these subsidies should not go to persons who do not need them and that they should not absorb money which should be used for building decent houses for the many thousands of people still without them.  The £3,500,000 to be spent in subsidising Dublin Corporation housing in 1969-70 could build another 1,200 houses if it were available for that purpose.  The £14.5 million paid since 1964-65 in subsidies for Dublin Corporation housing alone, would, allowing for differences in cost, have built another 6,000 houses approximately&mdash; or sufficient to provide a house for more than all the persons now on the corporation's approved waiting list for housing.  I know that the majority of people now living in the comparatively good accommodation provided for them by the local authority do not object to paying for their accommodation and would not willingly be party to a slowing down through the use of money for subsidies which should be used in the drive to build houses for those who have still not got them, including in many cases their own sons, daughters and relatives who may be living with them and waiting for a house.  I know also that many genuine grievances exist&mdash;and may be inevitable in an estate of more than 50,000 houses&mdash;for example, because of the accumulation of arrears through delays in reviewing incomes for rent purposes, and I have asked the corporation to look into these problems.</P>
    <P>Many people in corporation houses <Col N="237" /> who pay rents which vary with income would wish to buy their houses and so convert their varying payments into a fixed sum each week or month for purchase. The corporation are pressing ahead with their scheme to give tenants an opportunity to buy their houses and I understand that over 8,000 tenants have, in fact, expressed an interest in purchase.  The corporation are also giving preferential treatment to tenants who wish to buy their own houses with the aid of house-purchase loans and supplementary grants.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no statutory authority for payment of assistance of this kind from State funds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The cost of domestic heating is an ordinary household expense and, as such, should normally be borne by the householder.  The public assistance authority may, however, help towards meeting this cost in cases of genuine <Col N="242" /> hardship.  Where such circumstances arise in the case of tenants of the Ballymun scheme, I understand that the Dublin Health Authority are prepared to assist the tenants concerned and, in fact, have done so in a number of cases.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that in certain cases in Ballymun up to three times the amount of rent can be charged for central heating?  Is he further aware that great hardship is being caused by the central heating levy on the flat dwellers in Ballymun and that the central heating is not necessarily a luxury in the Ballymun flats but a necessity to make these flats habitable?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>

This central heating, apart from being costly and not being a luxury, can also, according to reports which have come from Zurich, be a contributory factor in certain upper respiratory tract diseases, thereby resulting in a further increase in the cost of living of these people.

Aer Lingus has stated that the airline will meet all its obligations under its salary/wage agreements and that no redundancy is likely.

One factor is that the fares on cross-channel routes are very high and the other is that the departure times of many of the scheduled services are not suitable and seem to be geared to fit in with the transatlantic run rather than to cater for the ordinary passengers and, particularly, for the tourists.

      <P>The Dublin Health Authority applied in recent months for additions and alterations to the installation serving St. Kevin's Hospital and for better maintenance arrangements. Work on the additions and alterations has been completed with the exception of three external extensions and these are in hands.  Arrangements exist to ensure that faults reported receive priority treatment and I am satisfied that the installation receives special maintenance attention.  An examination of the extensive installations serving the hospital is being arranged, however, in order to see whether <Col N="250" /> improvements of the service could be effected by modifications to the existing manual private exchange pending provision of a centralised automatic branch exchange by the Dublin Health Authority at St. Kevin's Hospital.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>The recovery of disused telephones lines is generally programmed to fit in with other engineering work in the area.  Instructions were issued some time ago, however, that wires on abandoned routes should be recovered specially so as to reduce the danger of theft.  Claims are not made against local authorities in the event of disused plant being damaged by vandals.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid the Minister is not quite aware of the situation with regard to this matter.  Is he not aware that claims for disused telephone wires which were stolen have been made against practically every local authority; that every county council, including the one of which I am a member, have had to pay compensation to the Minister's Department for wires which had been stolen and which had been abandoned by his Department for years and had not been taken down but which suddenly became very valuable when they were stolen by tinkers or somebody like that?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not my information. The position is that if any of our property in use is damaged and where we have to carry out repairs, yes, we have claimed against the local authority in that regard.  My information is that we do not claim in regard to disused equipment.  The Deputy says that charges have been made to local authorities all over the place and especially to his local authority and my information does not convey that. If the Deputy has any feelings or any individual information in that regard I would be happy to hear from him.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a number of different aspects of the contributions on housing that I have not dealt with and unless there is a specific request I do not propose to deal with them at all.  Before I move on from housing I should like to refer to a case that was raised by Deputy FitzGerald which shows the type of duplicity on which he based his attack.  He referred to the housing conditions of a constituent of his and said that the person in question had a wife and five children, that they were living in a two-roomed, two-storey terrace house, that the ceiling of the upstairs room had collapsed some time ago and that the family have since been living in the ground floor room. He stated that he approached the corporation 14 months ago seeking alternative accommodation for the family but that his efforts were not successful and he obviously implied that the corporation would not house a family such as this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am reasonably satisfied that I have traced this case and I feel that some of the facts that have been deliberately <Col N="258" /> concealed by Deputy FitzGerald should be given so as to give a more complete picture.  The fact that this man has refused offers of accommodation from the corporation in the following schemes: Cuffe Street flats, Ballymun, Coolock-Kilbarrack and the latest offer of a flat in St. Michael's estate, Inchicore, which was previously known as Keogh Square.  He is employed with the Irish Glass Bottle Company and while one can concede the disadvantage of working with the Irish Glass Bottle Company and living in Ballymun or Coolock-Kilbarrack, I do not think that Cuffe Street flats is an unreasonable distance from Ringsend.  Many people travel further to their work.  In fact, there are many people who travel from Ballymun and from Coolock-Kilbarrack much further distances than to Ringsend but because of their consideration for the health of their family they have accepted accommodation in places not suitable for their places of employment in the hope of eventually getting transfers or a change of work.  I feel that it is a man's duty to his family to accept this amount of inconvenience if the accommodation offered is the only accommodation available.  If we are to accept that nobody should be expected to travel from Cuffe Street to Ringsend in order to work, as Deputy FitzGerald alleges, then we are placing an impossible burden on the corporation.</P>
    <P>This man has indicated that he requires accommodation either in Ringssend or in Donnybrook.  These happen to be places where there are not any sites available for new houses with the possible exception of one that is becoming available now and where casual vacancies arise only very rarely. It must be obvious that his chance of being housed in the particular locations that he has selected are quite remote but it is a fact&mdash;and Deputy FitzGerald concealed this in order to present a completely false picture&mdash;that at any time in the past ten years this man could have been housed if he was prepared to accept the accommodation offered.  In fact, I feel that even to travel from Inchicore to Ringsend is not a very great hardship.  There are many people travelling much longer <Col N="259" /> distances.  However, I feel it is in the corporation's own best interests and in everybody's best interests to try to arrange, as far as possible, that their tenants will be housed in areas that are suitable for them.  I feel they should make every effort to facilitate people in this way by arranging for tenants who are unsuitably housed from the point of view of their work or even from the point of being near their relatives to transfer with other people who would be more suitably housed where they happen to be.</P>
    <P>Another question that was raised was the practice of certain Deputies indulging in the pretence that they have been able to get houses for people.  I am glad that a number of Deputies made it quite clear that, in fact, no Deputy is in a position to obtain a house for a person and that houses are allocated in an objective way in accordance with need as determined by one or other of different methods.  Deputy Foley and Deputy Burke made the Fianna Fáil attitude clear in this regard.  We have always made it clear that the allocation of houses is completely unaffected by any representations on behalf of individuals made by public representatives.  It is true, as Deputy Clinton mentioned, that certain action was taken by some Fianna Fáil public representatives in regard to the allocation of houses in one particular area of County Dublin &mdash; Malahide. That action produced the result of having the proposed allocation reviewed so as to ensure that people who were entitled to houses and did not get them in the first provisional allocation were, in fact, given the consideration to which they were entitled.</P>
    <P>At that time I felt it was a great pity that the late Deputy Seán Dunne was not still in this House because there is nobody who would have been able to deal as adequately as he would with the arrangement that disqualified the people residing in the Baskin cottages from housing in the Malahide area and required them, instead, to be considered for housing in Santry, Ballymun and such areas.  The subterfuge that was adopted of saying that, because the Baskin townland was not the townland <Col N="260" /> in which the majority of the Baskin cottages were situated but the townland of Ballymacartle rather than the townland of Baskin was something that would not have got by the late Deputy Dunne.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the councillors who tried to trick these people out of houses to which they were entitled because of this naming of the Baskin cottages eventually saw that the game was up and amended the scheme so that justice was done.  As I say, I agree with Deputies who said that this practice of people pretending to get houses for people when, in fact, they have nothing to do with it, is something that should be condemned.  I hope that Deputy L'Estrange will now cease to send out letters such as this:</P>
    <P>Dear John,</P>
    <P>Glad to inform you that you have been awarded a house at the meeting on Monday night.  Wishing you many years of health and happiness in your new home....</P>
    <P>I hope, in particular, that if he should continue to send out such letters he will only send them to people who have been awarded houses and not as in this particular case when the letter is sent to a man who did not get a house and who never approached Deputy L'Estrange or anybody else to try to get one for him.</P>
    <P>Deputies Cluskey and Timmons brought up the question of the rents charged for flats and bedsitters in Dublin city.  They spoke of the accommodation and furniture that was provided in these flats and bedsitters and, in particular, they referred to the scandalous exploitation of so-called furnished flats.  I may say that I am well aware of the anti-social activities of these racketeers who provide less than the minimum furniture necessary for normal life but who charge exhorbitant rents.  Obviously, this is a difficult problem and it is not one for my Department.  As far as I can remember, it was brought within the ambit of this debate by Deputy Cluskey who pointed out that if there was available a sufficiency of housing, the scope for the malevolent activities of the bedsitter and furnished flats parasites will be greatly reduced.  This, I admit and I <Col N="261" /> would very much like to be able to deprive these people of their ill-gotten gains in this way.  However, it must be obvious that we are not within sight of remedying this evil in this way and that other methods which are not within the scope of my Department must be sought.</P>

      <P>Justice.  I am not saying that I see any way of dealing with it but I agree that it is a problem which should be dealt with if at all possible.</P>
      <P>A number of other matters were raised during the debate but I do not think it would be reasonable to detain the House any longer despite prolonged attempts by the Opposition to keep this debate going for as long as possible but there is other important business to come before the House and I only propose to deal with a couple of other matters.</P>
      <P>I am glad, in particular, that no opposition was declared to the efforts that are being made to get local authorities to provide permanent serviced sites for itinerants as a first step in the process of rehabilitating them with the rest of the community.  I hope that this will be the attitude of public representatives generally and I am talking now about my own side of the House as well as other parties when these matters are being dealt with at local level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is when a proposal comes up in one's own constituency and in one's own locality that the sincerity of this attitude is tested.  The only real criticism that I heard here in regard to this effort was criticism of its inadequacy and this is as it should be. Deputy Dr. Browne questioned whether it was a good idea or whether it was the best approach to put these people first of all into camps where they are so clearly marked out from the rest of the community while continuing to live a sub-standard existence.  I wish to make it clear that in so far as I am concerned I would not look upon this first step as a solution to the problem and it is not intended to be a solution to the problem.  However, the present <Col N="262" /> position is that these people are on the roads and being moved from place to place or else they are camping in unauthorised and unserviced sites, living in appalling and unChristian conditions.  The first step must be to endeavour to improve that situation. In their present mode of living, which is the only one available to them, they are a source of great nuisance to the settled population and are the cause of many complaints, some of them quite unreasonable.  At the same time, they are a source of nuisance on some of the sites on which they camp.  This is a serious problem but the point I want to make to local authorities is, that while it is serious, it is of small proportions.</P>
    <P>This winter is almost passed and there is no doubt but that this problem can be dealt with in so far as this first stage is concerned by every local authority in the country before next winter and I say that any local authority who do not do this commit a clear and culpable dereliction of duty.  I said that the problem could be dealt with in this way but not solved because this is only a first stage but it will be an improvement.  The children will be able to have continuous education while the adults will have reasonable opportunity of obtaining some kind of employment.  It will be the first stage in their rehabilitation and absorption into the settled community. What I would hope for is that shortly after being settled in these serviced camps the itinerants will become applicants for housing by the local authorities in the normal way.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Sherwin pointed out, people should look upon the provision of sites in their own locality as a status symbol and an indication of the social conscience of the settled residents in the area rather than that they should oppose them.  They should regard the provision of these serviced sites as scope for worthwhile social work.  I would endorse what Deputy Sherwin said about the attitude of people in the Ballyfermot and Bluebell areas and, in particular, the attitude of the people in Finglas who sponsored the provision of sites.  I would hope that some of what are called better-class <Col N="263" /> areas would follow this example rather than what has happened in several cases where there were proposals to establish these sites, when there was an immediate outcry from the settled population to the effect that these sites would devalue their houses by substantial amounts of money.</P>
    <P>This is absolute nonsense.  It is a point of view that I personally have no patience with, no sympathy with, and I would hope that public representatives generally will not give this type of campaign any assistance.  There is no reason whatever why the establishment of a properly serviced site for those people should have any adverse affect on the value of property in the area.  I am particularly anxious to have that problem dealt with because I suppose of the fact that most of the problems connected with my Department are of their very nature continuing ones, permanent ones, that we will have with us forever, but this is one which can be disposed of.  All that is necessary is goodwill and leadership instead of what we have had in some cases weak-kneed submission to unchristian and selfish opposition.  I have seen some letters of protest about the proposals to establish sites in certain areas which I consider were quite appalling.  I think any public representative worthy of his salt would prefer to be defeated in an election rather than go along with this type of opposition.</P>
    <P>The question of the traffic here in Dublin city was mentioned but I do not think there is much necessity for me to go into it in any further detail than I did in reply to a Parliamentary question here some time ago.  I want to make it clear that there is not any possibility whatever of sufficient money becoming available to make the Dublin street system capable of carrying the amount of traffic which desires to use it according to the present pattern of usage.  I think it was Deputy Carter who pointed out that to do this would absorb so much capital that there would be none available for the development of centres outside the Dublin area.  Of course, the Government's <Col N="264" /> policy is to try to decentralise industry and industrial development generally; and if all the money for infrastructure, for roads and so on, is absorbed here in making it possible for the Dublin street system to be used at the selfish rate of one person per car, then it will not be possible with the best will in the world to provide the necessary infrastructure for expansion in other areas.</P>
    <P>The Dublin traffic position will have to be tackled in a different way.  There just is not any question of sufficient money being available for the expensive acquisition of property, knocking down of good buildings, in order to widen streets and so on that would be called for.  Deputy Carter also referred to the proposals to establish a large industrial estate to the east of Dublin city by Dublin Bay.  That is a proposal which involves more than my Department, but I think it is fairly obvious that, if we are to have an industrial estate employing large numbers of men, they will have to come in from outside the city.  They will have to travel from where the population is housed in the North, West and South of Dublin city.  As we know the street system in Dublin is not capable of carrying any more than it is carrying at present.  In addition to that if we are also to have&mdash;although I suppose the industries would be mainly exportoriented&mdash;goods being transported out, then such a development would have very serious repercussions indeed on possible developments in other parts of the country.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is feasible to go into everything that was raised and I do not propose to do it.  I would just conclude by saying that throughout all the time this debate on the Estimate for my Department was going on, which was a month and a day, there was also an election campaign going on here in Dublin city and the matters which come within the province of my Department were made a particular issue in that election.  I think this debate was kept going in order to provide a platform for Opposition Deputies to misrepresent the position as much as they could, in particular with regard to the provision of housing. <Col N="265" /> They made every possible effort to do that but the people of Dublin South-West, just as the people of the country as a whole did last June, have very definitely rejected their proposals to tackle this serious problem in the irresponsible way they have suggested.  I suggest to them that they try and learn a lesson from that and deal with this subject in a responsible way in future rather than in the totally irresponsible way they have been dealing with it in the past.</P>
    <P>I am sorry if I disappoint the House on this occasion in not bringing the question of the sanitary services schemes which have been authorised since the last Estimate debate up to date, but since there was not on this occasion such a specific demand for them as there was by Deputy Treacy in the Estimate debate two years ago I propose to refrain from putting this list on the record, which I think would take me somewhat longer than it did two years ago because there is a two-year period involved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for External Affairs (Dr. Hillery)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £40,400 be granted to defray the charge which will come <Col N="266" /> in course of payment during the year ending on 31st day of March, 1970. for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for External Affairs and of certain services administered by that Office including a Grant-in-Aid.</P>
    <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose that the Supplementary Estimate for External Affairs and the Supplementary Estimate for International Co-operation be discussed together.</P>
    <P>The Supplementary Estimate for External Affairs is required to meet additional expenditure arising on subhead B&mdash;Travelling and Incidental Expenses, on subhead C&mdash;Post Office Services and on subhead D&mdash;Repatriation and Maintenance of Destitute Irish Persons abroad.  On subhead B, the additional requirement was caused mainly by the high level of payments by way of travel expenses and related expenditure arising from transfer of diplomatic staff, some over long distances. Expenditure on such transfers proved greater than originally envisaged. A general increase in the activities of the Department has resulted in increased travelling on official business by officers of the Department and also a greater use of the other services provided in the subhead&mdash;postage, telegrams, telephones and miscellaneous items.  In addition the services covered by the subhead have of course been affected by rising costs.  Deputies will appreciate that it is difficult to forecast travel costs and the extent of the use of the other services included in the subhead.</P>
    <P>Subhead C&mdash;Post Office Services&mdash; relates to expenditure on postage, telegrams, telephones and miscellaneous items incurred at headquarters.  Here again, the level of activity in the Department has resulted in higher expenditure than was originally anticipated. In addition, certain increases in postage and telegram rates have had an effect on expenditure under this subhead.</P>
    <P>With regard to subhead D, the number of persons repatriated or given financial assistance by our missions abroad has proved greater than originally estimated.  Expenditure on <Col N="267" /> repatriations in the normal way may reach £6,000 and provision has been made for an additional sum of £2,000 to provide for possible expenditure by the embassy at Lagos.  As the public become more travel conscious we must expect the number of persons applying to our missions for assistance, especially on the Continent, will tend to increase. Expenditure incurred on the repatriation and maintenance of Irish persons abroad is charged to this subhead and moneys subsequently recovered from persons who are repatriated is brought to account by way of Appropriations-in-Aid of the Vote.  An additional sum of £1,000 has been included in the Appropriations-in-Aid subhead to meet extra receipts in repatriation cases in the current financial year.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Supplementary Estimate for International Co-operation, Deputies will recall that the Dáil on 5th December last voted a sum of £35,500 for the UNICEF programme of assistance in Nigeria and in my statement at that time I explained the type of work which UNICEF had been doing in the war affected areas to help Nigerian mothers and children.  On 7th January UNICEF appealed for further contributions so that their Nigerian emergency programme could be continued. This appeal was made all the more urgent by the sudden new needs brought about by the ending of the civil war.  The Government decided on 13th January subject to Dáil approval to make an additional sum of £10,000 immediately available to UNICEF for the emergency relief and rehabilitation of women and children in Nigeria. UNICEF have announced that Ireland and Canada were the first two countries whose Governments responded to their appeal.</P>
    <P>Since the ending of the hostilities, UNICEF have continued to make a vital contribution in Nigeria in the areas most in need.  In close co-operation with the Nigerian Government authorities and the Nigerian Red Cross, UNICEF have been providing food and medical supplies and have made available transportation facilities and specialist medical personnel.  I am convinced that by supporting the work <Col N="268" /> of this United Nations agency we have been helping in an effective way to alleviate the suffering of women and children in Nigeria during this very difficult period.</P>
    <P>I should like to conclude by saying that I was very pleased to note that the Irish National Committee for UNICEF, from generous contributions received from the Irish public, made available a sum of £18,000 on 20th January in response to the UNICEF appeal for funds for Nigeria.  This sum is in addition to a previous amount of £25,000 made available by the national committee for the same purpose.  Thus the total Irish contribution to UNICEF&mdash; including the contributions of the Government and the national committee&mdash;for Nigeria now amounts to over £88,000.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of these Supplementary Estimates is, one mainly in respect of travelling and the other in respect of relief in connection with internation co-operation.  I note that the number of moves of departmental staff has involved an increased sum.  This is probably an appropriate occasion to say a word on this matter.  In so far as diplomatic services generally are concerned, because of their size there is no pattern of movement from one post to another in the sense that in certain other countries the practice is to leave people for more or less defined periods, usually about three years, sometimes a little longer and occasionally, of course, shorter.</P>
      <P>Some of our staff, particularly in the case of heads of missions, have had very long periods of service abroad and this causes a great deal of hardship to the individuals concerned and has a number of drawbacks otherwise. In some cases people are left too long abroad and get out of touch with events at home and indeed out of touch with the Department, except for periodic visits either on leave or when they are brought home for a discussion on a particular matter.  I appreciate that because of the size of the Department and the relatively small number of personnel available for certain posts, it is not easy to move them as regularly as is the case with the diplomatic corps of other countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="269" /> At the same time, experience has shown that when particular people are left abroad or even moved from one post abroad to another, it involves long periods away from home base and in fact, as in a number of cases, involves considerable hardship.  There is, therefore, a case for moving people after a reasonable term in a particular mission so that if it is not always possible to bring them to a home post, they would at least be moved to a post from which access to headquarters is easy.  Undoubtedly, travel is much quicker nowadays but in some cases some of the people who have been in North or South America have spent long periods abroad without ever coming home except, maybe, on the occasion of transfer from one post to another.</P>
    <P>It is right to express appreciation of the fine work which the staff of our missions abroad do.  Very often criticism is expressed of their failure to develop certain aspects of their representation, mainly in respect of trade, and I should like to hear from the Minister which missions have specifically assigned to them trade attachés or persons whose main function is in the sphere of trade.</P>
    <P>A number of years ago, when I was associated with the Department, a special circular was issued to all missions abroad urging the over-riding importance of trade.  The obligation was placed on each head of mission, and on the staff in each mission, with one or two possible exceptions such as the Vatican, to concentrate on trade matters.  Great developments have taken place in the interim.  The progress of CTT, and so on, has to some extent lessened the need for specific trade functions except in certain defined missions abroad.  People sometimes think, because this or that is not being done, that the staff are not zealous enough or vigorous enough in the promotion of trade.  It is not often appreciated that, in most of the missions abroad, the entire staff is very limited.  In some cases it consists of one head of mission and one or two supporting staff.  That imposes a considerable amount of work on the personnel concerned.  I shall be interested to hear <Col N="270" /> the Minister on general policy in that regard although this is hardly the occasion to develop it.</P>
    <P>The provision of relief has been the subject of discussion here recently.  The return of a number of missionaries has focused attention on the magnificent work our missionaries did in Nigeria and Biafra.  No words can adequately pay tribute to their services, their sacrifices and their devotion to the interests of the people among whom they were working&mdash;whether they were missionaries in the strict sense of priests and nuns or whether they were doctors, nurses or teachers engaged either in medical or nursing work or teaching in particular places.  The fact that so many people contributed to the appeal was itself evidence of its impact on this country.  The reaction was evoked by the contribution our missionaries made which typified years of service and years of devoted and dedicated work not only in Nigeria but in other areas as well.</P>
    <P>Some concern was felt as to whether the relief voted and the supplies sent were delivered to the areas most in need.  The general impression in this country was that the area which, up to recently, was described as Biafra was the place where the relief was required most urgently&mdash;if it is possible, in a situation of this sort, to regard any area or any set of conditions as being much better or much worse than others. Undoubtedly, in the aftermath of the conclusion of hostilities, the area that had been under the control of the Federal forces for the whole of the time appeared to have been better supplied and to be in a better position. The fact that so many of our missionaries were in the secessionist area and had particular knowledge and experience of the conditions there justified the response which people gave. I believe it gave rise to the anxiety in many quarters that the supplies and relief would, in the main, be directed to that area.  Of course, if there were any other specific cases or places where relief could be of assistance then, needless to say, it should have gone there, too.</P>
    <P>The efforts by the Irish committee and the contributions by the public reflected <Col N="271" /> very genuine sympathy.  None of us familiar in recent times with any appeal for charitable or relief purposes &mdash;or, for that matter, for any purpose at all&mdash;can recall such a spontaneous response from great numbers of people very many of whom could not afford as much as they contributed.</P>
    <P>The subheads of this Supplementary Estimate limit discussion.  There will be another opportunity of discussing other aspects of the Vote on the main Estimate. I note, however, that this covers the Council of Europe and also the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.  Perhaps the Minister would indicate generally, when replying, on what precise date it is proposed to issue the White Paper on EEC and indicate generally the aspects of our application intended to be covered in it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been something of a tradition here, in relation to the Estimate for the Department of External Affairs, that the Minister's introductory statement is rather uninformative.  I was hoping the new Minister would depart from that&mdash;as he has, to some extent.  At the same time, we are not getting a very complete picture even as regards the extra amounts required to sustain certain forms of activity abroad, which we ought to be able to debate here.</P>
      <P>This Vote, No. 45, is for a net total of £40,400.  We have some reason to believe that this is by no means complete as far as expenditure necessary to sustain activities abroad is concerned. Another Supplementary Estimate which we shall come to later, Vote No. 16, contains the item of Miscellaneous Expenses: Northern Ireland: Special Publicity&mdash;£70,000. That sum is almost double what is sought in the Supplementary Estimate now before us.  I believe also that, under the heading of Government Information Bureau under the Taoiseach's Department, there is supplementary expenditure, too.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All this arises out of one aspect of the country's activity which has been channelled through the Department of External Affairs and which ought to <Col N="272" /> be reflected in the Supplementary Estimate before us, that is to say the publicity, information or propaganda effort&mdash;whatever one likes to call it&mdash; which was conducted in foreign countries and therefore comes under the aegis of the Department of External Affairs during the period under review.</P>
    <P>I know that we shall have an opportunity of discussing Northern Ireland special publicity on Vote 16 but we shall be dealing in that case with the Minister for Finance and we have to take other matters connected with this to the Taoiseach.  This is all one thing and it would be much more coherent to deal with it under the umbrella where it belongs, that is, the very neatly rolled umbrella of the Minister for External Affairs.</P>
    <P>We ought to have the opportunity of discussing how far the activity of the Department of External Affairs is opportune.  I think it was and is inopportune as regards our relations with other countries and as regards the Northern Ireland problem I think it was negative.  Its positive effects were measured, as is often the case when propaganda is used, in the terrain of home politics.  It is questionable that the taxpayer should be called upon to contribute to the cost of an exercise which essentially served the domestic propaganda of the Government by appearing to answer the question: &ldquo;What are the Government doing about this problem?&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I notice that the Ceann Comhairle is looking at me in a somewhat sceptical fashion and I do not want to introduce matters which would have been dealt with in the main Estimate had we reached it then and which we shall have an opportunity to talk about with the Minister for Finance on another Supplementary Estimate.  I have a slight ground for uneasiness in discussing it on that Supplementary Estimate because whereas the Minister for External Affairs has always dealt informatively and courteously with questions from this side of the House the Minister for Finance has stated in the Dáil that he takes some personal pleasure in giving unsatisfactory answers to the Deputy who is at present addressing the House. That is unsatisfactory.  However, it is <Col N="273" /> a small issue compared with the general issue that we ought to be able to consider all the activities of the Department of External Affairs together.  We ought to consider how opportune they are and we ought to have an opportunity of asking the Minister for External Affairs what response he got from the special publicity activity.  I feel sure the Minister will tell us what benefit was derived from this additional activity. This arises not merely on another Estimate, but on this Supplementary Estimate also.</P>
    <P>We are told that a supplementary sum is required under subhead B of Vote 45, for travelling and incidental expenses amounting to £29,500.  The original estimate of £130,500 was a considerable underestimate.  We should like to know a little more about how this expenditure arose than what we are told in the Minister's speech:</P>
    <P>On subhead B, the additional requirement was caused mainly by the high level of payments by way of travel expenses and related expenditure arising from transfer of diplomatic staff, some over long distances. Expenditure on such transfers proved greater than originally envisaged.  A general increase in the activities of the Department has resulted in increased travelling on official business by officers of the Department...</P>
    <P>I should like to ask a few questions about that.  As this additional requirement arose both from transfers and from other travelling expenses would the Minister inform us what proportion was due to unforeseen transfers and what proportion was due to an increase in the activities of the Department which resulted in increased travelling? Would the Minister give us some information as to the increased activities of the Department?  Was the Department previously plunged in lethargy and is it just now being awakened by the Minister?  If that is so, let us hear that.  Does any proportion of this increase arise from the special efforts which were made at the time of the crisis in the North last August?  If it does, the House would be interested to hear what the activities were and exactly what benefit the country&mdash;as distinct from the governing <Col N="274" /> party&mdash;derived from these activities. Does any part of this arise&mdash; perhaps it does and if so the Minister will tell us&mdash;from the activities of those who were seconded from other services and attached as publicity officers to embassies at a given time?  We should like to know a good deal more about these increased activities.  It is very good that the activities of the Department of External Affairs have increased provided they have increased in the interests of the country generally and not only in the interests of the governing party.  If it is the case that they have resulted in benefit for the country generally surely the Minister will not conceal that from us?</P>
    <P>I do not want to say a great deal about Vote 46 but it strikes me that the sum involved is, in fact, very small in relation to the degree of concern which the people of this country have shown about the immense human disaster which occurred in Nigeria and in the area known formerly as Biafra, now part of the eastern region.  I thought the Government would have been moved to produce a sum other than what this is, that is to say, about one-third of the additional travelling and incidental expenses&mdash;the margin of error reflected in the Supplementary Estimate.</P>
    <P>In relation to this matter we would like to know what the Minister feels he can with propriety tell us about conditions in the devastated region and about the possibility of relief efforts reaching that area.  I speak with great restraint.  I have no intention of seeking any kind of political post-mortem on the issue which I do not think would serve any purpose.  There is here widespread concern about what has happened. It is as if a curtain had fallen. I appreciate that the Minister must be careful on this.  He must not seem to be intruding on the internal affairs of a sovereign State.  He must not do anything that will jeopardise the possibility of more effective aid from this country for the people who have been hit, whoever they may be.  Perhaps he could tell us whether Irish officials have been able to visit the devastated regions and have been able to form any opinion as to the amount and kind of rehabilitation that is taking place and what, if <Col N="275" /> anything, the Irish people might be able to do in relation to the situation in the future, apart from voting this rather small Supplementary Estimate.</P>
    <P>I would hope that the Minister would also give us his views about his responsibility as Minister for External Affairs for the co-ordination of what are politely called our information activities abroad, which also could be called our propaganda activities, and his view of the utility of such activities, whether they are to continue, whether in the developing situation in Northern Ireland he thinks it will or will not be useful to carry on such activities and, finally, whether he accepts the concept that his Department are the co-ordinators of information activities addressed to other countries.  Let us leave the Six County area or Northern Ireland out of it for the moment.  Let us not grapple with that constitutional issue. Does the Minister accept the concept that the Department of External Affairs are responsible for the co-ordination of publicity propaganda information addressed to other countries, including Great Britain, and if he does accept that concept, why is it not reflected in the Supplementary Estimate?</P>

Originally the Minister for External Affairs had, perhaps, one of the easiest jobs in the Government but it so happened that when the present occupant of that high office took over, he inherited a difficult situation.  First of all, he had to deal with the situation in Northern Ireland.  That is not relevant to this Supplementary Estimate. Subsequently there was the complete blow-out in Nigeria which this Estimate deals with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps, I have been one of the Minister's most severe critics in that I posed parliamentary questions to him which may have been a source of embarrassment. One day when he was not here to answer questions the substitute Minister replied that the policy was one of quiet diplomacy.  I think the day of quiet diplomacy in foreign affairs has passed.  Unless you assert your nationhood and your rights you are not likely to get satisfaction from the <Col N="276" /> parties concerned, whether they be great or small powers.</P>
    <P>May I take this opportunity&mdash;it is the first one I have had&mdash;to pay the highest tribute possible to our ambassador in Nigeria, Mr. Paul Keating, who has been under the greatest difficulty and the greatest strain during trying times in that country?  May I include in that tribute those who serve with him in the embassy?</P>
    <P>I note that the Minister has found it necessary to vote a greater sum for our embassies abroad.  I note with satisfaction that one of the embassies concerned is that in Nigeria.  The Minister and I are going a long way together in that I think he recognises that this country had a lot to do in Nigeria in the past and will probably have a lot to do there in the future.</P>
    <P>With regard to the money we are voting to UNICEF, I agree with Deputy Cruise-O'Brien that, although under international obligations we must pass everything through the Governments concerned, there is a particular problem of the most acute proportions relating to women and children in Nigeria.  The Minister should bear that in mind.  This sum is voted to UNICEF and, so far as they can, they channel the money through for the necessary rehabilitation and social work.</P>
    <P>It is an inescapable fact that, taking Nigeria as a whole and accepting that Biafra no longer exists, there is greater suffering in the south eastern region, which was the original territory that went under the name of Biafra, than in any other part of the country.  It should have been possible for the Minister to give us some idea of the conditions that prevail in that part of Nigeria.  I do not know whether he knows what these conditions are, because we have been unable to ascertain by way of parliamentary question what exactly happened when the collapse came, and what happened in relation to the work which was carried out so efficiently by Joint Church Aid and Caritas Internationalis.</P>
    <P>If I may inform the Minister of anything I have been able to discover, a certain amount of food is going into that area and we are providing a certain amount of money for the purpose <Col N="277" /> of rehabilitating women and children who suffered so much in that zone.  Though the food is going in there, and though things are slowly returning to normal, just as anywhere else in the world, you cannot get food unless you can pay for it.  In view of the fact that the Minister is the representative of the Irish nation and the Irish Government in the contribution we are making to Nigeria, he should be in a position to ascertain from the Nigerian Government if they propose to take any action to rectify the monetary situation in the area.  I take it that the money we are providing is for the purpose of feeding the women and children but if there is food in that area the people have to have money to buy it.</P>
    <P>My information, subject to correction by the Minister who has more opportunities of knowing what is going on than I have, is that the people have no money.  They have the original currency that existed before the collapse of the former Biafran State, but they have no money available except Biafran money.  Biafran money is not recognised by the Nigerian Government and, therefore, it is absolutely worthless and they are unable to buy anything.  The missionaries, the Irishmen who have dedicated their lives to charitable work abroad, found themselves in the position of being unable to help these unfortunate people financially because they have no money other than Biafran money.</P>
    <P>I think I am in order in suggesting to the Minister that, in giving this extra £10,000&mdash;which, incidentally, for the information of the House is not really £10,000 because the rate of exchange there is 17/- to the £; I found that out to my cost when I was out there; I thought I would get £ for £ but I only got 17/- to the £&mdash; he should impress upon the Nigerian Government that what is really required in the south eastern region state, which is now its official name, is money, and that the only way they can get money in the south eastern state is for the Nigerian Government to make some sort of arrangement under which Biafran currency would be worth something.  It is worth nothing at the moment and if you produce a <Col N="278" /> Biafran pound you could not buy anything.  Therefore, it would be valueless for us as a nation to make a contribution unless we were satisfied that was an overall contribution to the most necessitous parts of the Nigerian territory.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether we have any influence there or whether the Minister has any influence, but, perhaps, he would tell the House what exactly the position is.  This is a debate in connection with which we are endeavouring to help those who are in need.  When I left that country not much more than a month ago just before the collapse, there was certain aid going in there.  That food is no longer going in there by the channels through which it went in before.  Has the Minister any information, through our ambassador, from the Nigerian Government in regard to the distribution of food?  I want to impress upon the House&mdash;this is the first opportunity I have had of doing so&mdash;that when I left that territory there were thousands and thousands of people on the point of starvation.  They were kept alive by the inflow of food that was being sent to them by an organisation run largely by Irish priests and Irish nuns.</P>
    <P>Has the Minister an up to date report or is he relying&mdash;and this is where I would criticise him if he is&mdash;on quiet diplomacy?  The words &ldquo;quiet diplomacy&rdquo; were not used by the Minister himself but by the Minister who substituted for him here.  Quiet diplomacy, with my knowledge of the situation, leads me to believe that what we are doing is glossing over the disastrous situation that exists there, and it exists not only in the south eastern states but also very largely in the original Nigerian territory behind the fighting line.  Even if the money sent is a direct donation from the Government it is first raised from the taxpayer.  That money is produced by the Irish race as a whole, and we are entitled to have a full statement from the Minister as to how that money is used, and I do not think that is asking too much.  It may well be the Minister does not know.  If the Minister has adhered entirely to quiet diplomacy he probably will not know.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="279" /> The Minister for External Affairs is in charge of a Ministry which although it could be described as a mare's nest has at least achieved one thing, the realisation that Ireland can have and must have a separate foreign policy from that of other countries.  I would suggest to the Minister that he bears that in mind and bearing it in mind that he uses the full force of his high office to assert the right of Ireland to have the information direct from the countries concerned and not through a foreign power.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Minister for External Affairs (Dr. Hillery) Patrick J. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Minister for External Affairs (Dr. Hillery)</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Cosgrave that in a small service it is not possible to make frequent changes or to have people come home as frequently as we would desire: whatever their own feelings about the matter would be, there are mixed opinions about the advantages. Specific trade attachés exist in some of the bigger missions&mdash;London, EEC, Paris, Rome, but I would say that the ambassadors have been asked to bend their energies towards improving trade.  In connection with the main Estimate which we debated this year, I invited exporters from this country to make use of the expertise and local knowledge which is available to the embassies in various countries, and I hope they will do this.  If Deputies could think of any more formal way in which I could encourage this I should be glad to hear it from them. I could not hear it today, I suppose, but some other time.</P>
      <P>On the point made by Deputy Esmonde about Nigeria, the Nigerian Government is a sovereign independent government and they are not subject to the will of this House in any form. We have to deal with them on that basis or on no basis at all.  As a government, our only approach to relief in Nigeria and to the protection of our own citizens is through the Nigerian Government.  I should like to tell the House that the last of the Irish citizens are now out of the former enclave and I expect that by this time they are in Rome on their way home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The suggestion that £10,000 for Nigerian relief is not enough came from both Deputy Cruise-O'Brien and Deputy Esmonde.  I told the House <Col N="280" /> before that we have also offered £80,000 for Nigerian relief and rehabilitation and have been in touch, through our ambassador, with the Nigerian Government about the ways in which they might consider the amount could be best utilised.  In addition to that, there is the Government contribution to the Red Cross which comes under the Estimate for Defence.  There was a Supplementary Estimate for the Department of Defence recently and the Red Cross contribution was debated under that.</P>
    <P>The criticisms about Nigeria in this House should be balanced by a feeling of gratitude that all our citizens are now safely out of the former enclave, having come to the end of the civil war and a most difficult situation. There is reason for people here to express gratitude that this safe passage has been accorded and assured for our citizens.  This assurance was given to me when the war ended and I called the <i>chargé d'affaires</i> of the Nigerian Embassy in to see me.  There was an Irish nun killed in the war.  Her car was attacked by an aeroplane, but since the end of the war with the army and the Nigerian Government in charge our citizens' safety has been guaranteed and, as the House knows now, ensured.  Deputies know already that for a while representatives of the embassy were able to be in the war area, but at one stage they were kept out and have been kept out since.  It has been possible for us to get information on the situation there through people meeting other people from the area, and through international organisations.</P>
    <P>Generally speaking, the relief is developing well and supplies are beginning to flow better and organisation improving.  I gather from one group who were there that they came across very few cases of kwashiorker although they found some cases on the mend.  Deputy Desmond is right in assuming that I have no direct information because our people from the Embassy are excluded from that area. What information I have is that the situation is improving all the time.  My main concern has been the protection <Col N="281" /> of Irish citizens, which is really my business.  We were entitled as a Government to seek their protection and we sought it and were guaranteed it. Going into the affairs of another nation can only be done on the basis of wanting to help and offering help and we have done that.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sir Anthony Esmonde says the day for quiet diplomacy is past. This is not true.  One cannot approach problems with an open mouth all the time or one can cause harm and do damage.  I suppose it must be part of the job of a Minister for External Affairs to have people assume he is doing nothing if he is not shouting it from the house tops but, certainly, a great deal of the good&mdash;the protection of our citizens in Nigeria since the end of the war&mdash;was due to quiet diplomacy and a great deal of our residual goodwill has been maintained because of the understanding of this by our missionaries, by our channels of communication and by most Deputies.  I think the Deputy should revise his opinion and he might adopt the motto of an American statesman who had on his desk: &ldquo;Today is a good day to keep your mouth shut&rdquo;.  I should not wish Deputies to stop talking altogether but I should like him to move away a little from the idea that quiet diplomacy is dead and gone.</P>

    <P>I am grateful to him for mentioning Ambassador Keating and his staff.  I have had letters of appreciation from representatives of the missionaries who were loud in their praises of what was done by Ambassador Keating and Mr. Small and their predecessors Mr. Rush and Mr. Ó Tuathail.  All the missionaries, I think, have been fully aware of what our staff and Embassy were <Col N="282" /> doing and I am glad the Deputy has put this on the records of the House.</P>
    <P>I am not sure what I should say about the enlargement of the Government Information Bureau which took place in the autumn in relation to events in the North of Ireland and our particular interest in them.  I think no Deputy will deny that we have a very particular interest in what happens there.</P>

      <P>There was a period in dealing with the problem at the UN when I came to the decision that the time had come for quiet diplomacy and I made it known.  I cannot say anything to what the Deputy has said: I had already said it myself.  At the same time I think that what happened in the north and at the UN, and everything associated with it, did have its own good effect.  The expansion of the bureau and the cost of it will be debated here on a Supplementary Estimate to be introduced by the Minister for Finance, I think.  It was an <i>ad hoc</i> arrangement and is no longer in existence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is intended that the information service of the Department of External Affairs will be expanded.  This decision had been taken but events at the time suggested to the Government that more information was needed in other countries.  Apart from the expansion of the bureau there was more activity in the missions as we asked our missions to let the Governments to which they were accredited know of the true situation as accurately as possible.  I do not think I would be entitled, even though Deputy Dr. O'Brien did deal with the expansion of the bureau, to discuss this. It would scarcely be fair to the person whose Supplementary Estimate it is. I do not think there will be any attempt to be unco-operative.  The Deputy should not be too sensitive about that. I cannot make promises, of course.  It is not in this Supplementary Estimate. It concerns the Government Information Bureau, not the Department of External Affairs and it would seem <Col N="283" /> inappropriate on my part to attempt to discuss it.</P>

I could not estimate the utility but I would say that those involved were people at the top of their profession.  This was their work and they were contributing to their country's needs at the time.  Their intentions were good but I would not assume the role of an expert to assess the effects.  None of us can do that in respect of what we do; there is no feedback of that nature.

      <P>When the main Estimate was before the House a number of Deputies expressed regret that the Estimate for the year 1969-70 was reduced.  I tried to explain to the House then that, in fact, we would overexpend the money then provided and this has now proved to be the case.</P>
      <P>This Supplementary Estimate is for increased expenditure on some of the services provided by the Office of Public Works and to regularise certain payments.</P>
      <P>The total amount required is £294,000, but £44,000 of this will be met from increased receipts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The excess under subhead B is caused by the greater amount of travelling <Col N="286" /> found necessary to deal with the activities of the Office and by increases in the allowances for travelling and subsistence.</P>
    <P>The extra amount under subhead D is to meet the cost of accommodation needed urgently for the Language Institute.  The need was not foreseen when the original estimate was being prepared.</P>
    <P>The main increases are for primary school building and arterial drainage. School building work has gone ahead very satisfactorily this year and the total expenditure is expected to reach £3.6 million.</P>
    <P>The £52,000 required for arterial drainage is to meet increases in wages granted during the year.</P>
    <P>The sum of £1,000 provided separately under subhead EE is to regularise the payments for Killybegs fishery harbour scheme following the passing of the Fishery Harbour Centres Act 1969.</P>
    <P>Subheads F1 and F2 cover the maintenance and furnishing of State premises. The excess on these services is due to increased costs and to the requirements being higher than was expected. The increases on subhead F4 are due to increases in the charges for electricity and other fuels.</P>
    <P>Subhead H covers the purchase and maintenance of engineering plant, machinery and stores.  The additional sum required reflects increased costs and calls on the services provided by the Central Engineering Workshop.</P>

      <P>I agree with the Parliamentary Secretary that when the main Estimate was introduced most Deputies, including myself, felt a little aggrieved that the Estimate was less than the figure we all felt it should be. I do not think that this extra £250,000 <Col N="287" /> is doing the work most of the Deputies suggested should be carried out by the Office of Public Works.  This sum is mainly in respect of increases in costs, charges and wages.  In considering the figure of £250,000 in an Estimate of approximately £9 million, it is fair comment to say that there was a very poor attempt made at proper estimation.</P>
      <P>The biggest item here is under subhead F1 where a figure of £125,000 is quoted for maintenance and supplies. I find it difficult to believe, even with the extra cost and increases in prices, that that figure should be so high.  Subhead H, which refers to maintenance of plant and machinery, also shows a large increase.  Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary would say when replying whether any new plant or machinery was purchased that was not anticipated when the Estimate was being prepared?</P>
      <P>It was reported to me some time ago that there was a danger that many of the labourers employed in Board of Works schemes would be redundant before the end of this financial year. I should like to know if this is the case and also whether the employment there is as high as it was previously: were any labourers disemployed in any of the schemes undertaken by the Board of Works since last Christmas?</P>
      <P>There is a reference to a sum of £3.6 million being spent on schools.  When this Estimate was being discussed I agreed that any money spent on schools throughout the country was a step in the right direction and I still hold this opinion.  However, rumour has it that there will be a slowing down in the building of schools and I should like if the Parliamentary Secretary would tell us whether he has any indication either from the Minister for Finance or from the Government that that is part of that policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think the House will object to the provision of this money since, as the Parliamentary Secretary said, we all asked on the main estimate debate that this work should be done.  The only comment I have to make is that I do not see that any of the extra work or more useful work we suggested will <Col N="288" /> be undertaken as a result of the provision of this money.  I am appealing to the Minister, therefore, first of all to ensure that there will be no redundancy from the point of view of employment in the Board of Works and, secondly, to ensure the construction, maintenance and heating of schools.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary says that the main increases under subheads E and G are for primary school building and arterial drainage. He says:</P>
      <P>School building work has gone ahead very satisfactorily this year and the total expenditure is expected to reach £3.6 million.</P>
      <P>The Board of Works are doing a reasonably good job but there are still far too many substandard schools.  I do not know what the Parliamentary Secretary can do about these.  I do not know whether or not he can attempt to increase substantially the amount of money available.  Last year I had a question down about schools in my constituency, a constituency close to Dublin city, and I was appalled at the number of substandard schools. Now the fact that some schools are so bad is because it does not appear to have been anybody's responsibility to keep them in repair and, if a school starts going down hill, it is only a matter of time before lack of maintenance, repainting and repair leaves the school in a condition in which it is close to being unfit for human habitation.  There are far too many of these schools.  It is shocking to find schools built as recently as 25 years ago in that condition. No one seems to have any responsibility for maintenance.  I do not know whether it is the school manager, the inspector, the Board of Works, or the teacher who should see that maintenance is carried out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am opposed to the idea that it does not matter what kind the surroundings are in the schools.  It is unrealistic to ask us to have young people growing up in such surroundings. Inevitably they will become vandals when they find they can break windows, damage doors, pull up floorboards, or anything else they like, and nobody will pass any remark.  It should be the responsibility of the principal <Col N="289" /> to see that the schools are kept in good repair.  The pupils should be encouraged to keep the schools clean and tidy. Every effort should be made to provide pleasant surroundings, including flower beds where possible.  Where there is a playground it should be kept clean and neat., It is shocking to see playgrounds littered with luncheon wrappers.  No effort appears to be made to keep some of the playgrounds in order.  The Parliamentary Secretary might pay a little attention to this and see if some improvement can be made.</P>
    <P>There are exceptions.  There are schools which are a joy to look at. Apparently those who work in them take an interest in both the pupils and their surroundings.  As I say, these schools are a joy to look at.  But the opposite is the case far too often.  In addition, there is the old story, more relevant to the Department of Education, I admit, where a school built a few short years ago and still in excellent condition is closed down and the pupils transferred to another bigger centre, a centre in which additional classrooms have to be built to cater for the extra pupils.  There is something wrong in this.  Enough attention is not being given to this by the Department of Education and, if they do not give it, then it is the responsibility of the Parliamentary Secretary to see that public money is not wasted.</P>
    <P>We could talk about arterial drainage all day.  The Parliamentary Secretary says:</P>
    <P>The £52,000 required for arterial drainage is to meet increases in wages granted during the year.</P>
    <P>I assume this refers to the famous 25/-and the £1.  Last April practically every worker in the country got a wage increase. No State employee got an increase at that time but, after a good deal of shemozzle and after a special sub-committee was set up, it was agreed to give these workers an increase of 25/-, not from April but from June. This was a little bit of sharp practice. That was followed by another £1 in October.  It was quite a long time before that money was paid to some of those employed on arterial drainage. Apparently no provision was made for the extra money needed to meet these <Col N="290" /> increases and the result was that drainage maintenance workers were laid off work, although the work was there for them, and they are still unemployed. If anybody thinks it is improving the worker's lot to give him an increase of £2 5s a week and then give him eight months work instead of twelve he does not know very much about the economics of the working man's home.  Possibly those who decided this was the way to do things are the people who have 52 weeks wages every year.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary is relatively new to the job.  I have discussed these things with him.  I have found him very approachable.  He is prepared to look at my side and in one particular case he was able to be of considerable assistance.  Now I do not like writing to Parliamentary Secretaries or Ministers about matters which should be dealt with by officials and so I try to deal with officials, but it is a little ridiculous when someone writes and says that the men on X scheme cannot be restarted until some time in May, which is the usual time, when in fact I know and they know that the men on X scheme have always been employed up until the middle of January, off in February and part of March, and usually starting again in early April.  This sort of thing does not help to engender good labour relations and the Parliamentary Secretary could help by getting these people to understand that facts are facts.</P>
    <P>There is another matter of which the Parliamentary Secretary might take note.  In arterial drainage we are dealing with men who are on little more than a bare subsistence.  The money they get for the job they do brings them only from one week to another. If a man was liable to income tax&mdash; God knows, very few even lowly paid workers escape now&mdash;the Minister for Finance took approximately 11/- out of that £2 5s. increase.  If the man was living in a local authority house the local authority took half-a-crown in the £&mdash;not 3/8 which is what it is in Dublin &mdash;which represented another 5/-.  There was an increase in the stamp from 1st January and the £2 5s has suddenly become £1 and a few shillings of an increase.  We are, I think, reaching the <Col N="291" /> stage at which when wage negotiations are being carried out we will have to start taking into consideration what the take home wage is&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJBurke" hpid="Mr. P.J. Burke Mr. P.J. Burke">

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;rather than what is being paid as a gross wage.  It is most unfair to give a man the impression that he is getting an increase of £2 5s to enable him to live better and to buy the necessities of life when that £2 5s turns out to be £2 5s less £1, which the State, which is granting him the increase, takes back from him. This is simple economics.  It has to be dealt with some time and the quicker the Parliamentary Secretary deals with it the better.  Men employed on arterial drainage are working at the dirtiest job possible.  They have to take mud, stones and all sorts of muck out of the rivers.  They are exposed to the elements from early morning to late at night.  The Office of Public Works have got their employees to work long hours during the summer.  They work these hours needing the money from overtime because their wage rates are so low.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A definite effort must be made to improve the wages of these people. A wage demand has been served on the Office of Public Works.  The very least we could expect is that within a period of a few weeks a conference would be arranged to discuss these matters.  Apart from a simple acknowledgment, such as is used for acknowledging everything in the Office of Public Works, no notification has been received.  Could I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to find out from the officials when they mean to open negotiations with the trade unions on the question of this year's wages?  The wage rates should operate from 1st April, 1970, and not from 1st June next.  It is only fair that the employees of the Office of Public Works should be treated in the same way as employees in other jobs.  They should know at least their position.  They should not be thrown something in a &ldquo;take it or leave it&rdquo; way.  We have now the right to take the case of employees of the Office of Public <Col N="292" /> Works and other State employees to the Labour Court.  We do not want to go to the Labour Court with all sorts of complaints.  Unless the Office of Public Works improve labour relations, they will find they will have to have the same treatment as everybody else and will have to discuss publicly the rate of wages they are trying to justify, rather than in the boardrooms, with people representing the workers who are prepared to discuss the matter in a reasonable way.</P>
    <P>The £52,000 required here is to meet increases in wages during the year.  Can I take it this sum will now have the effect of re-employing some of the people laid off because of the fact that money was short in a particular period? Can I also take it that an effort will be made by the Parliamentary Secretary to ensure that a substantial wage increase for the coming year will be included in the Estimate so that we will not have this situation again where men are laid off because the money was not available even though the work was there to be done?</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary, referring to subheads F1 and F2 said:</P>
    <P>Subheads F1 and F2 cover the maintenance and furnishing of State premises.  The excess on these services is due to increased costs and to the requirements being higher than was expected.  The increases on subhead F4 are due to increases in the charges for electricity and other fuels.</P>
    <P>I assume that &ldquo;State premises&rdquo; includes Dáil Éireann.  Might I refer to the fact that on the floor used by the Labour Party two rooms which were available when not in use for sub-committee meetings have been locked for a considerable period and have not been made available to the Labour Party since they were taken over?</P>

I notice there have been quite a substantial number of Supplementary Estimates moved over the last few weeks.  I would imagine they have run as high as the sum which would have been found by a mini-budget if there had not been a by-election in Dublin South-West.  It was not politic to have that mini-budget because of the by-election.  I will be most interested to see the provision made for this over-expenditure in the Budget which is coming soon.</P>

      <P>One point I wish to mention arises from amalgamation of national schools.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>Before any of these buildings fall into disrepair, or even ruin, they should be disposed of. This would apply also to any lands which are held.  These lands are usually small plots.  These small plots of land can become unsightly, if neglected.  It is not to be expected that the Office of Public Works would look after all these small pieces of land.  As building sites are becoming very valuable, I would suggest that any derelict land which will not be used for any purpose and any derelict or vacated buildings should be put up for sale by public auction or public tender.  Where schools have been closed, local philanthropic or development associations should be given first option in the negotiation with the Office of Public Works for the purchase of the buildings.  There are many cases where local development committees, charitable organisations, credit unions, or any organisation working for the local benefit, either economic or philanthropic, could make good use of these premises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a pity to see around the country-side schools, closed because of amalgamation, being neglected and falling into disrepair.  When such properties are not being used by the Board of Works they should be either sold to or placed at the disposal of local bodies or, indeed, put up for public sale for any other use.  In Donegal we have Fort Leenan which was handed over to the Government in the 'thirties and which is not now used as a military fort but is under the Office of Public Works.  A local development committee is very much interested in this property and they feel they could make use of it or could encourage some person, company or group of persons to use it for the benefit of the area.  I have already suggested to the Parliamentary Secretary that it should be disposed of to the local development committee at an agreed reasonable price or else it should be let to them at a reasonable <Col N="295" /> rent.  What could happen in such cases is that such properties could be bought by a person who might have no interest in local development and the community, therefore, would derive no benefit.</P>
    <P>In general, I would suggest that schools or other buildings which have been vacated for one reason or another should be disposed of rather than be retained until their value drops.  All of the schools which have closed because of amalgamation are not owned by the Office of Public Works and I am sorry to say that the position here is even worse.  I know of many schools that have been closed and no use whatever is being made of the buildings. In some cases they are not bad buildings. The Parliamentary Secretary has no control over those schools but where schools are owned by the Board of Works he has and I should like him to take action.</P>
    <P>My second point deals with the erection of national schools.  Although we hear about protests and agitation against the closing of a school or schools because of amalgamation the public may get the idea that there is wholesale disagreement with the policy. This is not so.  It is only isolated cases which reach the headlines and the hundreds and hundreds of cases where agreed amalgamation has taken place never reach the headlines at all.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The policy of closing schools would be more properly a matter for the Department of Education.  I do not think the Parliamentary Secretary would have any function whatsoever.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree, but the point I am trying to make is that where there is agreement for amalgamation involving the erection of a new school, where everybody is agreed that two or three schools should be closed and that amalgamation should take place &mdash;and this is happening in 90 per cent of the cases&mdash;the grumble in part of the area I represent, and, indeed, in most areas, is over the delay in erecting the school.  Where everybody has agreed there should be very little delay in erecting the school.  Where there is disagreement a case might be made <Col N="296" /> for delaying the erection of a new school but where there is 100 per cent agreement&mdash;between parents, teachers, manager and Department&mdash;every effort should be made to have the school erected quickly.  There are a number of cases in my area where the agitation is not against amalgamation but over the delay of the Board of Works in erecting these schools.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="Mr. S. Browne Mr. S. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Parliamentary Secretary pointed out, the main increases here are for primary school buildings and arterial drainage.  It is only right that we should congratulate the Board of Works and the Parliamentary Secretary on the type of schools being built, on the design, the lay-out, etc.  Recently I was in a neighbouring village, Blackwater, near Enniscorthy, and I saw there a beautiful new school which is a tribute to the Board of Works and those responsible for it.  My main reason for contributing to this debate is to mention schools for mentally handicapped. Recently a school was completed in Enniscorthy for the mentally handicapped and, again, it was a very fine building.  While, again, in the first instance, it is a matter for the Department of Education I would urge the Parliamentary Secretary to get ahead with the building of these schools for the mentally handicapped.  There is a proposal for a school in Wexford town and the plans are with the Parliamentary Secretary's office and I hope sanction will be forthcoming in the very near future and that they will be able to get ahead with the job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was also mentioned by the Parliamentary Secretary that £52,000 required for arterial drainage is to meet increases in wages granted during the year.  I am sure nobody has any objection to the increases granted to the workers in this section of the Board of Works and, like Deputy Tully, I would like to see greater increases under this heading.  These people work very hard and deserve everything we can give them.  We cannot divorce the workers' wages from the work they do so I should like to mention the question of urgent drainage works.  I know that there are definite well laid down priorities for arterial drainage <Col N="297" /> but there are urgent drainage matters and I feel the Parliamentary Secretary should have some latitude in dealing with these.  We had the Parliamentary Secretary in Wexford recently to look at one of these problems.  I hope he will find it possible to provide the necessary funds to look after this urgent matter.  It is a problem that will affect something like 9,000 to 10,000 acres of arable land if it is attended to.</P>
    <P>At subhead K the Parliamentary Secretary says that a survey of provincial museums, great gardens and historic houses has been carried out by An Taisce.  I am interested in the provincial museums.  A few years ago a local committee in Enniscorthy, headed by the late administrator of the town, Father Ransome, acquired the ancient Norman castle there which was in a remarkable state of preservation and turned it into a folk museum.  This museum is now something which attracts visitors from far and near to Enniscorthy.  I should like to know whether the Parliamentary Secretary has formulated any policy in relation to this type of museum because it is something that is very worthy of support.</P>

A river in north Dublin, commonly known as the Ballyboughal River, is the cause of flooding of hundreds of acres of land.

With regard to the purchase of engineering plant I want to say that modern machinery is most essential for any progressive Department. I hope that work will continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With reference to provincial museums I believe that, as we are depending so much on the tourist trade, every area should have its own historic museum. It would be a good thing if committees were set up in the different counties to deal with this.  There are many <Col N="299" /> museum pieces to be found in the homes in various counties.</P>

      <P>While the Supplementary Estimate does not permit of very wide discussion I consider that I should not let the occasion pass without <Col N="300" /> expressing my pleasure that the tremendous work being carried out by An Taisce is now being recognised and that a grant-in-aid of £3,000 is being made available to this organisation. It is not generally appreciated and the public are not generally aware of the aims and ideals of this organisation and the tremendous amount of work which they have been doing quietly and without publicity.</P>
      <P>An Taisce have done a tremendous job in focussing attention on the great heritage of this country, particularly, historic buildings and places.  The survey now being carried out by An Taisce will reveal an interesting situation. Deputy Burke referred to the more practical aspect of the programme for preserving historic buildings, that they have very great potentiality as regards the tourist industry.  While realising that these memorials are of great interest to many tourists we must not lose sight of the importance of making our great heritage known to the younger generation.  I have personal knowledge and experience of the work that has been and is being done by An Taisce and I welcome the grant-in-aid in this Supplementary Estimate.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the efforts of An Taisce to restore, at least in part, the historic walls of Limerick.  A great practical example of the value of our ancient buildings in so far as the tourist industry is concerned is Bunratty Castle which is situated a few miles outside Limerick.  Here, an ancient building has been restored to its original condition and, due to the tremendous promotional work and imaginative planning by the Shannon Development Company, has become a tremendous tourist attraction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, while I welcome this grant-in-aid I am puzzled as to how the figure of £3,000 was arrived at. The Parliamentary Secretary might give us some additional information in this regard.  The carrying out of any survey nowadays is a costly business and relatively small social surveys have cost several thousand pounds.  I am wondering if the amount provided will be adequate.  Certainly, the Parliamentary Secretary will have sympathetic support for any efforts he may <Col N="301" /> make to uphold the work of An Taisce and to assist in preserving our great heritage.</P>
    <P>I wish to make one or two points with regard to arterial drainage and I hope the Ceann Comhairle will allow me to do so.  Under the subhead for arterial drainage, we are told, an additional £2,000 is required.  The question of arterial drainage is very much in the minds of the people of the constituency which I have the honour to represent.  This is because of the recent decision of the High Court in relation to the draining of the river Maigue.  I should like to know what will happen in this regard since the original scheme has been thrown out and the High Court decision has been given against the Board of Works.  If the Parliamentary Secretary can throw any light on this matter I shall be very grateful.  If he has not got the information now he might be kind enough to write to us giving the information.  This decision of the High Court has come as a bombshell to the hundreds of farmers who were told years ago that the river Maigue would be drained and that all was in readiness. Unfortunately a flaw was discovered in the Adare area.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to let us have whatever information he can as to what will happen now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I should just like to make a few remarks in regard to this Supplementary Estimate.  A great deal of the activity of the Board of Works relates to the building of schools and I must say that the work seems to have been done in an excellent manner. Nobody has found fault with the work to date.  However, as some of the previous speakers remarked, a number of the older schools that have now become vacant are the cause of some trouble and local people or local organisations would like to acquire these schools.  Therefore, I join with those Deputies in urging the Parliamentary Secretary to facilitate those people to the extent within his power.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My reason for rising on this occasion is to make a few remarks about arterial drainage.  It is obvious that very good work has been done throughout <Col N="302" /> the country in this regard but, unfortunately, my constituency does not seem to be in a position of any priority in this connection.  For all practical purposes, the constituency is surrounded by water because of the various rivers on each side most of which flow into the Shannon.</P>
    <P>The River Shannon has received some publicity in the past and I am aware that work has been started on that river.  To this extent, any promises that have been made have been fulfilled but it is obvious to any reasonable person that it would take a very long time to conclude anything definite in relation to this river.  We are told that the tributaries flowing into the Shannon cannot be drained until such time as the Shannon itself has been drained but it is my opinion that some new thinking will have to be done in this regard because, as I see it, we will have to wait an indefinite time to have work carried out on those rivers.</P>
    <P>There is the other problem which has been aired here by Deputy Seán Browne as regards the smaller rivers. I will certainly go along with everything he has said in urging the Parliamentary Secretary to provide money for schemes to deal with small rivers. I understand there is a scheme for draining intermediate rivers which flow into the sea or into certain lakes but again they seem to be caught up in this question of Shannon drainage.  We are told even the smaller rivers cannot be drained.  I would urge the Parliamentary Secretary to take particular note of this problem and to make provision by way of Supplementary Estimate or main Estimate for this purpose.  Flooding of these rivers has been a source of trouble and there is tremendous demand for drainage. This problem is not confined to my constituency.  I would urge the Parliamentary Secretary to give very serious consideration to this matter before the introduction of another Estimate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say first in relation to the question of redundancy that Deputy Tully and Deputy Barry are fully aware that redundancy is a seasonal hazard in so far as maintenance of <Col N="303" /> the various rivers that have been drained is concerned.  There is no fixed date when people are let off and there is no fixed date when they are employed. The information so far as I can ascertain is that re-employment starts some time around April and maybe in some cases not until May.</P>
      <P>The fact that we have made provision for £52,000 in this Supplementary Estimate should allay any worry Deputy Tully has in particular that because the men got a rise they were let go ahead of time.  This sum of money has been provided for the purpose of paying the increases in wages and I am very glad I was able to get this sum to retain people in employment as long as I possibly could.  I would like to say, however, so far as I am personally concerned, and so far as discussions as to next year's Estimate are concerned, if I can help it in no instance will I allow those maintenance schemes to terminate before Christmas.  It goes against the grain with me to see people laid off a couple of weeks before Christmas but this is sometimes necessary due to water levels and many other factors which money has nothing to do with whatsoever. There are a great number of factors affecting the length of the maintenance work and money is not the most important. In fact, sometimes we run into difficulty about the availability of seasonal employees.  Sometimes they are just not available at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very pleased to say that as a result of general Government policy the instances of unemployment are very much less than they were some years ago.  I expect that starting in April, not necessarily in Deputy Tully's area, various seasonal employees will be taken on <Col N="304" /> for maintenance work again.  They will be taken on as they are required in the different areas depending on the merits of each individual case.</P>
      <P>I should like to say that wage negotiations are a matter for the trade unions.  The various unions which have to negotiate with the Office of Public Works have found the establishment people are prepared to sit down and talk reasonably with them in the hope of reaching an amicable settlement. I certainly do not try to intervene if I can help it.  I have received deputations regarding complaints about conditions rather than about wage levels and I have in some instances been able at least to help a compromise to be reached between my officials and the officials of the trade union.  Settlements are reached between the Office of Public Works and the trade unions in the ordinary manner of wage negotiations as obtains in private industries.</P>

I am quite sure they will not delay negotiations for any ulterior motive the Deputy might be suggesting.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I can say that in fact the settlements we made with some of the employees in the Deputy's union last year were slightly above the national average.  With regard to Deputy Cunningham's question regarding the disposal of surplus property we are compelled by statute to dispose of any surplus property either by way of tender or auction, that is, provided no other Government Department require this property for their own purpose.  If another Government Department require it they get first option and the property is not sold.  It is not necessary, however, for the Office of Public Works to accept the highest bid at an auction or the highest bid by tender.  The Office of Public Works will always be conscious of public amenity.  In fact, in recent times we have demonstrated our interest in this field more than in any other field.  In regard to any property in the hands of the Office of Public Works which is of artistic or historic merit, or which might be spoiled by commercial development, whereas a local authority, a harbour authority or a local voluntary organisation could put it to greater use as a public amenity, that will certainly be taken into full account on every occasion.  I certainly have no intention of selling St. Patrick's Island to the hippies.  In the first place, I do not own it and the Office of Public Works do not own it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was pleased with Deputy Seán Browne's contribution.  Unfortunately it is not very often that we hear Deputies paying a tribute to the professional staff of my office and I wish I could hear more of this in future speeches here.  There is very little doubt that the professional staff in the Office of Public Works are not only highly-skilled <Col N="306" /> personnel but they are dedicated to the job.</P>
    <P>Deputy Browne referred to a drainage problem and I thank him and Deputy Allen for having invited me down to see Tacumshane Lake in County Wexford.  Not only had I a very educational day but the hospitality was exceptional and I now have got the proposal of the local engineers and farmers.  It is being examined and there will be communication between the Office of Public Works engineers and the local engineers.</P>
    <P>Deputy Browne also referred to castles and other such matters.  Anybody who has studied Estimates for the Office of Public Works in recent years will appreciate that increasing amounts of money are being devoted towards monuments and other ruins. There is increasing awareness now in regard to local and national monuments and museums.  As far as we can see from the archaeological survey we have carried out, there will be more than 1.2 million monuments to be looked after within the State and we must depend very largely on local authorities in this direction.  When I was in Wexford with Deputy Browne I came across one of the first stone churches of the Penal Days.  It is in private ownership now and there is nothing to prevent the farmer on whose lands it stands from demolishing it.  I seriously hope the local authority concerned will put a preservation order on this building.  If they do not, I should like the Deputies from the area to draw it to my attention and I will then see what I can do about it at national level.</P>
    <P>Deputy P. J. Burke expressed concern about certain improvements that might be made in the furnishings of this House, particularly the &ldquo;adjournment chamber&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not tell you. I have been all over this House and I have had consultations with the architect in charge and with the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach.  We have decided in principle that many improvements are required in the furnishings of the House but that these improvements <Col N="307" /> will not be made until the Summer Recess.  This comes under the general heading and there is no particular sum of money allocated for doing one room or another.</P>
      <P>While on this subject, I should like to make one thing clear regarding the buildings and furnishings of this House. When I replied to a parliamentary question on behalf of the Minister for Finance recently regarding the cost of the buildings and furniture in this House no Deputy opposite, to my surprise, asked a supplementary question. Nevertheless, editorial and other writings in the press were very critical regarding the figure I gave.  Had I been pressed on that occasion I would have said that a large proportion of that sum was required for normal day-to-day maintenance.  This is recurring all the time.  I would have said also that the cost of all the new buildings and furniture, if you take them at today's values as against the values of the day when the work was begun, is well below the cost originally provided for that purpose.</P>
      <P>Deputy P. J. Burke was worried about the Ballyboughal River, which involves an intermediate scheme, and Deputy T. O'Donnell spoke about the Maigue.  Both are interrelated.  The situation regarding the Maigue is unfortunate. There are hundreds of farmers who find themselves without the benefit of this scheme, which took years and years to prepare, involving a lot of money, time and expertise.  The Arterial Drainage Act worked successfully since 1945 and the first time anybody decided to challenge it was in relation to the Boyne.  Fortunately, we were able to reach a solution in that respect.  Now we have been challenged again and an injunction has been granted preventing us presenting this scheme to the Minister for Finance for sanction.  I should like to tell Deputy O'Donnell that the judgment is being studied with a view to a possible appeal to a higher court.  We are also examining the question of whether the 1945 Act might be amended to enable us to begin this drainage scheme.</P>

The judgment is being examined in detail and I hope to have a report on it in the next week or so. I would be happy if the Deputy communicated with me or my private secretary.  As I have said, it is a serious situation.  If this large scheme has to be postponed I am examining the possibility of proceeding with some of the intermediate and minor schemes which were not being dealt with because it was felt that to deal with the major catchments was the best way to get value for money.  What about bringing the people from Limerick up to the Boyne?</P>

      <P>To Deputy Barry I would say that I do not think there is any significance in the Supplementary Estimate from the point of view of the purchase of any new heavy machinery.</P>
      <P>Deputy Burke's intermediate scheme may now be considered as a result of the vacuum arising out of the Maigue decision.</P>
      <P>St. Patrick's Island cannot be dealt with by the Office of Public Works. The remains of the church have been made the subject of a preservation order.

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="310" /> Deputy Dr. Gibbons referred to the Shannon.  I have decided to put more staff on the Shannon survey work, although I am fully aware that that decision may be a case of robbing Peter to pay Paul.  There, again, the decision regarding the Maigue will influence whether extra survey work on the Shannon might in some way hold up or delay other catchment schemes. The whole question of whether we can continue with drainage under the present legislation must be examined very thoroughly.</P>
    <P>I was disappointed that Deputy Cunningham implied we were delaying the erection of new schools.  The allocation for schools in the Office of Public Works this year was £3 million. My main reason for being here today is that, by the end of the financial year, we shall have overspent by nearly £600,000.  We are forging ahead with as many schemes as possible.  I think our school building programme is now geared to such a stage that financial provisions cannot slow it down.  Deputy Barry said there was a rumour it would be slowed down.  We are spending £3.6 million in the current financial year.  The allocation for the year before was £700,000, yet we spent just £3 million.  The Office of Public Works invariably has to come to this House with a Supplementary Estimate because of subhead E&mdash;School Building.  The Minister for Finance must consider all the priorities.  The money being spent on schools is a record and is far in excess of what was envisaged even when the original Estimate was prepared.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Tully that landscaping is a very desirable feature of schools: it will follow the erection of the schools, in due course.  I think our design of schools has improved.  The amenities for the children have improved.  I hope we shall continue to improve all aspects in this connection as we go along.</P>

If the manager requires improvements, additions, repainting or other maintenance work, the Minister will have the matter examined.  In most cases, he accepts because the manager comes only when the work is needed.  There is very little delay before the Office of Public Works intervenes.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £750,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on 31st day of March, 1970, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and of certain other services administered by that Office, and for payment of a grant-in-aid.</P>
      <P>As Deputies are aware, the main Estimate for my Department amounting to £25,410,000 net was, in common with a number of others, passed without debate shortly before Christmas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Supplementary Estimate for £750,000 net is necessary to meet excess expenditure under a number of subheads and certain expenses under <Col N="312" /> an additional subhead which were not foreseen when the original Estimate was prepared.</P>
    <P>An extra £550,000 is required under subhead A&mdash;Salaries, Wages and Allowances.  Over £200,000 of this is needed for additional staff over and above those provided for in the original Estimate.  These are mostly telephonists and engineering staff recruited to meet the rapidly expanding needs of the telecommunications services.  The balance is required mainly for increased overtime expenditure following improvements in overtime and Sunday duty rates and for higher social welfare contributions.</P>
    <P>Under subhead B, an extra £73,000 is needed mostly to meet higher rates of travelling and subsistence allowances and the cost of increased travelling on engineering work.  There have also been some increases in provisions made for training courses, conferences etc.</P>
    <P>Accommodation and buildings charges&mdash;subhead C&mdash;are expected to be higher than the original estimate by £163,000 due mainly to the acquisition of certain badly needed sites and premises which came on the market during the year.</P>
    <P>The costs of conveying mail will be higher by an estimated £169,000 than the provision made under subhead D. This is due to a number of causes including arrangements for quicker clearance of airmail accounts, higher than estimated airmail traffic, steep increases in conveyance costs for foreign mail and higher conveyance costs generally.</P>
    <P>The increase of £158,000 under subhead E for Postal and General Stores is due to the incidence of payment of arrears of Stationery Office and inter-state accounts, increased stationery requirements and higher costs, particularly for printing and for motor vehicle parts and repairs.  There have also been some initial costs in connection with decimalisation.</P>
    <P>An extra £12,000 is required under subhead I&mdash;Losses.  It is difficult to estimate closely the charge under this subhead.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="313" /> Under subhead J&mdash;Superannuation&mdash; £99,000 more is needed.  The increase is due to improvements in pay and to the numbers of retirements and marriage gratuities being greater than expected.</P>
    <P>The extra subhead L&mdash;Commissions and Special Inquiries&mdash;has been added to the Estimate to authorise payment of legal and other expenses in connection with the tribunal which is at present inquiring into the conflicting evidence about illegal moneylending arising out of the RTE &ldquo;7-Days&rdquo; programme on the subject.  The provision of £5,000 is intended to cover payments likely to be made up to the end of the month.  The bulk of the expenses in question will fall on next year's vote.</P>
    <P>The items mentioned amount to a gross total of £1,229,000 but offsetting savings estimated at £244,000 are expected under subheads F and G.  Moreover, further offsets amounting to £235,000 are expected from increased Appropriations-in-Aid.  These together reduce the net amount required to £750,000.</P>
    <P>I recommend the Supplementary Estimate to the House.</P>

I have always considered that the wages and salaries paid to postmen and linesmen are particularly low.  They always seem to work very hard and get very little remuneration for doing so.  Now that I have mentioned postmen I should like to say that in this day and age I do not think postmen should be employed in a temporary capacity in positions which appear to be permanent.  I suppose this ought to be said on the main Estimate but when money is being allotted for wages and salaries I feel I must take the opportunity of making the point here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The increased allowance under subhead B is very reasonable because the cost of travelling and engineering work <Col N="314" /> is going up all the time.  The same goes for subhead C.  Obviously, any sites acquired in the future, whether in town or out of town, will be more expensive than they were years ago.</P>
    <P>I do not understand subhead D1. I take it that it is only concerned with the conveyence of mails and that it does not have anything to do with deliveries as such.  Does subhead E deal with arrears to the Stationery Office or is the bulk of the money going to be used for repairs?  One imagines that arrears of that kind would not be allowed to accumulate in a Government Department.</P>
    <P>No information is given about the £12,000 losses under Subhead I.  I appreciate the Minister's difficulty in finding it hard to estimate these losses.</P>
    <P>I imagine that subhead J will be welcomed by all Deputies.  It is important that all members of the staff get proper retirement pensions and marriage gratuities.  From time to time I have had complaints about widows' pensions.  I understand that the Department of Posts and Telegraphs decided to administer its own pension scheme for civil servants and their widows, and the widows of members of this Department were the last to get their increase in pension. When one widow rang up to inquire when the increased pension would be paid, she was answered very rudely. It is understandable that widows should be anxious about their pensions. After all, they have not been used to managing the financial affairs of the family and they will be more anxious than the person who has earned money all his life about paying the rent and rates.  If there is any technical hitch this should be explained to them.  They should not be fobbed off with a rude answer.  I understand that they did finally receive their pension increase.  I have always been interested in widows' pensions because for far too long not enough has been done for Civil Service widows.  I think civil servants are the most abused people in our community. I am afraid they are blamed for doing a lot of things for which they are not responsible.  I know they are a very conscientious and hard-working people and many of them kill <Col N="315" /> themselves working.  The least we can do is treat their widows fairly when they have passed away.</P>
    <P>I suppose it would not be in order to discuss the cost of the Seven Days Tribunal in full but I notice a provision for it here of £5,000.  I do not know how the Minister arrived at this figure.  I am sure the cost of this tribunal will be gigantic, astronomical. I would think that it will cost well over £100,000.  This £5,000 is intended to cover payments made up to the end of the month.  I am afraid that when we have to foot the bill we will have to add some noughts to that £5,000. However, we cannot criticise it.  We asked for this inquiry and we are getting it.  I hope something useful will come of it and that the money will not be badly spent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to confine my comments to the subheads outlined by the Minister.  I will deal with the more detailed aspects when the main Estimate comes before the House.  I support the Supplementary Estimate for £750,000 and I welcome the various allocations under the different subheads.  An extra £550,000 is required for wages, salaries and allowances and the Minister pointed out that most of it is going to the telephonists and the engineering staffs.  I agree that there is a need for greater expenditure in this area.  With the expansion in the economy in the seventies there will be a demand for better telecommunication services in the State.  This Supplementary Estimate pinpoints the fact that all the indications are that throughout the seventies there will be a very substantial demand for extensive postal, telephone, telegraph and telex services.  Therefore, expenditure of this nature is not only desirable for those directly involved but necessary for the growth of a better public service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Indeed, it is not often fully appreciated by the public at large that the Department of Posts and Telegraphs now employ in the region of 19,000 people in 100 different grades.  This level of employment is comparable to that given by CIE.  When we talk in terms of the 19,000 people involved in the 100 different grades, we appreciate <Col N="316" /> the magnitude of the postal, telex, telephone and telegraph services and the growing importance of the Department.</P>
    <P>I would urge the Minister that not only should there be increased expenditure but that it should be devoted increasingly to the telecommunication service because, despite the £50 million development programme which the Minister launched last year, there is still a grave shortage of telephone services throughout the country.  It would be unfortunate if the growth of industry, particularly outside the Dublin area, and the development of a more efficient public service, were to be impeded by lack of capital in the first half of the 1970s.  There was a growth of well over 7 per cent in the latter half of the sixties in the number of private subscribers and, when we consider what is likely to happen in the first half of the seventies, since all the indications are that the growth rate will be well up to 10 per cent, with a demand for an additional 125,000 telephones, we realise that the additional money voted under this subhead is necessary and desirable for the expansion of the telephone communication services.</P>
    <P>I would urge the Minister to expedite the full development of these services. A debt of gratitude is due to the engineering and technician staffs in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs who have worked under intense pressure in the past decade.  I have no doubt that during the seventies they will be very much involved in meeting the expanding needs of the country. This should be recorded in this House on this Estimate.</P>
    <P>I should like to see more money being devoted, if it is available, towards the complete automation of the telephone services.  At the moment, some eight out of every ten telephones are automatic.  The service would be better and more efficient if we had a 100 per cent conversion to automation.  That does not mean that there would not be a growing demand for telephone operators for the personal service which is inherent in any automated service. I should like to see it expanded as rapidly as possible and I should also like to see more money being set aside <Col N="317" /> for the growing development of telex. There has been a phenomenal and almost explosive growth in this area in the past half decade, a growth rate, as the Minister indicated recently, in the region of 35 per cent.  In the telex field we can certainly bring about a more rapid service to industry, to our public services and to the nation as a whole.  This shows the growing strength of the country in the field of telecommunications. It is very welcome.</P>
    <P>In respect of charges for accommodation and buildings I support the increased estimate of £163,000 which the Minister says is required for the acquisition of certain badly needed sites and premises which came on the market during the year.  I submit to the Minister and the House that many of our public service buildings which are used as post offices are in dire need of an urgent face lift.  I would point out to the Minister that in the constituency I represent, Dún Laoghaire/ Rathdown, with the rapid growth of the new services in the shipping field, with the growth in the car ferry service, with the growth of hotels and so on, the central post office does not meet the needs of the local population, or the growing tourist population, or the growing commuter population.</P>
    <P>There could be considerable refurbishing and brightening up of many of our public postal premises.  The Minister has pointed out that Donegal, Dungarvan, Listowel, Nenagh, Longford, Portlaoise and Mullingar, will get new post offices and improvements will be carried out in other centres but if we are to have an efficient national service, proper facilities should be provided for indoor staffs particularly in the sorting offices in areas where, with the growth in letter posting, there is need for greater expenditure.</P>
    <P>The only other comment I would make is in respect of subhead L, commissions and special inquiries, under which the Minister must provide £5,000 to cover legal and other expenses up to the end of the month in connection with the RTE &ldquo;7-Days&rdquo; Tribunal.  This could be classified as unwilling expenditure on the part of the Minister, and I do not think I am <Col N="318" /> unduly going outside the scope of subhead L in saying that if the Government had listened fully to the Minister that £5,000 expenditure might not have been incurred.  I would surmise that the total cost to the State in respect of Departments generally, not including the very substantial involvement of public officers, members of the Garda and so on, might add another £50,000 to the figure Deputy Mrs. Hogan-O'Higgins suggested, so that this tribunal would cost not less than £150,000 by the time it concludes in another three or four weeks. It is well that it should be pointed out that for this exercise we are going through the taxpayers will be obliged to pay £150,000 at least in respect of legal and other costs.</P>

      <P>Having had the indulgence of the Chair I accept your ruling.  When the main Estimate comes before the House we shall have a great many things to say to the Minister about conditions of employment of postal workers, the fact that there are a very large number of the 19,000 workers employed by the Department who could be classified as low-paid workers, in an area where the Minister could bring about the practical implementation of an effective incomes policy.  We shall also have a good deal to say about management-labour relations. There has been a plethora of Supplementary Estimates coming before the House in the past fortnight and there are more to come involving the best part of £40 million.  In the context of the budgetary system and of Estimates generally there should be a better way of meshing in these Supplementary Estimates.  However, that would more appropriately be discussed under the heading of parliamentary reform and I hope we shall have that opportunity.  In the meantime we do not begrudge the extra money being spent here and we support this Supplementary Estimate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I note that part of the wages and salaries subhead goes to officers seconded from the Department <Col N="319" /> of Posts and Telegraphs to staff associations and so on.  There is a certain difficulty here in that these officers are bound by very strict rules of the Department which affect their involvement in politics.  This affects post office clerks in that if they attain a position in their staff association or, more particularly, in the trade union movement of which Civil Service Associations are a part, they are bound by very strict rules against any form of political involvement. I understand this may very seriously inhibit the activities of the incoming President of Congress, Mr. Maurice Cosgrave, who is a post office clerk.  That is my information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not correct, so the Deputy need not worry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I withdraw what I said therefore.  I was informed this might be the case.  I understand, however, that such restrictions would not apply in the north where post office clerks have full political freedoms which possibly our people do not have.  They can join parties and involve themselves in politics.  Why can our post office clerks not have similar rights?</P>
      <P>One of the grave injustices in regard to the wages and conditions of workers in the postal service is one that was mentioned by Deputy Mrs. Hogan-O'Higgins, that is, the position of postmen who are temporary and remain temporary for a long period in their lives.  Not only does this involve a cut in salary&mdash;I think there is a difference of about £2 a week&mdash;but they do not have the pension rights they would have if they were permanent. This is a very mean-minded attitude on the part of the Department in that they are not allowing these people to become permanent, thereby making marginal savings while causing considerable hardship and injustice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under subhead G there is reference to the steep increase in the conveyance costs of foreign mail.  I would be interested if the Minister could elaborate on the type of increase incurred.  Have <Col N="320" /> these been inordinate increases which one does not anticipate from one year to the next or has the last year been marked by a particularly large increase in the conveyance costs of foreign mail?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Bruton was on the wrong track when he was talking about Mr. Maurice Cosgrave.  He can be assured that when Mr. Cosgrave becomes President of Congress he can make any statement he considers necessary and the Government, no matter what Government it is, will not interfere.  However, that is outside the Supplementary Estimate.  Compared with other Supplementary Estimates which have come before this House in the last couple of weeks this sum is mere chicken feed.  However, I am interested in one particular subhead, A&mdash;salaries, wages and allowances. The Minister states that over £200,000 of this is needed for additional staff over and above those provided for in the original Estimate and the balance is required mainly for increased overtime expenditure following improvements in overtime and Sunday duty rates and for higher social welfare contributions.  It applies to everybody.  It appears to be a very small amount per person, about £18 10s.  Perhaps my arithmetic is wrong; I like to get figures right if at all possible.</P>
      <P>Higher rates of travel and subsistence allowances apply not only to every Government Department but to every type of employment where travelling and subsistence are involved. Travel costs have gone sky high in the past couple of years and, in particular, over the past 12 months.  Some of the Government's chickens are coming home to roost.  It is costing the Government more now because they allowed costs to increase so steeply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Accommodation and building charges under subhead C are expected to be higher than the original estimate by £163,000 due mainly to the acquisition of certain badly needed sites and premises which came on the market during the year.  Could the Minister say if these include Ballsbridge?  Has a site been found there?  If he has a short list of those sites, perhaps, he <Col N="321" /> would let us have it when replying as I would be interested to know what sites are concerned.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister could also say whether it is proposed to do anything about the dust in Sheriff Street?  A site there was built on but as soon as the summer comes the situation there will be as bad as, or worse than it was in the past few years.  I, like Deputy Bruton, am interested in the cost of conveying mail.  It will be higher by an estimated £169,000 than the provision under subhead D. What percentage increase would that be?  Perhaps the Minister would let us know the figure if he has it.  An increase of £158,000 under subhead E for postal and general stores is due to the incidence of payments of arrears of stationery office and inter-state accounts, increased stationery requirements and higher costs particularly for printing and motor vehicle parts and repairs.  This seems to be a hotch-potch.  Would it not be possible to have it broken down more? If it has now been decided to bring up to date payment of arrears of this kind it is a good idea.</P>
    <P>Those of us associated with local authorities find it very annoying that the Government are such bad payers. When we are due grants of any kind we do not get them until the 31st March when they are no longer any use to the Government because they want to have them paid out in that financial year.  The result is that we pay interest on money we owe all over the year while the Government hold the money and could have paid it to us. If they are doing the same in their own interdepartmental payments I am sure unnecessary costs are building up and if this is a change for the better we cannot criticise it.  I would be interested to know how the £12,000, a relatively small sum in a Supplementary Estimate of three-quarters of a million pounds, required under said subhead I for losses, arises.  The Minister says it is difficult to estimate closely the charge on this subhead but could we have some general headings showing how this sum or the bulk of it arises, if the Minister has the information?</P>
    <P>On subhead J, superannuation, <Col N="322" /> £99,000 more is needed.  It was stated that the increase is due to the improvement in pay to the staff and also to the numbers retiring and getting marriage gratuities being greater than expected. I suppose the improvements in pay are due to the £2 5s 0d or 4 per cent granted last year.  There should be a pattern for retirements and it should be easy enough to estimate the number retiring during the year.  I did quite a lot of this myself and I cannot understand how we would not know fairly accurately who was likely to retire. Marriages, I grant, are pretty hard to estimate.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to deal with the Seven Days inquiry except to make the comment that the £5,000 provided under subhead L, is to cover payments likely to be made up to the end of the month.  I would ask the Minister to confirm that that £5,000 does not represent anything like the expenditure that will have to be met on this inquiry up to the end of the month lest somebody would get the impression that we are getting the Seven Days inquiry up to this for a mere £5,000.  I should like to know if the Minister has the information and what the amount will actually be or is likely to be?</P>

      <P>The Chair may say that this is not in order but about four years ago the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs proudly announced that he proposed to change the colour of the post vans and letter boxes and also the name of the Department which he said would in future be known as &ldquo;Post and Telecommunications&rdquo;.

      <P>It should not be here and even if it is here it should not be named &ldquo;Commissions and Special Inquiries.&rdquo;  It should be named &ldquo;Inquiry into Telefís Éireann&rdquo; or something like that.  I do not like civil <Col N="324" /> servants to go in for this type of generalisation; it always annoyed me when it happened and I always protested about it in the long years when I was in the Department of Finance.  There is only one tribunal and it is a tribunal of inquiry into Telefís Éireann or some of the activities of Telefís Éireann and that is what it should be called.  It may be that this title was copied by some official or somebody who likes precedent from the original Vote, &ldquo;Commissions and Special Inquiries&rdquo;. and that that is how the title came.

      <P>We will have a reasonably sufficient amount of time to deal with general items on the main Estimate. <Col N="325" /> Deputy Mrs. Hogan-O'Higgins dealt with the various subheads as presented and perhaps from my point of view it would be as well for me to deal with the subject matter of the debate in the same way.</P>
      <P>There was a general welcoming acceptance of the necessity for the increase in remuneration for staff. Deputy Tully did a quick sum in regard to the additional £200,000; he divided it by 19,000 and worked it out at £18 per head.  It is clearly stated that the £200,000 is needed for staff additional to those provided for in the original Estimate and in fact we had an additional staff of 400.  For the information of Deputy Tully that sum works out at £500 per head.  Some of those people may not have been on the job for the entire year so that by working that out at £10 per week one does not come to a logical conclusion.</P>
      <P>Deputy Mrs. Hogan-O'Higgins, Deputies Tully and Bruton referred to the question of the non-established part-time postmen.  This question is referred to annually; at the present time the claim for the introduction of a pension scheme for what we term full-time, non-established and part-time staffs has been made under the conciliation and arbitration scheme for the Civil Service and is presently before the general council.  This claim was discussed at a meeting of the general council recently and, as the claim is the subject of arbitration proceedings, it is not usual for a Minister to make any public statement beyond saying that the claim has been made and is being considered.</P>

      <P>He usually spends so much time on the job that he has not time to do anything else.  Therefore, as far as he is concerned it is his job and it is a fallacy to say it is not a full-time job.  I know what the Minister means but most of these auxiliaries do not have any other job.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>We have been operating the idea put forward by the Minister for Lands for quite a number of years. Deputy Mrs. Hogan-O'Higgins asked some questions regarding arrears under subhead E and this has also been mentioned by another Deputy.  The amount specified was due to an account for a large amount of stationery supplies received too late for payment in the 1968-69 financial year.  It was received actually just immediately prior to the current financial year and it had, <Col N="327" /> therefore, to go in under the heading of arrears.</P>
      <P>The question of losses under subhead I was raised.  There are various kinds of losses.  There is, for example, compensation for loss and damage to postal packets and there are losses sustained in the post office arising from burglaries and robberies.  There was, unfortunately, an increase in the incidence of losses in the two years 1968-69 and 1969-70.  I am afraid we have exceeded the standard, if I may put it that way, and it is the excess in the current year that is covered in this subhead.</P>
      <P>Deputy Mrs. Hogan-O'Higgins referred to the payment of Civil Service widows' pensions in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  All outstanding claims have now been dealt with. Since the Department employs about half of the overall numbers in the Civil Service it was obvious we would have more difficulties in this regard as compared with other Departments.  We were deducting at source income tax which other Departments will deduct in the next year, but we have now readjusted that.  I do not accept that widows were abused or unfairly treated.  There was a mix-up because we were sticking to a regulation.  We have overcome the difficulty now and I regret that there was any hold-up.</P>
      <P>I do not think I need refer to Deputy Bruton's remarks about the seconding of post office staff to some of the trade unions.  I think that matter was covered in asides between Deputy Desmond, Deputy Tully and Deputy Bruton.  I personally have a great regard for the official mentioned and I regret that the actual name had to be raised here.  I think Deputy Tully covered the point when he said that Deputy Bruton may have misunderstood the position.  I shall say no more than that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Tully said we should be able to estimate the number of retirements better than we do.  The Deputy will appreciate that when there is an increase in salaries and wages the pension, on retirement, naturally goes up. The gratuity is increased.  I can give a breakdown of the £99,000.  The increased cost of pension payments due <Col N="328" /> to more retirements than anticipated and to pay increases was £17,000.  The increased cost of additional allowances was £62,000 and there was then the increased cost of marriage gratuities because of a substantial increase in the marriage rate which amounted to £33,000.  Whether the lady members of the staff are becoming more marriageable or more attractive, I do not know. If they are I cannot claim any credit for that since it is the Civil Service Commission that recruits them.  These figures of £17,000, £62,000 and £33,000, which amount to something over £100,000, were offset by a reduction in the cost of death gratuities and other miscellaneous items which amounted to £13,000.  That is the breakdown Deputy Tully sought.</P>
    <P>I accept the full implications of what Deputy Desmond said about the wisdom of spending as much money as possible on telephone development and more automation.  Deputy Desmond paid tribute to the development that has taken place.  I join with the Deputy in paying tribute to the staff; they have made remarkable advances over the past few years.  We will, of course, continue to receive criticism of the telephone service, as such, but I think Deputies will accept that tremendous strides in telephone developments have taken place.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully&mdash;I hate to refer to it as a hardy annual&mdash;raised once more the question of dust in Sheriff Street. I suppose it is covered under some subheads.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Dust covers everything.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the things which must be said is that I had not included any excess estimate for the clearing of dust from Sheriff Street.  I cannot say there has been a falling off in the incidence of dust but there has been a falling off in the incidence of complaint. I understand certain steps were taken in an effort to minimise the volume of dust.  Deputy Tully is forever reminding me of the fact that we talk about dust and then forget about it until the following year's Estimate.  I do not accept that.  I have taken great interest in the possibility of getting rid of dust from this place.  I come back <Col N="329" /> now with a hardy annual by saying that the coal will be taken away and with it the creation of dust will be minimised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The windows were closed but that is not all right during the summer.  It will be hot then and there will be the same trouble again unless something is done.  The coal will be taken away eventually but there are other causes of dust.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>The postbags create dust. The bags are being cleaned twice as often as they were before.  These are major steps in the elimination of dust. There are people who say that the officials in the sorting office could not raise dust.  They are raising dust, which is a proof of their efficiency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>These men work very, very hard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Mrs. Hogan-O'Higgins says there is no civil servant as much maligned as the civil servant within the post office.  He is meeting the public more often and his work affects the public more often than that of any other civil servant.  Letters are written to the paper about these men and various complaints are voiced. Because of this, I have taken more than a little interest in the question of the extraction of dust from the Sheriff Street office.  I will continue to do this by taking all remedial action I can in relation to that building.  It is a fine premises but post and postbags are things which bring in dust.  I was glad that the Deputy remarked on the improved image.  I hope that Deputies who have seen the &ldquo;new look&rdquo; postal vans have been pleased with them. Deputy Tully spoke in previous Estimate debates about the necessity for a change from the drab green.  I think the marigold and white, with the new monogram designed by the Kilkenny design workshops, is very nice.</P>

      <P>In fact, it might be as well to leave that until we are talking about the main Estimate.  There is a lot in the name.  We get back to the <Col N="330" /> Devlin Report in this regard.  I have covered most points now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister a list of the new sites which have been bought?  Is Ballsbridge included in it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  Deputy Desmond referred to Dún Laoghaire.  I spoke to him on that, explaining the difficulties. We will have a new sorting office there.  Ballsbridge is proving difficult. It is a case of finding an alternative site.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be very difficult to get a place at any price shortly.  Sites are becoming more expensive daily.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>We have been concentrating on finding a site in the immediate Ballsbridge area.  It is difficult, even if we went to a fringe area of Ballsbridge and readjusted the postal routes.  In fact, even at a price, we are finding it difficult to locate a site, and price is a factor which must be taken into consideration by us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister take some of the services out of the existing premises?  They could then be used for people who do not wish to go very far.  It is unfair to continue using the premises as they are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>We talked with the staff about moving down to our old premises in Pearse Street.  The staff were not in favour of this move.  No doubt some of them live in the Ballsbridge area. We moved out of Pearse Street to go into Sheriff Street.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Why not get a site close at hand and build to accommodate most of the services?  Eventually something like that must be done.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>We lost that one and we are after a different site at the moment. We are trying to negotiate for it.  It is a case of &ldquo;many a slip between the <Col N="331" /> cup and the lip&rdquo;.  I myself was dealing with this particular problem last year. Deputy Tully raised this on the Estimates by way of Parliamentary Question. It is one of the problems he often raises.  Deputy Tully also stresses the need for pensions for auxiliary postmen, which is one of his strongest points.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to thank the House for accepting <Col N="332" /> this Supplementary Estimate so graciously and to say that I appreciate their comments.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
