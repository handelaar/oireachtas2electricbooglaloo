    <Speaker pid="ThomasFOHiggins" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach whether in order to secure the adaptation of legislation and the co-ordination of social policies between the applicant countries and the member States of the EEC the Government will now propose the establishment of a joint consultative body composed of the Commission and the applicant countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government keep in close touch with the European Commission and the member States on all community developments, including progress of a legislative kind, and on social and other policies.  The question of the adaptation of our own legislation is being examined actively, and any difficulties which reveal themselves in the course of this examination will be resolved with the member States in the course of the negotiations. While the Government are ready to consider any constructive proposal that will advance the preparations for membership, it is felt that there does not at present appear to be any necessity to propose the establishment of consultative machinery of the kind suggested by the Deputy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Taoiseach say whether any proposals of this character have emanated from the European movement meeting in Rome?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>A proposal did emanate from the Dublin branch of the Irish Council for European Unity, <Col N="516" /> or whatever is the official title&mdash;I forget just now&mdash;and it was part of a number of proposals they made to the international meeting in Rome at the end of last month.  No action was taken, nor was it expected to be taken, on the proposal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if the Government intend to take part in discussions with members of the European Economic Community to formulate a common EEC foreign policy prior to Ireland's entry to this community; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Hague Summit Conference in December last instructed the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the countries of the European Economic Community to study the best method of achieving progress in the field of political unification in the context of enlargement and to make proposals before the end of next July.  In implementation of this decision preparatory work is being undertaken at official level among the Six and the applicant countries will be kept informed of developments.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if, in view of the Government's proposals to enter into negotiation for membership of the European Economic Community, he is satisfied with the relative contributions of industry, agriculture and services to the gross national product, particularly with the dependence on services which now amounts to nearly 50 per cent of the national product.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The question seems to relate primarily to the percentage of our gross national product attributable to the services sector.  I do not accept the implication in the question that a relatively high contribution from the services sector necessarily reflects a structural weakness in an economy. Long-term comparisons of several OECD countries show that the services sector, which covers a wide range of activities including distribution, transport, commerce and tourism, tends to form an increasing proportion of national output as economies develop. In 1969, the services sector accounted for 46 per cent of our gross <Col N="517" /> product which is broadly in line with the position in the member countries of the European Economic Community.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will give details of the increase in total employment in this country in each of the last five years; and what steps are being taken to increase employment opportunities and to reduce the average unemployment rate which is slightly in excess of five per cent in the past ten years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose, with your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, to circulate in the Official Report a statement giving the details requested in the first part of the question.</P>
      <P>As I stated in reply to a question addressed to me in this House on 4th February last, the Third Programme for Economic and Social Development sets out the Government's plans to provide increased employment in the period up to 1972 in the context of the long-term aim to achieve full employment.</P>
      <P>Following is the statement:</P>
      <P>ESTIMATED total labour force and number of persons at work in the main branches of economic activity at mid-April, 1964 to 1969, and change in total numbers at work in each of these years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health what steps will be taken as a matter of urgency to relieve the overcrowding of adult mentally handicapped patients at St. Ita's Hospital, Portrane, County Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Childers) Erskine Hamilton Childers">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have received a proposal from Dublin Health Authority to provide a unit of 100 beds at Portrane to relieve overcrowding and to permit of the discontinuance of an existing ward where conditions <Col N="519" /> are very unsatisfactory.  I fully agree that extra accommodation is needed for the adult mentally handicapped, but I am not satisfied that this should be provided by new buildings at Portrane rather than by freeing beds by making provision elsewhere for geriatric patients who are at present accommodated at Portrane.  I have asked the health authority to investigate this aspect as a matter of urgency.  There will be no delay in dealing with this problem as far as I am concerned.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure about the fire hazard but I know that part of the policy of my Department is to try to deal with the position of geriatric patients in mental hospitals.  As the Deputy knows, this problem can be found in other countries also.  The whole of the modern policy in regard to mental patients is to avoid having very large establishments.  Indeed, there are some countries where it is regarded as desirable not to have more than 500 beds in any one area.  This is a long-term study we are making in regard to geriatric patients in mental hospitals and, as I have said, we will examine this particular case as rapidly as we can.  If we have to provide a unit of 100 beds in Portrane, we will do so, but we hope, by means of exchanges of patients, to solve the problem by placing some of the geriatric patients in Portrane elsewhere within the Dublin Health Authority institutions.</P>

      <P>I have received very recently a copy of the report referred to.  I have not as yet had an opportunity of considering it in detail.  The report in itself does not reveal the complete picture of alcoholism but its import is of serious dimensions.  I am satisfied that we have in this country a very serious problem of alcoholism and that it is important to promote public education on the dangers of this disease.  I have already had a number of discussions on the matter with the Irish National Council on Alcoholism.</P>

      <P>I made two visits to Britain during 1969 in connection with our agricultural trade with that country, which accounts for about 80 per cent of our total agricultural exports.

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if he is aware that according to the February 1970 edition of the <i>OECD Observer</i> Ireland has the lowest number of dwellings completed per 1,000 inhabitants of all member countries quoted for 1968; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen the report referred to by the Deputy.  I dealt with this subject in some detail in appendix V of the White Paper&mdash;<i>Housing in the Seventies</i>&mdash;which I issued last June and also in my reply on 11th March, 1970, to the debate on the Estimates for my Department at columns 217 to 219 of the Official Report, volume 245, No. 2.</P>
      <P>Briefly, I may say that houses are built to meet needs arising from the formation of new households and other demographic factors.  In this country both the increase in population and the percentage of the population who are married are low by the standards of other countries.  Further, the average number of persons per room is fairly low by international standards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Houses are also built to replace dwellings which are demolished or have become obsolete.  In this country, a large proportion&mdash;about 24 per cent &mdash;of the housing stock has been reconstructed with the aid of the scheme of reconstruction grants which has been in operation more or less in its present form since about 1932, or longer, so far as can be ascertained, than any similar scheme elsewhere.  These grants, of which about 10,000 are now paid annually, have slowed the rate of obsolescence of the housing stock as a whole and ensured a degree of adaptation to current needs higher <Col N="526" /> than would have been the case without them.</P>
    <P>The comparisons as between countries of numbers of houses built per 1,000 can also be misleading because of the different sizes of the dwellings. According to the <i>Annual Bulletin of Europe, 1968</i>, houses in this country were the largest in any country, except Iceland, for which the statistics are given.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">

      <P>Does the Minister not agree that the whole tenor of his speech was to the effect that we are doing marvellous work and now this question asked by Deputy Collins has indicated that an independent body, namely OECD, have proved us to be the worst housing administration in Europe?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know about the tenor of my speech, but I think I did show that the housing effort being made at present is the greatest effort made yet in this country and that it compares favourably with the effort by any other country.  As I have shown, the figures can only be properly interpreted if one bears in mind all the relevant considerations such as the number of houses that are reconstructed, which, as I said, slows down the rate of obsolescence, and also if one bears in mind the fact that the number of persons per room in this country is fairly low compared with most other European countries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>As I indicated in my opening and concluding speeches on the Estimate, the Government realise there is still a considerable effort needed in regard to housing and that effort will continue to be made by this Government which will take care to ensure that the economy of the country remains capable of financing a considerable housing programme.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The income of the man to which this statement refers would be about £20 a week or more. The fixing of rents for new houses is <Col N="529" /> a matter for the local authorities concerned in accordance with a rent scheme of which I approve.  I indicated to local authorities in circular letter H.7/69 of 20th February, 1969, the general principles I am prepared to follow in approving schemes.</P>
      <P>The rent to be charged for a house in accordance with these principles would vary according to how the income is made up, the number of children, cost and standard of the house etc.  In general, I may say, however, that a man with a wife and four dependent children earning £20 a week would pay approximately £2 10s a week in rent, in accordance with these principles, for the sort of house which is now costing about £8 a week to provide and maintain in Cork.  The rent in Cork at lower income levels or where the income is made up, in part, from the income of subsidiary earners, could be lower than that calculated in accordance with the circular letter.</P>
      <P>I have not got comparable figures for the amount of rates in the different areas.  However, these are not a payment for housing and they&mdash;and the services for which they are paid&mdash;vary so much from area to area, that comparisons would be misleading unless they were done in depth.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>There has not been <Col N="530" /> a spectacular increase in rents and what increase there has been is due to the increased income of the people in these houses.

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The abstracts of <Col N="531" /> accounts of local authorities which are submitted to my Department after the close of each financial year include details of the amounts collected in rents and rates.  A number of interim periodic returns are also submitted. The totals are obtained by aggregation of the relevant figures.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1961" hpid="Mr. P. Belton Mr. P. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it true that the cost of the house or flat is the point on which calculations are based? Therefore, if a flat costs £6,000 do the Minister and his staff work out the rent of the premises on this basis?  The cost of housing at Ballymun per flat or per house is greater than the cost of a corporation house.  If the Minister's Department make a mistake regarding the purchase of land or in the construction of huge blocks of flats rather than houses does the tenant have to pay for this mistake?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite clear it is not done that way.  The maximum rent fixed bears very little relation to the economic cost of providing the accommodation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish  Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>and <b>Mr. Corish</b> asked the Minister for Local Government whether it is necessary for him, before approving of rent increases submitted by local authorities, to be given full information as to the number of people paying minimum rent, the number of people paying maximum rent and the number of people not paying rent; and, if not, what information he requires before either approving or rejecting local authority rent increase applications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not necessary. Local authorities are by law responsible for the administration of their houses.  They are not required to submit to me proposals for increasing fixed rents, or for increases in the maxima of differential rent scales by 5/- a week or less in any year to meet increases in maintenance, administration, insurance and other costs for which the authority are liable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If proposals involving other changes in differential rents are submitted, I require information as to the number of houses affected, an estimate of the <Col N="532" /> implications of the revision on the local authority's finances and the estimated number of tenants whose rents will be decreased, increased or will remain unchanged and any other information which I may consider relevant to the particular case.</P>
    <P>18.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government whether he is satisfied that his request to Dublin Corporation to introduce a scheme whereby the weekly receipts for tenants would indicate separately the basic rents and the rates being paid, has been complied with; and whether he proposes to take any steps to ensure that confusion arising from non-compliance with his request is erased.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to my reply to Question No. 32 on 25th February, 1970.  As I stated in that reply, the detailed operation of their rent schemes is, by law, a matter for the local authority.</P>
      <P>Following my requirement that the existing differential rent scales should be amended as soon as practicable to indicate separately the basic rent and the rates in each case, Dublin Corporation now notify each tenant of the rateable valuation of his dwelling so that he can calculate the rates payable on it.  I am not satisfied that this is a sufficient compliance with my requirement and the local authority has been made aware of this.  They are being pressed to comply fully with the requirement.</P>
      <P>I might, however, point out that the amount paid by tenants on the minimum and lower points of the differential rent scale is, in fact, insufficient to cover the rates so they are paying no rent and only a fraction of the amount due for rates.</P>

      <P>The commission made no recommendation in regard to the provision of finance for gardaí wishing to purchase houses.

It was in recognition of the fact that, because of the nature of their occupation, they are moved around from place to place that the Government asked the National Building Agency to provide housing for the Garda in different areas.

There is also a proposal in the Conroy Commission report that a consultative council be established.  That has been set up.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government support in general Recommendation 583 of the Consultative Assembly.  In particular it favours instructing the Committee of Experts on Human Rights to draft an additional Protocol to the European Convention on Human Rights which would cover the prohibition of discrimination in certain fields.</P>
      <P>In regard to the second part of the Deputy's question on the UN Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Racial Discrimination, Ireland signed this Convention subject to ratification on the 23rd March, 1968.  In order to enable this country to ratify the convention it would seem that legislation may be necessary to give effect to some of its provisions and this matter is being examined.</P>

The missionaries in question have, following on our representations, been released to come home, and none of them has asked me to pursue the questions raised by the Deputy.

      <P>As I have stated on a number of occasions recently the Government are keeping the economic situation under continuous review and <Col N="546" /> will take corrective action as and when necessary.  I would, however, refer the Deputy to my answer to Deputy Liam Burke's question on Tuesday, 10th February, 1970, in which I pointed out that it would not be in the public interest to speculate on the nature of such action, if any, that may be needed.  I may add that the Government consider that the most valuable contribution that could be made would be a restraint by the different sections of the community in their demands for income increases, the abandoning of all unrealistic and excessive claims and the adoption of a policy on incomes that the economy can sustain.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance what policies he intends to pursue in order to reduce the present crisis high bank rate which is inhibiting increased investment within the Irish economy; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 39, 40 and 41 together.  The publication referred to by the Deputy gives Denmark as having the highest official discount rate, Ireland the second highest and Britain with France and Canada the third highest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because of the freedom of movement of funds between this country and Britain, the rediscount rate of the Central Bank, and discount rates and interest rates generally, are influenced by rates prevailing in Britain.  If rates were lower here, there could well be an outflow of funds, thus reducing resources for the financing of Irish <Col N="547" /> production and development.  For some time past interest rates have been exceptionally high all over the world. The high rates do not, however, appear to have adversely affected investment in Ireland.  Domestic fixed capital formation has continued to increase as a proportion of gross national product, rising from 18.6 per cent in 1967 to 19.6 per cent in 1968 and an estimated 21.7 per cent in 1969.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I ask the Minister what domestic fixed capital formation means in this context of a bank rate?  It is all right to string words together but they should mean something.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is possible that it would be no harm if the Minister, as Minister, were to analyse those words.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>All I know is that this question deals with the effect of interest rates on capital investment here and I have endeavoured to point out in the answer that the high interest rates which we have been experiencing in recent times do not appear to have affected capital investment here because the proportion of our gross national product invested has been rising steadily.  If the Deputy finds that meaningless then I find myself in the same position in relation to the Deputy as my colleague, Deputy Boland, Minister for Local Government, finds himself in relation to Deputy Garret FitzGerald.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is all right but when the Minister for Finance talks about gross national product he has, in fact, by the enormous expenditure of the Government pushed up gross national product.  And is he not aware that, by borrowing and getting <Col N="548" /> the banks to write up £25 million in their books a few months ago, he pushed up the gross national product by that very thing?  These are rubbishy words, the &ldquo;gross national product&rdquo;. The Minister may shake his head if he likes but they are rubbish because they are arithmetic, not reality.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Naturally, I am very pleased that the case I made here last week for the liquid milk producers in the Dublin area and in the Cork area caused the Minister to examine his conscience to such effect that, over the weekend, he decided to increase the price of liquid milk in these areas by 2d per gallon.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnLOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps if the Deputy would now speak for milk producers in other areas it might have the same effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>This means that, over three years, the unfortunate milk producers in these areas have received an increase of ?d a pint per year, at a time when production costs were soaring. The Minister admits he took away from the producers in those two areas in the past year a subsidy of £300,000. In fact, therefore, they did not even <Col N="561" /> get an increase of ?d per pint per year over those three years.</P>
      <P>One hears the case made inside and outside this House that we are selling butter abroad at give-away prices.  The question was asked why our people here cannot benefit from this cheap butter.  There is no reason in the wide earthly world why this cannot happen without costing the Exchequer anything. The matter is so serious that the Minister or his Parliamentary Secretary should take the trouble to explain what this would involve.  The suggestion was made that perhaps the price of butter on the home market could be brought down to the price of margarine and in this way cut out margarine altogether. People here who could not afford to buy butter would then be able to buy it and enjoy it.  On the face of it, there is a first-class case to be made for giving our people butter as cheaply as possible&mdash;butter that we are practically giving away on the export market.</P>
      <P>I think it is correct to say that the last 75 million gallons of milk cost about 2s 4d a gallon in support&mdash;an enormous subsidy.  If it could be spread out to enable Irish people to get cheaper butter then the case should be examined.  I have made some rough calculations.  We consume about 650,000 cwt. of butter in this country and we are using about 200,000 cwt. of margarine.  It would cost the Exchequer about £3½ million to reduce butter to 2s per lb.  There would be a substantial saving if we succeeded in replacing the margarine by milk which we should otherwise have to export, a saving of about £1 million, leaving a figure of £2½ million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At this point, I get a little muddled in my calculations.  I think we must then go back to subsidise the 200,000 cwt. as well.  No doubt the Parliamentary Secretary has the figures available to him.  The Irish people should know the full facts.  If they cannot get the benefit of the cheap butter perhaps the Government could go part of the way and examine whether it could be given to the social welfare classes, or portion of it.  Deputy Murphy has made a case in this regard.  One constantly hears criticism of the fact that <Col N="562" /> we are giving butter away on the export market for a very small price indeed, a price at which our people in this country would be able to afford to buy it rather than having to buy margarine.  There is no doubt about it that it is almost impossible to understand the attitude of the Minister in refusing to double the beef calf subsidy in order to get rid of the surplus milk that is costing us so much to export.</P>
    <P>My calculation is that the last 150,000 cows&mdash;basing cows on a 500 gallon average, approximately&mdash;are costing the Exchequer £60 a cow.  Yet we have the Minister refusing to pay a £25 beef calf subsidy in order to induce people away from milk production to beef.  It does not make sense to any man who thinks seriously about this business.  We must have a serious look at this because we know that every cow's milk, taking the lot of them, that is exported is costing the taxpayer £30.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am being conservative, but the last 120,000 cows are costing £60 a cow.  It is that surplus that we want to drain off, the surplus we cannot get any sort of reasonable market for.  Bord Bainne are trying very hard and on the whole are doing a very good job.  At times one hears complaints that while they have to sell the commodity they have not the control of quality and that this control should be reposed in Bord Bainne. However, this is something I have no positive views on.  It would appear normal that if you have to sell a product you should have some control over the quality of that product and I am afraid that in this case quality control is still being left in the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries.  There are complaints frequently that Bord Bainne should be responsible for sales in the home market.  Their only interest possibly is that they look for a better promotion job so that more milk will be sold at home in order to drain off some of the surplus that Bord Bainne cannot get rid of.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another complaint one hears frequently is in relation to the subsidy on carcase beef.  It is to the effect that the <Col N="563" /> competition now is rather unfair for those in the store cattle trade, because of the existence of a subsidy on carcase beef that is, perhaps, greater than it should be, while there is none for store cattle, this is unfair competition which militates against the store producer.  There must be something in this complaint because it has gone on for some time.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries has said he is dissatisfied with the way the trade agreement with Britain is going in relation to quotas of one sort or another.  It is quite obvious that we are being treated extremely badly by the British.  In that agreement there was supposed to be a growth factor satisfactory to the Irish Government and people, but obviously that growth factor has been ignored completely, and when one has regard to the way imports from Britain have rocketed during the lifetime of the agreement, the case for increased quotas becomes unanswerable, and why the British adopt the attitude they do is hard to understand.  One could say that the people responsible for reviewing this situation are doing a bad job because the result is bad.</P>
    <P>I remember that when we were discussing the agreement here the Minister at the time said we had got practically everything we had asked for and that he thought this quota of 25,000 tons, on which the British would pay a subsidy, was a wonderful amount.  That was the full amount at the time.  We are now exporting 75,000 tons and we can easily see how this is working against us.  I do not know how we can get a better deal but certainly there is a very strong case to be made for improvements in the agreement.  By the time it has been fully reviewed I hope these improvements will emerge and become obvious.</P>
    <P>In the Supplementary Estimates there is an item for sheep and I think this is one of the things we will have to be given an opportunity of expanding if we get into the EEC because prices are likely to rise by, perhaps, 50 per cent and not nearly enough is being done to prevent a decline in sheep numbers and to increase the numbers substantially.  All we have <Col N="564" /> done in this direction has been in respect of mountain sheep.  There is a case to be made in respect of early lamb for a subsidy of 3d per lb. on lamb produced from March to June, and the giving of a subsidy to lowland sheep producers and not to confine it entirely to the hills.  In the lowlands people are despairing for many reasons but mainly because little or nothing has been done to improve their situation.</P>
    <P>I was interested in the provision for increased grants for glasshouses.  This is one scheme that has done very well, has had significant results, but, unfortunately, we have not looked ahead in the glasshouse scheme.  In the case of milk we asked the producers to give us 550 million gallons by 1970 and they gave it to us, but before we got it we began to reduce prices because we did not put any new research efforts into new products.  We have Kille-shandra who, on their own, did research into a new product, long life whey which is selling at a premium. There is scope for much more research into this type of product if we are to sell at a reasonable price the extra milk being produced.</P>
    <P>In the glasshouse industry we provided fairly substantial grants and we got good results.  As I said here a couple of years ago, I was impressed by the co-operation between An Foras Talúntais, the growers and the advisory services.  Immense strides were made on general improvements in production. It became obvious we were getting some place and that the growers were eager.  However, immediately we get the production we do not trouble with the markets.  We do not set up an organisation to investigate the prospects for such marketing.</P>
    <P>I am aware that for some time past there has been pressure from the horticultural industry for the setting up of a council.  What is mainly needed in the tomato industry is compulsory grading.  This matter has already been raised at Question Time.  Last year four groups decided in the early part of the year that they would export to the British market.  Of course, that involved having available suitable trays, packages and so on.  However, the <Col N="565" /> trouble often is that as soon as these groups export one consignment they may find that the price on the home market is a penny per pound more so that when the time comes for them to export the next consignment, they welsh and will not agree to send the consignment.  There must be compulsory grading.  I know that some of the people among these groups were ashamed to have had their names coupled with growers who put good tomatoes on top of their trays and bad ones underneath.</P>
    <P>As well as having compulsory grading we have also reached the stage where each grower must be compelled to export a percentage of his production. Until such time as there is rigid control of this nature there is little or no hope for the glasshouse industry&mdash; an industry in which there is such great scope.  There is a very strong feeling that in order to get exports under way in the tomato industry, we should give the growers relief of income tax on exports the same as mushroom growers. It is hard to make a case against that. I know it is not a matter for the Minister but the case might be put to the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>There is a staggering increase in the figure for the eradication of tuberculosis in cattle and when the Minister is replying I should like him to tell us the reason for this increase.  Was there a breakdown in the country or is this an all-out effort to eradicate the disease once and for all?  We are all aware of the enormous amount of money that has already been spent on TB eradication but this increase is a matter of concern to all of us.</P>
    <P>With regard to the eradication of brucellosis I was disappointed to notice a saving of £300,000 in the amount provided for this purpose.  This scheme is moving too slowly.  In Northern Ireland additional restrictions have been imposed in relation to this disease but the fact that we have this saving indicates that we are dragging our feet in this matter.  There is no encouragement for any herd owner who is trying to eradicate the disease himself and there is a case to be made for giving him something.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="566" /> Concerning the disposal of surplus wheat the Minister said, and I quote:</P>
    <P>As the House is aware, there was a large surplus of wheat over the milling requirement from the 1968 harvest.  This surplus had to be disposed of as animal feed and the Exchequer had to bear the cost as no wheat levy operated in that year. In addition to a sum of £900,000, which was paid in 1968-69 to An Bord Gráin to meet part of the loss involved, there is a provision of £500,000 in the Supplementary Estimate to meet a further part of the loss involved.  Indeed this may not be the end of the Exchequer commitment for the 1968 crop.</P>
    <P>Why are we still in doubt about the amount of commitment?  Surely we should know at this stage what is the total commitment in respect of wheat of the 1968 crop.  Why do we not know and when will we know?  I know that a substantial amount of wheat was carried over into the 1969 season because of a belief that we should not have two such good years in succession. However, I hope that part of the expense involved here does not arise from overstoring, storing for too long and involving us in the extra cost of storage.</P>
    <P>We are glad to learn that the land project scheme is going ahead but I think most Deputies will be aware of the delays in the payment of grants towards this scheme.  I do not know why this should be so but, perhaps, the Minister could look into this matter.</P>
    <P>Concerning the additional sum for grants for the purchase of forage harvesters, this was one of the best schemes initiated from the point of view of encouraging silage making. The increase is not enormous, being about one-third, but it has had the very worthwhile effect of increasing silage production.</P>
    <P>The last matter about which I wish to speak is one that was raised also by Deputy Fahey who said that one of the main things wrong with Irish agriculture is that we have not enough advisory assistants but Deputy Fahey obviously did not pause to ask himself why we have this situation.  Is it <Col N="567" /> not a fact that there is turmoil in the advisory services because reasonable salaries are not being paid?  Is it not also a fact that the salaries paid are very much lower than the salaries of other professional people?  For instance, an engineer starts with about £1,500 a year, whereas an agricultural graduate starts at about £900 a year.  If the Minister agrees with Deputy Fahey about the shortage of advisers, he should do something about the salary scale.  There is no incentive for people to take degrees in agriculture.  The Minister should do whatever he can to overcome the difficulties that are facing the advisers as well as the committees of agriculture.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cronin</NameTxt>
      <P>In his own time the Minister will deal fully with the points raised but I should like to refer to a few points within the limited scope of this Supplementary Estimate.</P>
      <P>Coming from one of the most intensive agricultural areas in the whole of Ireland, with a combination of milk and tillage, I welcome the additional moneys made available for agriculture. Extra money is being provided for shows and show societies.  This is highly desirable because wherever there is an element of competition it makes for higher standards.  From my own experience, we have found that competitions for beet crops and so on improve the standard of workmanship and the standard of the final product in a big way. I welcome the provision of extra moneys under this subhead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An Foras Talúntais is also being <Col N="568" /> assisted.  This I regard as another highly desirable development.  With all the advantages we have in north east Cork, we also have the dairy section of An Foras Talúntais.  I am very pleased to say that they are doing an excellent job and I feel that the outcome of their work will have a big bearing on the future of our agricultural products.  In co-operation with the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries they are conducting very intensive research activities and probably the foremost of these activities is the attempt to diversify dairy products and to provide a wider range of products. From my experience they are fulfilling their purpose in north east Cork and doing a very good job. The advantage of their work is not alone seen in the open days or the fixed, scheduled demonstration days but their example is followed by many farmers in north east Cork.</P>
    <P>The land project is also being provided for.  I am pleased to say, having regard to the amount of work that has been carried out in many parts of Cork, that this is a well worthwhile investment. From time to time we hear complaints that the standards being sought by the land project office are too exacting but I am a believer in getting good value for money.  I have at all times advocated in my statements that it is only right that where the taxpayers' money is being invested the best value possible should be got for it.  This is reasonable.  The land project office is doing an excellent job. Indeed, we would like to have the advantage of the land project in parts of County Cork and north east Cork where it is not at present available.  The Board of Works enters into it here in that drainage is necessary before the land project work can be carried out. My one regret is that this necessary drainage has not been done with the result that land project grants are not available to farmers in certain areas. Many acres of top class land in north Cork are being flooded by the Black-water and its tributaries and where land is flooded an applicant does not qualify for a land project grant.  However, what is being done is well worth while, I feel that effort and endeavour should be compensated and paid for at <Col N="569" /> all times and certainly the operation of the land project scheme is well worth while.</P>
    <P>I am glad, too, to see attention being paid to the glasshouse industry.  There is a tremendous future for the horticultural sector.  I have had experience with the representatives of the glasshouse owners and they certainly have the right ideas as regards the development and improvement of the glasshouse industry.  It is highly desirable that a training scheme should be introduced because we must keep our minds on the fact that if we are to compete on the international market and hold our own we will have to produce top quality stuff.  The grading system for tomatoes is well worth while.</P>
    <P>We have heard from Deputies on the other side of the inadequacy of Government policy towards farmers while on the other hand we have heard that our Irish farmers are among the most efficient in the world. I claim that their efficiency is brought about by the aims and services and policies of the Fianna Fáil Government and that one cannot be divorced from the other.  Their efficiency and their high standards of quality of production would not be possible if it were not for the assistance given by the Government and the Department down the years.  Needless to say, we welcome criticism but it should be constructive and some of the comments from Deputies on the other side were anything but constructive.  The farmers of Ireland recognise that their standard of wellbeing is due to the policies of Fianna Fáil.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cronin</NameTxt>
      <P>As a direct representative of farmers, I am naturally interested in securing as much as possible for them.  In fact, I wish that the Estimate for Agriculture could be doubled but, unfortunately, we must be sensible in our attitude and in our approach.  It must be admitted that the Fianna Fáil Government and the Department have stood squarely behind the farmers and have made their present standard of wellbeing possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="570" /> I did not intend to speak on this Estimate because of its restricted nature but I wanted to make those few points especially that about the assistance for shows and competitions and any type of activity that would have the effect of improving our food standards. At the moment we hear a good deal about the establishment of what is known as the national codex alimentarius committee which has recently been established by the Minister. This is an organisation which aims at improving the standards of food products and has as its object to bring about standardisation of food among the many participating countries. When we join the EEC we will have to be able to attain the standards of this international organisation.</P>
    <P>Money is made available, too, for the provision of forage harvester equipment. This is highly desirable and I would hope for an extension of this type of grant to provide money for farmers who are prepared to go into co-operation in the use of farm machinery.  In beet growing areas we see the effectiveness and the usefulness of what are known as farm machinery syndicates.  These are regular, formal companies which bind farmers together in the use of the various implements which they need.  This type of activity should be encouraged because it helps the small farmer and makes available to him the most costly and best type of machines at a reasonable cost.  I visualise Government assistance to syndicates of this type.  I feel they should be encouraged.  They are certainly the answer for small farmers who want to have the benefit of top class equipment.</P>
    <P>As the Minister will be dealing at length with the various aspects of the Estimate, I have only hit a few spots in which I was particularly interested. I am not making any attempt to reply to the points that have been raised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>My contribution to this debate will be brief.  The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries indicated that those employed in agriculture can be thankful to Fianna Fáil policy and to the Fianna Fáil Government, and probably to the Minister as well, for <Col N="571" /> whatever money they have.  In my view there is no direct agricultural policy whatsoever.  The Government have been asking farmers during the past few years to increase milk production.  Last week the Minister stated that one of the products of this, butter, was being exported at the rate of 1s a lb.  People are being charged five times that price on the home market.</P>
      <P>I ask the Parliamentary Secretary what is the point in encouraging the farmers to produce something, or to increase their production in something, for which the market is already oversupplied? The prospects for the future do not seem very bright either.  What is the sense in asking farmers to produce more milk when in actual fact it is costing other sections of the community, along with the farmers, a certain amount of money to subsidise it?</P>
      <P>We will be entering the Common Market some time in the future and the Department of Agriculture should have a clear-cut policy whereby they would indicate to the farmers what we need when we become part of the EEC.  Will it be beef or milk that will pay them best in that community? This is what the Department of Agriculture and the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries should be concerned with at the moment rather than this stop-go policy which has prevailed with Fianna Fáil for quite a while.  Surely the Parliamentary Secretary must agree with what I am saying.  The sensible thing to do would be to prepare for our entry into the European Economic Community rather than introducing this Supplementary Estimate to try to forestall the farmers for a few more years with some silly promises of one type or another.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Deputy not agree with the Supplementary Estimate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Parliamentary Secretary says: &ldquo;My only wish would be that the Supplementary Estimate would be doubled&rdquo;.  As the discussion on this Supplementary Estimate is rather limited I will just deal with a few points.  First of all, I should like to deal with the farm building <Col N="572" /> scheme.  At the moment many farmers do not know what they are entitled to under the farm building scheme.  It is the duty of the Minister, the Parliamentary Secretary and the Department to set up an advisory service whereby those farmers who are not aware of what benefits they can receive under the farm building scheme would be educated in that respect.  Macra na Feirme are doing a very good job in this regard but the Department are lacking very much in this respect.  I suppose one could say that where pilot areas have been set up a certain amount of good has been done.</P>
      <P>We sent up a question to the Minister regarding the Dunmore pilot area. When this pilot area was set up three agricultural instructors were appointed to it but since October, 1969 we have been without a pilot area instructor. What was the sense in appointing three instructors when at the moment we have none?  I agree with pilot areas but the one thing I see wrong is that a lot of the agricultural instructors concerned with them have no practical experience of farming.  They deal with figures and things like that which are of little good to the farmer in many cases.  They encourage them to put up a lot of expensive buildings such as cow byres, haysheds and so on.  That is little good in the west of Ireland when you have to borrow money.  It is all right when the buildings are going up and for some little time afterwards but when you have to start paying back the money it is a different story. Where is the money to come from then?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>You will find in this regard that a millstone is being tied around the necks of small farmers.  They find it very hard to bear the brunt of the cost involved in running their farms because of the manner in which the agricultural instructors instruct them to run them. Many of those farmers accept the advice of those instructors but it would be much better if a lot of this money were put into some type of production from which there would be a monetary return at once.  Long term plans, whereby they could put up the necessary buildings later on, could also be made.  The manner in which the pilot area instructors instruct the small farmers <Col N="573" /> is not right.  In one area near where I live too many haysheds and cow byres have gone up and as a result you have a big expense of galvanised iron on a very small farm and the farmer finds it very hard to pay back what he has borrowed.  I would appeal to the Minister to ensure that some type of advisory service be set up to let small farmers know exactly what they can receive in regard to roads to their farmyards and water schemes from the farm building scheme.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer also to the land project scheme.  The grants for this at the moment are moderate.  One thing I object to is the delay in the payment of those grants.  This affects a lot of people.  In my area a fair amount of work is going on under this scheme and in many cases we find it very hard to get the agricultural officers to pass the schemes.  As a result many of those who are employed as agricultural contractors to do this type of work in the area have machines on the hire purchase system.  No farmer they go to can pay them cash down for a scheme. The result is that the contractor has to wait until the farmer gets the grant which means that he has to do the work and wait until the Department passes it.  Even after they pass it they wait for quite a while before they pay the grant.  This should be speeded up because a lot of those small contractors who are doing great work for the small farmers are being forced out of business due to the delay in the payment of those grants.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to see to it that those grants are speeded up.</P>
    <P>In the last Dáil I put down a question about wool prices.  The Minister set up a wool board, An Chomhairle Olla.  I do not know what the functions of this board are but I know that the Minister picked the vast majority of the members himself.  As one who produces a small quantity of wool every year I think the price paid for the wool is scandalously low.  If the Department does not do something about the price of wool it will find that the sheep population of Galway will dwindle even further than it has dwindled at the moment.  I make the point in the hope that the Minister will increase the price for wool.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="574" /> Many people not engaged in agriculture are under the impression that farmers get everything for nothing.  I am quite sure that there are a number of gentlemen farmers who get an easy £ because they have plenty of cattle and superior management but the vast majority of farmers in my own constituency work very hard for a very small income.</P>
    <P>In reply to the Estimate on Lands the Minister for Lands said he thought his Department should be amalgamated with the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries and that part-time farming should go hand in hand with industry and at the Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis he got a standing ovation for this suggestion.  Fine Gael have expressed this view for some time but rather than talk about it I wish the Government would implement the idea.</P>
    <P>There are a number of farming organisations but I do not feel there is enough co-operation between them. I understand the Minister is in consultation with the NFA at this very moment.  I know that the Minister is putting one body fighting against another.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I notice that an increased sum has been given to the Agricultural Institute in this Supplementary Estimate.  We should all be pleased with the work which the instititute has done.  It must not be forgotten that the institute was established during the lifetime of the last inter-Party Government.  This fact is sometimes conveniently forgotten outside this House, as, indeed, are many other things.  In the first years of its operation it devoted the major part of its activities to soil science, but as this study has been completed, as far as the practical farmer is concerned, they now have an opportunity to study animal genetics and animal breeding. It is essential that we should import the best breeds for milk and beef so that with the same feeding and the same number of cattle we will be able to produce increased milk yields and greater liveweight gains which, subsequently, will get us more money.</P>
      <P>Many worthwhile experiments have been carried out by the Agricultural Institute but the results of the experiment carried out at Grange on the feeding of cattle without roofs over their heads have not been fully conveyed to the farmers.  It was suggested to farmers attending the experiment that it was just as economical to feed cattle on silage and meal with no roofs over their heads as it was to do it with a roof over their heads.  The farmers who saw the experiment just did not believe it.  There were no figures for mortality rate, perhaps there was no mortality, but I still believe that any beast left outside in all weathers will devote some portion of the food to the preservation of its own body heat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to agree with what my colleague Deputy Donnellan said about <Col N="576" /> too many farm buildings and too little land.  I do not think small farmers should take on the responsibility of repaying loans which they cannot afford. The farm improvement scheme gives an opportunity for providing better and more economical housing for our cattle which, in turn, will bring a greater profit to the farmer.  As I have been critical about an experiment carried out by the institute, it falls upon me to give my reasons.</P>
    <P>I borrowed from the Agricultural Credit Corporation approximately £3,500 repayable over 21 years.  I availed of grants to the extent of about £800.  That unit will provide self-feed silage for 100 cattle in two units of 50. The cost, if one were to put only one beast per year through that unit, not taking into account the principal being repaid, which is an advantage for the owner, but taking into account merely the outgoings, is £2 per head.  If I am lucky enough to put my heavy cattle through that unit and then have a few months left to put stores and anything else into it at this time of the year until I have them out on grass, I avoid poaching and I am putting, more than one beast per head per year through that unit.  The cost to me, not giving credit for principal repaid when I avail of the grants, is £2 per head per year for one beast passing through.</P>
    <P>How much is £2 per head on beef in the Common Market?  It is one-sixth of a hundredweight.  If we can organise ourselves to provide the best technical and financial advice for farmers and produce units in bigger or smaller sizes, without doubt, this experiment falls down.  It is an advantage to have a beast well housed, the hay kept dry and right, and the straw for bedding piled above the silage bench.  Take the difference in cost for one-sixth of a cwt.  in, perhaps, 100 days winter feeding in such a unit.  It is quite certain that the beast out in the elements lying on wet grass will not produce this one-sixth of a cwt.  of beef which will be produced by an animal fed exactly the same amount of meals and silage in a comfortable, modern, well-designed unit.  I suggest that that is an <Col N="577" /> experiment which should be discontinued. Experiments should be along the line of producing well-designed self-feed silage units which can be mucked out with a tractor, which can be as large or as small as the farm can carry and will mean that the beast will be dry and comfortable&mdash;necessary conditions for putting on weight. As a practical farmer I have no doubt that any advice to the contrary is incorrect. I should like the Minister to comment on the matter when he is concluding.</P>
    <P>I wish now to comment upon the increase in the Supplementary Estimate for the land project.  The increase for the subsidy on fertiliser, both phosphatic and potash, betokens greater use of fertiliser by farmers. This is something that we all think is the right thing, the thing which will bring greater profits in the years to come and immediately.  As a farmer I have no objection to saying that quite a lot of the subsidy on fertiliser that is applied to grain goes in the first year and we as a Parliament and the Government are putting that aside into the Capital Budget, thereby implying that this will bring further results in the years to come.  In the case of granular fertiliser fed down the spout in a seed drill, this is hardly true.  Whether one has to worry about that aspect of the matter or not, the fact is that the extra application of fertiliser is commendable and merits mention.</P>
    <P>There is provision in the Supplementary Estimate of £224,000 for the land project.  I remember when the land project was the subject of scathing abuse in this House.  It is a long time since the former Deputy James Dillon stated that one million acres of land had become arable and profitable as a result of the land project.  He had the pluck to take £24 million of Marshall Aid money at 4¾ per cent.  Last week the ESB had to take money at 9½ per cent.  Let us thank God for the foresight and pluck of former Deputy Dillon and let us remember that at that time there were those in this House who decried him and said that he was putting the country in pawn. By whose standards do we work now?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="578" /> Who is putting the country in pawn at the moment?  Those who are over there now, who at another time were here, are responsible and, for political advantage, are not saying what could be said.</P>
    <P>The scheme of grants for calved heifers was a disastrous failure.  I want to give the history of that scheme.  The history started before the scheme was announced.  In the previous year, when I had been shadow Minister for Agriculture for Fine Gael, Deputy Clinton, former Deputy James Dillon and I sat down over three or four days and produced a heifer mating subsidy scheme which was designed to make it possible for the farmer to mate a heifer and have her calf, even if she was a beef heifer, before she left the country as beef.  It was an entirely different scheme from that operated by Fianna Fáil.  Once we had proposed that scheme, they had to do something different, being professional politicians to their fingertips.  They did something different.  The Estimate in the first year of this scheme of grants for calved heifers produced in his last year as Minister for Agriculture by Deputy Smith was £350,000 and the Supplementary Estimate for that scheme in that first year, when all the chancers in agriculture&mdash;and there are chancers in agriculture just as everywhere else&mdash; availed of the scheme, was £1,900,000. That is the proof that the scheme was a disastrous failure.  In this Supplementary Estimate today we are hearing its death knell.  It has gone now, as it had to go, because it was ill-designed and was made to be different from the proper scheme which we had devised which could have helped the farmers and could have been of continuing help to them as they moved towards the Common Market.</P>
    <P>I want now to deal with the two largest items in the Supplementary Estimate and, with your permission, Sir, I propose to discuss them together. In subhead K.29&mdash;Beef Cattle Incentive Scheme&mdash;there is a provision of £900,000.  There is an extra provision of £4.061 million for Milk Production Allowances, Marketing of Dairy Produce, including grants-in-aid.  I want to <Col N="579" /> advert to a matter that has slipped the attention of many people who are worried about our advent to the Common Market.  It is a fact that when the Common Market membership becomes ten instead of six our position in regard to milk products will improve marginally.  At the moment we are outside the Common Market and, as the Minister said in his opening speech, we have to sell butter at 1s per lb.  When we enter the Common Market that will no longer be the position. Marginally, our position will improve and we will not be in an absolutely disastrous surplus position within a Common Market of ten nations.  This should lead the Minister to realise that the sums he is now providing are really capital sums.  They are an investment in the prolongation of breeding herds here.</P>
    <P>I have already mentioned the question of animal genetics and animal breeding and said how necessary it is that the full attention of the Agricultural Institute should be devoted to these two aspects so that we will get the very greatest profit from our herds, whether for beef or for milk, when we go into the Common Market.  It is on profit that we all live.  At the same time, I want to emphasise something that people may not realise.  In fact, within the Ten we will not be as badly off on two counts.  The first count is that the arrival of 60,000,000 British will mean that there will be more people to drink milk.  That does not quite cancel out the arrival of Ireland and Denmark and any other country with a surplus of milk products.  Our position, as far as a surplus or a deficiency of milk products within the Ten is concerned, will be better than it would be at the moment within the Six.</P>
    <P>The second reason why we will be better off is that, when we get into the Common Market, there will be a system of target and intervention prices.  As I understand the situation, the price at which the Six would have to intervene to support our milk products would be higher than the price we are receiving at the moment or, if not higher, about the same.  The last time I looked at it, it was marginally higher.  So, in fact, things are not as <Col N="580" /> bad as the Minister suggested in his opening statement.  If we can get into the Common Market there is the point that surpluses and loads to be carried will be spread on ten backs instead of one and we, as a surplus producing agricultural community, will be in the favourable situation that the cost of disposing of those surpluses will be a responsibility not only of Ireland but also of Britain and all the other countries within the Common Market.</P>
    <P>Another interesting fact in relation to beef and milk that must also be thought about very seriously is that milk consumption remains largely static.  I suppose any of us looking at it in a practical way would say that in advanced communities such as we have all over Europe this will probably continue to be the case.  In fact there are not many children in Europe who cannot get an adequate amount of milk. There are many millions of children in Africa and South America who cannot get an adequate amount of milk but, with social services as they are in Europe, Britain and here, there are not many children who cannot get an adequate amount of milk.  Children are the big milk consumers and what has happened over the past year will continue to happen, that is, milk consumption in the various countries within the Ten will continue at about the same level.</P>
    <P>This is not true of beef.  The situation in relation to beef is that you could be quite well off and you might not be able to afford beef every day.  In Europe the price of beef is such that pork is everyman's meat and beef is eaten as a delicacy, as something that is more expensive and more prized.  As the standard of living rises in these countries it would seem that what has happened over the past decade will continue to happen and that the consumption of beef will continue to rise. Therefore, I would think that we will not be as badly off as the Minister suggested.</P>
    <P>When we get in&mdash;we will have a long hard pull until we do&mdash;we will certainly be better off as far as milk is concerned, and this great new market for beef will be opened up to us.  The figure I saw in the shops in Paris not so long ago for a hind leg of lamb <Col N="581" /> was £1 per lb.  They did not cut the leg of lamb the way my wife would want it if she went into the butchers.  They went right up across the rump and gave a huge lump of bone as well.  In the same city, steak would be making about the same price or more.  Of course the mark-up on the continent is colossal with added value tax and all the rest.</P>
    <P>In these circumstances, it is still a fact that if we can produce good beef in sufficient quantities we will have a great opportunity for expansion.  That is why I started my remarks on this Supplementary Estimate by exhorting the Minister to see to it that now&mdash; because cattle breeding is a long process&mdash;full attention is given to animal genetics and cattle-breeding, that as well as that, full attention is given to the improvement of our sheep breeds, and that in each case these will be made an absolute priority. There are beef breeds that can do better than anything we have here: Charollais, Semanthol, Limousin and various other breeds are being investigated at the moment.  There is our opportunity, but we cannot do this in five minutes.  A cow has a calf once a year roughly and if we want to get to the ordinary farmer, the man we all want to work for, the man Deputy Donnellan is talking about, we have to do this job now.</P>
    <P>We have been a little too fainthearted in the past.  Of course we were interrupted by the outbreak of the foot and mouth disease in England and once that happened it was ridiculous even to think about importation. I want to impress upon the Minister the opportunity that seems to be there.  We should not be too dispirited or too disconsolate just because there is a huge figure to be met now.  If, within a unified Europe, we will be working towards a better situation for Irish agriculture, then it is our job not to count the cost now but rather to point our thoughts in the right direction, towards producing an agricultural policy, and designing the work of the Agricultural Institute and the Department towards Ireland in this unified Europe which surely must <Col N="582" /> come.  Opportunities lost now will not return, and now is the time of opportunity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. Blaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>May I say first of all to the Members of the House that my absence from the House during a great part of this debate was in no way intended to be any reflection on the House.  Indeed, I was sorry that I could not be here but arrangements had been made for some time in advance for discussions with various farmers' organisations and that was the cause of my absence from the House not only today up to a short time ago but last week as well.  I should like to have been here for all of the discussion but, from what I have heard, and also from the notes I got, it would appear that the discussion ranged over wider matters than those concerned absolutely with the additional money requested in the Supplementary Estimate.</P>
      <P>However, this in itself may not have been any harm in view of the fact that it is quite a considerable time since we had a full overall discussion on agricultural matters in this House.  I am not sure of the details but I understand there is some suggestion that, perhaps tomorrow, there might be a debate on a token Estimate.  I do not know whether this is so, or if it is so what exactly it would entail, but if it should entail widening the discussion on the Department following on the contributions already made on this narrower estimate my remarks in reply would of necessity be more restricted than they might otherwise be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To get on to the matters that were raised.  There was, of course, the usual discussion on milk and beef, and the beef subsidy schemes and the cost of the subsidy for milk.  A great part of the £8.9 million for which the House is being asked is required for the support of milk products or dairy products this year.  Some Deputies had quite a bit to say about milk and dairy products as a whole.  The attack of course was mounted on this matter of a scaled support.  It was referred to as scaled pricing.  There is a clear distinction here.  No effort has been made to scale prices but a very decided <Col N="583" /> effort has been made to scale the support from the Exchequer to the individual milk producer, and that is based on the fairly just formula, as I see it, of giving the greater part of the support to those who need it most.  This is not to say that substantial profits cannot be made by the big enterprises engaging in milk production.  I have said that only 2½ per cent of our producers are suffering a diminution in actual price support and this has been refuted here in the House.  I have given the absolutely correct figure and that is the way it has been under this new support arrangement.</P>
    <P>If we had all the money we would like to have perhaps we could, willy-nilly, continue to support milk regardless of the quantity produced. However, it must be realised that the money we have available comes from the Exchequer and that there are many other uses to which any surplus that might accrue could be put, not only in agriculture but in many other activities of the Government.  We must therefore ask ourselves would we be fair to the community and to the public in continuing, as we have been doing up to recently, to give the same support for every gallon of milk produced regardless of the quantity and regardless of the profit per gallon that the particular producer was making from it.</P>
    <P>I think we have taken the right decision. All I am sorry for is that when milk price support arrangements were first instituted the scaled support arrangements were not built in.  Had that been done at that time it would have been welcomed as was the initial support then proposed.  Not only would it have been welcomed but there would not have been a chirp about it by way of criticism because it would have come to be accepted as fair and proper to help our dairying producers on a differential basis, giving support where it was most needed, while at the same time trying to maintain a situation where all participants in the dairying industry would be engaging in it on a profitable basis and getting a return for their labours proportionate to their input.</P>
    <P>The big milk farmer has no cause for complaint.  Let us remember, taking <Col N="584" /> one year with another and taking the average milk producing period as eight months of the year, mostly during the fair weather of the year, off the grass, if you like, a number of milk producers have been getting as much as £2,500 of support for their milk, an average of almost £50 a week or considerably higher than that if it is related to the eight months average milk producing period.  If that situation is contrasted with the situation of the smaller operators of whom there are 80 per cent in the dairying industry, it will be realised what a big figure £2,500 is by way of support and what a large income that would seem to the 80 per cent to whom I am referring.  Far from penalising the large producers, which has become the catchery in recent months, we are still supporting them to a very considerable degree.  The large milk producer working on any sort of efficient basis is doing quite well under our new support arrangements.  More power to him and may he continue to do so, but let us not have people crying on his behalf and saying he is being penalised because he has become efficient.  People who make that kind of argument either know only too well what they are talking about or have no idea what they are talking about.</P>
    <P>That tongue-in-cheek attitude is adopted by people who want to make trouble and to minimise the usefulness of the efforts we are making to support the dairying industry as a whole and to retain it intact even in these times of grave pressure on our dairy markets, in these times of gluts and surpluses in nations much bigger and better off than we are.  We do so in the knowledge that this situation will pass.  How long it will take to pass is the big guessing point at the moment, but pass it will.</P>
    <P>In the meantime we cannot afford to lose our cow numbers.  We would like to have less milk commercially sold or utilised for dairy products.  Therefore, we have been set the rather difficult task of maintaining our cow numbers and increasing them, if possible, while at the same time trying to keep down the throughput of commercial milk selling and to turn out more beef. Any one of those aims might be readily accomplished but to do all three is <Col N="585" /> very difficult.  However, we are succeeding on all three fronts.  Despite the stresses of the dairying market our cow numbers are increasing, admittedly slowly, but nevertheless increasing.  At the same time our total milk cheque to our dairy industry continues to increase and our total beef production continues to rise.</P>
    <P>Therefore, we are succeeding in doing the three things which seem to be incompatible and which other countries in somewhat similar circumstances have tackled in a completely different way.  It is often asked why we do not do as they are doing.  If we were to do that we would kill off our cows.  This is very easy to do but once it is done it is not so readily rectified.  We want to keep increasing our cow herds.  We want more beef and we want to be in the position that if and when we do enter the EEC and milk becomes a viable proposition again we can readily move back into substantial milk production in addition to continuing beef production.</P>
    <P>In trying to accomplish these aims we must defend ourselves from attacks by various people who are interested in only one element and have no regard to the other elements that go to make up this group of people who breed the cattle and produce the milk, altogether amounting to a very considerable proportion of our farming enterprise in this country.</P>
    <P>There is a great deal of talk about rationalising in order to get bigger returns per gallon for our milk.  As I have made known on many occasions, I am for amalgamation and rationalisation, but these moves must be socially as well as commercially desirable.</P>
    <P>The effect on our national economy as a whole must be taken into account. All these things require careful study and if at times, perhaps, I have appeared to decry some effects of amalgamation proposals it was because those proposing them were not doing so in the most useful manner.  They were making wild claims regarding the financial benefits that would accrue; in some cases they claimed that there would be an increase of 6d or even 1s per gallon if certain amalgamations were carried out.  Everybody knows it <Col N="586" /> would be impossible for any amalgamation, no matter how outlandishly unsuitable it might be from many points of view, to have an inbuilt benefit of anything like 6d or 1s per gallon.  I am not against amalgamation but I want to debunk wild claims, made perhaps unthinkingly, for which there is no basis and in respect of which there would be a great deal of gnashing of teeth if such amalgamations went through and the reality had to be faced that instead of 1s per gallon there might be 1d or 2d per gallon.</P>
    <P>To help me to evaluate any proposal it is my intention to set up a group of experts who would take an objective view of any suggestions for amalgamation.  Their job would be to advise me; they would not be a general stalking-horse or a substitute for the Minister behind which he could hide, but would be an aid in helping the Minister to arrive at conclusions where propositions are made.  An arrangement like this would ensure that when we agree to amalgamation we would have looked at both sides of the coin, not only in the purely local and profitability sense, but in the local social sense and the wider context of ultimate amalgamations and rationalisation taking place in adjoining areas.  This body is not intended to be a decision-making organ behind which the Minister could shield from all subsequent criticism but is merely to ensure that the best possible knowledge is obtained from people, chosen for their objectivity, who have no particular axe to grind.</P>
    <P>There have been the usual rather exaggerated suggestions about what we could do at home to find new outlets for milk and dairy products.  It was suggested that the establishment of milk bars would help in this direction. There are milk bars in this city and throughout the country but I should like to see milk being made available in our bars&mdash;and I mean liquor bars. If milk could be sold in our bars this would be of benefit to many people. It would certainly mean that many would get home on a slightly straighter path, in addition to helping increase the consumption of milk.</P>
    <P>We have been endeavouring for <Col N="587" /> some time to ensure that in our hotels and restaurants, particularly those registered by Bord Fáilte, milk would be available as a matter of course, just as tablecloths and cutlery are provided on tables.  There is no reason why milk should not be readily available in a country that has such an abundance of milk and which is such a good value product from every point of view.  At present while milk is fairly readily available in some bars or hotels in other cases one would think the management had to bring the cows in and milk them to judge by the length of time it takes to fill an order.  All these measures are minor and, taken individually, would make very little impact but grouped together they could help to reduce some of the surplus we have and would be of benefit to the nation as a whole.</P>
    <P>On the question of margarine we have the pro-and anti-factions, with wild claims from both sides.  It is considered by some that the control of the sale of margarine in any way would be practically unconstitutional while the other side holds the view that not to impose controls would, equally, be unconstitutional.  However, somewhere between both extremes there must be the happy medium and compromise. Due to the extreme publicity and propaganda which the international concerns have carried out in relation to margarine it is true that the butter market in this country has been eroded.  We have either got to conduct a propaganda war with these people or take the more obvious course&mdash;to have some sort of control over their operations. Even as private commercial companies in some cases these combines could afford to spend more money on advertising than we as a nation would be prepared to spend and I do not, therefore, see much point in conducting a propaganda war.  Personally, I have no doubt whatever about which product is better but the fact is that propaganda can, and does, have a tremendous impact.  At the moment about 10,000 tons of margarine are being used in this country, for which butter could be very usefully substituted. If we work on the basis of a loss of £250,000 per 1,000 tons we can <Col N="588" /> and £3 million at the moment and that is an approximate figure.</P>
    <P>A suggestion has been made regarding free milk for hospitals and schoolchildren. One of the difficulties in cases like this is that the administrative costs quite often practically outweight the advantage of providing the commodity. There is the inbuilt propensity in our nature that, where something is provided at no cost, very little is thought of it and it is abused rather than used. There is also another tendency to get this free milk for specific reasons but to substitute it instead of the milk that might ordinarily have been bought at full market price, with an ultimate loss to the Exchequer and no additional quantity of milk being consumed. Having regard to these tendencies I have mentioned, there might be very little return for all the work and all the accompanying paraphernalia that would be put into such a scheme. However, the suggestion is not being discarded but is being examined to see whether something useful could be achieved by the establishment of such a scheme.</P>
    <P>From the point of view of utilising more dairy products at home the position is that we could use a good deal more Irish cheese.  I want to put on record how much I deplore the attitude of the shops, particularly the large shops, which import cheese despite the fact that we have an abundance of home made cheese.  In my opinion, they have a goddam cheek to bring the stuff in at all and a greater cheek to display it practically exclusively on the shelves.  There is this extraordinary trend, not only in relation to cheese but in relation to many other commodities.  Biscuits come to mind immediately.  There are all sorts of things in tins and the further away they are made the greater the display: you name it, they have it.  They have everything except what is made in Ireland.  There seems to be some kind of premium attaching to distance.  The further away the product is manufactured, the better it is; that seems to be the implication.</P>
    <P>I do not see what we can do.  It is for the consumers to take the matter into their own hands and make it <Col N="589" /> clear that they are not interested in the imported article when they can get equally good, or better, produced at home.  Something must be done about this because the practice is growing and it will have consequences for industry, employers and workers, here at home.  It may be said that the Dairy Publicity Council is not doing enough. Perhaps it is not.  Perhaps it could do more. I have been in touch with the council and they are very willing to do more, and I am hoping that in the coming financial year steps will be taken to ensure that Irish dairy produce is displayed in abundance in all our shops.  It is in our own interests to buy Irish and it is nothing short of a scandal that products of a lower quality are peddled here as if they were sent down from heaven for the benefit of the people.  The people must get wise to this and demand Irish goods.</P>
    <P>The suggestion was made that Bord Bainne should be given the responsibility of operating home market sales. They have enough on their plate operating on the export market, particularly in depressed markets and almost closed markets, and all their energies are required in the external market to find a footing of any sort in order to dispose of an export surplus.  The home market is using a considerable amount of dairy produce.  It could use more, but I do not think Bord Bainne should be diverted from the absolutely essential work of looking after export sales. It was for that purpose it was set up. Perhaps, if the time arrives at which we can actually sell abroad instead of partially giving away, Bord Bainne can be asked to do a job on the home market.</P>
    <P>It is not true to say we are unfair to the Irish consumer when we sell butter at 1s per lb abroad.  It is all too easy to make that statement.  It is all too easy to ask why we do not sell it at the same price on the home market rather than give it to reluctant consumers abroad.  The fact is we are getting almost, though not quite, an economic price at home.  We pay a considerable subsidy even on the butter consumed at home and, as against losses on export, we get a reasonably <Col N="590" /> good price.  If we were to reduce the price of butter at home to the price at which we are selling it on the export market one can see immediately that on every ton of the 33,000 tons there would be a loss of perhaps 4s per 1b. If we were to increase consumption by 4,000, 5,000 or 10,000 tons we would still lose in the overall.  It would be only too pleasant if we could operate an economy like that, but it just does not work out that way.  We would, in fact, find ourselves in more difficulty.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton talked about the levy on liquid milk and he said that two-peace per gallon is twice as much as is necessary.  All I can do is to refer the Deputy to the milk producers in Dublin and Cork.  So long as I get back the equivalent of what the disposal of surplus milk is costing the Exchequer at the moment, I will not mind which way they take it.  I am afraid Deputy Bruton miscalculated.  The levy is necessary to give us back the money that the Exchequer wants returned.</P>
    <P>The beef incentive scheme was discussed at some length.  If people are oriented towards beef, then the scheme is a good one.  The man who is interested in milk sees the scheme as something designed to attract people away from milk production.  Neither one of these conclusions is correct.  The correct conclusion is a bit of both. We want people to refrain from producing more milk.  We want to help people in curtailing milk production at this time if this is possible.  We want to encourage them not to go in for milk production if they are not already involved in it.  We wish to do this because of the depressed state of the market.  We want to encourage them to produce beef.  We need more beef. We would like to reduce the level of milk production until our market has become stabilised.  This scheme is double-edged.  It was introduced on that basis.</P>
    <P>We have a suggestion that the subsidy should be raised substantially because it is not attractive at the moment.  The £12 subsidy per cow will not compensate a man for decreasing the milk production.  If he had intended to lessen the milk production for other <Col N="591" /> reasons the subsidy would encourage him.  I do not want such a man to sell his herd and to cease rearing cows.  I want him to stay in cow production. We need to have the same number of calves as heretofore but we would be glad not to be embarrassed by more milk production from any particular herd.  To say that we should double the subsidy from £12 to £24 is ignoring certain basic facts.</P>
    <P>In furtherance of this argument, it is said that one could save £10 or £11 per cow because each cow is costing £35 in milk subsidy and the difference between £35 and £24 is £11, so every cow taken out of milk production saves £11.  This ignores the fact that there are about 500,000 cows in the country which are not producing milk commercially but which participate to quite a considerable degree in the beef incentive scheme.  If we increase this £12 subsidy to £24 we must remember that, while there may be a saving on each cow taken out of milk production, there will be a considerable number of cows for which we will have to pay the additional £12 over and above the £12 we pay at the moment. On this basis the scheme could cost us considerably more than the sum we have allocated to it this year.</P>
    <P>Allowing for attractions out of milk production into beef production and for the amount necessary to pay for the first and second cows under this scheme, our bill could come to something in excess of £7 million.  While stepping-up the subsidy from £12 to £24 seems to have an in-built reward from the Exchequer, as against the support given for milk production, it does not work out like that.  The additional cost for the basic beef herd which is already there must be calculated before one begins to calculate the savings on attracting cows from milk to beef production.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>It could rise to £9 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>It could.  It could rise to £7 million or £9 million.  That depends on how attractive the whole new situation of doubling the subsidy would be.  One can only guess how it <Col N="592" /> would work out, how much impact it would have, how many people would be attracted from milk production to beef production for the first time, and how many additional cows those who are already in beef production might keep in the future.  If we were in a position to announce an increase of that sort our overall bill for the scheme in the year ahead would rise by at least £5 million over what it is costing in the present year.  The increase could be £7 million.</P>
      <P>A suggestion has been made that by increasing this subsidy we could also apply it in such a way that we could phase farmers out of milk production and could pay the subsidy to them on some of their cows.  If farmers declared they were only going to milk 25 cows this year instead of 50 last year, it has been suggested that we could arrange for them to collect a beef subsidy on the cows which no longer produced milk for sale.  It is not easy to police such an operation.  I deliberately use the word &ldquo;police&rdquo; for the reason that some of the herd would produce milk and the question is which part of the herd would produce the milk and how much milk would it produce.  Calculations might be made on the milk production of 50 cows, and a subsidy paid on less milk sent in than previously. Such a scheme is full of difficulty.  No two cows necessarily produce the same amount of milk.  A great deal of milk might not necessarily be got from a selection of the 50 cows and the residue would be collecting a subsidy the other way.  A farmer could be said to have things both ways.  I am not saying this is a totally wrong concept.  It would be very difficult to operate such a scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Clinton was anxious to know how many cows were switched from milk production to beef production because of the £12 subsidy.  I do not know and I do not think anybody else knows.  I have no doubt whatever that if there was not a scheme in operation at the moment there would be more cows in commercial milk production than there are at the moment.  The inducement to engage in milk production would still draw farmers in the years ahead as it has been drawing them in the years just passed.  I cannot <Col N="593" /> put a figure on it.  We will be able to get down to figures for this when we have more experience of the scheme.  At the moment it would be foolhardy to attempt to do this.</P>
    <P>There has been much talk about pigs.  The throughput of our factories this year has been an all-time record. This has been generally accepted.  An additional number of pigs went through our factories.  What is in doubt is where they came from.  We are being told how many came from the Six Counties and how many were born, reared and fattened in the 26-Counties. I do not believe that there has been a huge influx of pigs from the Six Counties. I have no doubt that there was a movement of pigs from that area.  I do not doubt that there is a movement at any stage, either way across the Border, if it is commercially attractive. It may have been commercially attractive to bring in pigs before we brought down the weight of our top-weight pigs to near-conformity with the reduced weight of 145 lbs in the Six Counties. I do not believe that the two million pigs which went through our factories can be accounted for to any considerable degree by smuggling operations. Anybody who knows anything about smuggling operations would not countenance that the figures for smuggling were of any great impact in that total record throughput which has been arrived at in this particular year.</P>
    <P>Neither do I agree with those who say that the upsurge in numbers has not some relation to the various incentives and aids that have been provided by Government policy over a number of years and stepped up in recent times.  All the various things we have been doing to encourage pig production on a more rational and uniform basis are beginning to pay off and the rise in throughput at our factories will, subject to market availability for the produce either as pork or bacon, continue. Provided we can keep the relationship between the profitability of a pig fed and fattened and any similar activity on the farm, or available to a farmer, I think we should continue to get high numbers.  We may even seek and get still higher numbers than are going through at present.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="594" /> This is not to say that some of the pigs did not come down from the Six Counties.  They did not leave because of the troubles in August or anything like that.  They did come down but there was not the influx that is talked about and we are not likely to have any repetition, necessarily, in the immediate future of what we had last year.  Whatever the level of it may have been, I do not think it is likely to run at that level this year because the same attraction is not here.  Although complaints are made about the price of pigs, the price of feeding and the profitability, or lack of it, and about smuggling and the lack of prevention, nobody seems to think of congratulating ourselves that our price levels in our factories are such as to attract pigs from the Six Counties.  We should be rather proud of this in a way because we so often hear so much about how much better things are north of the Border that you become rather sick of it.  Here, we have a case where pigs are more valuable down here to the extent that smuggling in various degrees is said to be going on.  It was price that brought the pigs down and it was not any of the difficulties encountered last summer.</P>
    <P>It is true that the talk about smuggling has largely stopped.  One does not see it headlined in past weeks any more than you see headlines about barley or wheat smuggling.  I suggested publicly at one stage that all the talk would stop only when the shoe was on the other foot and something was going across the Border in the opposite direction.  I suggest the stoppage came when potatoes began to go across the Border in a northerly direction.  That is why the two-way trade is operating again and there has not been the outcry about the wheat and barley and pigs that were said to be pouring in and about to smother us only a few months ago.  There is no doubt about it being a two-way trade.  To what degree it may be countenanced, I do not know; but there is a level below which it cannot be controlled.  If the profit is there it will take place, and it does take place. The territorial boundary is such that it is physically impossible completely to prevent it in regard to any commodity at any time.  While we may deplore it at <Col N="595" /> times very often there is little more we can do than what is being done at the moment by way of customary patrols and Garda patrols along the Border.</P>

      <P>Let us get back to pigs and to the fact that the policies pursued on this side of the Border in increasing pig numbers are showing up to advantage.  Deputies over there should read the criticisms that were made a year or two ago about how pig numbers had declined and how the Government were to blame for that situation.  They can see how others can stand up in their place here today and talk about the increased numbers and not in any way acknowledge that the Government had a hand in bringing about an increase in stocks.  The fact that we have increased stocks will be explained by saying they were all smuggled across the Border.  That is one of the features of the Opposition that tends to confuse if one thinks back too far or reads what was said six or 12 months ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have had suggestions about the sheep subsidy scheme to the effect that it should be extended to cover inland or lowland sheep.  In our considerations, in initiating a mountain sheep subsidy scheme and extending and improving it, this is a matter to which we gave some thought.  On every occasion since when there was any change and even annually, when we were viewing the year ahead and providing money to cover the existing hill sheep subsidy, it has also been considered. It is not an easy suggestion to counter in one sense.  We have a declining total number of sheep but in the lowlands particularly there is a decline. <Col N="597" /> The attractions of other farming enterprises and lines of production that are apparently more profitable must play a very considerable part in deciding whether sheep stocks expand or contract I think that recent years will be seen as years when the attraction of milk, beef or cereal production or root crop production&mdash;depending on the part of the country concerned&mdash;may have encouraged people to cut down on sheep and step up their other activities.</P>
    <P>At the same time it is held that in the absence of an absolute floor price market arrangement, no matter what the profitability might appear to be in sheep, people will not produce them in any great number or the numbers will not revive.  That is debatable against the background of a British market, which is a supported one and whose price level is by and large paralleled here by the aid we are able to give on the export of lambs and the fact that we have a cross-Border trade for stores, lambs or sheep.  The fall in number in Britain, where they have almost guaranteed markets and prices, makes one wonder whether the argument is basically good that certainty of market is the essential ingredient missing here at present.  Britain has that certainty and her numbers are falling.  The further they fall the greater assurance there is to our sheep producers that there is a ready market that is fairly reamining this at the moment.  I do not munerative available to them but that knowledge does not seem to have had any effect in the recent past.  We are exknow if we can do anything by way of manipulation of the existing support or subsidy.  It is rather puzzling against the background that sheep numbers are so low, particularly in the lowlands, and have shown no signs of recovery as yet.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies suggested that the inspections of mountain sheep for subsidy purposes are too severe.  I have also heard suggestions that such inspections are not severe enough.  Perhaps there is truth in both.  Perhaps a little tightening-up here and a little slackening there and a greater uniformity can be achieved according as we get used to the administration of this <Col N="598" /> scheme.  I would not say that, at the moment, there is not basis for both criticisms; I have no particular evidence that there is.  We are learning in the course of the administration of this scheme and maybe, in the time ahead, we shall be able to do a more satisfactory job as a result of experience.</P>
    <P>Animal diseases came in for considerable discussion.  Somebody asked when the bovine tuberculosis eradication scheme would end.  It will never end.  That is not to say we shall be running the country and taking out hundreds of thousands of reactors every year, at very great cost to the community. While that is not what is in prospect, nevertheless, once we have an area clear, there will have to be some surveillance to ensure that the disease does not emerge again.  This is a continuous process.  You cannot just eradicate the disease and close up shop and think that never again shall we have problems of this nature. Once we are really clear then we have to ensure by our own efforts, that the disease does not re-emerge, or, if it does, that it is controlled quickly and at no great cost by its expanding or getting out of hand.</P>
    <P>There is a natural desire in this House that the brucellosis eradication scheme be extended as soon and as far as possible.  This is the intention of my Department and it is my intention. We are moving along as fast as we can and shall continue to do so in the hope that ultimately we can eradicate this scourge, as well, not only to obviate the losses it causes and has caused over the years but indeed, also, on a purely commercial basis, because the Six Counties is now moving into the clear as far as brucellosis is concerned. Britain is expected to commence operations in clearing in 1971.  As sellers to both of these markets, it behoves us to try to get rid of brucellosis as fast as we can.  This we are proposing to do.  Already, five counties have been declared brucellosis-free.  We want to add to this as quickly as we can and radiating from that front is the manner in which it will go.</P>
    <P>There has been certain criticism of our prices for animals taken up by way of reactors.  It was argued that the levels were laid down a considerable <Col N="599" /> number of years ago and require to be up-dated.  This may be so; perhaps we can do something about that.</P>
    <P>Mention was made of the warble fly, which is difficult to eradicate completely. There are some intractable people with infected animals who did not present them for dressing even when we were offering it for nothing. Mistakes must have been made, also, by haphazard operators who went around to do the dressings.  Somebody said that they just shook their hands at them, in some cases, or left the mixture with the farmer and suggested that maybe he would do it himself.  We have brought damage from warbles from a very high incidence to a very low level in a few short years but we still have this pest with us in some areas.  We are making an evaluation, as best we can, as to the incidence of the pest and where it still seems to persist. We expect this information to be fairly well available to us in a coherent from by April when we intend to have another look at the situation to see what further steps can be taken to wipe out the pest, if at all possible.</P>
    <P>Fluke control in sheep has been mentioned by way of the Department's giving more information to sheep owners on the subject.  Certainly, we can readily give information as to its control: I thought we were endeavouring to give it.  We can have another look at the matter from the point of view of intensifying propaganda in regard to fluke control.  This is very necessary especially if information alone can make inroads on its control. We should be very glad to make known to farmers in a more forceful manner the control methods we recommend.</P>
    <P>Difficulties in relation to grants for water, particularly on farms, have been mentioned.  The suggestion was made that where a group scheme is in prospect or a regional scheme, which is perhaps even more remote at times in an area than a group scheme, farmers are finding difficulty in their individual applications in getting any satisfaction from my Department.  This is not so, and if there are Members of the House who come across this problem, we will have to intervene <Col N="600" /> and try to smooth things for the people concerned.  With that in mind, I ask Deputies who come across this problem to get in touch with me in the Department with a view to solving the matter.</P>
    <P>There has been much mention of farm buildings, the main suggestion being that there are delays in paying grants.  This is always difficult to answer.  One can always pick out of the thousands of applications a relatively few isolated cases of which it could be said that they were not dealt with very expeditiously.  There may be some explicable reasons in some cases and in others there may not be any good explanation for the delay.  It has now been brought to our attention.  We have taken note of the suggestion and we will do our best to ensure that there will not be any element that would tend to make this scheme unsatisfactory. If there is, we will try to eliminate it in our examination of the administration of the scheme.</P>
    <P>There were suggestions on the question of grants for dry-stock as distinct from dairy stock and it was submitted that the entire matter should be reviewed. It is topical that this should be raised at this time because it will be realised that during the past number of years there has been a leaning towards equipping the dairyman by way of buildings, dairy parlours and milking houses and so on as distinct from the dry-stock producers. It is time to have another look at this and we will give it that look to see if there can be a levelling up in the assistance given to the dry-stock producers.  As I said to somebody recently, though the suggestion to level up the dry-stock assistance may have merit, it may well be that we should instead level down the assistance to the dairy stock people.  It is more likely, however, that there will be a compromise in a new scale of grants. We will consider it and Deputies will be hearing more about it in the near future.</P>
    <P>There have been suggestions that when farmers avail of the land project scheme and also the farm buildings scheme, one type of inspector should <Col N="601" /> be in charge of both.  This suggestion seems to be attractive but I am afraid that is not the way the schemes can be operated.  Several of the people who deal with the land project do so on the basis of their training for that particular role.  Farm buildings are an entirely different thing, though both are related, and you could not expect to get in all cases and in every area a man who could assume the dual role. While it might be useful to have it in a few cases, it would be nearly impossible in all areas to have men who would be qualified for both.  Therefore, this is clearly not on, though it is a worthy thought that it might be accomplished.</P>
    <P>There has been a suggestion that the agricultural advisory services should perhaps push the use of lime and fertilisers to a greater degree, and as an addendum it has been suggested that perhaps the number of instructors is insufficient.  There are 600 throughout the county and they are pushing the use of lime and fertilisers through educational classes and courses.  They have been pushing the greater use of fertilisers and in fact more lime and fertilisers have been used in recent years.  However, in so far as it is desirable and useful to mention it to them, we can mention it to the CAOs and others in our various talks with them.</P>
    <P>The glasshouse grants scheme was mentioned.  As I indicated in recent days, the scheme has been amended. We took out the open door and where the sky was the limit heretofore as regards the total amount any applicant could get, and an applicant did not need to have any contact with agriculture or horticulture&mdash;a business firm could engage in it to a colossal degree &mdash;we have brought down the limit to a maximum of £40,000 in the case of applications already in hand and to £25,000, with the one-third of the estimated cost still being the yardstick, in so far as new applicants are concerned, with the further addendum that priority will be given in future to those mainly or solely earning their livelihood from agriculture or horticulture or both.</P>
    <P>The intention is to direct the money <Col N="602" /> to those who really need it, to those who will make proper use of it, those who will earn their livelihood from these operations.  That is the way we should move at this stage rather than in the way we operated in the immediate past.  I should say that, as a result of the scheme in the past, the £500,000 earmarked for a five year period was well exceeded after two and a half years.  That is why we had to call a halt in the middle of last autumn. A re-appraisal was essential if it was to continue and as I have said, I recently announced the conditions on which it is to continue.  Perhaps, the House will realise and appreciate that the attainment of this upper level is the right way to operate a scheme such as this.</P>
    <P>With regard to the small farm incentive bonus scheme, the rousing suggestion has been made that the figure should be raised to £1,000. Certainly, I would not mind in the least having £1,000 to offer to every participant or potential participant in the scheme but we must realise that that sort of money does not grow on trees any more than the other moneys which we have to get by the million. I would point out to the House and to the Deputy who raised this matter that this scheme which emerged a few years ago in the modest form of a £200 bonus scheme has been increased recently by 50 per cent, thereby increasing the benefit to £300 per holding. Considering that all the other grants are available to participants in this scheme this amount is not bad for merely striking the target that has been laid down by a farmer in drawing up his farm plan.  It is a free scheme given to a farmer for doing something that he himself wants to do.  The idea of increasing the figure to £1,000 cannot be thought about at this time.</P>
    <P>The question has been asked as to what we will do about the pilot areas. This question has been put to me in various forms during the years.  A pilot area, by its very name, gives a fair indication of what the scheme is all about.  Some years ago the scheme was introduced in each of 12 counties and it was decided to give special grants and advice in these areas as to how <Col N="603" /> best the lot of the people could be improved in each of the parishes and how this could be done in an intensive sort of way while trying, at the same time, by co-operatives and other means, to engage the people in new enterprises or outlets for their products or, indeed, in any new line of farming.</P>
    <P>The result of a couple of years experience on the parish basis encouraged the Government to go a little further and expand these pilot areas by adding about one more parish to each so that during the past couple of years we have been working on the basis of approximately three parishes per county of the 12 designated western counties.  We got a good deal of information on the basis of the parish operations and we then decided to expand the operation into areas three times the size of the parish to see how this would work and if flaws would emerge when the scheme is more generally applied.  Therefore, these different enterprises in different areas are being tried out on this broader scale while they still remain sufficiently small to be within the perspective of the adviser in the area.  We hope to have an evaluation from this effort of the three-parish basis from which we may learn a lot.  We may find that certain incentives are meaningless and should be discontinued because of their not being good value for money while we may find that others are very good value for money and should not only be retained but broadened, improved and increased by way of the amount of grant.  We hope that the result of this exercise will mean that grants of assistance from the Department may be more intelligently applied to the country as a whole.  Therefore, to answer the question as to what we will do with the pilot areas in the future is not possible at this time because they are pilot and they are there for the purpose of evaluating so that the question can only be answered when we have decided that all useful information has been gleaned from the exercise. The question cannot be answered until we have made up our minds as to what we will then do and this stage should be reached fairly soon.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="604" /> There was a suggestion that sufficient money is not given to An Foras Talúntais to enable them to plan ahead.  They have my sympathy but which one of us can say that, in his own estimation, he gets enough money? Who is there among us who can positively plan ahead in so far as money utilisation is concerned?  At the same time, let me say that year after year our import of Exchequer money to An Foras Talúntais is greater and greater. This year it will be in the region of a couple of million pounds.  It is increasing and will continue to increase.  How far will it continue to increase?  Will the increases be fast enough to do the jobs that it is believed are useful and necessary to do?  Everything considered we have been making a fair input to An Foras.  While more money could be used, they have been given fair scope during the years and the money we are now contributing is not to be sneezed at as An Foras will readily appreciate.  While they never fail to avail of an opportunity to impress on us how much more money they would like to receive and the plans they could make if they had this extra money, they realise that our contribution is no mean or small amount.</P>
    <P>I am sure they are also aware that the idea of a planning programme to cover some years ahead is one which I favour and I am glad that the council of An Foras Talúntais are thinking on these lines.  It will make for better operations between An Foras and my Department if we have this long term planning.  As to allocating the money for two or three years ahead, this is sound sense and I am in favour of doing this.  I will do all I can to try to formulate the type of financial programme that will be fairly satisfactory to An Foras, their director, their council and their staff while, at the same time, giving a fair return to the country in all contexts by way of benefits to the farming community generally for the money spent.</P>
    <P>Agricultural shows were mentioned and it was suggested that a small show should get fair play as against the bigger one.  I do not know what exactly Deputy Creed had in mind here but if he is thinking of the type of <Col N="605" /> assistance that is provided by the local agricultural committees, then I say that if they think they should go a little further than they are doing I would be very much inclined to sympathetically consider any proposals they may send in with regard to increasing their contribution on the basis of encouraging a small show in some strategic area as against spending more money on a big show that is well established and does not need contributions to the same degree.  We would certainly be sympathetic in that direction if there was any question of such being raised.</P>
    <P>Then we had the question of the farm income.  This is the hoariest of all the hoary statistics that one can quote.  I do not blame the Deputy who quoted it in any way.  It came from that most reputable of bodies&mdash; An Foras Talúntais.  It came from a survey of theirs which showed that the average income of an Irish farmer is £465.  I could spend the next six months playing around with that figure and those who would play around with me on the figure would be just as wise at the end of the six months as I am at the beginning because it does not mean anything very much.  There are qualifications of all sorts that must, in fairness, be built in with that statement which are not built in with it. Therefore, trying to answer that sort of assertion is like looking for the needle in the proverbial haystack.  It just cannot be done adequately except on a much broader basis and with many qualifications.  The figure of £465, in fact, has little relevance in the context in which it was used in this debate.  I would welcome this figure being introduced here in a more protracted debate on, say, the general Estimate, and followed, with all the conditions that I know must go with it, to its logical conclusion.  We could have a very useful exposition of the fallacy of throwing out this sort of isolated figure and the effect it can have on the public mind.</P>

I do not quite get the relevance here but perhaps the Deputy will enlighten me later on.  However. I would welcome a discussion on this on a broader basis, perhaps on the Estimate proper or indeed at any other time the opportunity arises.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Donnell Complained about there being no opportunity of having a detailed discussion on agriculture since the end of 1968.  I regret that as much as Deputy O'Donnell does because if one were to go back&mdash;and I did not go back&mdash;to read the debates of 1968 I would say that much of the bubbles that were blown at that stage by the Opposition at these benches have long since burst very decisively.  The loss is mine and the Government's that we did not have an opportunity during the past year to have a full discussion and to expose some of the fallacies that were preached to us in the 1968 debates.  Perhaps in the coming year we may get this opportunity that was not available to use in 1969.  I would welcome it as much as Deputy O'Donnell.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been a suggestion that there is a conflict between the Minister for Lands, the Minister for Social Welfare and the Minister for Agriculture in regard to pronouncements recently.  Quite candidly, I am not aware of the circumstances of these alleged conflicts.  I was not in the House for Deputy O'Donnell's contribution but he talked about the 70-acre farm.  I would like to see people with 70 acres of land.  If it were possible I would like to see them with 100 acres of land but I know it is not possible and that it will not be possible for a very long time, no matter what re-arrangements take place, to have this happy circumstance of an adequate acreage being available.  The question, even then, is whether 70 acres is adequate.  Seventy acres of what sort of land in what part of the country and participating in what type of farming operated by what type of farmer?  These are the questions one must ask when one talks about the viability of a holding.  So many things decide this issue that while 70 acres is a nice figure for many of our land-hungry <Col N="607" /> western farmers, and indeed land-hungry farmers in many other parts of the country as well, taking that in isolation and talking about it is not an answer in itself and never can be.  There can be no suggestion that the Minister for Lands reckoned that if a man is given 70 acres of land he can be let off and is safe and sound forever after, regardless of what form of farming he participated in and what type of farmer he is, whether he is prepared to work hard, prepared to do more than the average farmer or to do less.  All these things must come into this and I am quite sure the Minister for Lands had in mind these conditions applying to any figure that he, at any stage may have mentioned. I must say I am not aware of the relevance of the Minister for Social Welfare to this alleged conflict and therefore I am not in any position to comment on it.  I would be surprised if the Minister for Social Welfare and the Minister for Agriculture found themselves in any conflict.  We do not usually do so.  This Government, as Deputies over there have found to their cost, do not have the sort of deep conflicts that sunder a party and leave it in opposition for generations, as has happened to our colleagues across the way.</P>
    <P>An all-party committee on agricultural price support was suggested by Deputy Desmond.  I thought he was here but he is not.  I do not know what he would hope to attain by an all-party committee on price support. There are so many people who are readily available to advise on the use of the money we can afford from the Government for price support, and other supports not necessarily in the agricultural world, that an all-party committee does not seem to me to offer anything that is not already available in one form or another.  Members of this House, no matter what party they belong to, have their say-so even though it may be only infrequently on a Vote such as this.  They also get their points across quite frequently and deliberately by way of supplementary questions which are really statements, much to the discomfort of the Chair at times as well as the rest of us.  They <Col N="608" /> get these things across in the House. Of course, outside the House many of them are members of committees of agriculture and can discuss what the Government should do or should not do or are doing badly or well.  They get these things through there also. Then there is always the opportunity, as Deputies are well aware, with a Minister as approachable as the present Minister for Agriculture, of getting across to him.  Of course, they have no problem whatsoever in getting across to me at any time.  A nod is as good as a wink to this fellow.  He does not have to be put up in the middle of the night to know what is going on.</P>

      <P>Believe me, if a Deputy has a good proposition I will take it and use it.  I have no hesitation about using somebody else's good idea if it is good enough but it must be good enough.  All in all, as I say, I am not quite sure what Deputy Barry Desmond had in mind.  Perhaps at another stage he might elaborate somewhat more on it and give us a better idea of what he had in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Michael Pat Murphy, strangely enough, had somewhat in different terms but perhaps maybe on the same wavelength the idea of a subcommittee of the House representative of different parties on agricultural policy formation.  Perhaps he and Deputy Desmond were really talking from the same thought, from the same brief, maybe from the same discussion in their own party and perhaps we will hear a little more from both of them about this particular suggestion.  We had then as well, when we are talking about committees, and teams of various kinds, Deputy O'Sullivan suggesting the setting up of a team to forecast market trends.  A very useful occupation I must say and if I could find the type of group which could really forecast those things really accurately I would not only make a fortune myself but I would let the rest of you in on it and you could all make a fortune at the same time.  However, taking Deputy O'Sullivan's suggestion seriously, while this sort of thing is not formally done by a group in my Department, <Col N="609" /> at the same time a reading of the signs is continuously going on, and this has already helped and does help to formulate Government outlook and Government action in regard to the future agricultural policy.  This, together with the advantages we gain from the knowledge of people in the business, such as the Pigs and Bacon Commission, keeps us fairly well posted. They have a weather eye open at all stages.  The new Livestock Board must be of considerable advantage to us in the future also.  Like the Pigs and Bacon Commission, their job is promotional, and in order to promote they must research and evaluate.  As a result of this we will get from them very useful guidance in regard to market operations.</P>
    <P>Likewise, Bord Bainne, which have been there for a considerable number of years, also do this sort of thing.  It is part of their job.  They must do it if they are really to know the position. Again, my Department receive from this body an amount of valuable information about dairying.  In addition, the information we receive from other sources, such as trade missions abroad, all adds up to perhaps what Deputy O'Sullivan suggested: a group to evaluate market trends.  As I say, we do this almost every day.  There is no formal body set up specifically to do it but it is done as part and parcel of the day's work in the Department. It has proved itself over many years to be perhaps as good a method as we can get.  If somebody else has some suggestion which can bring about a better method of evaluating things I would be very glad to hear it because this sort of information is invaluable to any Government at any time particularly to the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries.  That is about all I have to say.  I would, as I say, welcome the opportunity to discuss on a broader basis many of the things that have been suggested and many of the comments that have been made.  I think Deputies for their contributions on this and I will have a look at quite a number of them within the next few weeks.</P>

      <P>I should like some information from the Minister at this stage.  I notice that part of the sum required is to meet additional money required for the purpose of examinations. Could the Minister indicate what stage the study of the Devlin Report has reached?  It appears from the Devlin Report, from some of the recommendations in it and some of the figures they have dealt with, that a stage has now been reached that in relation to applicants for the Civil Service&mdash;I refer in particular to Table 8 (2) in the Devlin Report&mdash;the most recent figures show that, of 600 applicants for posts advertised, if 56 are required, they have had to go down as far as the 600th.  In other words, some 544 people offered posts in the Civil Service have turned them down. This seems to be indicative of some malaise in relation to opportunities in the service, to the increasing competition that undoubtedly arises from business opportunities.  It indicates very definitely that posts in the Civil Service are increasingly less attractive to those who in the first instance applied for <Col N="611" /> them, were held qualified but who, when it came to the crunch, turned them down.</P>
      <P>There is also what I regard as a disturbing fact referred to in the Devlin Report in relation to professional posts in the Civil Service.  As I read it, it indicates that some 39 per cent of these posts cannot be filled. This again seems to show a need for some urgency in dealing with the recommendations in the Devlin Report, in the reorganising and recasting of the Civil Service.  I do not expect the Minister to make any major statement of policy now but I wanted to raise the matter and give it an airing at this stage.  Perhaps the Minister might indicate very generally what is the present position in relation to the study of this report.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to talk on the same subhead but in a slightly different vein.  It is most extraordinary that, as recently as in the Estimates volume produced in May last, the figure was £29,000 and it is now £43,000, but that is only a minor point.</P>
      <P>The Irish newspapers, in imitation of their English betters, have recently started to carry great big advertisements. I do not mind admitting that I read the <i>Irish Times</i> and I saw this huge advertisement for administrative officers on two separate days, one day the advertisement was in English and another day it was in Irish. If the papers charge as much for printing advertisements as they do for printing political notices then each of these advertisements must have cost at least £50 and maybe even £100.  What worries me about the whole thing is the question of waste.  I do not know how many extra applicants one would get from an advertisement three columns wide and nine inches deep as compared with an advertisement one column wide and three inches deep.  I do not think there would be one extra applicant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the point made by Deputy O'Higgins which he learned from the Devlin Report&mdash;and ever since I heard that the Devlin Committee paid £93,000 to a group of <Col N="612" /> American consultants, who could know nothing about this country, I made up my mind not to read that report&mdash;it is a good thing that 38 per cent of the professional posts in the Civil Service are vacant because that makes for a saving.  I realise this is a rather old-fashioned point of view.  The Department of Finance used be accused of holding up appointments in order to save money but that day has long gone and, in fact, the day has long gone when the Department of Finance could save money on anything.  Judging by the numbers employed in the Civil Service, there are many people in the Civil Service who have no real work on their desks.</P>
    <P>I consider this Supplementary Estimate to be most extraordinary.  The sum required is practically double the original estimate.  Of course, the Government may have taken a decision about the necessity of recruiting people for the Civil Service but there is another side to this: the Government are paying RTE for these advertisements. I do not know if the Minister has ever seen any of these advertisements. Unfortunately, in my present abode I have no option but to watch RTE, because I cannot get BBC.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister about the methodology of the appointment system used by the Civil Service and the Local Appointments Commission.  I put down a question on the longest time, the shortest time and the average time of getting an appointment through the Local Appointments Commission and I very much appreciated the comprehensive answer which the Minister gave me.  I did not do that to waste either the Minister's time or the time of his officials.  I have frequently made clear my high regard for the whole apparatus of the Appointments Commission. The commission try very hard to maintain a high level of integrity in relation to the making of appointments in spite of what is said from time to time in this House.</P>
      <P>I should like to know if the Minister considers the time has come when the whole process for making important appointments requires changing.  Very often a person can be appointed to be in charge of an institution worth £1 million and he might very well be there for life as a result of an interview which took an hour or half an hour one afternoon.  A person can put on a wonderful show at an interview and in fact not be the right person for the job.  This could have serious consequences for the community because the individual might not be able to give an optimum service.  I am sure the Minister is aware that in the United States and Europe attempts have been made to assess individuals in much greater depth.  It takes much more time for an American company to choose personnel for posts of importance and responsibility than it does here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know very much about the Civil Service Commission but I have had some experience of the Local Appointments Commission.  While I have admiration for that commission's attempts to maintain a high standard the whole apparatus is archaic and requires a complete overhaul. <Col N="614" /> The longest period for making an appointment was 57 months; there were many good reasons why it took that long, but even though I am not a great admirer of private enterprise I doubt if any organisation could tolerate that kind of process in order to make an appointment.  The public service has to follow procedures which private industry can ignore if it wishes to do so.  The managing director can appoint his son if he wants to and nobody can question him. That cannot happen in public authority services.</P>
    <P>I know there always must be these inhibitions on the establishment of a more efficient appointments system but I would just like to ask the Minister whether he has given the matter any thought, whether he feels there are ways in which he might make certain when he is choosing an appointee for a particular post that use is made of the resources available for personality assessment, job suitability, vocational aptitude and all these other tests which do not make the final decision but help to guide a board in making a suitable appointment in any particular case.</P>
    <P>I remember inquiring into it when I was Minister for Health.  I know most of the tediousness of the present procedure arises from an attempt to ensure that there shall be a fair appointment. I think they nearly always succeed in doing that.  There are occasions when they may fail through no fault of the Appointments Commission.  Not only should fair appointments be made but steps should be taken to ensure that the mechanism is brought up to date and modernised and an attempt should be made to ensure that the most suitable candidate, not just the most suitable candidate on the day, but the most suitable candidate because of his experience and qualities that are likely to last throughout the whole period of service, is appointed and that the commission are given all the help and assistance of modern psychological assessment methods now available for this purpose.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I must say that I endorse a great deal of what Deputy Dr. Browne has said about the Civil Service Commission and the Local Appointments <Col N="615" /> Commission.  I should like to say that both of these institutions have stood the test of time and have built up an unassailable reputation for integrity in the appointments they make. Anybody who has ever been a Minister in a particular Department, I am sure, has experienced this sort of frustrating delay in getting people appointed that Deputy Dr. Browne has been speaking of.  To some extent these delays do arise from the precise reasons that Deputy Dr. Browne has mentioned, namely, the scrupulous pursuit by both commissions of fairness in making an appointment.</P>
      <P>The world is changing very rapidly indeed.  Young people today have many, many openings and opportunities available to them outside the Civil Service.  The public services can no longer attract young people into their ranks to the extent that they used to be able to do by virtue of the fact that other suitable opportunities were not available.  So, our recruitment techniques will definitely have to change and, as Deputy Dr. Browne said, we will have to avail of the modern techniques of personnel selection, and so on.  We have that to some extent already but I think not to the extent that we should.  We are experiencing and will experience to a greater degree in future considerable difficulty in getting the sort of people we want in the public service.  Of course, the public service is changing in that regard also in so far as it is now looking for a whole variety of new types of people, professional people, specialists, people with technical qualifications of one sort or another and the recruitment of all of these is placing an increasing strain on the recruitment machinery.</P>
      <P>As Deputy O'Higgins has pointed out, Devlin had quite a deal to say about the whole situation in regard to recruitment and the examination by Ministers of that particular part of Devlin is very well advanced indeed and we hope to get fairly fundamental changes effected within a reasonable time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not agree at all with Deputy Dr. O'Donovan's criticism.  He is <Col N="616" /> accurate enough in his estimates.  To some extent this increased Estimate is due to the necessity in recent times to go in for these large display type advertisements.  First of all, everybody else is doing it and, if everybody else is doing it, I do not think that if we want to compete for these people &mdash;and we are competing for people now in the public service&mdash;we should just throw the thing there and say: &ldquo;Come into the public service if you wish.&rdquo;  We are going out looking for people and if private industry and private business are going in for this type of display in looking for people we have no option but to follow suit if we want to be mapped.  That is one of the reasons why there is this increase in the Estimate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not too easy either.  We have an overall responsibility to keep total Government expenditure down within reasonable limits and out of that total Government expenditure we want to try to make as much money as possible available for desirable social purposes.  Therefore, we have to try to be as economical as we can in the running of the public service.  I think we should pay our public servants well but, on the other hand, we just cannot be over-generous in our approach.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The only thing I can say to the Deputy is that in our community there are lots of people who are not too well paid, not as well paid as they should be.  I do not think we can blame anybody in particular for that. We are not all that wealthy a community. What we should do is to try to improve these conditions all the time.  That is the test you should apply <Col N="617" /> to us, not the absolute test of whether people are well paid or not.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>These rates in the public service are negotiated through the conciliation and arbitration machinery. They are not <i>obiter dicta</i> on our part.  They are worked out as a result of these negotiations and discussions.  I think that is all by the way.</P>
      <P>The fact remains that the Civil Service Commissioners are costing us more money here for a number of reasons and I am afraid that they will cost us a lot more money in future because, as I say, we no longer hold a monopoly position as employers or prospective employers of young people and, secondly, we will be needing in the public service a whole variety of new types of people.  Therefore, we will just have to become a great deal more aggressive and active in our recruitment and, as Deputy Dr. Browne has suggested, we will have to avail of all the modern selection techniques which private industry has been using for some considerable time.</P>

The sum involved is £25,000.  It clearly refers to fees paid to counsel.  I should like to make it clear that these are counsel employed and engaged by the Attorney General.  I do not want to say anything about the fees involved. I assume the sum is necessary.</P>
      <P>I want to direct the attention of the House to the fact that the Bar of Ireland have found it impossible to work the legal aid system and I think it is fair to say that one of the reasons is the extraordinary disparity that exists between the fees paid by the Attorney General to counsel engaged by him and the fees available under the scheme which came into operation almost ten years ago.  The disparity is quite extraordinary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am merely concerned with the fees paid by the Attorney <Col N="619" /> General to counsel employed by him.  If, for instance, he engages a junior counsel to prosecute a larceny charge in the city of Limerick, the man so engaged will find his own way down there and he will prosecute for the day.  If there is a conviction, sentence is frequently postponed until the following morning, and he will stay there and appear the following day and he will be paid for the second day.  Indeed, if sentence were postponed for two days he would be covered in his fees for that.  The fee paid to him for this engagement could be 30 guineas for prosecuting and an appropriate fee for the second day or the third day.</P>
      <P>His opponent who is on legal aid will find his own way down to Limerick.  He will have to go down the night before and he will fight the case for the day.  He will stay in a hotel and if sentence is postponed he will stay in a hotel again.  He will get no fee for the second day.  His entire fee will come to ten guineas which will cover his travelling expenses and two hotel bills. This is a contrast which exists and which we are recognising by voting this sum in respect of law charges.  I do not understand the basis on which it exists. It would seem to me to be appropriate that if the State provides a legal aid service it should at least pay the same fees to counsel engaged on both sides.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that but we are discussing here the fees paid to prosecuting counsel.  I do not want to suggest that they are too high.  In fact I do not.  I would not suggest that counsel for the Attorney General instead of being paid 30 guineas should be paid only ten guineas, but there must be some norm.  Either the norm should be what is, in fact, paid to counsel for the Attorney General or what is, in fact, paid under the legal aid system.  Both fees are intended to attract the services of a professional advocate; both fees are intended to attract his whole-time service for the duration of the case; both fees are intended presumably to enable him to live and feed and clothe himself.  The <Col N="620" /> disparity of one-third is, in my view, quite grotesque.</P>
      <P>Of course, it becomes more absurd when you find in a murder case in the Central Criminal Court senior counsel engaged by the Attorney General being paid a fee of 75 guineas.  There are two of them.  Each is paid 75 guineas.  The poor fellow on legal aid is paid 20 or 25 guineas.  Which is the norm?  I am prepared to accept that this sum should be voted and that it represents proper fees paid to counsel engaged by the Attorney General.  There should not be one standard or one law for counsel engaged by the Attorney General and another standard or law for others.

      <P>I will not talk about legal aid.  I will leave that for the debate on the main Estimate even though I may have to wait for a long time.  I agree with what Deputy O'Higgins has said.  Perhaps I am in an easier position to say this.  I want to draw attention to this extraordinary increase of 50 per cent on the estimate. What is the matter with the estimating in these cases?  We have already had one estimate which was doubled and now we have one with an increase of 50 per cent.  If it were intended to pay all the costs of the tribunal that is inquiring into Telefís Éireann I could perhaps understand it.  It is not so long since the total fees to counsel were about £15,000 a year.  This year they will be £75,000.  If there were exceptional criminal prosecutions from 1st April, 1969, to 31st March, 1970, I could perhaps understand it.  As I said earlier, I read the <i>Irish Times</i> and I take it that it gives as much information as you can get anywhere else on this subject.</P>

      <P>To come down to more mundane things, the prevention of cruelty to children, does the Minister consider this society is being treated fairly in regard to the allocation of funds?  I am sure the Minister is well aware of how the finance for the running of the society is raised.  One of the big problems is that local authorities are limited to a very small token sum which they may give to the society, and the result is that they seem to be always short of money.  I do not know <Col N="623" /> whether the Minister has had any experience of the work their officials are doing.  They are doing an excellent job but they always seem to be doing it on a shoestring.  Even if there is an extra £5,000 here, if that is compared with the general increase in expenditure on everything else in the country, it is a very small amount.  This is particularly so when it is remembered that the local authorities have not been allowed to increase their sum over the amount laid down by the Minister for Local Government, who determines the amount they may give.  In the rural areas, particularly in the towns, where the necessity occasionally arises, inspectors of the society are doing excellent work to prevent children from being abused.  Unfortunately there are many people in this country who abuse children, and even parents have been known to illtreat the unfortunate children for whom they are responsible.  In the cities the problem must be very much greater, and I understand the society are finding it extremely difficult to keep the staff they employ because they just have not got the money.  If they disappeared and if the running of this organisation fell entirely on State funds or local authority funds, there would be a far less efficient organisation dealing with the matter and it would cost a great deal more.  I would appeal to the Minister to have another look at this matter when he is framing his Budget.</P>

      <P>This is a very large Supplementary Estimate.  It seems to indicate considerable lack of foresight in the preparation of the original Estimate. <Col N="624" /> It also pinpoints the need for an incomes policy.  If there can be, in one short financial period, a departure from an estimate for remuneration of £3.3 million, it certainly is indicative of no certainly as to what any period of 12 months is likely to bring.  Does it mean that in relation to the Estimate for the coming year one must just look at it and say: &ldquo;Well, it is the best estimate the Minister can make.  Of course he will bring in a Supplementary Estimate later on&rdquo;?</P>
      <P>There have been many efforts at proper planning of Estimates and many undertakings by Ministers.  I remember one of the Minister's predecessors some years ago being very vehement here in his assertion that &ldquo;there will be no Supplementary Estimate of any kind this year&rdquo;. The words were scarcely spoken when the machines were busy printing the necessary Supplementary Estimates, and here we have again at the tail end of the year&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>There it is again, the old song Ministers for Finance always sing.  It is disturbing that one year is the same as another.  Always at this time of the year there is the last minute effort at moving Supplementary Estimates.  It just means that estimates are a joke.  They do not mean anything and they will continue to mean very little until we can get some proper planning of incomes and different earnings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That was the unanimous view of the last Dáil.  A Fine Gael motion to that effect was agreed to by the Government. We wasted our time in moving it and the Government wasted their time in agreeing to it, because nothing has ever happened.  The situation in relation to incomes is as much a jungle as ever it has been.  This is symptomatic of what is taking place.  I do not particularly blame the Minister.  He cannot help it, but no one will believe his estimate for Civil Service remuneration over the next 12 months.  How could one?  No one knows what will happen.  With galloping prices, with steep rises in the cost of living, with <Col N="625" /> the next month bringing as bad a story as the last month, with no apparent probability of controlling the deflation of the value of our currency because of the inflationary situation, how could anyone say what incomes or remuneration will be necessary to maintain essential services for the next 12 months?  This Supplementary Estimate is symptomatic of the Government's failure properly to control our economy and is symptomatic of the situation which has been allowed to develop, where we have unbridled, uncontrolled inflation.  What is happening in this instance is something that, in the present circumstances, cannot be avoided and I do not see much hope in the next 12 months of the Minister's jocose statement coming true that there will be no need for Supplementary Estimates.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I commented last week on the various Supplementary Estimates which have come before this House.  Today the Minister told us that it will cost something in the region of £40 million in Supplementary Estimates for this financial year.  It makes one wonder what happened last year. Was it intended to have a mini-Budget later in the year which, in fact, did not materialise for reasons we all know, or was there underestimation to such an extent that the money was swallowed up?  The Minister can come here on Budget day and say he has balanced his Budget despite the fact that an extra £40 million had to be found.  I am interested to know which is the correct answer.  If the latter is correct, it makes one wonder what is the point of having a Budget at all, and if the former is correct we are being doubly charged because in addition to paying the extra this year we shall have to pay a double load next year for the purpose of catching up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know that civil servants must be paid for doing their job.  The Minister said at Budget time last year that the sum of £2 million would pay for the extra increases to all State servants but now we find that more than £3 million is required for civil servants alone. What was the basis of the Minister's original Estimate?  I do not think we will get the answer to that until the <Col N="626" /> Budget and I am sure we shall have that before the by-elections.</P>
    <P>Last year I found it necessary to bring to the Minister's notice a practice of this House in regard to junior employees who felt they were not being treated fairly.  The Minister agreed to have the matter attended to and did so very promptly.  This year I find something else happening and perhaps the Minister might have the matter looked into&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I know there is very little the Minister says he cannot do.  However, I must give the Minister credit in that he usually attempts to right a wrong when it is brought to his attention. The present case concerns a person temporarily appointed to a job, left in the temporary employment but paid at the lower rate of his previous occupation. This practice appears to prevail in this House with regard to minor employments: it may be that nobody worries very much about a person who is in a minor post and does not realise that the difference in payment of £1 or 30/- a week means a lot to some people.  I should be grateful if the Minister would give this matter as prompt attention as he gave to the matter I raised last year.</P>
      <P>The other matter I wish to refer to is on the fringe of being within the discussion and I shall not labour the point.  A sum of £14,200 is mentioned for the Office of the Minister for Justice.  I know this is not a large sum when it is spread over the entire Department but I assume some of this money will be paid to district justices. Recently I was shocked to read in a newspaper of a district justice who was trying two persons&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>District justices are not included.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Remuneration is mentioned. The district justice was trying two people, one of whom had stolen some money in a post office and the other person was a sorter who had taken some postal packets.  The district <Col N="627" /> justice said that people employed in Sligo post office would have to take care because he would send them to jail if they came before him again.  The Minister might ask his colleague, the Minister for Justice, to get the gentleman concerned to withdraw that remark. I shall not labour this point any further but I have mentioned it here because the Estimate under which this point might be raised will, because of the rush of business, probably not come before the House.  In regard to the sum of £19,200 for prisons, does this apply to extra wages for staff of prisons or does it refer to extra staff?  I understand a number of prisons are short-staffed and I am told that the staff are not well paid having regard to their type of work.  The Minister might comment on this in his reply if he has any information on this matter.</P>

      <P>I fully support the statement of Deputy O'Higgins.  The Dáil is supposed to have certain rights over expenditure but the whole business is completely phoney; all this talk of Supplementary Estimates in the last three weeks is worthless.  I should like to raise a technical point with the Minister.  I do not think the title &ldquo;Remuneration of Civil Servants ... £3,316,000&rdquo; is correct.  It would have been better had it been called &ldquo;Remuneration of State Servants&rdquo; for a serious enough reason.

      <P>We are living in a very inflationary situation and, in such a situation, estimating becomes increasingly difficult.  The bulk of the Supplementary Estimate comes as a result of the agreement made last year. I want again to emphasise that I think that was an excellent development. On behalf of the Government I met the public service committee of Congress and we were able in a fairly short time to hammer out an agreement to be operated generally throughout the public service.  That was a very useful development.  As a result of that agreement I had to provide more money last year for the remuneration of civil servants than I had provided in the Budget but, as I said earlier, that was well worthwhile.  It did cost the Exchequer more than we had provided for in the Budget, but it was a first-class agreement.  The fact that we were able to hammer it out in the way we did was a very desirable innovation <Col N="629" /> and I shall be very, very happy if we can repeat that.</P>

    <P>As Deputies are aware, the current year's Estimate for my Department was adopted without debate in November last.  A token Supplementary Estimate for £10 was then introduced to enable a discussion on social welfare matters to take place.  There is now a further Supplementary Estimate for £7,542,000 before the House to provide for the extra expenditure arising from the improvements announced in the 1969 Budget Statement and enacted by the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1969.  I think it would be appropriate to deal with the full requirement for the year in the one discussion.</P>
    <P>The original Estimate for social welfare for the year 1969-70 was £51,880,000.  This represented an increase of £2,572,000 on the total provision, including a Supplementary Estimate of £3,907,000, for the year 1968-69.  When we include the additional amount now being sought, total expenditure comes to almost £59½ million, and the increase over last year's figure amounts to more than £10 million.</P>
    <P>The figure of £59½ million which I have mentioned represents only the amount which the Exchequer must contribute towards the cost of the social welfare services.  When the estimated expenditure from the social insurance fund is taken into account, together with certain costs borne by other Departments in connection with the administration of our services, the total <Col N="632" /> expenditure for the year is expected to be approximately £92¼ million.  In addition about £1 million will be spent on benefits under the occupational injuries scheme and about £165,000 on &ldquo;wet-time&rdquo; payments.  No State grant is payable to the occupational injuries or the &ldquo;wet-time&rdquo; funds, and accordingly provision for these services does not require to be made under the Vote for social welfare.</P>
    <P>The increased rates of payment announced in last year's budget became effective as from the beginning of August, 1969, in the case of the assistance services and from the beginning of January, 1970, in the case of the insurance services.  On the basis of these rates, total expenditure on the social welfare services is now running at an annual rate of almost £102 million.</P>
    <P>The increase in expenditure for the current year as compared with 1968-69 is attributable to three factors; first, the additional cost for a full year of the 1968 budget increases which operated only for portion of the year 1968-69: second, the cost in the current year of the 1969 budget increases and third, a continuing upward trend in the number of beneficiaries.</P>
    <P>Subhead H&mdash;Children's Allowances &mdash;shows an increase of over £3½ million, due almost entirely to the increased rates now payable.  Under subhead G&mdash;Non-Contributory Old Age Pensions&mdash;there is an increase of over £2¼ million.  Deputies will observe that at £17,920,000 this is the largest item of expenditure among the social welfare services.  If we add the cost of contributory old age pensions, which is now estimated at £11,434,000, the total cost of all old age pensions in the current year is seen to be over £29 million.  There are about 112,000 non-contributory and 45,000 contributory old age pensioners.</P>
    <P>Disability benefit is expected to cost over £14¼ million this year.  Apart from the increased rates of payment, there is a continuing upward trend in claims, and this has been aggravated this year by the influenza epidemic.</P>
    <P>In the case of widows' and orphans' pensions the cost of the contributory scheme is estimated at approximately <Col N="633" /> £9½ million, and the non-contributory scheme at over £3 million, a total of £12½ million.  There are altogether about 68,000 widows in receipt of pensions and the number is increasing year by year.</P>
    <P>There is an increase of £542,000 under subhead K &mdash; Miscellaneous Grants.  This subhead provides for grants to local authorities in respect of school meals, cheap fuel and footwear, for grants to institutions providing services for the blind, and for the cost of free travel, free electricity and free radio and television licences for pensioners.  The increase as compared with last year is mainly attributable to an upward revision in the rates of payment to the concerns providing free travel facilities, increased cost of the free electricity scheme and the extension of the period of operation of the cheap fuel scheme.  There are also small increases in the provisions for school meals and welfare of the blind.</P>
    <P>The provision made under this subhead for welfare of the blind constitutes, in the main, capitation grants paid by my Department to approved institutions for the blind towards the education, maintenance and employment of blind persons in these institutions. One such institution is the Board for the Employment of the Blind, which was set up in 1957 by a former Minister for Social Welfare when the Richmond Institution became unable to continue to operate on behalf of blind workers.  Under existing arrangements the board is financed by way of capitation grants from the Department and local authorities together with special contributions paid by local authorities towards the annual working losses of the board.  Despite these subventions the board's financial position has given and continues to give increasing cause for anxiety.  When this project was initiated it was visualised that subsidies at the original level would not be required indefinitely, but instead they have had to be progressively increased. The matter is one which must give rise to considerable concern in the future unless there is a radical change for the better in the financial results of the board's operations.  In this connection Deputies may be interested to know that the number of blind persons employed <Col N="634" /> in the workshops is about 60, or only about two per cent of the blind adults in the State.  These 60 or so workers are, in effect, being subsidised to the extent of £42,000 per annum or about £700 per blind worker, in order to keep them in employment.  By any standard this must be regarded as comparatively generous treatment of the small section, employed in the workshops, of the total blind population. The members of the board are dedicated men and are deserving of the utmost praise for the time and energy they give, without remunerative reward, to their arduous and sometimes thankless task.</P>
    <P>When one realises that in many outside positions blind persons can hold their own in competition with ordinary members of the public without any subsidy, it is somewhat difficult to understand why better results cannot be achieved in these workshops.  I would, therefore, appeal to every person connected with the undertaking, no matter in what capacity, to make a special effort to make the board's operations more successful.</P>
    <P>The only other significant change in the Estimate for 1969-70 as compared with the previous year is an expected increase of over £5? million in income from employment contributions.  This increase is a result of the revision of contribution rates in January, 1969, and again in January, 1970.</P>
    <P>I do not think there are any other items calling for comment, but I will, of course, give Deputies any further information they may require.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The principal criticism which we would make of the Estimate is that it is far too small.  There is more wealth available in our community for the relief of the under-privileged than is being tapped by the State at present.  There is also a readiness on the part of many people in the community to accept a larger burden of the cost of maintaining people of limited means in a decent standard of living.  It must therefore fall as well-deserved criticism on the shoulders of the Government that they have not availed of the anxiety which is prevalent in our community to assist the <Col N="635" /> underprivileged to the extent that people are ready to give.</P>
      <P>The Government have not yet gathered into the purses of the State for redistribution a great deal of the unnecessary expenditure on high living which is becoming a growing feature in our society.  This is because the Government have the view that improvement in social welfare is dependent on economic growth and on an increased national product every year. If this is not forthcoming the social welfare beneficiaries have to wait.  If such money is forthcoming it must be siphoned off for less necessary expenditure because there is still the feeling abroad in Government circles that the relief of destitution is something which must only be done when absolutely and demonstrably necessary.  There is still too little preparedness on the part of the Minister for Social Welfare to examine in depth the problems of hundreds of thousands of our people who are unable to provide themselves and their families with the standards that are available even to the members of the community who are living on mere pittances and earning much less than the national average wage.</P>
      <P>It did not require the report which was published this week in relation to unemployment assistance to demonstrate that the rate of unemployment assistance was only one-third of what the average wage-earner is now getting, but it is a very useful report in that it helps to underline what we in Fine Gael have been saying for so long and it brings into one easily-understood book a great number of the facts which should be affecting the mind and the planning of the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Supplementary Estimate of £7.5 million is comparable only to the increase in the cost of living.  In fact I suspect the figure is even less than the cost of living but the latest figures are not yet available.  That this should be so is an indication that, in fact, rather than improving the standard of social welfare we are at best maintaining it and I suggest we are making it a great deal worse because total State expenditure on social welfare in relation to all State expenditure is falling rather than increasing.  I can anticipate <Col N="636" /> the Minister's reply to the debate.  He will point out monetary, nominal increases in the levels of benefits, pensions and payments compared with ten years ago.</P>
    <P>Fortunately, our society has moved on over that decade.  To whom the credit goes is a matter of indifference but what does matter is that our people now have higher standards than those to which our parents were born.  It is no answer to be perpetually relating present scales to what applied ten, 20 or 30 years ago, if at the same time you do not point out what is common knowledge: that the standards of living of practically all sections of the community have improved immensely over the same period, and that things once regarded as luxuries and available only to the wealthy are now regarded as necessities of life.  Poverty and wealth are related; you cannot deal with either of them in isolation. You cannot determine that a person is wealthy or poor according to statistics produced to ascertain cost of living indices or matters of that kind.  These things are relative and must be considered against the background of the society in which people live and not against the impersonal and sometimes inhuman means test.</P>
    <P>In his opening statement the Minister made some remarks concerning the Board for the Employment of the Blind.  Many people will share with the Minister his regret that the board is not more successful financially.  It is important to recite here the readiness, I trust, of all parties not to judge the success or otherwise of the employment of the blind by the financial examination which might be appropriate in other cases.  It is true that blind, handicapped people can be as efficient in many activities as, or more efficient than, people who do not have the handicap of blindness.  The Minister and others who are concerned with making the board more successful than it has been must look with a critical eye on the appalling relations which exist between the board and the employees.</P>
    <P>To say that is not to castigate either one side or the other but, while from time to time we have criticised the Administration and private industry <Col N="637" /> for poor industrial relations, my own experience has been that even the worst industrial relations in State or private concerns are very much better than the relations which exist in that board.  In such a situation it is unlikely that any group of employees, whether handicapped or not, will give of their best.  I venture to suggest to the Minister that, while I do not doubt that he appropriately praises members of the board for their good intentions, he should most critically examine whether their good intentions have produced the results which he says himself he would like the board to achieve. It is quite clear that the reverse is the position and, that being so, I think the Minister should now seriously consider restructuring the whole administration in that institution in Rathmines. If it is not done soon we may find ourselves in the situation of having to listen to a proposal that the board should close down.  That would be a really terrible disaster for the employees of the board and their families.</P>
    <P>I know a large number of the workers in Rathmines and I am greatly impressed by their zeal, dedication and anxiety to overcome their handicap, by their readiness to prove that blind people can be as good as, or better than, people who are not blind and I am certainly at a loss to understand why it is this zeal, dedication and application, which blind people have far more than non-handicapped people, do not produce better results.  And when they do not produce results I think any reasonable person would look to the management.  It seems the management are not above criticism and therefore the Minister must take what, perhaps, for him is a difficult step and decide to reconstruct the board and have new personnel on it including, I would hope, people who are themselves handicapped by blindness and have a real understanding of the problems of the blind.</P>
    <P>I have no wish to go into some of the industrial disputes that have taken place but were the Members of the House to be aware of them I think they would be appalled to think that any concern, public or private, could have acted in the Victorian way in which <Col N="638" /> that board have treated their staff within the last couple of years, particularly around Christmas time.</P>
    <P>I should like to urge on the Minister that the promotion of the sale of turf or the maintenance of the turf industry is not a function which should be carried out by the Department of Social Welfare.  It is desirable, where particular industries are maintained because of their national benefit or because of their social benefit in the area in which they operate, that they should be identified as such.</P>
    <P>I think it is wrong that the money of the Department of Social Welfare should be expended in purchasing, for distribution in urban areas, fuel which is extremely costly to handle in the way in which it is handled and which means that a considerable amount of the money used in relation to the scheme does not go to the benefit of the people who need the money most. It is clear, on the figures of the costings of the cheap fuel scheme, that, if the State were to give a fuel voucher to poor people to buy fuel of their own choice or requirement, the beneficiaries would be able to purchase almost twice the amount of fuel for the present cost of the administration of the scheme.</P>
    <P>At present, turf is brought to various depots in Dublin and other urban areas, oftentimes in inaccesible places, sometimes in places of ill repute.  The result is that a growing number of elderly and poor and invalided people are disinclined to go to these depots. Because the number of people available for the distribution of this fuel is falling, those still remaining in the activity of distributing the fuel from the depot to the pensioners' houses are now charging what sometimes are quite exorbitant rates.  This is common practice.  We know, I suppose, that the demand for services is great.  If the number of people available to perform it are few, then it is understandable that those rendering the service will charge the maximum they can get. Many old age pensioners cannot afford the 2/-, 3/- and 4/- they are sometimes asked to pay for the delivery of the so-called free or cheap fuel.</P>
    <P>One also meets the problem, where <Col N="639" /> people move to new housing estates outside the old urban boundaries, that the cheap fuel scheme does not apply. That position arose in Ballymun.  The State makes no contribution to the cost of providing heating for old age pensioners because it is provided through central heating.  If the cost is borne by anybody other than the pensioners, it falls entirely on the rates.  If the scheme is to continue at all, it should be modernised and brought into keeping with the needs of the people.  It began as a war-time emergency scheme when it was extremely difficult to get fuel of any kind in urban areas and when it was necessary to ensure at least a minimum of fuel for poorer people.  That day has gone.  There is little justification for maintaining the system of distribution with all its hardships and all its indignities.  I would urge on the Minister to take a radical look at the cheap fuel scheme and to replace it with one in accordance with the modern needs of our people.</P>
    <P>The Estimate for the Department of Social Welfare is, I suppose, always a difficult one to criticise.  One generally finds that the money sought is all required and that the money is well spent.  One fortunate development in recent times has been the readiness of the State to provide services from some of the money expended rather than providing mere monetary payments. This is a very necessary development but one which the Department of Social Welfare is not properly attuned to give.  Most of the administrators in social Welfare in this country might just as easily have been administering the affairs of the Land Registry or of the Land Commission or of the Office of Public Works or of a multitude of other State activities.  Most of them are in the Department of Social Welfare simply by chance, through the lottery which takes place on entry to the Civil Service which determines in what particular field one is to spend one's life thereafter.  This, of course, does not mean that they do not, over the years, acquire skills and experience. They do, of course, acquire skills and experience which they then bring to bear on the problems, as they see <Col N="640" /> them from inside the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>The Department of Social Welfare have all too few operators in the field. They have not got on their staff qualified sociologists.  I would not classify these in the same manner as the Minister classified those concerned with the preservation of the amenities of our civilisation as people whose views and theories had little relevance to the requirements of our community.  People who study social problems and who work in the field of social and public service deserve to get more attention from the State than they have been getting from the Minister's Department.  It is essential, if the Department of Social Welfare is to conduct the kind of improvement in our social services which our times require, that they would have people in the Department who are qualified to carry out the necessary research.</P>
    <P>It is very interesting to note that practically all research work in social science and in social services in Ireland in recent times has been done by bodies other than by State bodies. It has been done by people outside the public service.  It ought to trouble the Minister's conscience that this is so. It is time the Department of Social Welfare got away from accepting their passive role in the distribution of monetary benefits.  It is time the Minister for Social Welfare refused to accept that the various pension schemes and benefit schemes we now have are acceptable because they are a growth of schemes introduced ten, 20 or 50 years ago.  They need to be studied in depth.  If they are studied in depth I believe that in many cases they will be found wanting.  It is quite possible that, if the necessary studies are carried out and new methods tried, there could be a considerable saving to the State, a saving which we would be anxious to see used for the purpose of giving greater benefit to those in real need.  If the Minister would give us an assurance that he would be prepared to recruit qualified sociologists and carry out this necessary research, I believe the country would applaud him and would look forward with some confidence to some real improvement in the social needs of our people.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="641" /> At the present time, we merely guess at the needs of our people.  Politicians and civil servants are not necessarily the people who are always right when they guess the needs of the under-privileged in our community.  We need to get closer to the people to understand their problems and real difficulties and then to tailor our social welfare services to their known present-day requirements and not to requirements which were valid, urgent and compelling 50 years ago and which have little relevance to the anxieties and requirements of the present day.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Twenty years ago, when I was in charge of the Department of Health, one of the things I did was to go around the county homes of the country to look at the conditions under which people lived in them.  I confess to having been so shocked by the appalling conditions in the majority of those places I visited that eventually I persuaded the then Government to set up an inter-Departmental committee which made recommendations in 1950-51 in regard to some of those county homes.  I think the repercussions have been that limited improvements have been made in some of them as a result of those recommendations. Conditions in some of them were quite indescribable.  I will not bother the House with it now because it is not my particular concern tonight.</P>
      <P>I am concerned still about the way we discharge our responsibilities to the old people in our society, the way we fail to discharge our responsibilities to the aged poor.  It is probably the most shocking of all the many failures to which we must confess, taking the whole spectrum of our society, taking the whole ambit of our activities since the State was founded 50 years ago. I have no doubt the Minister will tell me, as he did when making his apologia for our failure to provide housing for our people when he was replying to the Estimate for the Department of Local Government, that the money is not there, that other countries are wealthier.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister were seriously concerned by the magnitude of our failure he would begin to examine seriously <Col N="642" /> the reasons why a society such as ours finds it cannot feed its hungry aged poor.  I have said before, and the Minister can contradict me when I say it again, that I believe the old person living on the non-contributory old age pension if he does not die of hunger in Ireland certainly he dies hungry. That is a scandalous admission, and I do not care whether it is one old person, 100 or 1,000.  I ask the Minister could he himself or would he expect anybody belonging to him to live on the old age pension which he now pays to old people, with living costs at the level they are at.</P>
    <P>He knows quite well.  In his closing speech on the Local Government Estimate he jeered at the socialist Government in Britain as he called it, and their housing record in London.  There is a conservative council in London, but I will let that pass.  The point is that the socialist Government there provide for old people in a way which we have grossly failed to do here, and the socialist Government in England are one of the most backward of the socialist Governments in Europe and the British social services are among the most backward in the whole of western Europe.  Yet our social services are worse than the British and a shame to what purports to be a Christian community.</P>
    <P>I have often referred to the decline in the concern which the Fianna Fáil Party had, in the loyalty they had to the underprivileged in the 1930s, when I believe&mdash;I have said it many times&mdash; they were easily the highest and the best in the country.  That is my case: they are less and less concerned for the provision of better health, better education, better housing, better care for the aged.  That is particularly well borne out by the fact that in 1959-60 Government expenditure on social welfare was nearly 20 per cent, but in 1969-70 the provisional figure is 14.3 per cent.  The Government, the Fianna Fáil Party, have deserted this sector of the community.  In here at periodic intervals they have increased a pittance by a pittance but at all times leaving the aged poor underprivileged, undercared for, a very uneasy, neglected sector of our society.  Nobody could live, <Col N="643" /> nobody could survive on the £3 or £4 a week given to old people.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister must understand that what has to be provided for the old people is not simply the old age pension thrown at them once a week to keep them quiet.  He must realise that he must reorganise his whole conception of his responsibility, of our responsibility, to the old people.  It is not simply a matter of throwing them a pittance pension and expecting them to get by on it with the so-called free fuel scheme.  There is a whole range of services needed.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Ryan pointed out, there are services which are provided now in most advanced European societies for the care of the aged, particularly in the socialist Scandinavian countries &mdash;socialist in their own way&mdash;who are far ahead of the British and, of course, of us.  I am sure the Minister has read frequently the reports of the heads of psychiatric hospitals who point out that one of their problems, their biggest problems, is that old people are certified as being insane in order to get them somewhere, in order to get them into psychiatric hospitals when, in fact, the problem is one of two things&mdash;there is not proper home accommodation for old people available in the community, there is not enough of it, or, alternatively, no serious attempt is made by the Departments of Social Welfare and Health to provide services in the home which would help the old person to remain in the home and so get by on this miserable pension.</P>
    <P>Some people take the view that the younger generation are not prepared to care for their old people.  Generally speaking, I think that is not true.  One of the repercussions of the economic failure of successive Governments in the last half century has been the continuous emigration of middle-aged people leaving us a grossly distorted society in which there are the very young and then a very high proportion, related to the wage-earners, of old people who have to be carried by a relatively small number of taxpayers, ratepayers and so on.</P>
    <P>This, again, is one of the consequences <Col N="644" /> of the failure of the social and economic policies of the Government. It is not an act of God as the Government and the Minister know.  There is no good in the Minister saying that he would like to double the old age pension but that it would cost so much to do so.  When there is failure, because of economic policies, to provide for these old people it must be then accepted that there must be a change. The demonstrable truth of the failures I have cited is a drop in Government expenditure on social welfare funds of nearly 5 per cent during the last ten years.</P>
    <P>Young people would be prepared to take care of their aged parents if they could manage to do so but we all know that too many of our families, working-class families and white collar workers also, are living in overcrowded conditions.  Many of them are living in flats in which up to now there was no provision for keeping old people in that community.</P>

      <P>If such provisions had been made it would be possible for children to care for their aged parents with the help of services to be provided by the Minister.  I should like to ask the Minister what he proposes to do about bringing the necessary services into being within the community as rapidly as possible.</P>
      <P>Looking at the matter even from the mercenary point of view, it costs the Department from £12 to £14 per week to keep an old person in an institution whether it be an institution directly intended for the geriatric type patient or the old person misplaced in a psychiatric hospital.  From the humane and economic point of view it would make sense for the Minister to establish services at such a level as is found in other advanced European societies.</P>

    <P>I should be glad if the Minister would consider the provision of these services.  It is quite obvious that there is a need for a national council for the aged, some sort of a co-ordinated organisation whose function it would be to try to find out as much as possible about the extent of the neglect <Col N="645" /> of the aged in our community both in the cities and in rural Ireland.  The function of such an organisation should be to establish the various services now accepted as common form in most European countries, to provide specially designed accommodation in all local authority type house planning systems, the provision of wardens for the supervision of the known aged people in those housing areas, the provision of services for these old people of which the obvious ones are medical care and nursing care so that they would not have to travel to dispensaries where they have to wait in the cold.  Such an organisation could also provide for special laundry services. They could also provide emergency funds as well as providing domestic help so that these people would be catered for as they become more and more decrepit or immobilised by progressive old age.  Provision could also be made by such an organisation for visiting the old and ensuring that they do not feel completely neglected and forgotten in our society.  Of course, the provision of hot meals on wheels is another obvious need in our community.</P>
    <P>The Minister should also consider the establishment of day centres where an old person, instead of sitting alone, can spend some time during the day, where he will be provided with a hot meal and where he is helped to pass the time by various forms of diversionary activities in the company of other old people.  There should be proper assessment units where medical doctors could decide on the need of each individual over the age of 65.</P>

      <P>That would be a matter for another Minister.  It would arise under the Estimate for the Department of Health.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the Chair's ruling.  One of our difficulties is that there is an overlapping of functions as between the Minister for Health and the Minister for Social Welfare.  Indeed, it is very difficult to know on which Estimate to speak about this particular subject.  I understand an attempt is to be made to co-ordinate the services of the three Departments <Col N="646" />&mdash;Local Government, Health and Social Welfare&mdash;but nobody seems to know yet which Minister will be answerable for the different services that will be made available.  There is a need for much research into this whole problem of the aged.  It is particularly badly needed in our society because it is a disproportionately large problem here by virtue of the fact that so many of our young people must get out of the country.</P>
      <P>One of the best services&mdash;it is the type of service which I have in mind &mdash;is that provided in the north of England, in Nottingham, by Dr. Mac-Millan. It is based on the old wartime warden system whereby an old person in need of help signifies this by putting a disc in the window and thereafter anything up to 25 different facilities, amenities or services can be put at his disposal.  The systems are not uniformly good in Britain but that, as far as I can gather, is one of the best.  It probably would repay the Minister well, if he is sufficiently interested in it, to see how this problem is dealt with in other countries.</P>
      <P>One of the repercussions of easy access to the chronic hospital, the long-stay hospital, whether it is a psychiatric or a general hospital, is chronic invalidism and earlier death than is necessary.  This chronic invalidism results in a long-term demand on the funds of the Minister's Department. If the Minister could establish proper assessment units in different forms of rehabilitation care units it is possible to reduce the degree of chronic invalidism arising in this type of case and it is possible to send anything up to 50 per cent at times of these people back into society again. I think it is generally true to say that once an old person goes into one of our hospitals or homes he tends to stay there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is little or no serious public opinion on this whole problem.  It would be the function of a national council for the aged, if the Minister chooses to establish one, to try to create a public interest by the establishment of local councils for the aged which would look after this.  There is only one that I am aware of&mdash;the Kilkenny scheme by Bishop Birch&mdash;<Col N="647" /> which seems to me to be a kind of prototype of a scheme which might, with adaptation, be applied in Dublin. On the whole in Dublin we have failed to deal with this problem in the way in which it should be dealt with.</P>
    <P>It should be possible for the social services in St. Kevin's and various geriatric centres which treat old people to work through boarding-out schemes where an old person could be boarded out in a private home with, say, a widow with a spare bedroom or two, anything rather than sending them to hospital because of the rapid deterioration which takes place I am afraid in the majority of our institutions.  Once an old person goes in he tends to deteriorate and die rapidly, certainly deteriorate into a chronic invalid.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister would try to understand that coming in here and going to elections proclaiming from time to time that we will increase the old age pension by 5/-, 7/6d or 10/-is not answering the needs of the old people in our community.  He is fooling himself completely if he thinks that by providing £3 or £4 a week in a society such as ours with the cost of living at such a high level, he is discharging our responsibility&mdash;it is not his alone&mdash; as a Christian community to the old people in our society.  It has become a very much more complex problem now.  It is not 5/-, 7/6d or 10/- that matters.  It is various services which are needed by old people, to be provided for them in the home through the interaction of various voluntary organisations, some of which work under great difficulty and do good work, and the local authority&mdash; medical, nursing and geriatric services of one kind or another.</P>
    <P>The Minister should be given credit for the fact that in his other capacity as Minister for Local Government he created an interest in the problem of the itinerants and, more than that, he mobilised public support among local authorities and voluntary organisations for the itinerants and some attempt is being made to deal with them.  This is a very much greater problem and a very much more costly one but if he would show anything like the same <Col N="648" /> energy and interest in it I am certain he would find the same concern, interest and, above all, compassion for these unfortunate people who are, unlike the unemployed who can emigrate, prisoners of our society.  They are past emigrating.  They are past running away, as do our unfortunate unemployed, to the British welfare society to be fed and clothed, cared for and housed in sickness and old age in Britain.  These old people simply cannot get away from the cruel indifference to their plight of the society which we have created here in the past 50 years.</P>
    <P>The question of widows' and orphans' pensions is one which we have dealt with in a very mean and niggardly way.  It must be clear to everybody that it is bad enough to lose one's husband without having to find that one is then expected to try to provide a level of services after his death and that the only way open is by going to work, if one knows of any skilled work, or the other appalling choice of putting children into an institution.</P>
    <P>Again, we have this extraordinary attitude towards institutions.  We are prepared to pay £5, £10, £15, or whatever it may be for an old person in a home and we are prepared to pay a somewhat lower sum to keep a child in an institution but we are not prepared to pay a widow enough money to keep her family together and to remain in the home herself.  I have very strong views on this need for the mother in the home.  The family which loses the father, the breadwinner, suffer gravely, not only materially in the obvious way of lowered income and lowered standard of living, but also suffer emotionally because the loss of one parent in any family is a very serious emotional and traumatic experience. In those circumstances it is imperative that the remaining parent, the mother, should not be forced to go out to work.  She should be helped to retain the vestige of the family unit on which our Constitution is based.</P>
    <P>We do not, I believe, by the niggardly and mean pension we pay to widows and their orphans make it <Col N="649" /> possible for them to remain at home and to try and provide the vestige of a family life for their families.  If the widow is to try to maintain nutritional levels for her children as well as clothing, educational and medical needs of one kind or another, or drugs of one kind or another, she is almost invariably forced to go out to work, if she can get it.  The widow's pension should be one which makes it possible for her above all to keep the family together.  Widows are a special responsibility of any community and I do not think we discharge this responsibility in the way I consider we should do so.</P>
    <P>I can never understand why we find it so easy to pay for the child going to an institution; this may be a considerable sum if there are three or four children going to different institutions, the boys going to one and the girls to another.  From the emotional point of view this is very destructive and very damaging to those children and above all to the mother.  In fact, we pay for the breaking up of the family, we facilitate that, but we will not provide money at a level which would make it possible for the mother to keep her children in the home.  Widows' pensions are grossly inadequate and should be on a very much more generous level. I hope the Minister will not give me the reply that we are a poor country. That is not true.  We are a relatively wealthy country.  It is simply a fact that the wealth is maldistributed.  It is simply a fact that the three basic needs for the creation of wealth, land, labour and capital, are not used to the optimum in order to create the necessary wealth to provide for those people, whether it is the old age pensioner, the services I have mentioned or the widow and her children.</P>
    <P>It is no good the Minister shedding crocodile tears about what he would like to do.  There are plenty of agricultural based communities like our own, such as the Scandinavian countries, New Zealand, and various other countries which have solved this problem of providing for the dependent classes in their societies.  It is true most of them use socialist methods in order to achieve this objective but the Minister has to decide between which is the <Col N="650" /> greater scandal, an organisation or a society organised on social lines or hungry old people, hungry widows and their orphan children.  Which is the greater scandal?  Which is the greater crime?  Which is the greater sin?</P>
    <P>I support Deputy Ryan's criticism of the blind workshop.  There appear to be very bad relationship between the management and the employees. I know the institution.  The extraordinary thing about it is the work is very beautiful.  It is basket work mostly but furniture of different kinds is also produced in this factory.  I cannot for the life of me see why it appears to be run at the loss at which the Minister says it is being run. Surely this is a problem which should be looked into by efficiency experts in his Department in order to find out if it is a fact that they are producing something nobody wants.  The work is beautiful but if nobody wants it then why do they go on providing it? What is the reason that this business is being run at such a loss?</P>
    <P>I would like to ask the Minister in relation to the provision of free electricity if he would be less demanding in the conditions under which this scheme is made available to old people. I know of sons and daughters who care for their aged parents and as far as I can gather under this scheme the income of those wage-earners will be taken into consideration in assessing eligibility.  They should be helped to keep the old people in society.  It is difficult for parents with five or six children living in a two- or three-roomed flat to accommodate elderly people in such overcrowded conditions. Every possible facility should be given to a daughter or son who attempts to keep an old person at home in order to help in this humane and fundamentally Christian act.  They should be given free electricity, free fuel and help with the rent.  The old people should also be taken to day centres and returned home in the evening. There are various ways of reducing the burden which old parents can be on an already over-burdened working class family.  If the Minister were to provide these services, in addition to whatever pension he wants to give <Col N="651" /> them, he would find that our geriatric hospitals, no matter how big they are, would not be filled as soon as they are opened.</P>
    <P>I realise these suggestions are not a modern way or a revolutionary way of dealing with the problem because, in fact, they are already practised in many other countries, but if the Minister adopted these suggestions there would be less need for him to provide these very costly institutions, some of which have been adapted from old county homes and others from TB institutions, and it would also save him the considerable cost of capitation payments which he has to make to local authorities in order to keep these people in the institutions.  Above all, I would ask the Minister, in the name of common humanity, to look into the problem of the aged in the city of Dublin.  This problem has been wantonly and shamefully neglected by successive Governments since the formation of the State and it is about time the Minister did something to remedy the situation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I do not propose to take up the time of the House for very long on this Estimate but I do regard this as a very important Estimate which should not be allowed to pass without appropriate comment.  The first thing that strikes me is that the gap between the income of what one might describe as the social welfare classes and the better off classes is rapidly widening instead of narrowing.  The object of any Government, with an appropriate social conscience, should be to improve the lot of the people who cannot look after themselves, or cannot help themselves until they are brought into line with people who are employed or are in receipt of incomes from other sources.  This, I think, we are failing to do.  We are failing very badly to discharge our obligations to the aged, the sick, the infirm and the people who, for one reason or another, are in no position to look after themselves.  The more affluent our society becomes the further these classes are allowed to lag behind.  Whether the economy justifies an affluent society or not is another <Col N="652" /> question but there is no doubt that there are many people in this country at present living in a state of considerable affluence.  One has only to see how money is spent on luxuries of one kind or another in order to realise that the people who are able to fend for themselves are getting on all right whereas the social welfare classes and State pensioners&mdash;I know State pensioners do not come within this Estimate&mdash;fall behind.</P>
      <P>The tendency in the schemes for free fuel, free radio and free electric light&mdash;worthy schemes as they are&mdash; seems to be to encourage old people to live alone.  Perhaps I would be more correct in saying they discourage young people from looking after their aged relatives.  A person over 70 years of age only qualifies for a free radio or television licence if he lives alone or in the company of another old person. Likewise, a person only qualifies for a free supply of electric light if he lives alone.  I appreciate that if the scheme were extended to cover old people living with their relatives it might be abused but I do not think it is beyond the capacity of the Minister or his advisers to devise a scheme under which the abuses would be negligible.  Concessions should be given for the allocation of free radio and television licences, free electric light and free travel for old people living with immediate relatives.  It is very desirable that young people be encouraged to look after and provide for their elderly relatives yet it appears that every scheme introduced by the Minister's Department is going in the opposite direction.  At present when a young person relieves the State of the burden of looking after an elderly relative he is not given recognition for doing so and he is not given any grant or help in providing for them.  If we extended these schemes we would be doing two things.  We would be encouraging the retention of family units and relieving the State of the cost of providing for these people, as Deputy Dr. Browne has said, in homes for the elderly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is appropriate at this time to repeat a plea I made last year or the year before in respect of non-contributory <Col N="653" /> old age pensioners who wish to go to reside with sons and daughters across the sea.  As the regulations are operated at the moment a non-contributory old age pensioner who goes to reside with a son or daughter in England or America must do so as a pauper; the non-contributory old age pension ceases.  That is wrong.  As there are reciprocal arrangements between Great Britain and this country and between other countries and this country the old age pension should be continued if the pensioner is living with a son or daughter abroad.  An old age pensioner may have reared a family and may be left alone here because for one reason or another the family has been forced to emigrate.  In such cases, the pensioner who goes to live with a member of the family abroad should continue to receive the non-contributory old age pension.</P>
    <P>This is a problem which I imagine the Parliamentary Secretary must meet quite frequently because there is considerable emigration from his constituency, as there is from many constituencies. Particularly in the case of Great Britain it should be quite easy to check for the purpose of confirming that the pensioner has not won the sweep or the pools, because that is the only source of income they would be likely to have.  They must be over 70 years of age to qualify for the pension and it is unlikely that they would be engaged in gainful employment.</P>
    <P>Such a scheme as I have recommended would not cost the State anything. In quite a few cases it might relieve the State of the burden of maintaining these people in homes for the elderly, county homes or public institutions of one sort or another.  It is a source of anxiety to old persons not to be able to make some contribution towards their maintenance when they go to reside with their kith and kin abroad.</P>
    <P>I would appeal to the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary to review the regulations and to ensure that they are operated in such a way that elderly persons can qualify for non-contributory pension while resident abroad.  At present there are reciprocal arrangements with regard to unemployment <Col N="654" /> payments and sickness benefit.  Why not extend them to the non-contributory old age pension even if it would be one way traffic?</P>
    <P>It should be a simple matter to make an arrangement whereby the British Ministry of Pensions would check the position of the pensioners. Even if that were not possible, if the Minister's conscience compelled him to do so, there would be no objection to the appointment of, say, two roving inspectors who would visit the elderly persons and check that they had not won the sweep or the pools.</P>
    <P>I should like to deal now with the question of deserted wives.  I realise that if I were to advocate an amendment of the law to provide pensions for deserted wives I would, quite properly, be ruled out of order by you. Therefore, I do not propose to do that. I do say, however, that under existing law the Minister has ample power, if he wishes to do so, to relax somewhat the regulations governing the payment of the widow's pension.  Most Deputies have come across cases where a woman has not seen or heard of her husband for 20, 25 or 30 years, where her efforts through the Garda Síochána or the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children have failed to trace him.  In these cases the Minister is quite entitled under existing regulations to regard the husband as dead and to regard the woman as entitled to the widow's pension.</P>
    <P>Under Acts governing the issue of grant of probate and such things it is a comparatively simple matter to get an order from the court presuming death.  I do not know whether or not it is still the law but it used to be the case that if a man had not been seen or heard of for seven years, his death could be presumed.  Some of the husbands that I am speaking about have not been heard of since the last war. Their wives have had to bring up their children in their absence.  These women should qualify for the widow's pension. At the moment, practically speaking, nothing short of a death certificate will satisfy the Minister for Social Welfare in this type of case.  I have a case where a man who, if he were alive, would be about 80 years of age, would <Col N="655" /> not be regarded as dead for the purpose of the non-contributory widow's pension by the Minister for Social Welfare unless a death certificate was produced. Eventually a death certificate of a person of the same name was produced and the Minister accepted it.</P>
    <P>The Minister should exercise the discretion which I think he has under existing law to presume death where a man has not been heard of by his wife and where the efforts of the Garda Síochána or other police forces or the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children have failed to locate him. His death should be presumed and his wife should be entitled to the widow's pension.  There are cases of very severe hardship, of women being forced to work when they are not fit to do so or existing on home assistance from local health authorities.  That is not good enough.  All Deputies know about this problem.  The Department of Social Welfare can be relied upon to see that abuses will not take place and there are the Garda Síochána and other bodies to assist in investigation.</P>
    <P>Another matter that is causing some trouble at the moment is the question of Garda widows who are in receipt of the non-contributory widow's pension.  The fact that they are in receipt of a non-contributory widow's pension or a non-contributory old age pension is not any creditable reflection on the amount of the Garda widows' pension they receive.  Nevertheless, when the Garda widow's pension is increased by some paltry amount the non-contributory widow's or old age pension is reduced.  Very often it is reduced retrospectively and the Garda widow is blamed, if you do not mind, or faulted in some way, because she did not draw the attention of the Department of Social Welfare to the fact that her Garda widow's pension had been increased.  She is then called upon to pay the amount she is alleged to have been receiving for, perhaps, 20 or 30 weeks in excess of the proper amount.</P>
    <P>Those paltry increases should be ignored.  If a woman is entitled to a Garda pension and a non-contributory <Col N="656" /> widow's or old age pension, and if the Department insist on reducing the social welfare pension immediately the other pension is increased, it should not be beyond the capacity of the Department to have some special mark on her file which would immediately identify her as a Garda widow.  If they insist on this miserable practice, which I do not think they should, the non-contributory pension should be automatically reduced so that they would not be saying after six months to this unfortunate woman: &ldquo;You received £20 or £26 more than you should have and we are now going to recover it from you and not only reduce your pension to what you should have been getting but also reduce it still further to recoup ourselves for the amount you have been receiving in excess of the amount you were entitled to.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>When a person in receipt of a non-contributory pension, whether it is an old age pension or a widow's pension, lets land practically the very last penny she receives in rent from that land is regarded as net income and her means are assessed accordingly.  Sufficient allowance is not made for the maintenance of the land, for attention to the land, or for management of the land.  Apparently the Department consider that you can drain and drag the last penny out of the land by way of rent and put nothing back into it and that is that.  That is wrong.  A more generous allowance should be made to these people who let land.</P>
    <P>I approve of the recent amended scheme under which allowance is made to an old age pensioner in respect of a female relative who is looking after him or her.  That is a good scheme.  From what I have seen so far it is being operated in a reasonable manner.  Of course, until it was amended recently by the abolition of the employment provision and the insurance contribution provision in the former scheme it was absolutely useless. It was non-existent.  It was there on paper only.  As the Minister disclosed in answer to Parliamentary questions, the number of people who reaped any benefit from it was negligible.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="657" /> Since the scheme was extended to include female relatives who never worked or who were never in insurable employment, it has become worth while.  To give credit where credit is due, it has been operated in a reasonable way and let us hope it will continue to be so operated because that is the type of encouragement which should be given to relatives to look after old people, their parents and others.  If that example were followed in other schemes we would have a happier elderly community.  We would have elderly people looked after by their own and there would be a considerable saving to the State.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister that it is unfortunate that his Estimate is dealt with piecemeal over the year.  Apparently the principal Estimate was adopted on 1st November last without a debate.  A token Estimate for £10 was taken later on and now we are dealing with a Supplementary Estimate which is expected to be passed within a matter of hours on the eve of the Easter recess.  The business of this House should be so arranged that it would not be necessary for the Estimate for the Department of Social Welfare to be passed without any debate as was done in the case of the main Estimate this year.  We are now dealing with this very substantial Supplementary Estimate and we are expected to deal with it in a matter of hours.  lumped in with a number of other Estimates.</P>
    <P>Indeed, it is no wonder that the newspapers feel obliged from time to time to criticise this House for being engaged in what might appear to be the valueless exercise of discussing expenditure after the money has been spent.  This cannot go on indefinitely. We must try to devise some ways and means of dealing with these Estimates and having a proper discussion on the activities of the Departments at least once in the year, at a time when the current year's problems, expenditure and requirements are fresh in everyone's mind.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to delay the House unnecessarily on this <Col N="658" /> Supplementary Estimate.  Like Deputy Fitzpatrick, I feel it is a futile exercise to discuss money which has already been spent.  It seems as if we are just a debating society.  However, there are some points I should like to raise in relation to our social welfare services which I maintain are the lowest in Europe.  There was a reference last week, by the Economic and Research Institute I think, to the effect that our social welfare allowances are very low and far below what is desirable for our infirm and sick.  This is evidence that there is something radically wrong with our social welfare system.</P>
      <P>When a person becomes ill it is important that he should have an adequate allowance to provide for him during those trying times when there are increasing demands on his meagre resources.  We should not expect a person who becomes ill through no fault of his own to try to subsist on such a small social welfare allowance. I should like to bring to the Minister's attention the problems of these people who become ill.  These are the ordinary working people who have no money whatsoever.  Their wages are barely sufficient.  They become ill and for the first three days they get nothing, while there are demands for medicines, doctor's fees and extra nourishment perhaps.  When the certificates are submitted they are lost; no one knows where they are.  These are not isolated instances.  It is a frequent occurrence with the Department of Social Welfare that certificates are lost.  The person has no redress; he must wait for weeks and must provide for himself while he is ill.  The Parliamentary Secretary will agree that there is need for streamlining this Department which is perhaps one of the worst Departments of all. There is an inadequate telephone service in the Department.  It is forever engaged and when people try to phone up about their certificates they can never get an answer.  It is a constant problem.  I find it a most frustrating job to phone up on behalf of poor people who have received no cheques.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate what the Parliamentary Secretary has done and is trying to do in the face of tremendous difficulties.  I have discussed this with him before and he is to be congratulated on the efforts he is making. However, I cannot but condemn what has been happening in relation to the Department of Social Welfare. People who are ill or infirm, who are dependent on this meagre allowance, have tremendous difficulty in this regard, and I must bring their problems to the attention of the House and put them on the record.</P>
      <P>I am annoyed and irritated by the fact that when the Minister was asked if he would try to make calculations as to what it would cost to bring our social welfare benefits into line with our neighbouring countries, he said it could not be done.  If we are seriously considering entering the Common Market this must be done; we must find out what it will cost this country to provide social welfare services on a par with the services in those countries. I hope the Government will pay attention to the recommendations made last week by the Economic Research Institute.  I should very much like to know what they intend to do about those recommendations, if they will accept them or in what way will they improve our social welfare services? I presume&mdash;I do not know&mdash; the Parliamentary Secretary has control over this Department.  Certainly to have the one Minister dealing with social welfare and also with our very acute housing problem is too much for one man.  I should like to see a Minister for this Department alone.  This is one Department that needs a separate Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to draw the attention of the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary to the question of the non-contributory old age pensioner who often finds that, when one member of the family gets an increase in salary, thus bringing about an improvement in the household circumstances, his <Col N="660" /> pension is reduced.  It is also common that where an increase is provided for an old age pensioner the rent of his council house goes up.  The same Minister who provided an increase gives orders, as Minister for Local Government, that there shall be an increase in the rent.</P>
    <P>In this so-called age of affluence our old age pensioners are the greatest victims.  The biggest problem with them is depression and despondency, so many of them with no will to live. They are trying to survive on meagre resources.  I was wondering if the Minister would, as a little exercise, try to find out how a pensioner can manage to subsist, to provide the necessary food for himself, the high protein diet which is essential for an old age pensioner, on the small allowance. Many of them who are on their own are suffering from malnutrition.  If a study was made into this problem it would be found that malnutrition among these people is immense.  It might be found that James Plunkett's book <i>Strumpet City</i> would have relevance today among old age pensioners, when he portrayed the man looking for food in the bins.  Is the Minister aware that it can happen today and is happening, that some of these old people are literally starving?  I think I mentioned before the poor person who at intervals of ten or 12 weeks went into hospital for blood transfusions and to be built up because she and her daughter were living on a total of £3 15s and were starving.  We have seen some cases over the winter of people having died.  A study of how a person lives on the present-day pension would be a revelation.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the problem of the stamping of employees' cards.  After years working with a firm employees suddenly discover their cards are not stamped.  I have had so many cases in the last two years that I am wondering if some system could be devised whereby an employee would know at six-monthly intervals that his cards had been stamped.  If his cards are unstamped he must take action himself against the employer.  The Department will take action only when he has failed in his attempts.  This is a serious <Col N="661" /> problem and we must find some way of preventing this injustice to employees. I should like to see some system devised to protect employees, to give them this assurance about their holiday money, benefits and also redundancy payments.  This is very important and I know that the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary are sympathetic in regard to this matter.</P>
    <P>I am not advocating changing the Social Welfare Act but I must highlight the problem of widows in receipt of pensions who, because of circumstances outside their control, are compelled to work.  Very often when those widows fall ill they only receive half benefit, which is most unjust.  Their husband's stamps provide the widow's pension and the widow's stamps provide for social welfare benefit; I cannot understand why these people should be victimised due to the fact that they have a pension from their husband's contributions.  If a married woman works, and her husband also works, and if she falls ill she receives full benefit but this does not apply in the case of widows who very often have to maintain their children.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the problem of deserted wives because I have come across cases both here and in England where the husbands are drawing social welfare benefits on their behalf.  I would urge on the Minister to consult with his colleagues in the British Ministry to see what can be done in cases where husbands are collecting social welfare and national health benefits in respect of their wives but who are keeping the allowances for themselves. Of course, it would be better if we ourselves could provide for these people.  It is degrading and humiliating for the deserted wives to have to depend on home assistance, where it is discontinued after four weeks, and they then find themselves completely destitute.  Renewed applications for home assistance have to be made and these people exist on the charity of their relatives and friends.  This is an increasing problem and it demands urgent attention.</P>
    <P>I am told that many people do not get their full social welfare benefit, or even lose it entirely, because their <Col N="662" /> certificates are not properly dated.  It may be due to errors on the part of the doctors but if people are deprived of benefit because of erroneous dating of certificates the matter should be brought to the attention of the doctors and the people themselves.  I am reliably informed that a considerable amount of money is lost in this way by recipients of social welfare benefit and, if this is the case, we should give full publicity to this fact and let them know that they are losing the benefits.</P>
    <P>I often hear the cry that we cannot improve our social welfare services, that it is not possible to do so.  However, we must do something about it particularly in regard to the infirm and aged and those who cannot cope with the ever-soaring costs of foodstuffs.  By some other form of taxation, by exploiting our natural resources to a greater extent, we must provide more social welfare services for our people so that we can be proud to say that at least we treat the aged and infirm well in this country.</P>

      <P>It is rather unfortunate that a debate on social welfare, which is a matter of great importance, is likely to go through this House in such a summary fashion.  It is possible that the debate will be concluded tonight, which I consider regrettable, and not in line with the relative importance of social welfare in our national economy. I should like to echo the remarks of Deputy O'Connell when he said that we should have a separate Minister for Social Welfare.  The very fact that one man, however able, is holding down two important Ministries&mdash;of which Social Welfare is one&mdash;is a reflection of the priority the Government give to this matter.  There is a very clear case for a separate Minister for Social Welfare to ensure that, not alone will he merely maintain existing schemes and make occasional improvements in response to pressures, but that he will be in a position to undertake an overall review of our entire system and, if necessary, to have a total overhaul to bring this country into line with European standards.  When a Minister is holding down two jobs he is not in a position to do this fundamental thinking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="663" /> In approaching the whole concept of social welfare we must not see it purely from the point of view of alleviating hardship.  While this is its primary purpose, it has a secondary role which is to bring about greater equality in our community.  If we see it merely from the point of view of dealing with instances of hardship as they arise, we have not a complete view of the functions of social welfare. It must be seen as a continuous process towards making this country a more just place in which to live.  We must see it not only from the point of view of improving physical conditions for our people but the services must be administered in such a way as to restore to deprived people moral wellbeing and dignity.  I have no fixed or definite idea as to how our social welfare system could be improved in this respect but I hope this matter will get the thought and consideration of the Government.</P>
    <P>A point which has been repeatedly made is the need for a unified system of social welfare.  Formerly we have tended to respond to immediate pressing needs, to introduce a scheme for this or that, but the whole system is very much of a patchwork nature.  All the various social welfare provisions, including home assistance which is at present administered by the health authorities, should be brought under one umbrella so that all the contesting claims of various groups for welfare services can be assessed in competition with one another and not administered by different authorities with differing sets of priorities.  Only by having such a unified scheme can we ensure that nobody is excluded.  In the course of my contribution I shall indicate some people who are being blatantly excluded at the present time and who, if there was a unified system and a consequent reassessment of all needs of the community, might find themselves included in the scheme.</P>
    <P>The main difficulty in this patchwork approach to social welfare is the question of home assistance which is administered by a different authority on a discretionary basis rather than on a basis of right.  It is more or less filling <Col N="664" /> in where our centrally administered system does not fill the bill.  This is a haphazard approach to social welfare. I should like to quote now from a review by Mr. Anthony Coughlan in a recent edition of <i>Administration</i> on &ldquo;Law for the Poor&rdquo;, published by the IPA.  He says:</P>
    <P>It is difficult to see how the anomalies and injustices of home assistance can be got rid of unless it is integrated with the national assistance of the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>I take it he knows what he is talking about; he certainly knows more about the matter than I do.  I understand that 62 per cent of those at present receiving home assistance receive such assistance as a supplement to cover the inadequacy of existing centrally administered schemes.</P>
    <P>There is another group omitted from the scheme&mdash;deserted wives and the mothers of illegitimate children.  For these there is no social welfare.  All they can receive is home assistance. Now such assistance is not paid as of right; it is discretionary.  These women&mdash;deserted wives and the mothers of illegitimate children&mdash; should receive assistance as of right.</P>
    <P>Again, there are the permanently disabled.  Those who become disabled in insurable employment receive benefit as of right.  The only benefit available to those born disabled is home assistance and again it is discretionary. One of the big difficulties here is the fact that there are differing standards of payment from county to county. That is wrong.  Those suffering genuine hardship should receive payment as of right, under a centrally administered scheme.</P>
    <P>One of the major criticisms of our insurance scheme is the fact that payments are on a flat rate.  This is fundamentally unjust because those who earn little pay just as much as those who earn considerably more. We should move towards a wage related graduated scheme similar to that which obtains in most European countries.  It would be more humane to relate the payments to what people earn while at work.  Their living standards are set during the period in <Col N="665" /> which they are gainfully employed and the objective should be to enable them to maintain that same standard of living.  At the moment people who are earning and who suddenly find themselves on social insurance payments suffer a severe drop in their standard of living.  The amount should be related to earnings.  There should be no flat rate.  That would be a more humane scheme.  It would, indeed, be more in line with what obtains in Europe.  There is the advantage, too, in such a scheme that it is protected against inflation.  If wage rates rise payment under the graduated scheme rises automatically.  Under the present system, with its flat rate, there are serious disadvantages.  If the political pressure is not on the Government to increase the rates of payments the rates are allowed to lag seriously behind.  If there is political pressure, if there is an election coming, the rates of benefit are raised in order to help the Government over some political hurdle.</P>
    <P>Increases in social welfare should be related to the cost-of-living index and not to the political needs of the Government.  It must be firmly established, and accepted, as a principle that social welfare payments must be related to the cost of living.  The way in which to do this could be by a graduated scheme similar to that on the Continent.</P>
    <P>One of the remarkable features of the recent report on the care of the aged is the fact that it echoes many of the proposals put forward by Fine Gael quite some few years back. There is endorsement of the need for a proper domiciliary welfare service. That is now recognised in the report. It was, of course, recognised by Fine Gael in 1965 in their policy for a just society.  There is need for more welfare officers with specific responsibility for looking after the aged.  I trust the Minister will implement these recommendations as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>There are one or two other points I should like to mention.  One is the question of the three waiting days. Those who become unemployed, for whatever reason, do not receive any payment for the first three days.  The <Col N="666" /> reason for this is to prevent malingering or to prevent people having a half-a-week's holiday.  I can see the justification for not giving anything in respect of three isolated days.  I can understand that approach.  There is a need for some scheme under which a person who is out of work for more than 12 days would be paid not only in respect of the last nine of those days but also in respect of the first three days as well.  If a person stays out for 12 days he has a genuine reason for doing so.  He should be paid for all the days he is out of work and not just for the last nine of those 12 days. I understand such a scheme is in operation in respect of occupational injuries. Why can it not be extended to disability benefit and to unemployment benefit?</P>
    <P>It has come to my notice that people have been laid off work as a result of the cement strike.  They are laid off through no fault of their own.  They are not involved directly in the trade dispute.  These people are experiencing great delays in obtaining unemployment benefit.  I do not know why this is.  There may be some justifiable reason for it.  Some people who have been out of work for five or six weeks have not received unemployment benefit. I have not made a complete investigation into this matter yet.  The fact that so many of these people have come to me because they have not got unemployment benefit indicates that something has gone wrong in the Department.  There may have been a big influx of claims in the first week of this strike.  I understand that people might not be paid immediately.  There might be a delay of one or two weeks as a result of the heavy pressure on the staff in the Department of Social Welfare.  The coincidence of so many of these people coming to me would indicate that there is something fundamentally wrong with the payment of unemployment benefit.</P>
    <P>Family allowances, including remissions on income tax, maternity grants and children's allowances, are basically regressive because people who are prosperous on balance receive almost as much in family allowances as people who are not prosperous.  This is certainly the case in respect of <Col N="667" /> children's allowances.  To a substantial degree this also applies to income tax allowances which are given in relation to the number of children in a family. The more tax one pays the more rebate one can get off in respect of children&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Department of Social Welfare is responsible for the standard of living of those members of our society who are dependent on those of us who work.  We must see that the way they live is as satisfying to them as we would wish it to be. This Department caters for those who are in some way deprived&mdash;widows of their husbands, children of their parents, and the old people of the health and strength to provide for themselves. We should have regard for all these people.  Our regard should be shown by the Government in appointing a Minister to take complete control of the pensions and of the schemes which now come under a Minister acting in a dual capacity as Minister for Local Government and Minister for Social Welfare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dr. O'Connell was critical of the Department of Social Welfare. I was glad to hear the Parliamentary Secretary say that the telephone communications with this Department have now been attended to.  My experience of the Department has been that the staff there are courteous, efficient and helpful.  At local level, and in Dublin, I have found the staff considerate and conscious of the hardships on pensioners who do not receive their cheques in time.  The system breaks down occasionally. I hope the Minister or the Parliamentary Secretary will underline to the staff the seriousness to an old <Col N="668" /> age pensioner of not having a cheque for a week or a fortnight.  Such people must go to the shops and look for credit to tide them over.  They are in an embarrassing position if the cheque fails to arrive for a second week.  They must give an explanation which is often not fully believed.  When the cheques arrive such people are half ashamed to go and pay their bills.  I hope the Minister will see whether this position can be remedied so that old age pensioners are not put in the position of not receiving their payments and having to go to the shop to get credit to bridge the gap between the time the cheques are due and their actual date of arrival.</P>
    <P>The pensions which we give old people are deplorably low.  Nobody on any side of the House can fool himself that the pension is adequate recompense for a person who has reached 70 years of age.  Deputy Dr. Browne outlined all the various services which can be provided, not as charity but as a right, when someone has reached 70 years.  These old people have contributed all their lives to this country and have contributed to the pensions of previous old age pensioners.  When they reach 70 years of age they are entitled to a pension and to the company and comfort of those of their own age.  They should have centres in which restrooms would be available for their use.  In some parts of the country community centres are providing meeting-places for pensioners.</P>
    <P>I sometimes feel that old people grow in on themselves and become disinclined to mix with others unless they are forced to do so.  I would like to see restrooms available so that old people could go to them.  There should be no appearance of charity attached to anything we do for the old.  The people who are now drawing old age pensions would have been about 20 years of age at the time of the foundation of this State.  They would have given their full working lives for the country.  We should be very conscious of the debt we owe them and we should see that their old age is as comfortable as we would wish our own to be.  I think it is true that many of them die, if not of hunger, hungry, but <Col N="669" /> many more die of loneliness.  It is very sad to see old people living on tea and bread and butter only in a cold, bleak room having a fire for only three or four nights a week since they cannot afford a fire any oftener.  Even though the free fuel scheme is there, under some local authorities the old people must pay a charge for delivery or else collect the fuel themselves.  I asked the Minister about this before and I think he replied that there was some provision in the scheme that the fuel supplied must be hand-won, not machine-won turf or coal.  The least we could do would be to give these people machine turf rather than hand-won turf.  Even to give them coal might not stretch the country's Budget too far.</P>
    <P>This scheme runs from 1st November to the end of March but for old people the months of October and April can seem equally cold and I ask the Minister to extend the free fuel scheme to include these months and make it seven rather than five months as I think it is at the moment.  There is an aura of charity about much of what we do for the old age pensioners. Many voluntary bodies do extremely good work such as Meals on Wheels, St. Vincent de Paul, the Legion of Mary and many others.  I should like to see a situation in which there was no necessity for these bodies.  I hate to see them calling on anybody; old age pensioners should have sufficient money to enable them to live a normal life or their children should look after them.  It is frequently a matter of complaint that there is some reluctance on the part of children to care for aged parents.  I think the problem is exaggerated. I believe it is not widespread but in many cases parents are put into what are not geriatric units but into mental institutions in some places. This is not always done because children do not want to care for their parents but they cannot afford the physical room in the house nor could they keep that old age pensioner for a week on the old age pension that the old person gets.  The State should devise a system whereby when an old age pensioner goes to live with the children such children would be given an adequate allowance.  This would <Col N="670" /> save the cost of the institution and the conscience of the children would not be disturbed and the old people would live much longer.</P>
    <P>I understand statistics suggest that if you live to be 65 life expectancy afterwards is almost 14 years.  That means the State would be responsible for them for nine further years.  If as Deputy Dr. Browne suggested it will cost from £11 to £13 per week to keep them in an institution&mdash;I believe it would be nearer £18 a week&mdash;this would be a good investment for the State, considering the matter on the lowest level and on another level, the human level, it would be a tremendous comfort to the old people and it would give a sense of security to the children in that they would feel that when their time came they would get the same treatment.  It is true that as we treat our parents so we shall be treated by our children.  By providing an allowance in such cases the State would make a saving which would probably far outweigh the expenditure involved.</P>
    <P>The same situation seems to apply in the case of widows in that none of us realises the position in which they find themselves.  We seem to suffer a mental block and cannot agree among ourselves. On this side we cannot induce the Minister to bring in legislation to improve the position.  I do not know what the reason is.  It is a very sad thing to see a family broken up and the children separated from the mother and put into an institution.  I have seen it happen frequently.  It must be realised that there is a tremendous strain on a woman who has led a sheltered life and then loses her husband. The wages die with him and she is left, perhaps, with the widows' and orphans' pension and nothing else.</P>
    <P>Apart from the loss of her husband the strain of taking responsibility for running a house, which in so many cases is carried by the husband, is very great.  This frequently makes the widow incapable of making correct decisions for as long as two years afterwards and so the house is not run as he would have done it or as she would do it later on.  I have seen cases like <Col N="671" /> this where the widow goes into debt and seems to find things impossible. Nobody talks to her or helps her.  Then the children are taken from her and put into an institution and again there is enormous expense for the State.  If she had some knowledge of the financial position before her husband died whatever other worries or responsibilities she had she would not have the worry of assuming financial responsibilty to the same extent.  The children are deprived of a father and then of the mother and the home and in many cases live their lives in an institution until they go out to work. I have spoken to social workers about this problem.  Even the worst home is better than an institution and I think nuns and brothers who run the institutions would be the first to agree with that, except in very extreme circumstances.</P>
    <P>I hope there will be some rethinking in the Department on this matter and that some method will be devised whereby a widow will get something approaching what her husband had <Col N="672" /> before he died so as to allow her to rear her family as he would wish.  From pure mercenary reasons it would represent a saving to the State because the cost of keeping children in institutions must be about £10 per week, certainly £8.  If the widow had this she would be saved great worry and would be able to rear her children in an atmosphere which would give them a better chance in life.  Children coming out of such institutions are conscious of the lack they have suffered during the years they have been in the institution.  They are unable to face up to life; their mother has become merely a visitor and they look for the guidance they should get from their parents from people who, however well-meaning, are strangers to them.</P>
