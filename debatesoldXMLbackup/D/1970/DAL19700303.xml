    <Speaker pid="HughByrne1969" hpid="Dr. Byrne Dr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will consider amending Article 8 in a general review of the Constitution.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughByrne1969" hpid="Dr. Byrne Dr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach what consideration the Government have given, in the context of the partial or complete integration of the Six Counties with the rest of Ireland, to the application of the present Irish language policy to the Six Counties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.</P>
      <P>I do not intend to promote the amendment of Article 8 of the Constitution. I consider its provisions appropriate to our present position and adequate to meet future developments.</P>
      <P>The policy in respect of the Irish language to be followed in the Six Counties in the event of reunification would be a matter for determination by the appropriate authorities in the new constitutional situation which would have been created.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne1969" hpid="Dr. Byrne Dr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware of the contradictory element in paragraph 3 of Article 8 through which it is possible for the Irish language to be replaced by another language?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there is anything contradictory or that <Col N="1870" /> there is any suggestion that the Irish language would be replaced by another language.  To put the matter on record, I shall quote paragraph 3 of Article 8:</P>
      <P>Provision may, however, be made by law for the exclusive use of either of the said languages for any one or more official purposes, either throughout the State or in any part thereof.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne1969" hpid="Dr. Byrne Dr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that because of the dropping of the republican attitude by the Government the people of the country are very wary as regard paragraph 3 of this Article &mdash;that there is a loophole here whereby English could replace the Irish language? In these circumstances should the Taoiseach not prepare for the deletion of paragraph 3?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>An gceapann an Teachta go bhfuil orainn an teanga a fhágaint ar leataobh?  There is no suggestion that there is any change in the policy of this party towards our republican attitude.  If I have suggested interim solutions as stepping stones to the realisation of our ideal, it does not mean that any of our traditional basic policy will be abandoned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Although I do not support the suggested changing of Article 8, might I ask the Taoiseach when it is proposed to have a general review of the Constitution?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I answered that at some length here last week.  I said that at the moment certain amendments may be necessary in the immediate context of our imminent membership of the EEC.  As far as the broader aspects of the Constitution are concerned, certainly I would promote amendments as long as any such amendments would seem to facilitate the reunification of our country.  However, at this moment I do not think it is appropriate to proceed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Taoiseach think it appropriate five or six months ago when he made a specific suggestion that a particular Article would be amended?  Do we take it that it is not <Col N="1871" /> intended to change the Constitution in the immediate future?  Does the Taoiseach not think it desirable to have a change, particularly because of the happenings in the Six Counties during recent months?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">

      <P>The pressure for change in our Constitution now comes from our possible accession to the EEC rather than from any desire to achieve unity?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>On the contrary, I said last week that changes may be necessary.  In fact, I am certain some changes will be necessary if we become members of the EEC and these changes will be effected when they seem necessary.  In the event of reunification further changes will also be effected, as may be necessary and as appear timely and conducive to reunification.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughByrne1969" hpid="Dr. Byrne Dr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health the percentage of the population in the Ballyfermot dispensary area who have medical cards; how this percentage compares with the average percentage throughout the country; and, if it is not a greater percentage, why.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The percentage of the population in the Ballyfermot dispensary district covered by medical cards on 30th September, 1969, was 26.3 and was much higher than the average of 17.0 per cent for Dublin city.  The percentage for the country as a whole was 30.6.</P>
      <P>The percentage of the population covered by medical cards in a particular area is a function of the general level of income in an area and, even when similar criteria are applied in assessing applications, it is to be expected that there will be variations in the percentages so covered in different areas.  In these circumstances, the variation of four percentage points between the Ballyfermot figure and the national average would be a reflection of differences in income levels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne1969" hpid="Dr. Byrne Dr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that the figure of 26.3 per cent is extremely low considering that the people of Ballyfermot are in the lower income group and that practically everybody is living in subsidised accommodation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy knows, there is virtually full employment in the area.  The figure compares favourably with a great many areas in other parts of the country, where the figure goes up to 45, 46 and 47 per cent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughByrne1969" hpid="Dr. Byrne Dr. Byrne">

    <P>5.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne1969" hpid="Dr. Byrne Dr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he will consider the introduction of an area registration scheme for general practitioners who would practise in the relevant areas in order to facilitate the fight against drug addiction and forged prescriptions bearing in mind that there is no up-to-date register available for immediate consultation by pharmacists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1873" />
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not quite clear as to the proposals in the question but I presume that the Deputy has in mind the establishment of and circulation to pharmacists of registers of medical practitioners on an area basis; and that doctors would practise only in the respective areas for which they are registered.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the regulations made under the Dangerous Drugs Act, 1934, and the Medical Preparations (Control of Sale) Regulations, 1966, require that a prescription be in writing, and be signed and dated and bear the address of the doctor, dentist or veterinary surgeon issuing the prescription.  It must also bear the name and address of a person to whom it is issued.</P>
      <P>With such information available to him, it seems to me that a pharmacist should be in a position to have a check made without undue difficulty on the bona fides of any prescription, should he consider it necessary.</P>
      <P>I know that some difficulties exist regarding forged prescriptions, but I am not aware that such forgeries play a major part in the matter of drug abuse.  It is hoped that forthcoming legislation will improve the position in regard to the prosecution of such offences.</P>
      <P>While I welcome any suggestion which would assist in combating drug abuse, I do not consider that the arrangements put forward by the Deputy, as I have interpreted them, would be practicable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne1969" hpid="Dr. Byrne Dr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that a circular was recently sent out by Dublin Health Authority to all their medical officers informing them of the importance of keeping prescription pads locked up because of the great increase in the number of forged prescriptions being presented to chemists? There are no lists of registered doctors available to chemists.  It is quite feasible for a forger to have his own medical prescription pad printed as there is no list of registered doctors available to the printers.  Would the Minister, as a matter of urgency, see that some form of legislation curtailing the availability of these prescriptions is introduced?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware that the position is as serious as the Deputy indicates.  I have asked the working party dealing with dangerous drugs to look into this and other matters before they present their final report to me.</P>

    <P>6.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne1969" hpid="Dr. Byrne Dr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he intends to introduce legislation to control the sale of cough bottles which contain minute amounts of morphine in therapeutic doses but which when consumed in large quantities as has been the practice with drug addicts, have an effect other than the desired therapeutic effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Under existing statutory controls cough bottles containing morphine, even in minute quantities, can only be sold by persons authorised under the Pharmacy Acts 1875 to 1962, e.g. pharmaceutical chemists etc.  I am not satisfied that the misuse of these preparations for the purposes stated by the Deputy is such that I would be justified in imposing further statutory controls on their sales, such as making them available only on prescription.</P>
      <P>I think that the judgment and responsibility of authorised persons can be relied on to prevent any significant abuse of such preparations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne1969" hpid="Dr. Byrne Dr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that morphine in minute quantities in cough bottles is being consumed in large quantities, for effects other than therapeutic, in order to obtain the morphine extracts?  This source of morphine is readily available despite the new legislation which the Minister has brought in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The working party on dangerous drugs has a far better means of acquiring information on this matter than either the Deputy or I have.  This particular abuse has not been brought to their notice as one of any significance.  I have no doubt that, if people will give evidence that it is, they will investigate any evidence put before them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Why should this matter be looked into?  If I understand Deputy Dr. Byrne correctly, he is suggesting that in order to get a <Col N="1875" /> cough bottle one should have to go and get a prescription first.  This will mean that, instead of just buying a cough bottle at the chemist's for a few shillings, one will have to pay a doctor's fee as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The dangerous drugs committee have asked for all the evidence they can get on these abuses. They have received evidence about certain of them, the result of which has been the changes which have taken place, including the steps I have taken in section 76 of the Health Act, and the removal of some 30 amphetamine drugs from chemists.  I have taken all the advice they have given me, but in order to take extreme action, such as making commonly used cough medicine available only by prescription, I would need evidence.  If people have evidence of any abuse they should present it to this committee.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that if a list of drug addicts was circulated to medical practitioners they would be in a better position to decide, when prescribing drugs like morphine, whether it would be dangerous to the patient?  Will the Minister not reconsider the whole matter?</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="HughByrne1969" hpid="Dr. Byrne Dr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not think it ineffective to have legislation inhibiting the sale of morphine in quantities when there is legislation making morphine available in small quantities to the public?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a matter for the Pharmaceutical Society.  If a member of the Pharmaceutical Society sees large numbers of bottles of cough medicine being sold to the same person, in order, by drinking a great deal of the mixture, to indulge in morphine to an excessive degree, it is his duty, if he has the evidence that Deputy Dr. Byrne has, to present it immediately <Col N="1876" /> to the working party on dangerous drugs.  The Deputy well knows that.</P>

      <P>My Department, with the co-operation of the Department of External Affairs, are in constant touch with developments in the health sector in the EEC.  Draft directives concerning all professions in this sector, which include provisions relating to mutual recognition of qualifications, were passed by the Commission of the EEC to the Council between March and December, 1969.  The drafts have been under examination in my Department and translations of the documents have been sent to the registration and teaching bodies and the professional organisations concerned.  The Department will continue to keep these bodies and organisations informed of developments in this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries if applicants under the beef cattle incentive scheme whose cows had not calves with them at two consecutive inspections in 1969 will receive the relevant grant upon the next and second inspection in 1970; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. Blaney) Neil T. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. Blaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>This scheme is based on the presence of cows and calves of suitable quality at two consecutive inspections.  I am aware that last year some herd owners did not have sufficient calves to match the number of cows they presented at the two inspections.  I am now reviewing the working of the scheme and while I would hope to make it more flexible I am not proposing to change the basis of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister state specifically if cows without calves on the first inspection will receive the subsidy on the next inspection?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, provided they fulfil the original qualification that they were there at the autumn inspection and the spring or early summer inspection, and that they had a calf.  In other words, it will be the same thing.  It will be two inspections rather than two inspections within the given year.  It will be any two inspections.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that the present system is a bit inflexible in so far as there could be an undue delay in obtaining the subsidy due to the necessity for two inspections?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  It is not a question of flexibility in this case.  It is a question of ensuring that a cow that qualifies for this cow with a calf scheme is there on two consecutive inspection dates.  There can be no question of <Col N="1878" /> inflexibility or flexibility in this matter. They have got to be there on two consecutive dates or else they are not on.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister consider an inspection in December rather than having to wait for the following March?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of when the inspection may be in the winter time depends largely on when it would be regarded as most suitable in the summer time, the idea being that there would be only two inspections in any given 12 month period and that those two inspections should as far as possible be equally spaced or equally distant in time from one to the other. In other words, every six months there should be an inspection.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  It would defeat the whole purpose underlining the scheme.  More inspections would mean that you would have to keep the calves and the cows for a few months and then flog them after they had the inspection having kept them three months and, perhaps, turn them into milk production instead of the production of beef.</P>

Many elderly people who go to evening Mass and church services at night have great difficulty in crossing the road due to the heavy increase in vehicular traffic.

      <P>While the administration of the Dublin Corporation's rates waiver scheme, including the determination of individual applications, is primarily a matter for the local authority, the volume of complaints I received suggested that there was a need for a special review of the operation of the scheme.

The rent based on the cost of providing, maintaining and administering the flats would be of the order of £10 a week plus rates.  The difference between the economic cost and the maximum rent is met by subsidy from my Department and the local authority.

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 31 and 32 together.</P>
      <P>The information that was sought related to complaints about Garda actions in street demonstrations and crowd control.  It is not a fact that the commissioner refused the information. The commissioner had not the information to give and he explained this to the newspaper concerned, pointing out that the information could be got only by special research which would mean diverting men from urgent police work.</P>
      <P>For the same reason, I am not in a position to supply the information sought in the Deputy's second question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should, however, like to make it perfectly clear that the fact that statistics are not available by no means implies, as the newspaper concerned has sought to suggest, that in the absence of statistics the Garda authorities have no general picture of the situation.  The general picture is well known not only to the Garda authorities but to the general public, and it is that there is a very small minority in this country, mostly in Dublin, whose policy it is to engage in illegal obstruction of the streets and in other forms of illegal interference with the rights of others, partly because they have no respect for the rights of others and partly with the deliberate object of trying to provoke a clash with the Garda Síochána, so that the moment the gardaí intervene to protect the ordinary members of the public, they can raise a chorus of &ldquo;police brutality&rdquo;<Col N="1888" /> which is the stock cry of layabouts and hooligans in this and other countries.

    <P>The causes of crime and the best ways of combating it are difficult and complex questions that cannot be dealt <Col N="1890" /> with adequately by way of a reply to a Parliamentary Question.  In fact there are divergent views as to causes and methods of prevention amongst expert bodies under the auspices of the United Nations Organisation and other international bodies and a great deal of research in that regard is going on in which my Department participates.  I would refer the Deputy to what I said on the subject in opening the debate on the Estimates for my Department on 21st November last.</P>
    <P>Briefly, what I said was that it is essential that we keep under constant review the allocation of Garda man-power so that maximum resources will be available in these areas where the need is greatest and we must also make a constant effort, within the limits of our financial resources, to make available the best possible transport and communication facilities so as to equip the Force as well as possible to discharge their duties with maximum efficiency.</P>

In addition there have been disorderly street demonstrations on a number of occasions.  Large numbers of gardaí have had to be diverted from their ordinary duties on these occasions.  Sooner or later the public must come to realise that the existing Garda force of 6,500, which is costing the taxpayer something like £11 million <Col N="1891" /> per annum, can cope only if and so long as the actions of irresponsible and criminal elements, who go all out to promote disorder on every occasion, are seen for what they are and treated accordingly by all and sundry.  There has been a tendency in the press to glamourise some of these petty criminals. The fact is they are costing the taxpayer a lot of money and taking up a lot of Garda time.

      <P>While the crime figures for assaults, woundings <i>et cetera</i> have not shown an upward trend in Dublin in recent years, it is true to say that crimes of this type are still all too prevalent.  The Garda Síochána give constant attention to such violent crimes where they occur and they will continue to do all they can to deal with the problem.</P>
      <P>Special late night Garda patrols, especially at week-ends, are provided in particular areas and it is expected that these patrols together with the ordinary beat patrols and mobile patrols operating from the local Garda stations will be effective.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that this problem is more serious than he has been informed by his Department? There are many people who are afraid to report these attacks to the gardaí for fear of reprisal by some of these gangs.  Would the Minister not consider putting more men on the beat rather than in patrol cars and increasing the use of trained dogs?  There are many people in my constituency and all over Dublin who are afraid to go out at night.  This is no longer a country where people can go about in peace.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose, with your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, to take Questions Nos. 36, 37 and 38 together.</P>
      <P>Before the legal aid scheme came into operation in April, 1965, discussions were held by the Minister for Justice with the Incorporated Law Society and the Bar Council on the level of fees to be provided for solicitors and counsel.  Both the Law Society and the Bar Council accepted the fees that were eventually incorporated in Regulations made by the Minister for Justice with the consent of the Minister for Finance, and there was a mutual understanding that the scale of fees would be looked at again after the scheme had been in operation for three years or so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following my consultations with the Minister for Finance representatives of both bodies were seen by me in July, 1969, when I informed them that we would be prepared to make new Regulations which would allow for an increase of 25 per cent on the present fees.  The new scale of fees, together with a number of fees and allowances for new items, were accepted by the <Col N="1894" /> Law Society.  The Bar Council representatives, however, did not signify acceptance but said that they would report back to their council.  They did not communicate with me further on the matter and the first I heard of their intentions to withdraw from the scheme was when a statement to that effect was made at the annual general meeting of the Bar on Friday, 13th February, and was reported in the daily press on 16th February.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>As a result of a general review of the organisation of the force that is still proceeding, the commissioner has advised that, without loss of police efficiency, better use could be made of the man-power at his disposal by the closing or reduction of a number of stations.  Ballybrittas was one of these centres and the station there will be closed on 31st March.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not appreciate the special virtue of any Garda station being situated on the main Dublin road as a reason for its retention.  There is another Garda station within four miles of it.  The question would suggest that there are no Garda stations on the main road between Kildare and Mountrath; in fact there are two, but if the questioner thinks that is not so because one of them is 400 yards and the other 800 yards away from the main road I suppose he is technically correct.  There is a population of 1,600 here and the average number of accidents is five and, therefore, the commissioner considered in his wisdom that it could be effectively policed from the station within four miles of it.</P>

      <P>With your permission a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 52, 53 and 54 together.</P>
      <P>The administration of the major resort development scheme is a function of Bord Fáilte and the question of the adoption, implementation and phasing of the Tramore Resort plan or any variant of it is a matter for the board of Tramore Fáilte in consultation with Bord Fáilte.  Funds for the promotion of tourism have been provided on an ever increasing scale for a number of years.  Of necessity priority has been given to promotional and marketing work and the development of holiday accommodation.  In the circumstances, the funds available for resort development have had to be restricted and Bord Fáil accordingly found it necessary to draw up a list of priorities to ensure the programmed development of resorts coming within the scope of the scheme and the avoidance of wasteful expenditure. Apart from finance, other factors influencing the priorities include such items as the stage to which plans have been developed and the availability of local contributions towards the works.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am fully aware of the situation at Tramore and, indeed, at the other resorts and as recently as 20th February <Col N="1903" /> last I received a deputation from Tramore Fáilte to discuss their problems. There is no question of funds earmarked for Tramore being diverted to another resort and indeed Bord Fáilte hope to spend at the resort during the coming year about £50,000 on site development work, an integral and essential part of the plan.  This will bring the total spent by Bord Fáilte on Tramore Fáilte projects to £250,000 and an overall total of £300,000 for resort works at Tramore.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The ESB are carrying out the rural electrification post-development scheme in a planned sequence of areas.  The object of this orderly programme is to keep the cost of the work to the lowest possible level and thus ensure that the maximum number of connections are made within the capital available.  The board are, on occasion, pressed to make connection out of turn and in cases where this is physically possible and where it will not divert staff from planned work, the board will offer to extend supply but only on payment by the applicant of the full cost of the work.</P>
      <P>If, therefore, the persons the Deputy has in mind wish to be connected out of turn, they will have to provide the capital themselves initially.  Otherwise, some one or more householders who are already in the planned scheme must lose their place until a later date.</P>

      <P>As I have indicated, the information is not readily available, not merely because of the difficulty of the effort of computation.  The Deputy may not be aware that it happens relatively often that people notify me of a proposed price increase.  They are written to, with a questionnaire, and told not to implement the increase until I have had an opportunity to examine it and to give the information requested in the questionnaire which includes various documents, including accounts usually.  It frequently happens at this point that they do not pursue their application but we do not know about this, may never know about it except that they do not implement it.  The information requested by the Deputy would be meaningless if we computed it on the basis that he requests, in view of what I have just mentioned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Throughout this debate we have been emphasising the serious situation arising from the housing <Col N="1908" /> shortage in our urban centres. Those of us from Dublin have been speaking about the situation here and other Deputies have been emphasising a similar alarming situation in their areas.  It all adds up to a very strong indictment of the Minister for Local Government, one of whose responsibilities is to ensure that the supply of houses in some way approximates to the demand.  The demand at present is in the region of 25,000 houses per year.  We are not meeting that demand and the Minister for Local Government in any of his projected programmes gives little evidence of either being aware of the urgency of the situation or producing any plans suggesting that in the very near future he intends to meet the increasing demand for housing in the urban centres.</P>
      <P>Let us look at the newly-weds' scheme.  Our canvassers in the Ballyfermot area have brought back reports from the tenants of Ballyfermot of the alarming situation faced by their sons and daughters in their search for accommodation here in Dublin.  There are a very limited number of houses offered in a draw by Dublin Corporation each year for couples who have married within the two-year period prior to the draw.  From this draw emerge an extremely lucky few because this is the only provision made by the corporation for young married couples who have no children.  It is a shocking comment on the housing situation in Dublin that young couples who have no children have absolutely no hope of being offered accommodation by Dublin Corporation except for this draw.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the present by-election campaign we have found that the issue uppermost in people's minds is housing. They have repeatedly emphasised the problems faced by their sons and daughters who have no opportunity of qualifying for housing.  Their problem is not lessened when one remembers that if they must live in private flat accommodation no rent control exists and they may have to pay £6 or £7 for a single room.  Obviously that situation does not permit of any savings.  Neither can they have regard to the husband's <Col N="1909" /> distance from his place of employment. There is also the custom among such landlords that as soon as a couple has a child they wish to get rid of them very rapidly.  We are very conversant with this problem in Dublin.  Even those who are lucky in the newlyweds' draw must wait many months before their number is reached.</P>
    <P>A great deal of controversy has centred around the actual number of people on the approved list in Dublin. It is regrettable that official sources have not explained conclusively the way this official waiting list is made up.  One of the features that makes any firm conclusion about the extent of the housing situation in Dublin difficult to reach is the lack of, one would almost say, honesty on the official side about the situation.  Here the Minister himself has added his own quota of vagueness, innuendo and inaccuracy.  In order to qualify for inclusion on the approved waiting list a couple must have at least one child. There is also an unapproved waiting list but this exists purely for statistical purposes because no action is taken to house families on this list.  The number of people who are not on the official list do not exist at all in the official mind.  The unapproved waiting list is a list of families who have applied for houses but are not considered in the official mind to be in immediate need of housing.</P>
    <P>What is the order of priority for the housing of families on the approved waiting list?  Families considered to be living in dangerous or unfit dwellings would be one category; another category would be overcrowded families and a further group would be families with priority for housing on medical grounds.</P>
    <P>What happens if a dangerous building notice is put on a building&mdash;that is, it is considered a danger to the occupants if they remain in occupation, and indeed the building has to be very dangerous for such a notice to be affixed&mdash;in other words, the people are considered in imminent physical danger of a stairway giving way, or the roof collapsing?  Those people are offered accommodation in accordance with what is available at that time. <Col N="1910" /> However, what is available at that time has no bearing on the proximity to their place of employment, and if the person happens to be a shiftworker this can be of extreme importance.  In looking at this problem in Dublin many people seem to consider the city a very small village, with distance of no account, but a man can be 20 miles away from his place of employment at the present time in Dublin.  Therefore, for shiftworkers proximity to their place of employment is of crucial importance.</P>
    <P>The question arises: who, in fact, will be offered accommodation when a building is described as dangerous and who will be excluded?  Single people and childless couples under the age of 60 years are not offered alternative accommodation and, when there is a possibility of being offered alternative accommodation, it is usually substandard. If a person occupies a building classified as dangerous and, for reasons of proximity to his employment, turns down the offer made by the corporation, he may remain on in the dwelling at his own risk and is not made a further offer until a court order for eviction is brought against him.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned the position of an occupant in imminent danger on account of the condition of the dwelling. Indeed, many families have had to wait for the roof to collapse before a dangerous building notice was affixed.  But what happens to those people living in a dwelling considered a danger to health?  This danger to health may not be evident immediately but may affect them in the following years.  What does one say of a family who do not qualify for inclusion on the approved list of Dublin Corporation but who have an infant with bronchial or chest disorders as a result of damp conditions?  Under the present housing fiasco that exists in Dublin how long does it take before aid can be given to a family officially considered as living in unfit accommodation?</P>
    <P>The Minister may give different figures but it has been my experience that it usually takes two years before all steps have been taken to ensure that a habitation designated as unfit <Col N="1911" /> is closed down and before the inhabitants are rescued from a situation that constitutes a threat to health.  There is a very large backlog of such dwellings in Dublin at present whose inhabitants must continue to live in conditions that constitute a danger to their health.  One could take many aspects of the housing programme as it affects Dublin and draw very serious conclusions on the inadequacy of the official response to this problem.  One could take that question of danger to health and consider the fact that in our capital city there are hundreds of families who must live in conditions that constitute a direct threat to their health, who must wait over a given period and whose children may suffer lasting, adverse consequences to their health as a result of the present housing situation in Dublin.</P>
    <P>This is the cost in human terms and misery behind the official housing statistics the Minister trots out in this House in defence of his record.  These are the facts that bring people out onto the streets and bring the agitators to the fore.  It is no use for the Minister to suggest it is purely the wickedness of the contemporary human spirit that compels young people to revolt for reasons they do not know.  The reasons are all around them in this city.  They see, perhaps, friends, relations and neighbours living in intolerable conditions with no real possibility of rescue in the forseeable future.  Seeing all this, if their comment on the society that permits this to happen is a violent one, who can blame them, least of all the responsible Minister?</P>
    <P>One of the other criteria involved is overcrowding.  This is determined by the cubic capacity of accommodation occupied by an applicant.  What do we consider as appropriate to each individual? We consider overcrowded families in the Dublin Corporation area are those whose accommodation consists of less than 400 cubic feet per person.  In other words, the cubic capacity of the chair occupied by the Ceann Comhairle is about what we consider to be satisfactory for one individual in terms of living accommodation in Dublin at present.  It is not very much, as the Ceann Comhairle would possibly <Col N="1912" /> agree&mdash;I am sure he would not like to stay in that chair day and night &mdash;but that is the position in Dublin. How can we ensure that our standards of cubic capacity in relation to accommodation are more civilised and how can we rescue people from the indignity of officials coming along with tapes, measuring wardrobes and ceiling widths, including sculleries and halls, taking into account every inch of space, ignoring prams and all the paraphernalia one sees in overcrowded conditions?  How can we rescue people from this assault on their privacy and this measuring tape mentality?</P>
    <P>There are health priorities.  How do the corporation or the local authority approach the question of health?  How do they consider the serious threat to health posed by our poor housing record?  Priority for housing on health grounds is determined by the city medical officer.  There is a tendency to condemn him.  I am not a medical person but, knowing the cases involved, I have been at a loss on certain occasions to understand why the city medical officer could not pass a particular case on health grounds.  Of course, he is as much a creature of the system as any other official in Dublin Corporation.  After all, they are in the hands of the Minister.  Only the Minister and the Cabinet can make available more cash for the institutional changes needed to step up the housing drive.</P>
    <P>If the city medical officer makes incomprehensible judgements on certain occasions, surely it is the housing situation facing him and not his medical training or his medical assessment which speaks when he rejects one case for housing and accepts another?  Obviously his medical opinion must suffer to a certain extent when we consider that his job is an impossible one since he cannot speak as a medical person as the houses are not, in fact, there.</P>
    <P>In the situation in which this unfortunate officer of the Dublin Corporation finds himself, priority can only be given to a family which is affected by a serious and contagious disease such as tuberculosis, or where the health of a family is affected detrimentally by their living conditions and <Col N="1913" /> the danger exists that a continuing habitation of that building could prove fatal.  This boils down, in effect, to something like heart disease, where an applicant's accommodation is considerably above ground level and a person with a heart condition must go up and down a few flights of stairs every day.</P>
    <P>Undoubtedly the city medical officer must take certain risks in relation to the judgments he makes because he is faced with an appalling housing shortage and, therefore, he must cut corners in making assessments of people's medical needs.  Since our health priorities cannot take in all the cases which are grievously affected by the housing situation in Dublin, we know we are taking grave risks with people's health in Dublin in relation to housing.</P>
    <P>It can take practically two years to decide that a place must be closed down.  With a serious shortage the official response is always to slow up the process of turning more people, more applicants, onto the housing market. It must be established whether or not a dwelling is capable of economic repair before it can be officially closed.  Quite expensive investigations must be undertaken before such a decision is reached.  A part from our present problem, which is a shortage of houses, there would also seem to be a certain amount of unfairness in the method of determining overcrowding which is the major criterion used at present in facilitating people in their request for accommodation from the Dublin Corporation.</P>
    <P>The official mind has, if you like, become hardened to the idea of a continuing housing crisis in Dublin and the regulations ignore some of the resultant misery.  People living in overcrowded accommodation are listed for housing according to the measurements of the accommodation in which they sleep.  The result is that subtenants who share a bedroom with members of the tenant's family are listed as occupying accommodation which, in fact, they only share.  In other words, if they share the place where they sleep with the tenant's family it is considered, by our present overcrowding criteria, that it is their <Col N="1914" /> bedroom when, in fact, they are sharing it.</P>
    <P>Sex overcrowding is recognised only in a family which includes a child or children over the age of ten years.  I think it will be generally accepted that the age limit should be lower today. The age of ten, it appears to me, is much too high in 1970 when considering sex overcrowding.  Obviously it should be much lower.  Again the problem is a shortage of houses and again the official mind has to cut corners.  For a city or a county famed for its fastidiousness in sexual matters, it is an extraordinary comment that ten years should be considered the appropriate age in this connection.  If our housing programme had regard to true human decency it would be much lower.  Here we are committing a basic assault on human dignity because of our failure to provide sufficient houses.</P>
    <P>These are real reasons why deep indignation should be felt by many citizens, why housing enrages so many people, and why many people are agitated about it.  The Minister should understand with sympathy why there is such indignation at the bad housing situation.  It is insufficient in response to quote the imaginary inadequacies of the Coalition Government on housing.  It is inadequate to try to explain a failure to provide houses in 1970 by citing failure in 1956 and 1957.</P>
    <P>This is very important.  No special priority is given to any family where the father is a shiftworker and has to sleep at home during the day.  Distance from an applicant's employment is not taken into account.  We are famous for our attachment to family life.  In fact, our Constitution mentions the subject.  Governments over the years have given warm praise to the idea of family life, yet no special priority is given to families who are separated due to overcrowding.</P>
    <P>If a married couple in Dublin are separated and living apart because of the housing situation we do not consider this a crime.  We do not consider it alarming.  We allow it to happen. In many cases in this city young married couples must live apart.  How sincere is the society which forces so <Col N="1915" /> many of its young married couples to live apart because of its failure to provide houses for them?  Can one blame such young people if they feel that the community of which they are exhorted to be members has excluded them if, in fact, that community gives them no possibility of living together in the married state?  Again, one could ask, quite fairly, how sincere is that community in its protestations of the sanctity of the married state when it cannot allow people in the married state to live together in decent housing accommodation.</P>
    <P>You can then have the situation in Dublin where a family living in very bad health conditions must wait an intolerable period before in fact being suited and one can offer them no particular hope of accommodation in the foreseeable future.  The only way in which we can really meet the situation is to provide more houses.  We need something of the order of 25,000 per year.  It was remarked earlier in the debate that the present Government policy appears to favour reliance on more private house building and the figure suggests a turn-away from the number of houses built for local authorities.  We appear&mdash;this has been remarked during this debate&mdash;to throw all the burden onto the private sector, forcing citizens to purchase their own houses.  Fair enough if we so arrange the market that they can get houses at reasonable prices, but it is not considered to be the State's business to ensure that houses can be provided at reasonable prices.  Under the corporation purchase system married couples in Dublin after two or three years living in private flat accommodation or under another system can have scraped together £700 deposit.  Of course when we have brought forward suggestions&mdash;not fantastic but sensible suggestions&mdash;to meet the situation&mdash; one of the most sensible was control of land prices&mdash;the Minister has met us with inflammatory charges&mdash;this was communist propaganda.  This party had a private Bill in this House a few short months ago and the Minister's response to that particular motion can only be described as disgraceful.</P>

      <P>I am referring to a change of attitude on the Minister's part to suggestions made for improving the housing situation and I am suggesting that the Minister's attitude is wholly unsatisfactory.  The situation is far worse than he admits and he has given us no indication of a decisive change in his programme nor does he say that his attitude is in the least degree altered by the facts brought forward here by Opposition parties in <Col N="1917" /> relation to housing.  In those circumstances, it is only fair to cite the Minister's own responsibility for the shocking housing situation existing in Dublin and in the country and I have no hope, no confidence, in the Minister being serious about the housing situation in Dublin and the country.  I do not think the Minister can be moved rapidly enough from this job.</P>
      <P>I know these are serious charges but I think the Minister's record merits this comment.  Instead of a disposition to treat of criticism made in, let us say, a cordial spirit, to meet the critics, to look at the facts and to bring forward the legislation needed, what we have is intolerance on the part of the Minister, an attempt to label the critics, who justifiably say that the present housing situation is disgraceful, by the various epithets known best to the Minister.  But of course the day is long gone when that kind of scurrilous political response to charges of incompetence can be approved of by the people and we have throughout the campaign in Dublin South-West consistently heard condemnation by the people there of the housing situation in Dublin at the present time.  There is a veritable clamour in Dublin to get an improved housing programme I believe there is a contradiction between an improved housing programme and the continuation in power of the present Minister for Local Government.  I do not think he is interested in housing.</P>
      <P>I can state other things in other parts of the country on which the Minister considers himself far more fitted to comment.  We therefore see little hope on the evidence.  There is such a thing as a death bed repentance. I am not talking about an actual death bed repentance now; I do not wish the Minister any physical harm; I am talking about the Minister as a responsible Minister.  But, there is such a thing as a late repentance and I would earnestly exhort the Minister to repent, to repent of his past misdeeds in the matter of housing, the omissions which are his, the total lack of an effective response.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is need in housing for a crash <Col N="1918" /> programme and it is no use denigrating the motives of those who call for a step-up of the housing programme.  It is no use, it seems to me, labelling people as Reds and Trotskyites and using colourful epithets like that.  We must, if we are serious about the job, look at the actual situation and see what can be done.  As I suggested earlier, to reduce the pressure on the local authority for more accommodation requires action on a number of different fronts.  We would need to ensure that people could rent accommodation at cheaper rates so that in their early years a young married couple would have some possibility of saving.  This has been done in other countries without revolutionary change.  It can be done here.  We can control urban land prices and, as pointed out by Deputy Dr. FitzGerald in the debate on the last day, this has been done by the Unionists whom the Minister is forever criticising.  He can criticise the Unionists for other things but the Unionist Government can be described as revolutionary by comparison with Fianna Fáil in regard to housing.</P>

The Unionist administration under O'Neill and Chichester Clarke have shown better responsibility towards housing than has the Cabinet of Fianna Fáil in Dublin and I would commend to the Minister apart from the controversy surrounding it politically, the manner in which the Unionist Government in the North acquired land for Craigavon city.  I would commend that example to the Fianna Fáil Government in Dublin.  Deputy Dr. FitzGerald quite justifiably asked what constitutional obstacles there are to prevent us from acquiring land at a cheaper price, controlling the price of urban land.  What obstacles there are the Minister has not yet stated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy who intervened may not have this problem which is a very serious one in Dublin. Things may be more spacious in Tipperary North as there has been a steady exodus from there over the years and this would lessen the pressure on housing. As I say, this is a very serious problem in Dublin and the people will not be put off the steps which they see could improve the situation by hoary charges of State intervention or other charges of that kind.  Fianna Fáil innuendoes of that kind are not effective in the Dublin area.  They may be effective in areas such as Tipperary North but they are not in the crowded conditions of Dublin city.  If we are serious about the housing situation and reducing costs, seeing that sites are such a costly item and seeing their effects on the rates and rents which have to be paid for corporation houses, we must realise that there are certain obstacles to providing local authority housing accommodation.  One of these is cash, the money that must be <Col N="1920" /> invested in the project.  If we are interested in seeing that local authorities can provide houses at more reasonable rates then the community must take the responsibility of controlling the price of urban land which is needed for such houses.</P>
      <P>This is not a new concept because the practice of controlling the price of land which is needed for houses has been undertaken in other European countries, none of them behind that curtain which is so often referred to by Members opposite.  This procedure has been followed in the Craigavon scheme in the north and, as Deputy FitzGerald remarked, whatever else we may call the Unionist Government they are not a Government noted for their extreme socialist views.  Therefore I would urge the Minister to let us know in detail to which constitutional obstacles he refers and if there are real objections or obstacles perhaps he could include these in the package review of the Constitution which will give us votes at 18 about which his candidate is talking in Dublin South-West.</P>
      <P>Another serious matter in regard to housing is the rents situation.  As we have heard repeatedly a great deal of hardship is being caused by the Dublin Corporation's B scale scheme.  We can all accept and approve in theory the idea of differential rents but the application of the B scale scheme means that the income of every member of a family is taken into account in assessing the rent, even the incomes of sons and daughters who are preparing for marriage.  What we are doing is forcing the unfortunate tenant and his family to pay for out lack of courage in ensuring that housing costs are reduced.  If we are afraid of slogans, afraid of being called certain names and of taking the commonsense approach to the control of urban land prices then the unfortunate corporation tenant and the ratepayer must pay for that cowardice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be much fairer if, in assessing rent, we confined inspection to the income of the chief breadwinner, the husband, as it is he who is the tenant.  The income of other <Col N="1921" /> members of the family should not be taken into account.  After all, we tax them heavily enough through central taxation.  The basis of our endeavours should be to ensure that they could save enough to prevent them seeking corporation houses themselves.  As it is at present we penalise the whole family.  One could say that it would be just that overtime earnings or bonus payments and so on of the head of the family should not be included in the assessment of rent.  However, as it is, the income of the entire family is taken into account.  This is putting the official boot down heavily.</P>
    <P>The payment of Dublin Corporation rent is the cause of great hardship.  For example, a man does overtime or receives bonuses in his job and over a period such income is assessed and then one fine day at the end of three months he gets a bill for perhaps £30 or £40.  We know of nervous breakdowns and families breaking up, of attempted suicides&mdash;and the tenants' associations have referred to these matters&mdash;even in such model schemes as the Ballymun scheme.  In such cases you will find people living in fear of the corporation rents, of the increased cost of living, the cost of long journeys to and from their places of work.  There are people living on the verge of nervous breakdowns and it goes without saying that a state of near permanent mental disorder is the lot of very many people living in these houses in Dublin.  There are so many cases where people are cited as suffering from nervous disorders that it goes without saying that the medical officer, in practical terms, ignores all health factors which include mental disorder. So common is this malady in Dublin, connected as it is so intimately with the housing shortage, with the primitive living accommodation of so many families, that any cases the Dublin city medical officer gets include mentally depressed persons, and so common is that that their treatment will be ignored and turned down even though the medical officer may be convinced the person concerned is in a high state of nervous tension.  So severe and so common is this malady due to the housing shortage and to other inabilities <Col N="1922" /> that a person must be taken in as a permanent patient before this mental disorder is taken as a factor.</P>
    <P>There is inability to pay rent arrears which are calculated in backlogs of rent in the case of persons who pay rent week by week but who do some overtime or get some bonus in respect of which months later bills are issued for the extra amounts.  In economic terms we call for increased productivity and any manager in industry will tell you that it adds up to more efficiency if he gets more output per individual worker.  However, we call for higher productivity while we penalise such higher productivity excessively in the assessment of rents by the corporation and in the whole manner of the implementation of our rents policy.  The differential rents system is fair in theory and if it must operate it should exclude the members of a tenant's family who should be free to add to their savings or to make their own plans for the future.</P>
    <P>On the national level, houses in this country are old by any European standards.  We have a very high proportion of obsolescent houses.  Some of them are more than 100 years old. There are no exact figures but one wonders how out of date the data collected in the 1946 housing census is by application to today.  We cannot really give any convincing answer on this.  In 1946, of 662,000 private dwellings only 5 per cent had fixed baths and only 23 per cent had indoor lavatories.  I suppose we can assume that a higher proportion of the 160,000 units built since then have been serviced to permit the installation of indoor toilets and bathrooms.</P>
    <P>It would seem that a case can be made for a new census today which would give us our exact needs in the 1970s.  While the present housing shortage continues, I would say that we must continue to cut corners to meet demands.  If there is lack of housing, then our regulations are designed to ensure that as few people as possible qualify for housing.  That is the impasse: when we do not build sufficient houses our regulations lay down that as few people as possible qualify. Assuming that we can get more houses <Col N="1923" /> built, we must re-draw the waiting list of Dublin Corporation.  At present, so bad has the housing situation got that quite a number of people are taking the law into their own hands and are squatting in corporation property. There is no exact figure to go on but it seems to me from the situation I observe that the system of filling vacancies in the city is breaking down.  We must remember that young married couples with one child do not have any hope of being rehoused by Dublin Corporation.  There must be many such families taking over corporation property. I do not condone this.  It is all very well for me to say I do not condone it at a time when so many are living in intolerable conditions.</P>
    <P>Therefore, it seems to me that we must devise a new waiting list, a new system.  I suggest it should be according to a points system, a system which will take into account all the circumstances relating to all families' living conditions.  This would not increase the number on the waiting list.  Of course the only way to deal with this problem is to build more houses, but the review of the house allocation system I have in mind would ensure that needy families would be housed first.  This would mean a lot of hard work and it would take a long time to launch such a scheme.  There would have to be an interim period.  There are numerous families who have been on the list for years.</P>
    <P>It would mean expanding the corporation welfare department.  This department is under-staffed at the moment and it has not the prime role it should have under a local authority system which was tackling the housing problem properly.  At present an official may say: &ldquo;What is the use when we do not have sufficient houses to put the people into?&rdquo; That would be a fair enough reaction but it seems that in order to make an impression on the housing crisis we need a better staffed welfare department.  This department would need to work in close unison with the medical department and the housing allocation department.  Up to the moment the welfare department has been regarded as the poor relation <Col N="1924" /> of the other departments in the corporation.</P>
    <P>A crash housing programme is needed if we are to achieve any success in providing houses.  We need 25,000 new units a year and we are not getting them at present.  A whole host of reasons can be given for this failure to provide the required number of houses.  As the market appears to reign supreme in regard to private houses many people will be thrown back on the resources of the local authority. Health factors and problems of overcrowding are not taken into account when allocating houses because the houses simply are not available. Human misery will increase as long as no action is taken.</P>
    <P>We have had some successful schemes in Dublin but not enough.  It is regrettable that the Ballymun scheme, which is an admirable scheme, was built on the outskirts of the city because it means that the people living there have to travel long distances to work.  One constant, but small, complaint is the lift, which, appears to break down about once a month.  Many of the people living in Ballymun are not accustomed to living 16 storeys up and having to use a defective lift might well lead to neurosis.  Would the Minister inquire why the lift is always breaking down?</P>
    <P>The tenants in Ballymun are unable to control the heating in their own flats.  Deputy Dr. O'Donovan has pointed out to me that the heating in Leinster House is excessive, but at least we are not forced to come here and we can always leave with or without the help of the electorate, but the unfortunate people of Ballymun have no control over the heating system.  The Minister will probably say that the expenditure involved in giving individual control in each flat would be prohibitive, but even if control could be arranged floor by floor it would be some help.  I wonder whether, in common with many other things we do, modern blocks of flats in Europe were looked at prior to the building of the Ballymun flats.  I do not know which example Ballymun took after; it was probably the example of a county council estate in Britain <Col N="1925" /> built about ten years ago, but the heating system is intolerable.</P>
    <P>The other day I was talking to a man who lives in Ballymun and he said that he had taken his children to Drimnagh for Christmas and while they were there the children's complexions returned to normal.  Apparently, now that they have returned to Ballymun, their complexions are as pale as they were before Christmas. It may be some years before the Minister says that there is an adverse reaction to this kind of central heating but in the meantime some type of control over the heating system should be given to the tenants.</P>
    <P>The old people in the Summerhill area of my constituency are, for all practical purposes, forgotten people&mdash; they live in the basements.  They do not have much chance of being rescued from these dungeons&mdash;and dungeons is what they are known as&mdash;before they die.  I do not think old people should be segregated from the rest of the community but, while the housing shortage continues, we cannot afford the luxury of meeting the problem fairly and squarely.  Meanwhile, these forgotten people continue to live in appalling conditions.</P>
    <P>There is a complete lack of information about the corporation's housing policy.  I can never understand why the corporation cannot explain the situation more clearly so that people will know the facts about housing.  Every Wednesday morning people can go and find out where they stand in the housing queue.  As long as the overall housing position is inadequate the tales they hear from the officials will be gloomy.  I would welcome Dublin Corporation opening information offices where corporation tenants could obtain information because at present there is a complete lack of information.  The whole corporation housing programme is shrouded in controversy and mystery.</P>
    <P>We must seek out our own figures so as to calculate exactly how serious the situation will be in the years ahead. It seems pretty clear that none of us in this House, of any party, can see any solution of the housing crisis in Dublin over the next five to six years. <Col N="1926" /> There are no factors which will reduce the seriousness of the situation.  We now have Islandbridge, St. Michael's Estate, which is nearly complete, Dominick Street-Dorset Street and Ballybough.  After those, what else? The Kilbarrack and Coolock area? There is no major scheme of the size of the Ballymun scheme coming up. Therefore, representatives of all parties meeting their constituents when the facts of the situation are inquired about must more and more answer in the negative in the future.  In such a situation it is an indictment on all of us that in the kind of democratic system we operate more and more people may, regrettably, be forced to take the law into their own hands.</P>
    <P>It is a serious situation where the system cannot provide for such elementary things as housing accommodation and it is regrettable that the Minister is not a man in whom we can have any confidence.  He is not in fact interested in seriously facing up to the situation.  He does not appear to share any alarm.  His whole approach to criticism is to ignore it, to consider it purely a matter of political opportunism, that any criticism of the housing situation is made by political critics.  All of us know in our hearts, regrettably, that we can see no diminution of the housing crisis.</P>
    <P>Whatever other failings our system may suffer from, there is no reason why we should fail in the matter of providing housing.  It would require no revolutionary change in our system to improve the housing situation.  It might require a different order of priorities but that is all.  As long as we refuse to take the action necessary, as long as we ignore the problem, the protests will be intensified and more and more must we see action move into areas which have nothing to do with the parliamentary process.</P>
    <P>I hope that this serious matter of housing will be given some attention by the Minister when he comes to reply.  I hope we will not be treated to a repetition of previous replies of his, pointing to alleged deficiencies of Coalition Governments in the past. <Col N="1927" /> Those were so long ago that they are outside human memory.</P>

      <P>What we are interested in is what this Government proposes to do in the years which are left to it as a government.  There is adequate material for debate in the record of this Government from 1957 to 1970, 13 long years, and the sincerity and direction of this Government must be seriously suspect when one sees over that period a continuing decline in the number of houses built by local authorities.  It is no use meeting criticism by saying that that is a mark of economic prosperity.  I have made this point before.  Prosperity for whom?  There is no point in reiterating this fable of empty homesteads under Coalition Government and bustling population under Fianna Fáil Government to account for the failure to provide housing.  The demand is there. Why are we not meeting it at this particular time?  Why are we not building an increased number of local authority houses annually?  Why are we refusing to take action to control urban land prices?  Which vested interests are tying the Government's hands in this matter?  Those are questions people will continue to ask as long as the number of houses built each year declines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The people who suffer from this continued ineptitude and incompetence on the part of the Government are mainly the old and the young.  I see no clash at all between social investment in housing and investment in productive economic undertakings.  That false distinction has been made in the Second Programme and has influenced the attitude of planners under the First and Second Programme.  One of the failings of the Coalition Government, as they see it, was their obsession with social investment.  It is a healthy obsession and I see no contradiction or no distinction between social investment and economic or productive investment. Investment in houses, in the health of our people, is equally conducive to economic well-being.  Who is to say what the final cost to the community <Col N="1928" /> is in the matter of the health of our citizens, what it will take to bring them back to health and so on, of living as they do in such appalling conditions?</P>
    <P>I have not exaggerated the case because tenant organisations have adequate files on the matter.  There is serious financial anxiety caused by the implementation of rent scales especially the B scale rent.  The cost of living is continuously rocketing and people based long distances from work have to pay increased bus and travel fares, and so on.  Those are the people who will suffer as long as the official policy of ignoring the housing situation continues. More action is needed from the Minister for Local Government.  I hope in his reply to the debate the Minister will give us some sustenance, some grounds for hope that either he is leaving office, departing from that Ministry or at least bringing forward plans.</P>
    <P>Earlier in this debate I saw a certain incompatibility between the Minister continuing as Minister for Local Government and the possibility of increasing the number of houses built each year.  I hope the Minister's concluding statement will give us grounds for hoping that this incompatibility will no longer exist but I think the record proves that the Minister for Local Government is not interested in building more houses.  At least, the record suggests he is not interested.  There is no clash, therefore, between social investment and productive investment. They go hand in hand and the health of our citizens, suffering as it is under the appalling housing conditions, can finally be a bigger cost to the community than the matter of providing more houses.</P>

In fact I believe there is hardly any Deputy in any constituency who, not just now but at any time in the future, can say quite happily: &ldquo;We have no housing problem; we have solved our problems.&rdquo;  Of its nature, housing is a matter which will always call for new ideas to say the least, more dynamic approaches.  I could usefully contribute if I took some precise points which apply not just to North Tipperary.  Incidentally, may I say that our population has not been decreasing over the last few years although the population from the Labour Party point of view may have decreased considerably?</P>

      <P>Leave it at that now.  One cannot fail to notice throughout the rural areas&mdash;and I am sure the same applies to the Dublin areas but here I yield to the experience of the Dublin representatives&mdash;the many housing developments.  In recent years there has been a very healthy development in the provision of serviced sites for housing schemes.  In a very wide-ranging speech opening the debate, the Minister pointed out that the White Paper of 1969 proposed measures to secure the highest possible output within available resources.  We are all concerned about this matter.  The Minister outlined the provision of serviced sites as a priority.  There is often great delay in the ordinary course of private housing development.  For that reason urban authorities in recent times have themselves undertaken the provision of sites, the servicing of these sites and, equally important, the clearing and establishment of title which often causes quite a long delay.  I will comment on this aspect later.  I would ask the Minister to continue to promote and encourage this aspect of local <Col N="1930" /> authority housing.  Some people think that the more the State is involved the happier the environment, but I am not one of those.  I believe that the more people themselves work within the facilities given by the State the happier the environment.  It is for that reason I would prefer to see people building their own houses according to standards established by An Foras Forbartha or the Department.  This matter has been getting much attention in recent times.  If people built their own houses they would have the basic pride of ownership.</P>

      <P>I will endeavour to be precise now about housing development needs.  I do not wish to over-commend the Minister about what has been, in my view, a broad-based, well-established and well-researched speech on this matter.  I do not need to go on for a long time about the houses, the rents and the families. We all know the problems are there. Let us have precise proposals to deal with these problems.  Urban authorities are acquiring land which is, in itself, somewhat more expensive than what might be otherwise available to them.  They are moving out to the perimeter of the towns around which the population has developed.  They are having to provide new services and <Col N="1931" /> to open up the services outside the perimeter of each town, leaving inside a rotten core.  This core was originally the heartland of the whole area.  This move has become evident in many towns throughout the country.  In the towns the water and sewerage services, as well as the sites, are available.  I commend to the Department to tell the urban authorities not to set their sights to expansion outwards, to come back and renew the inside.  We should all concern ourselves with this problem. In most cases there is need for renewal of the inner core of the towns.  Many of our towns were built 150 years ago. Because of the better facilities being provided on the perimeter of towns people are realising that it is now time to move out.  Are we going to allow them to move out and to leave derelict sites in the centre of the towns?</P>
      <P>If the present trend continues unabated and our towns continue to expand in a circle costs will vastly increase.  It will lead to increased prices for building land.  There will be vast waste of the area within the towns. Anyone who travels on a railway in Ireland cannot have failed to notice the derelict wasteland behind the houses in every street in Ireland.  Our planners should give full attention to this.  They should consider the utilisation of existing space which is becoming derelict.  If I said nothing further in this debate but if what I have said reached a ready ear I should regard my contribution as having been reasonably effective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The sameness of local authority housing schemes was a matter for concern.  There has been a welcome change in this respect over recent years which has been encouraged by the Minister and his Department.  One meets this awful sameness in all local authority housing.  Not long ago I had what might otherwise have been the undiluted pleasure of walking along the banks of the Shannon in Limerick. If one faces County Clare one finds possibly one of the finest city views in any city in Europe.  The mountains of Clare are in the background with the sweep of the Shannon along the foot of the mountains.  On both sides of the <Col N="1932" /> Shannon there are local authority housing schemes.  One of these schemes is about the ugliest thing I have ever seen.  It is not important that it spoils the view&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is in Deputy Coughlan's constituency and this Deputy apparently is not being allowed to speak as much as he likes from those benches nowadays.  It happens to be in Deputy Coughlan's constituency but I merely used this site as an example. Scenery is not the important thing but it is important here, in Limerick, because is it possibly one of the best-equipped natural sites for housing development.  The housing development I am speaking of is possibly 25 years old.  I cannot imagine it is anything more than a ghetto.  It has this terrible sameness, this door-to-door togetherness, this gate-to-gate togetherness, with no concept of space, no change of style and no variety.  Surely we should not countenance such utter depredation of natural beauty?  This was built some years ago.  On other sites which may not be so favourably assisted by nature our chances of improving the vista are not in any way good.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am a bit disappointed that Deputy Conor Cruise-O'Brien did not come back in with the gang.  I was talking about variety in housing schemes.  I am particularly glad that the Minister and his Department, and An Foras Forbartha in conjunction with them, are now paying serious attention to this very important aspect of local authority housing.  It is vitally important that the concept of freedom, the concept of variety, the concept of the individual house being different from the house next door, should operate in local <Col N="1933" /> authority housing schemes as it does in private housing schemes.</P>
      <P>If we do no more from now on&mdash;and the signs are very encouraging from what the Minister has said and from the programmes that are under way&mdash;than to introduce this notion into our local authority programmes we will have gone a long way towards solving not just our housing problems but also the other problems so closely associated sometimes with congested housing development such as crime problems and social problems of one sort or another. The next time I walk down along the banks of the Shannon in Deputy O'Malley's or Deputy Coughlan's constituency I hope I will find that the places of beauty not only have not been spoiled by housing developments but enhanced by new housing developments.</P>
      <P>While I am quite sure it is a matter to which An Foras Forbartha are giving a lot of thought it does not strike me as being any problem for 100 different types of designs to be made available to the local authorities in introducing these new schemes.  Each of them could be implemented with the same type of fittings, the same standard fittings, the same type of equipment, but a different facial structure.  To me at least this does not seem to be beyond the wit of man, beyond the wit of architects or planners.  I hope that from now on we will be able to have that enlightened, active, shall I say happy, approach to housing and not the rather drab approach that has been a characteristic of our local authority development up to very recently.  In the past five years there have been signs of very healthy change.</P>
      <P>I welcome particularly the Minister's concern about standards.  I know little about this but I am told that we have about 150&mdash;may be 150,000 for all I know&mdash;different types of domestic plugs and sockets.  Of course, this sends up costs much more than if we had the standard types of plugs and sockets which are being so wisely and sensibly introduced and used in every other European country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I would do best by taking some precise points, because there are many Deputies here who are much more experienced than I am.  I intend neither to comment nor to olagón for an extended period.  The last matter I want to raise on housing arises out of the Minister's recent announcement that henceforth the grant house will be limited to 1,249 square feet.  I can see the reason for this.  As the Minister says, our job is to secure the highest possible output in areas of greatest need with our available resources.  The Minister said there will be provision for further grants for extensions to houses in certain cases.  I think he called them expandable houses.  Possibly that is what he means.</P>
      <P>Take the case of man with a large family.  If he needs to build a house in excess of 1,249 square feet, where does he now stand?  Will he be expected to come within that limit?  This is a very simple question.  Maybe I missed something in the Minister's speech and he and his advisers may think it is too naive a query.  In any event, it is clear that if he wants to expand subsequently the facilities and the grants will be there.  It is not clear what the position is if he wants to do it now.  If he has 12 children and cannot come within the 1,249 square feet limit, can we devise a system whereby he and others who need space right now will be exempted in some way from the restrictions which this new scheme will introduce?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Other than that I wholeheartedly commend the notion behind the Minister's approach.  Housing is a need for all the community and our job is to ensure that those who cannot provide it for themselves get it.  We must be realistic enough to say that this may mean that some people&mdash;indeed many of ourselves in this House who have hitherto had the benefit of grants <Col N="1935" /> and loans for local authority houses&mdash; will have to give up those grants and loans so that more can be made available to those who need more.</P>
    <P>I want to make one final comment and it is not directly a matter of housing but has a very definite effect on the housing programme.  Every time a new site is bought anywhere in Ireland, and particularly in rural Ireland, the Land Registry have to draw up a new folio.  This means that the Land Registry have to plan a new map in respect of that folio.  This causes more delay than if I go over and buy all of Paddy Ryan's property holus-bolus because all that is involved is changing Paddy Ryan's name and putting my name on the folio but if I buy a portion of his property his map must be amended and a new map must be drawn up for me and a new folio.  I know from my own knowledge that with all the site development going on around the country, with the pressure on housing space and the pressure for housing development, the biggest delay we have to face in every case&mdash;particularly in relation to people looking for loans from local authorities who cannot get them until the places are in their own name&mdash;is the delay experienced in the Land Registry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is 12 months in some cases.  This does not come directly under the aegis of the Minister but I know it is a matter of concern to him. Something will have to be done in that section because, through no fault of the officers there, it is holding up the housing programme throughout the country.  Many people who are given the benefit of loans from the Agricultural Credit Corporation at certain rates, or from local authorities at different rates, have to wait a further 12 months when different rates of loans or different rates of interest apply.  I hope that those concerned will get their heads together and that someone will find a different way of dealing with these maps or new folios.  Perhaps there could be some kind of temporary folio or temporary map, thereby allowing <Col N="1936" /> the applicant to go ahead with the building of his house.</P>
      <P>I want to deal now with some isolated matters which have no relation to each other or to what I have been saying on housing but are matters which warrant some comment.  The Minister indicated in the course of his speech that the group water schemes throughout the country are expanding both in numbers and in nature.  From my own experience in North Tipperary I can confirm this.</P>
      <P>One of the great attractions of this scheme obviously is that it helps people to help themselves.  The advice and assistance will come from the local authorities and from the departmental inspectors but the onus is on the local people to start the scheme and to raise their shares of the money.  This scheme has been entirely successful in North Tipperary and, I am sure, in every other constituency.  However, as the Minister says, the inspectors involved are working to the limit of their capacity.  Therefore I am glad more inspectors will be appointed because more will be needed.  We in North Tipperary, Limerick and Kerry will be continuing this demand, and I should like to make a plea in this connection to some Deputies who are members of local authorities.  A habit has grown up of seeking up-to-date reports of the 50 or 60 group water schemes at a particular time.  By the time these reports come in and by the time the inspector is obliged to prepare these reports for the meetings, they are out of date, in the first instance; they take up his time, in the second instance; and, thirdly, they cause a great deal of comment which at the time is not at all relevant.  Therefore I would ask Deputies who are members of local authorities where this kind of thing is happening to advise them: &ldquo;This report will not have any effect because by the time we get it it will be three months out of date and it will interfere with the work of the inspector.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am particularly glad the Minister said that new and more stringent regulations will be introduced for the control of pollution from vehicles and so on, particularly in or around <Col N="1937" /> Dublin.  Since I came into this House one of my greatest concerns has been to see our environment in this city being spoiled by, amongst others, State sponsored bodies.  I should like the Minister to ensure, apart from anything else, that there is an adequate pollution control scheme.  It is no use saying the regulations are there.  I know they are there but I can see within a short walk of the Four Courts any day chimneys belching out poison all over the city.  Out on the dual carriageway near Baldonnel where there is a marvellous view of Dublin one can see poisonous fumes all over the place.  We cannot live in a vacuum but we can do a little better than we are doing.  I am not convinced that there are enough inspectors, prosecutors or whoever should deal with this to ensure that the matter is dealt with properly.  There is a certain road construction company and every time one of their trucks passes it leaves a trail of poisonous gas in its wake which is dangerous for traffic and dangerous for health and the environment.  When these new regulations have been introduced I hope some time in the near future to be able to ask the Minister, because this could be the test, how many prosecutions there have been and what has been the result of these prosecutions. I would also hope that prosecutions would decline each year.  There is no point in saying to the Irish people: &ldquo;Please do.&rdquo;  This is something we must learn the hard way.  We shall have to be forced to do it.  It may be that, equally important as the appointment of traffic wardens, will be the appointment of anti-pollution wardens and the sooner they are appointed throughout the country the better for all of us.</P>
    <P>The swimming pool is a facility which ought to be extended throughout the country.  My town, Nenagh, is very fortunate in that, while we have the Shannon and some other rivers at our door, a swimming pool was provided by local effort over 40 years ago.  Other areas which do not even have the Shannon or adjoining rivers are apparently only now becoming aware of the facility of a swimming <Col N="1938" /> pool.  Apart from calling on the Minister and his Department for assistance in the provision of a swimming pool people had better be aware of the fact that it will cost a great deal of energy, dedication and interest to maintain it.  It is not enough for the Department to give a grant of even 95 per cent.  The important thing is in ten years time, when perhaps those who are interested in the swimming pool will have disappeared from the scene there will be another team to ensure continuity in the maintenance of the swimming pool programme.  Even in Nenagh, where the pool was provided by local effort without any grant, we had problems up to recently in maintaining this pool in the manner in which we would like.</P>
    <P>Apart from that, where the local response is significant enough to warrant a response from the Department, I would commend the further extension of the swimming pool programme.  I am reminded of what the late Deputy Donogh O'Malley said when he was Minister for Health and when there was something of a housing problem: &ldquo;Maybe if you give Blaney the houses I won't need the hospitals.&rdquo;  The same could equally truly be said in regard to swimming pools.  If we give the Minister the swimming pools we may not need the hospitals.  I am told by experts that swimming is a very healthy and natural exercise.  If children are encouraged to swim it may eradicate problems that arise in later years for so many people.</P>
    <P>I was particularly gratified to hear the Minister talk about the planning programme being undertaken by his Department in conjunction with An Foras Forbartha.  Planning is one of the most important matters for this country at present.  There are fewer of us in Ireland per square foot than there are in any other country in Europe and possibly than in most other countries in the world.  So far we have not planned our environment as we should. I am glad to hear this is being done in conjunction with the local authorities and An Foras Forbartha.  In Clare, Limerick and North Tipperary they are not just planning in isolation as far as industry and tourism are concerned <Col N="1939" /> but are getting together to plan in conjunction with one another in relation to urban and local authority matters, so that there will be uniformity of design and so that the best use will be made of the available resources.</P>
    <P>I am glad to hear of the extension of the programme for research and scholarship and the advisory programme which will be made available to local authorities.  Up to the present, as was mentioned in the Devlin Report on the State services, and which is equally true of the local authority service, I fear these authorities are not as effective as they might be as planning authorities in the widest sense, as positive programming authorities, not there just to administer schemes and say who is qualified for housing and who is not, and to build roads where necessary but there as planning authorities in the fullest sense, concerned, for instance, about something I have already mentioned, the general decay of town centres.  They should be concerned about the nature of services provided in certain areas and could exchange ideas with each other.  Indications from the Minister's review of what has been done and what is proposed are very encouraging.  Anything done in that connection will add to the effectiveness of local authorities in any development they undertake.</P>
    <P>One matter that has caused concern &mdash;this is in connection with the road programme&mdash;is the problem one has in acquiring rights of way&mdash;for want of a better term&mdash;along the roadside when a new road programme arises. Last year I had the opportunity of entertaining some American friends. They were impressed by our expansion in every way.  They happened to be from Missouri.  They pointed out that if we do not do something about our national roads particularly, we will have a major problem.  They also pointed out&mdash;and this was a practical matter which they had experienced at home&mdash;that if we do not acquire the rights of way along the roads it will be much more expensive to do so in five years time when the plan is ready.</P>
    <P>Now is the time to acquire those <Col N="1940" /> rights of way.  If we wait two years before building a road, somebody will build a house, a factory, a store or even a petrol station along the road and when we come to acquire it we do not acquire the land only but must also acquire and compensate for the house, the factory, the store and the petrol station.  We may have further troubles through not being able to clear up the titles.  This is evidently happening throughout the country at present.  I saw a case where one cottage held up a major road programme.  It is only proper that a person's home is his palace but it is strange that a major programme could be held up in this way in&mdash;I think&mdash;County Kildare of County Laois.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>It could have happened there also or anywhere else. Danger of delay should be countered in advance of the road programme itself.  I know there is a problem and that we cannot go about buying up all land adjoining the roads now: the money is not there but if we could enter into some scheme of loans for local authorities to buy well in advance of the road programme we would have done a very good day's work and, in the long run, would save local authorities considerable expense.</P>
      <P>There is great need for further extension of our national primary road system as it is now being called.  Even the ancient Romans realised that a good road network was the first basic element in expansion and effective development. The Americans have also realised it and surely we, who are concerned, as we are, about reaching the hinterland of rural Ireland and making it available to us wherever we may be, about closing the gap between rural Ireland and the cities so that they will not seem to be divorced from where the action is, so to speak, must ensure that the road programme is continued as rapidly as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One often hears discussions about the Buchanan Report and whether we should build regional development centres or, on the other hand, build up small industries in certain rural areas <Col N="1941" /> or in small towns.  To me there is not necessarily a conflict here.  Provided we have a good road network&mdash;we have done a magnificent amount of work in recent years but we are a long way from our goal&mdash;distance will not be the obstacle; it will just be a matter of time.  Castlebar will not be whatever it is, say 20 miles, from Claremorris but, say, 20 minutes.  This is the important thing.  We shall not then have any worries about rural Ireland being denuded.  People are coming into Dublin from places like Carrickmines and Foxrock and it takes them three-quarters of an hour to get to work sometimes.  If you are 20 miles from the town in which you work and if you can get there in 20 minutes or half an hour, so much the better; you have the benefit of both worlds.  You live and work in rural Ireland and can enjoy a happy drive to and from work.</P>
    <P>This is asking a lot now but I hope when the national primary road system is introduced, the new road programme the Minister has promised&mdash;and which apparently has been widely commended by international experts&mdash;the Government will give this matter full consideration.  The new road authority will also do away with the lack of consistency in road standards in various parts of this small island.  Is anything so ludicrous as that in a country so small we should have different types of road surfaces and different road contours in different counties? Is there anything so dangerous as to have in one county a huge open road which has recently been provided and when you come to the county boundary you find a bottleneck?  This makes no sense at present but it has made sense for too long.  I hope the first thing the national road concern&mdash;I forget its title &mdash;will undertake is an absolute standardisation of road widths, contours and matters of that kind so that we can all go our way more safely.</P>
    <P>It is splendid to find on some newly-opened roads, travelling, for instance, from Dublin to Limerick, the excellent work that has been done in providing definition lines along the roadside and it is also wonderful to find along the margins of these roads, <Col N="1942" /> standards inside the actual road surface, which light up almost like an airport runway when one drives along the road at night.  It is absolutely essential nowadays to have these standards and definition lines and these marginal lights&mdash;for want of a better term.  These are the only things that give a driver reasonable security and precise vision when driving at night.</P>
    <P>This has been done to a great extent in many parts of the country.  It is significant that it has been done and also significant that it has not been done in so many other parts.  When a local authority or the new national road authority repair or extend roads they should as a first priority establish and construct definition lines at the side of the road to let the driver know where the road ends and the ditch begins.  Then, as soon as possible, they should put down whatever reflector lights are needed both in the middle of the road and on the sides of the actual road surface.</P>
    <P>We need much more standardisation of road surfaces and travelling conditions. I have been greatly encouraged by the Minister's awareness of this problem, and by what has been done already and I am sure that work of the kind already done will be continued and carried out more speedily.</P>
    <P>My penultimate point is in connection with night travelling and night traffic accidents.  I have had occasion to defend professionally people charged with dangerous driving causing death. I have seen death caused where it might have been averted.  I say &ldquo;might&rdquo; because one cannot say in any one case that it would have been averted. If a car breaks down at night or if there is an accident on the road it is likely that the lights were failing.  The lights may fail completely or they may not be sufficient.  The gardaí are called. I have nothing but praise and commendation for these men.  They try to clear the road of traffic.  They may have lights or they may not.  We all know the things a referee should carry on to the field&mdash;a whistle, a pencil, a piece of paper and so on.  A guard going to the scene of a traffic accident should have not only a pencil, a notebook, a <Col N="1943" /> measuring tape and possibly a flashlight, but also what each driver should have, a triangle.  The Minister's advisers are better equipped in this than I am but I feel the gardaí should have some kind of self-pulsating lights that they could leave on the road to show the public that there is an accident. They should have reflectors, even armband reflectors, for all concerned.  I do not think this would incur very much expense but it could save lives and prevent injury.  If it saved four or five lives or, perhaps, ten serious injuries it would certainly warrant consideration and introduction.</P>
    <P>The gardaí should also possibly have breakdown equipment.  We are rather unique in this country in that we have only one type of policeman, the policeman who does everything, from investigating crime to looking after traffic.  In most other countries there are traffic police and then other police.  This applies to Italy, France, Germany, America and even England. We must give serious consideration to introducing a second type here also. We need traffic police properly equipped.  We need traffic police with the equipment I have been talking about.  Last Friday on the way home from this House on a dangerous junction at Clondalkin my car broke down. I could do nothing about it and I could get no garage mechanic, because they were all going to their tea, to help me. All I could do was block the traffic until such time as a very concerned driver came and drove me back into the city and we got somebody there to take my car out of the way.  One should not have to rely on the civic concern of a person like that.  We should have, particularly on our main arterial roads, traffic police who would ensure, with this equipment, at nighttime and at other times that our roads are kept free and that an accident will not be the cause of another accident, as happens from time to time.  These police might possibly serve the dual function that I mentioned, that of pollution control police.</P>
    <P>I promised when I started that I would not delay the House with generalisations.  From my point of view <Col N="1944" /> the Minister's review was such a wide and deeply researched speech which gives such hope that it would be wrong for me or anybody else to try to cover the range of all that he said.  I hope these few precise comments may add something to his consideration.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that there will be a review of the structure of local government.  At this time I do not want to say anything more about that.  I would gladly welcome such a review. I think it is long overdue and when the Minister gets that review before this House I will be glad to talk on it again.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make a few general remarks and then say a few words about my own constituency.</P>
      <P>In the course of this discussion there has been a great deal of talk about housing, particularly by Deputies from city constituencies or adjacent areas. Some statistics have been quoted beginning with those quoted by the Minister. I do not want to add much to the figures that have been quoted nor to try to make special points from comparisons between one set of figures and another.  In the main, the housing programme in the last ten or 15 years has had two or three significant changes.  Fifteen years ago the number of houses built by the local authorities and by people availing of State grants was slightly less than the total figure which the Minister gave for last year. In the meantime, the number of houses built dropped very considerably in some years and then in recent years showed a rise culminating in the figure for last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The usual approach to this matter is to compare the figures for the inter-Party Government period with the figures for the subsequent Fianna Fáil years.  The Minister then quoted the figures for last year to show that an improvement had taken place.  No one of these sets of figures, other than the actual number of houses built, compares like with like in the sense that whatever number of houses were being built 12, 14 or 15 years ago and whatever number are being built at present, particularly so far as the Dublin area is concerned, each fails to take account <Col N="1945" /> of the substantial growth in the population and expansion of the Dublin area.  It is to focus attention on that aspect of the problem I want to say a few words this evening.</P>
    <P>I do not think people are impressed, no matter what their political views, by Deputies of one party or another quoting figures to show that at a particular period one Government or one Minister or even different local authorities constructed this or that number of houses.  The problem that exists at present and the one I feel we have to face and take major decisions on is to establish an effective order of priorities in respect of housing.  For many years the problem for one reason or another did not present itself in an acute form because sufficient resources were available for housing and for other construction work but there is now, particularly in the Dublin area and contiguous areas like Dún Laoghaire and in some other cities and towns, a housing problem.  Unless we establish a clear set of priorities and decide what amount of public capital will be available for the housing programme it is inevitable that the capital available as well as the supply of land for housing will be in competition with the money and land available for other purposes.</P>
    <P>I do not suggest it is an easy problem to solve; the capital problem is one aspect and the availability of land and the price for which it can be purchased are other aspects.  We have never taken a major definite decision to differentiate between the two.  Undoubtedly in last year's Budget certain changes in taxation were made designed to deter office blocks and blocks of buildings being constructed for purposes other than housing.  The Minister dealt at length in the course of his speech with the constitutional, legal and other difficulties involved in any form of compulsory acquisition. There are difficulties in restricting by legislation the use of land but some <i>modus vivendi</i> should be possible.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested here that State and local authority control, as advocated by some Labour speakers, is the solution.  I do not know if this is so.  I think it would be contrary to the <Col N="1946" /> accepted attitudes that have been adopted here and, possibly, contrary to the Constitution to try to operate that.  In Norway a licensing system operates in regard to construction that ensures whatever construction activity the economy can support is directed into fields of priority importance.  No real attempt has been made here to define priorities in regard to building. There is a notional acceptance by the Dáil and possibly by the Department of Local Government and local authorities that housing has priority but in actual practice so far as acquisition and availability of capital are concerned&mdash;and this brings into the field of public discussion the matter that has been referred to here&mdash;unless there are some restrictions either by means of taxation, by the provision of a licensing requirement or some other method, large commercial undertakings, whether insurance companies, office block promoters or property developers will be in a better position to secure capital much more readily than the ordinary private builder.  Without the assistance and support of the State the private builder and even the local authority who erect houses cannot continue with this work.</P>
    <P>Therefore, we must face up to the decisions involved&mdash;either to restrict by the application of some form of licensing system in certain defined areas or, alternatively, the imposition by means similar to those introduced in last year's Budget of some increase in taxation or some form of added burden that will deter people from engaging in forms of building other than housing.  Undoubtedly the owners of sites are entitled to receive the market value and fair compensation for disturbance but the community should not be expected to pay grossly inflated prices which some speculators and people who happen to be in the right place at the right time manage to secure.  Sums of money should be available for building houses instead of being siphoned off to a great extent for construction purposes other than housing.</P>
    <P>In that regard we must take a number of decisions in respect of the matters referred to in the Devlin <Col N="1947" /> Report.  For a number of years we have advocated, and the Devlin Report reinforces this, that decisions must be taken in respect of different aspects of local authority affairs.  One matter referred to by the last speaker was the question of a national highway authority under which uniform standards would apply and which would be financed as a national concern. The other aspect is the question of rates reform to which I shall refer later but so far as the question of local administration is concerned I know the Minister has announced his intention of publishing a White Paper on the matter.</P>
    <P>Some of the comments of the Devlin Report on the Department of Local Government were not merely interesting but enlightening.  The report said that the Department was holding on to excessive central control over local authorities which resulted in delay and duplication, frustration of initiative and complications in long-range planning. The report further said that the model to aim at might be the degree of operational discretion given to the noncommercial State-sponsored bodies which would become executive units under its proposals.  These points were mentioned on page 273 of the Devlin Report.  The report also stated something with which I am sure Deputies, who are members of local authorities, would agree&mdash;that the degree of control exercised by the Department, either for traditional reasons or because of certain legislative provisions, is in many respects not merely intolerable but frustrating and unnecessary.  The report refers to certain major questions that are of sufficient importance to warrant reference in the report.</P>
    <P>I want to reinforce my argument with some smaller examples.  The report says that &ldquo;Block samples could be substituted for detailed financial and technical control of individual projects. Control systems involving duplication of approval for individual schemes should be eliminated when general approval has already been given.  When technical controls are abandoned the Department should establish standards to which local authorities should be expected to <Col N="1948" /> adhere.&rdquo;  Now this reference in the Devlin Report can be reinforced in a variety of ways.</P>
    <P>In my constituency I have had experience of schemes submitted after they had been prepared by qualified technical officers&mdash;architects, engineers, planners and so on&mdash;and, as a result of departmental action, changes were made in these schemes.  In one scheme covering 100 to 120 houses the scheme was cut in half; a modified scheme was proceeded with and, before that modified scheme was properly finished, the county council had to go back to the Department and the Department had to revise its earlier attitude and sanction the scheme as originally planned. The scheme, of course, was done in two halves, with some minor variation.</P>
    <P>Even in relatively minor matters the position is that, as the Department functions at present, traffic control lights cannot be erected by a local authority unless they are approved and sanctioned by the Department.  Surely the people properly qualified to deal with such a matter are those directly concerned, those who are familiar with the situation and who have available to them the same statistics as the Department have?  Surely the erection of traffic lights should be left to their discretion?  If they are not competent to deal with a matter like this then the power should be taken away from them altogether.  The degree of control exercised by the Department in relatively minor matters is unbelievable. This is accepted because it has been the practice over the years.</P>
    <P>I want now to refer to particular matters affecting my constituency. Some of these matters are peculiar to constituencies on the fringe of Dublin. They are problems almost solely of areas in which there has been substantial housing development.  A number of estates have been developed and the houses on them are occupied in the main by people who take advantage of the small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts.  In a great many instances these estates have for years remained unfinished. The occupiers are liable for rates.  I, in common with other Deputies, have for years been attending meetings of residents' associations.  The <Col N="1949" /> people are not merely exasperated and frustrated but annoyed and sore in that the only service made available to them is the provision of scavenging facilities.  No other service is provided in most cases.</P>
    <P>These estates have been finished or almost finished for a number of years. Because of the failure of the particular builder involved to complete the work to the satisfaction of the local authority the normal services, such as lighting, adequate pathways, and so on, are not provided.  The places concerned range from Glenageary to Deansgrange, Foxrock, Stillorgan, Leopardstown, Clonkeen.  This is a vast area adjacent to Dún Laoghaire; most of it is in the Rathdown part of the constituency and some of it is in Dún Laoghaire Borough.  In most cases, because of the developers accepting responsibility only for the provision of roads&mdash;in some cases they provide nothing at all&mdash;the facilities and services in a great number of new housing estates are decidedly substandard.  The residents feel aggrieved because they maintain the planning system, as operated, can be used to prevent the occupier of a house building a garage, a room or a couple of rooms on to his house while the developers and builders are not required to do their work to a proper standard.  These occupiers are liable for rates.</P>
    <P>There is a definite gap between the enforcement by the local authority of the requirements they specify and the actual completion of the work by the builder or developer.  Occupiers have been in occupation of their houses for periods of from three to five years&mdash;in some cases it has been ten to 15 years &mdash;paying rates, sometimes full rates, and the only service they get in return is the scavenging service.  They get no other service to which, as ratepayers, they are entitled.  I urge the Minister and his Department to use whatever powers are available to them to get some action in respect of this very important matter.  One of the phrases used in the Buchanan Report was that planning must be positive, not merely preventive, and it adverted to the danger of excessive central controls.  It is in a matter of this kind, I think, their <Col N="1950" /> comments apply.  People who want to erect a garage or add on a couple of rooms to a house find they must comply with a whole set of requirements laid down by the planning authority.</P>
    <P>In this regard it is only right to say that the planning officers do their best. We have been largely unequipped to deal with planning.  I agree with some of Deputy O'Kennedy's comments to the effect that this is a new field and we have lagged behind; because the number of people to the square foot or the square yard is probably the lowest in Europe we have not paid a great deal of attention to the matter.  Certainly, so far as the Dublin areas are concerned, and this includes Dún Laoghaire and all the fringe areas, planning problems are presenting difficulties and, indeed, serious annoyance for many people.  When many people wish to have a small matter attended to, or a decision taken in regard to a relatively small question, they find the forms that have to be signed in order to comply with the requirements are considerable.  They look at the area in which they live and they consider that the planning authority&mdash;using the term in its broadest possible sense&mdash;or the local authority responsible for operating the Planning Act have failed to provide the ordinary standard services to which ratepayers and those who have made a considerable investment in houses in respect of loan charges and so on, are entitled and, naturally, they feel that this is a sphere of local authority administration in which action is required quickly.</P>
    <P>A criticism made at a recent meeting at which I was present was in regard to local authority schemes.  In most cases such schemes involve a small number of houses but whether the number is small or large the scheme will be completed and the services provided by the local authority; if they are not, the tenants and occupiers would rightly complain.  However, where the scheme is built partly by one builder and partly by another, or, perhaps, by a number of other builders, in some cases an annoying situation develops.  In one particular case I have in mind, in which some <Col N="1951" /> non-local firms were involved, they made laneways at the back of the scheme and they assigned these to a man of straw so that they would not have to maintain the laneways.  That sort of non-social activity should be the subject of action not only by the local authority but by the Minister and his Department in order to ensure that where facilities are provided for developers of that kind, the tenants and occupiers are entitled to the services by reason not only of their investment but also by reason of their contribution as ratepayers.  Failure to provide these services and the delay in finishing estates has caused strong feeling among the people concerned.  This applies to a number of areas which I mentioned but in the main this is an urban or semi-urban problem.  It is not a problem which exists to any great extent in any other part of the country although I suppose it can exist.  It applies particularly to my constituency, Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown and also to the Minister's constituency and certain other areas in which there has been development on the fringes of the old urban area.</P>
    <P>I want to advert now to a matter raised in the Buchanan Report in regard to regional development.  This is a matter to which sufficient attention is not being paid.  A number of years ago, and on a number of occasions since, I mentioned here the desirability of regional development in certain areas.  Two places which often struck me as being suitable for this type of development were Limerick and Ennis. While the theoretical idea behind providing employment in Shannon, in the sense of making up for the drop or possible drop in employment due to technical aeronautical development, seems attractive enough, nevertheless, the need to provide all the ancillary services and facilities emphasises the value of employing or utilising the facilities and services already in existence in places like Limerick and Ennis.</P>
    <P>One of the situations that has developed in the Dublin area, and even in places like Dún Laoghaire, is that in many of the older parts the populations have had to be transferred, <Col N="1952" /> because of the age of their houses, to new housing schemes and this has meant that many of those old areas have become derelict and denuded of buildings.  Undoubtedly, there is a strong case on economic grounds and even on sentimental grounds for a redevelopment of those areas and for the erection of schemes of houses or flats in them.  Most of the residents of those areas would prefer to remain in them if it is possible to have adequate facilities either in houses or in flats In that connection most people prefer schemes which would be much lower than in the case of the Ballymun scheme.  In some of the schemes provided in places like Church Street, of those being built off Dorset Street and around Dominick Street, and in my own constituency, one finds that blocks of flats of three or four storeys are more popular with the tenants and in many cases are more satisfactory from every point of view.</P>
    <P>These are major planning and policy decisions inherent in two reports which must be the subject of serious consideration and decision before a national planning scheme can be operated.  I do not think there is any real conflict here; certainly, some conflict of interest may arise in certain cases as between one town and another but, as major centres of development are decided upon, for many reasons it may well result in general development in the area concerned.</P>
    <P>I want to refer also to one matter which I have raised here before, the question of the fire-fighting services. Some years ago there was a very bad fire in my constituency in which the Dún Laoghaire church was burnt out. It was most fortunate for everybody concerned that it happened in the day-time. It was fortunate also that it did not happen in a multi-storey building in which people were living.</P>
    <P>Everybody realises that faced with modern developments our fire services are not adequate if put to the test. This is not a reflection on the personnel of the fire-fighting service, who are well trained and who apply themselves with energy and in many cases with considerable bravery and skill to the tasks they have to deal with and the consequential work needed to be done, <Col N="1953" /> but the facilities and the equipment are by no means adequate.  Therefore, I was glad to hear that certain proposals have been made to Dún Laoghaire Corporation to provide more up to date and better facilities in the town.</P>
    <P>That brings me to the question of the problems facing the fringe areas, the main one being that of water supplies. With the development of a number of estates in the extremity of the area, not only at peak periods but at other periods when they should reasonably hope for adequate water supplies, the residents find the pressure is not sufficient. I should be glad to hear from the Minister what prospects there are and what plans for a general improvement in water supplies for domestic and other purposes.  Many of the areas I have been speaking about are in my constituency but in other parts of the city that I am aware of this problem has presented itself, more acutely in areas in which elevation and building development happen to coincide.</P>
    <P>I should like to deal with some other problems in relation to my constituency. One has arisen because of modern development, the increase in car population.  It relates to the necessity to provide underpasses on many thoroughfares.  Sanction has been given in respect of the provision of an underpass at Williamstown, Blackrock, but it is obvious that with the advent of more and more cars at higher speeds a number of underpasses will have to be provided.  Otherwise it will be necessary to hold up traffic for greater periods in order to let people pass across the roads.  Therefore I urge that sufficient underpasses be provided on main thoroughfares.</P>
    <P>An area of particular concern in this respect is Stillorgan village.  The present intention is that portion of this village will form the dual carriageway between Dublin and Bray.  When this carriageway was planned originally the bulk of the village was on one side. Then there was private development and houses were constructed.  Then the county council built a housing scheme there.  In this respect I wish to advert critically once more to the fact that this scheme of 100 houses was reduced by the Department and eventually <Col N="1954" /> when the scheme was built it was done in two parts, houses being built on both sides of the road.  Even now, before the construction of the dual carriageway, people find difficulty in crossing the road.  Large numbers of children and many older people find it impossible to cross.  At the moment traffic is controlled there by one set of traffic lights and, because of the length of the village and of the frontage of the housing schemes, people have to walk long distances before getting to the lights.  I therefore urge that when the plans for the dual carriageway are being sanctioned the Minister will ensure there is provision for underpasses.  The same applies to other villages, but Stillorgan is now the largest village from the point of view of distance between point of entry and point of exit from the village.</P>
    <P>Recently, a question was raised in the House about the proposed ready-mix plant at Newtownpark, Blackrock. I wish to reinforce what was said during a discussion on a Parliamentary question tabled by other Deputies and me. The original plant in Blackrock was a concrete block one.  It is on a site adjacent to a school known as the Kingstown and Avoca School.  There is also a scheme of houses there.  It is proposed that the plant be reconstructed or altered in order to be used as a liquid concrete plant.  The residents and the people in charge of the school, as well as the pupils, but the residents more strongly than anybody, object most strenuously to this alteration which increases considerably the nuisance created by the plant.  The user will be changed to such an extent that a definite nuisance will be created with a possible hazard to health and a definite hazard as far as convenience is concerned.  I suggest that the Minister and his advisers examine carefully the whole question before allowing any development which would conflict with the interests of residents.</P>
    <P>In connection with the whole question of financing local services, I think the time has come to operate a system other than the rates.  I am not suggesting for one moment that the services, such as housing, sewerage, water, light and so on, which local authorities have to provide could be provided without <Col N="1955" /> finances.  All these services cost money and they will cost more money in the future.</P>
    <P>There are two major defects in the present system.  The first concerns the health service, which is providing an inequitable system with rising costs. It should be based on insurance, but that, possibly, is a matter outside the Minister's Department.  The second is that the rating system itself is inequitable, because it takes no account of capacity to pay.  In the last year or so a nominal system of waiver of rates has been adopted, but no one regards this system as satisfactory.  It is hardly in operation at all in some cases.  However, the fact that it was introduced is recognition of the inequities of the present rating system.  People are liable for contributions in other forms of taxation either because of their income and their capacity to pay or because they commit themselves of their own volition to spending money on a particular commodity which is taxable.</P>
    <P>The present rating system does not come under either of these headings. Whether one is an old age pensioner, a pensioner of any kind, a person in full health earning a substantial salary or engaged in business, the rate liability depends entirely on the valuation of the house&mdash;apart from a minor change which was made in relation to some old people recently.  Whatever merits and advantages existed under the old system&mdash;and there were probably quite a few&mdash;that system is no longer capable of financing schemes which, in many cases, are national in their application rather than local.  In most cases they are local in the sense that a particular district or local authority is responsible for them but the standards laid down are national in their uniformity and apply nationally.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the deplorable increase in vandalism.  The damage done to public buildings, telephone kiosks, public toilets and so on and the amount of refuse which is piled on the roads in and around our city illustrates an attitude of mind which must be deplored.  Consideration should be given to the introduction of penalties enforceable against those members of our community who engage in this <Col N="1956" /> sort of thing.  In co-operation with the Department of Education, instruction in these matters should be given to our young people.  In large centres of population local authorities should facilitate the public by providing dumps as well as adequate receptacles for this refuse so that the situation will not deteriorate and the environment will not be disfigured by this refuse.</P>
    <P>Decisions must be taken in relation to the establishing of priorities in housing and rates, and the recommendations made in the Devlin and Buchanan Reports.  Some form of penalty should be brought in enforceable by county councils and the Department of Local Government to ensure that developers will leave housing estates properly finished once residents go into occupation so that when people become liable for rates they should be in receipt of services.  I know this is a matter of less general application but it is of vital concern and anxiety to residents in constituencies like my own where new housing estates are being built.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Estimate for the Department of Local Government has taken quite a considerable time and I feel it will probably take quite a lot longer.  The Minister for Local Government is responsible for making decisions which vitally affect the daily life of every citizen in this country. The Department covers a wide range of matters of tremendous importance to the people.  Numbers of new dwellings have been erected&mdash;we have heard a lot about it from the Government benches&mdash;Ballymun estate has provided us with certain unique difficulties. Although they have to an extent helped to solve a very great problem, they have created new difficulties.  This is something of which the Minister and indeed all of us should be aware, and we should do our utmost to make provision for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Ballymun we have these high rise flats.  A number of problems have been referred to by some Deputies. One of the major problems for the people living in Ballymun, and the vast majority of them are people with young families, is the problem: &ldquo;How do you allow your child of very tender <Col N="1957" /> years out of the flat which can be up to 13 or 14 storeys high and down into an area to play?  You have lost sight of the child.  Physically you are very far removed from the child.&rdquo; This is a cause of considerable anxiety to these people.</P>
    <P>In my capacity as a Dublin Deputy I have been approached by quite a considerable number of people who accepted accommodation in Ballymun. They found the accommodation in itself quite acceptable.  Many of them spoke very highly of the actual accommodation, but they were worried by this problem and also by the lack of facilities in Ballymun.  The Minister must accept some responsibility for the undue delay in providing these facilities.  There is now a trend in Ireland towards something which has been in vogue in England since the war years, that is, married women going out to work.  This presents a further problem with regard to the care of their children.</P>
    <P>I believe a system has evolved in which one of the women in these flats &mdash;not necessarily in Ballymun; this could apply to Inchicore or Ballyfermot or Cabra or Crumlin or any of these large estates&mdash;undertakes to mind a number of her neighbours' children during the day.  This poses a particular problem in the high rise flats.  In the event of a fire there could be anything up to eight, ten or 12 very small children in one of these flats and this could prove to be disastrous.  I would suggest to the Minister that, when these estates are being planned, provision should be made for a day nursery so that these women can leave their children there and go about their necessary business with some peace of mind.  This is one of the many things to which we in this country seem to be very slow to adapt.</P>
    <P>As we all know this is Conservation Year.  Some members of the Government have been very vocal about the desirability and necessity to conserve whatever we can of our natural beauty and our national heritage.  One is inclined to take some of the remarks in this field by members of the Government with a grain of salt when one looks at what happened in Hume <Col N="1958" /> Street.  A very serious problem is developing in regard to the Dublin city coast of which the Minister should be aware.  If things continue as they are going, in a very short period of time the children of this city will be denied the use of Dollymount strand.  It is becoming polluted and apparently no effective action is being taken to stop this pollution.  The same can be said of Sandymount strand.</P>
    <P>Of late the Minister has been in places like Ballyfermot so he should be aware that for very many of our children during the summer months this is the only opportunity they have of going to the seaside and running around and playing on the strand.  It will be denied to them completely if we allow Dollymount strand and Sandymount strand to become polluted in this way.  Since it can be rectified, the necessary and appropriate action should be taken by the Minister to rectify it.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies spoke about the traffic problem.  There is no doubt that an acute traffic problem is developing, particularly in Dublin.  This involves expense and annoyance for motorists.  It is also becoming increasingly more difficult and dangerous for pedestrians to cross our streets.  One has only to drive or walk around the city to realise that pedestrians are catered for inadequately.  There are parts of the city where you literally take your life in your hands if you try to cross the street.  The danger is grave enough for the normal, agile adult but for children and elderly people it is extreme.  It is also unnecessary.  Surely it is not expecting too much to suggest that a proper survey should be made of the city so that we would know the volume of traffic in particular areas and provide adequate safe crossings for our people who, in the main, travel by public transport.</P>
    <P>This morning in my own constituency I was made aware that buses have been diverted and now take in Mountjoy Street in which there is a school, and that no pedestrian crossing or no traffic warden has been provided. The people sending their children to school in the mornings are becoming more and more worried about the safety of their children.  In <Col N="1959" /> consultation with the Garda, and with his commissioner, the Minister should do something about this hazard to children.</P>
    <P>Another problem has arisen in connection with a number of flats we have in the city area.  It is not a new problem but it has become more intensified of late and it is causing people increasing anxiety, that is, the problem of vandalism within some of our city flats.  Instead of trying to curtail this vandalism which we cannot eliminate, Dublin Corporation do not provide caretakers in these flats although caretakers have been provided in the past. The annoyance caused by some of the youths in these flats particularly to elderly persons who are accommodated on the ground floor, is extremely serious.  The mental anxiety caused to these elderly persons by youths who can only be described as hooligans defies description.  One would have to talk to these elderly persons to realise that their lives are being made a living hell by a very small number of youths in some of these flats.  The presence of a caretaker in these flats would reduce, if not eliminate, this persecution.  I ask the Minister to take this matter up with his commissioner.</P>
    <P>In his speech introducing the Estimate, the Minister referred to the number of grants which had been made available for the repair of old houses. This is a very good scheme which should be encouraged in every possible way.  It enables people who are living in houses which are structurally sound, but rather old, to put them into proper repair and to instal amenities such as toilets and bathrooms.  The way in which the scheme is being operated leaves much to be desired.  Recently I was asked to call on a constituent, a lady living with her sister, neither of them young.  The houses in this part of my constituency are reasonably old.  These ladies had saved a certain amount of money and wished to put the house into proper repair and to add on an extension to the kitchen to provide a bathroom and toilet.  They were prepared to spend their life-savings on this project.  They received a certain amount of assistance from the local authority <Col N="1960" /> in having this work done.  The job was done in a most unsatisfactory way.  I wonder how this could happen?  If one applies for a grant an inspector is sent out.  He inspects the premises and the estimate which has been given for the job.  If he does not consider that what is being done would put the place into a proper state of repair he insists on additional work being done before the grant is given.  Before the grant is paid a further inspection is made of the completed work.  This is to ensure that the necessary repairs and renovations have been carried out.  In the case to which I refer the renovations and repairs could only have been done by a very inexperienced, careless workman. Any man who knew his job would not have passed them on inspection. These people had spent their life-savings on this work.  They were forced to the further expense of legal proceedings in order to get the work carried out properly.  Last week I heard that on the day the case was to be heard in court a settlement had been reached.  Surely the inspector should not have passed this work?  These inexperienced people had full and utter trust in the workman.  There is something wrong in a system which allows this kind of &ldquo;chancer&rdquo; to prey on people who are trying to put their homes into a good state of repair.  I would suggest to the Minister that it might be a good thing if builders had to be licensed and that unless they met certain standards they should not be allowed to carry on this business at tremendous expense and inconvenience to those who, in good faith, employ them.</P>
    <P>Housing has been one of the main topics in this debate.  There are many aspects of the housing question.  There are many people suffering from lack of accommodation, particularly in this city.  One category which is not too often mentioned are young boys and girls who come to Dublin from rural areas.  They come to employment in the Civil Service, the local authorities and private firms.  They are forced to accept accommodation in &ldquo;bedsitters&rdquo;. The rents charged to these young people are in come cases nothing less than scandalous.  Most of these young people come to Dublin between <Col N="1961" /> the ages of 17 and 19 years.  They do not command very high salaries when they start work.  The are exploited because of the scarcity of accommodation. The girls earn £7 to £8 a week and are asked to pay £5 to £6 per week for bedsitters.  Deputy Andrews in all good faith appeared to be horrified that someone would look for £3 10s for a bedsitter in Dún Laoghaire.  I can assure Deputy Andrews and the Minister that in the city of Dublin young girls and boys who could find acceptable accommodation at £3 10s would consider themselves very lucky, in fact, they would be overjoyed.  It is time something was done to put an end to this rack-renting which is bleeding young people.  Houses have been converted into flats.</P>

      <P>My point is that if there was adequate housing in the city people would not be in a position to charge exorbitant rents for bedsitters. As one is very closely related to the other and as the Minister is undoubtedly responsible for the lack of housing in Dublin&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not press the point.  Another question which deeply concerns our people, and which I will refer to again later, is the question of rates.  Rates, as many people know, have been a controversial issue in this country and in this city.  With much fanfare, an announcement was made that certain reliefs from rates were to be granted to certain categories of persons.  This brought great hope to many people who were in difficulty. Some people absolutely dreaded from one year to the next the time when the postman would put the rates demand into the letterbox.  Widows who were trying to maintain their homes which had been built up in better days when their husbands were alive and their children were growing up, and were now on a very small fixed income, thought when the announcement was made that they, naturally, would be included in the relief promised by the Minister.  Unfortunately their hope was crushed.  It was a false hope.</P>
      <P>The way this scheme is operated, particularly in Dublin city, could only be described as a confidence trick on one of the most defenceless and badly off sections of our population.  There is no local authority, as far as I am aware, operating a scheme that one could in truth describe as a worthwhile, decent scheme but the one being operated by the commissioner who was appointed by the Minister is certainly the worst of a very bad lot. How could anyone who realised the plight and desperation of some of those people trying to meet their rates bill build up false hopes?  It would appear that it was done purely and solely for political motives.  Many people thought that at last this was the relief that we had so long been seeking.  They discovered that it was another of the Fianna Fáil promises which are very seldom, if ever, fulfilled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister devoted quite a lot of his brief to housing.  He mentioned the loans available for persons who wanted to buy their own houses.  The Minister would agree with me that the ceiling of £1,200 is completely unrealistic <Col N="1963" /> and it might be to everybody's benefit, particularly to those who are trying to buy their own homes, if this were reviewed in the near future.  We also heard not only from the Minister but from Deputy Dowling in particular, Deputy Moore and Deputy Foley of the tremendous progress that had been made in the provision of housing, particularly in Dublin, over the last number of years, that everything was disastrous under what the Minister described as the Coalition Government but that once Fianna Fáil were in the saddle everything was rosy and that all those people one saw on a Wednesday morning queueing up at Dublin Corporation appealing for some type of accommodation were a mirage, that the Fianna Fáil Government and the Minister for Local Government in particular had provided so many houses that we had no housing problem. The Minister quoted figures at great length to try to substantiate the statement.  He was supported by figures which I have no doubt he supplied to Deputy Dowling to reinforce the argument.</P>
    <P>Let us be honest about the housing situation particularly in respect of Dublin.  Undoubtedly great progress has been made and there has been quite a number of dwellings provided in the City of Dublin.  I cannot speak with any great authority outside Dublin but the number of dwellings provided by the local authority in Dublin is quite considerable.  The fact is it is not enough and as far as solving the housing problem is concerned we in fact&mdash;I emphasise &ldquo;in fact&rdquo;&mdash; have not made any progress.  The official figures of the waiting list of Dublin Corporation show that not only have we not made any progress but we have taken a step backwards, that there are more people now on the housing list of Dublin Corporation, that there are more people now in the City of Dublin who lack proper accommodation than there were in 1965, five years ago.</P>
    <P>If we look at the number of dwellings provided by Dublin Corporation over the years we see something very significant.  I have heard the Minister <Col N="1964" /> for Local Government, Deputy Boland, on many occasions tell us of the disastrous year 1956.  The strange thing about that disastrous year is that while in 1955-56 the Dublin Corporation provided 1,021 dwellings, a period of seven years elapsed before Dublin Corporation broke the thousand barrier again. I wish to quote from the official figures of the Dublin Corporation as furnished by the commissioner appointed by the Minister, so surely he will accept them as authentic.  In 1955-56, as I said, 1,021 new dwellings were provided by Dublin Corporation.  Fianna Fáil came into office that year and have been there ever since.  In the year they came into office they provided 480 dwellings, somewhat of a drop; the following year the local authority provided 505 dwellings; the next year, 237 dwellings; the next year, 643; the next year 786, and then, 791.  There is something we should note about the figure 786.  A total of 786 new dwellings, which was somewhat of an increase on the previous years, were provided in the year 1963-64, and they were provided as a result of two children losing their lives in this city because a tenement house in Fenian Street fell on top of them, and two elderly people were fortunately rescued from a tenement house which collapsed in Bolton Street.  This started a panic.  In 1963 officials of the dangerous buildings section of Dublin Corporation were going around and condemning <i>ad lib</i> houses in this city. The situation we had to accept was that people were evicted from their homes at a moment's notice and there was no one in a position to offer them alternative accommodation.</P>
    <P>That was the direct result of a deliberate policy by the Fianna Fáil Government from 1957 on.  Those are figures which the Minister and Deputy Dowling and Deputy Moore did not choose to quote.  I can understand some Deputies in the Fianna Fáil Party being fooled here by the statements of the Minister, being blinded by science, by the quoting of this number of houses, this number of sites, and this amount of money.  However, I refuse to accept that Deputies such as Deputy Dowling and Deputy Moore, who are Deputies from Dublin working-class <Col N="1965" /> constituencies do not realise what the facts of the housing situation in this city are.  Some Deputy representing Cork or Kerry or somewhere like that might accept in all good faith what the Minister says, but Deputy Dowling and Deputy Moore have no such excuse. They accept what the Minister says because it suits them politically to accept it, but they know what the facts are and they know that what the Minister is saying is a distortion of the facts.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dowling, above all, knows the facts because he appears to have a direct pipeline to the Minister's representative in this city.  Deputy Dowling can quote up-to-date figures here.  I shall quote some up-to-date figures and some not so up-to-date figures, official figures of the waiting list of Dublin Corporation, and we shall see just how much progress has been made with regard to the housing situation in this our capital city in the year 1970.  This is the approved waiting list and I underline &ldquo;approved&rdquo; because it does not reveal the full picture of people seeking their own accommodation.  In 1965 the figure was 4,890 families looking for accommodation from Dublin Corporation. In 1969, after four years of this crash programme initiated by this dynamic Minister, this man who was solving all our ills, this man who repeatedly told us in this House that the housing situation in Dublin was being vigorously tackled, the official waiting list in Dublin Corporation was 4,980.  It seems to have increased.  There were more people on the waiting list in 1969 than there were in 1965.</P>
    <P>This is progress.  It is for this we are supposed to applaud the Minister responsible for housing, that he can manage to increase the waiting list in the capital city for housing accommodation over a period of four years.  It is a peculiar way of measuring progress. The approved waiting list now &mdash; again I underline &ldquo;approved&rdquo;&mdash; in February, 1970, the latest date for which I have figures, is a little short of 5,500 families.  In 1965 the figure was 4,890 and five years later it is 5,500.  Then the Minister has the audacity, in introducing his Estimate here, to try to tell us and, through us, <Col N="1966" /> the people that tremendous progress has been made in the housing situation. Is the man mad or is there nothing that would make him face up to reality and openly admit that his policy has been a dismal failure?</P>
    <P>When quoting figures here as I have been doing we tend to lose sight of what these figures actually mean.  If the Minister cares to come along with me or any other Labour TD from Dublin to the clinics we hold to hear the problems of our constituents, he will realise they are not just figures. What is behind the figures?  Misery is behind the figures; broken homes, broken marriages, delinquent children, bad health and ruined lives are behind the figures we are quoting.  This situation would be understandable were it necessary but it is totally unnecessary. The only thing that stops us from solving the housing problem not only in this city but in this country is that the Government in power lack the political will to do it, and there will be no solution to the housing problem as long as the people give Fianna Fáil their support.</P>
    <P>It is very hard when speaking of housing not to get somewhat emotional, particularly when day after day, night after night, people are coming to you, a man, his wife and one child, where the man is living apart from his wife and child through necessity.  You must tell them honestly that under the present system they have no hope of being provided with a house by the authorities responsible for the provision of housing for our citizens.  You must tell a young woman who has been married one or two years that in all probability her marriage will never get off the ground, that it is on the cards that this is a broken home for all time.  Goodness knows, young married people in the best of circumstances have to adjust themselves to certain problems.  How much more magnified are these problems if the husband cannot even live with his wife and child, where she is forced to seek accommodation for herself and her child under another person's roof, even if that other person is her own mother or father?  What hope have these people?  No hope.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite a considerable increase.  I cannot give the Parliamentary Secretary the exact figure, but I accept fully his observation.  I took this into consideration when looking at the problem.  One tries to consider all aspects and to appreciate the difficulties facing the Minister.  But the answer to that, through the Chair, is that in the White Paper published in 1964, which the Minister waves around this House periodically when he chooses to answer at Question Time, the Minister was supposed to have allowed for a growing population which naturally a capital city would have and was supposed to have taken into consideration the fact that quite a number of houses would deteriorate.  These factors were supposed to have been considered. We are told this not only in the White Paper of 1964 but also in the White Paper in 1969.  There is very little consolation for some of the people I have mentioned in the fact that the Minister has issued a White Paper.</P>
      <P>The Fianna Fáil Government have allowed a situation to develop in which land speculation has become rife and in which this country and this city has become an E1 Dorado for every chancer in Europe to speculate in land for building purposes.  Not only did the Government condone it but they encouraged it.</P>

      <P>They encouraged speculation in land for building and things that would not be permitted in Great Britain, where legislation would not allow them.  People came over here and speculated because they knew these things were not forbidden but were encouraged here. The people who paid the price are <Col N="1968" /> those I have mentioned, those who are still on the Dublin Corporation's waiting list and who, under the present administration, will remain on that waiting list.</P>
      <P>If the Minister by his gigantic efforts has managed in a period of five years to increase the waiting list by 310 families, God knows what he will be able to do if we give him a little more time.  This is progress. I sincerely regret that the Minister is not present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree.  I am not suggesting that he has run away or anything like that but I regret he is not present because we also have in this city a unique situation.  We are the only capital in a democratic country ruled over, as far as local affairs are concerned, by one person.  That one person was appointed by the Minister for Local Government, a man with whom the elected representatives of this city, democratically elected, came into sharp conflict over a matter of principle.  This city has no elected local public representative. I feel it would be worth while to examine what led up to that situation and try to see what motivated the Minister for Local Government in taking such a step.</P>
      <P>There has been quite a lot of talk over a considerable number of years about the health charges becoming an increasing burden on rates.  This issue was dealt with, as we thought, by the then Minister for Health, the late Deputy O'Malley, when he publicly and in this House told the people of this country that as and from that year no increase in the health charges would require to be borne by the ratepayers. That public promise on behalf of the Government by a Minister of the Government was not honoured and the people particularly of this city found that they were reaching the point where they just could not accept any further increase in the rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the city council reminded the Minister for Local Government, the Minister for Health and the Taoiseach that this promise had been made and <Col N="1969" /> had not been honoured, the words, as uttered by the late Deputy O'Malley, then Minister for Health, in this House were switched, they were changed. There is nothing new about that so far as Fianna Fáil are concerned.  It happened before, it has happened since and it will happen again.  The consequences of that change for the very many people whom we represented at local level were very serious indeed. The city council carried on negotiattions with the Minister for Local Government, with the Minister for Health and eventually with the Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>Between 1966 and 1969, when the council was dissolved by order of the Minister for Local Government, a very significant event took place&mdash;the local elections.  When the results of those elections came in the Minister for Local Government found that the people of this city were not prepared to be ruled over by a Fianna Fáil dominated council: Fianna Fáil found themselves in a minority as against a combination of the Labour Party, the Fine Gael Party and Independents.  We all know the attitude of the Minister for Local Government towards what he describes, and has described no later than two weeks ago during the course of Question Time in this House, as coalition councils.  The Minister's commitment to democracy amounts to this: &ldquo;If it is a Fianna Fáil controlled council, if they do what they are told &mdash;which Fianna Fáil councils do&mdash;let us have democracy; but if they go against the wishes of the Fianna Fáil Party, if they attempt to honour the commitments they made to the people during the course of an election campaign, then something must be done about it.&rdquo;  This could not be tolerated. The Minister for Local Government came into sharp conflict with the city council on a number of issues.  One wonders what really motivated the Minister to take such an action.</P>

      <P>With one stroke of the pen 45 democratically, freely elected local representatives went out of existence and the Minister appointed one man who had been a secretary&mdash; what a coincidence&mdash;of the Department of Local Government, who was accountable only to the Minister for Local Government and was not, and this is the most serious aspect of it, accountable to the people of this city for whom he takes decisions.</P>
      <P>I, as everyone knows, had the honour to be the Lord Mayor of my native city at that time.  I should like to make it perfectly clear that I do not regard as very serious the abolition of the office of Lord Mayor but I regard as very, very serious the removal by a dictator of 45 democratically elected representatives of the people of this city.  The only place I know of in Western Europe to which it can be compared is Derry where the Unionist Government found that Derry Corporation were not prepared to dance to their tune and they removed Derry Corporation.  When the Minister for Local Government found that he could not bully and intimidate the members of Dublin Corporation he abolished it.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary may ask whether he had an alternative, and that is a legitimate query which I think we should examine, but before we do we should try to find out why the Minister for Local Government abolished the city council.</P>

      <P>During the two years, out of the five years for which they were elected, when the Dublin city council were in office the question of planning permission frequently came before them.  Any application submitted to them was scrutinised, the advice of their technical people was listened to with respect, but was frequently questioned, and valid reasons as to why planning permission should either be sanctioned or withheld had to be given to the city council and ultimately to the citizens.  It is common knowledge that on several occasions when if planning permission had been given it would have made certain properties very lucrative but was refused for specified reasons by the local authority, on appeal to the Minister for Local Government the decision of the city council was reversed.  No reason was given, or, apparently, required to be given, as to the reversal of the decision by the Minister for Local Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The city council was justifiably very concerned about this development and it came to a head when planning permission was refused by the city council for a property in Mountpleasant. Although the local authority had stated in very definite specific terms why they were refusing planning permission, the Minister for Local Government once again overruled them and gave a certain <Col N="1972" /> gentleman the permission which enhanced the value of the property by more than £60,000.  To that particular gentleman the Minister's signature was worth more than £60,000.  The Dublin city council were not prepared to accept the situation in which the Minister could overrule them without giving any reason, they were not prepared to accept that development could take place which was clearly detrimental to the interests of the people whom they had been elected to represent and they stopped the Minister from overruling them by means of section 30. Obviously, the Minister did not like that but at least it put a stop temporarily to this business of property being very considerably enhanced in value by the Minister's signature without any justification being offered by the Minister or his officials for the overruling of the original decision of the local authority.</P>
    <P>We then came to the question of differential rents, a problem that is now coming to a head, when the Dublin city council refused to implement a scheme suggested to them at the behest of the Minister for Local Government by the city manager which would inflict very considerable hardship on local authority tenants.  After a considerable time when the Minister knew that the corporation members were standing by the commitment they had made to the people who had elected them, he instructed the city manager, under the Managerial Act, to impose his system of differential rents on the tenants.  The Minister may very shortly regret that particular decision because I do not think the local authority tenants are going to be penalised any longer by some of the Minister's dictatorial decisions.  We have a situation now when the B scale differential rents could lead to very great trouble in the city as they have already led to much hardship, misery and mental distress for which the Minister must accept full responsibility.</P>
    <P>After negotiating for a period of three years on the question of the increase in health charges being levied on the rates a promise on behalf of the Fianna Fáil Government was made in this House by the late Deputy <Col N="1973" /> Donogh O'Malley in 1966.  It was not honoured in 1967 when the new corporation was elected nor was it honoured in 1968.  On both occasions when the time came for the city council to strike a rate they did everything humanly possible to get the Minister for Local Government, the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Health and, at last, the Taoiseach to honour the commitment made on their behalf by Deputy O'Malley and this they refused to do.</P>
    <P>There was no hasty decision made by the Dublin city council to refuse to strike a rate that would include the increase in health charges.  They had waited three long years for the Government to honour their commitment; they had negotiated time and time again with them.  I was in the Minister's office in connection with this matter on a number of occasions.  I attended with a deputation that called on the then Minister for Health, Deputy Seán Flanagan, and before the rates were struck in 1969 and before the council was dissolved at the Minister's command a deputation was received by the Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Health and the Minister for Local Government, and they still would not honour their commitment to the ratepayers.</P>
    <P>At that stage they were told in very definite terms that we, as the elected representatives of the people of this city, were not prepared to be a party to their conniving.  We were not prepared to condone their breach of faith with the people and, irrespective of what they did, we were going to honour our commitment to the people.  We refused to strike a rate which included the health charges for that year.  The Minister then wrote and gave us a certain short period in which to comply with his demand that we strike what he described as an adequate rate.  We had struck an adequate rate.  We had struck a rate, which represented a considerable increase in the existing rate and an added burden on the people of the city, to pay for those services for which the corporation were responsible, but not to pay the bill for which the Fianna Fáil Government <Col N="1974" /> were responsible and, above all, not to pay the bill for incompetence.</P>
    <P>The Minister chose a certain course of action.  The Minister has tried to put it across that the majority of the Dublin City Council ran away from their responsibility, the same sort of tripe that we had about 1956 and the Coalition Government, and that they refused to strike a rate for the purpose of carrying on the services necessary for the city.  No later than five or ten minutes ago we had the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government stating we would not provide money for the housing of our citizens.  How ill-informed can a Parliamentary Secretary be? Even allowing for the fact that he represents a Galway constituency, he is a Parliamentary Secretary.  This is the capital city of the country.  It was the democratically elected representatives of that capital city who were dissolved.  Surely that must be of concern to anyone who even pretends to believe in democracy.</P>
    <P>Dublin City Council struck the rate, but they refused to strike a rate which included increases in the health charges.  They decided that, if the Fianna Fáil Government and the Minister for Local Government would not honour their commitment, the Dublin City Council were not prepared to impose this burden on the people. They held that the responsibility for the increase in rates, due to health charges, was the responsibility of the central authority.  The Minister then abolished the city council.  Why?  Was there an alternative?  Of course, there was an alternative.  There were several alternatives.  But the Minister did not seek alternatives.  The Minister, just by application alone, could have got a court order which would have obliged the city manager to pay the health charges and, if there was any shortage in the services from the point of view of housing, roads, sanitation, and so on, the city manager would have been faced with another situation.  Several alternatives were open to the Minister. What alternative did the Minister choose?  The one that suited him best; the one that got this city council off his back; the one that stopped these fellows from exposing him; the one <Col N="1975" /> that stopped all the very unpleasant publicity at every monthly meeting when the conniving between the developers and the Minister's Department was being exposed.  That is why the Minister chose the particular course he did.  I still believe that the Minister and the party he represents will live to regret the hasty decision he made.  The citizens of this city&mdash;indeed, the citizens of the whole country&mdash;are beginning to realise the very serious undermining of democracy for which this decision by the Minister was responsible.  As the Minister has stated here frequently, any council which is not Fianna Fáil dominated is a dangerous animal and should only be tolerated as long as one must tolerate it.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, the Minister's Department and the Minister's Estimate is of very serious concern to a great many of our people because the decisions of the Minister and his Department vitally affect the lives of the people.  The attitude and the make-up of the Minister in charge of that Department are of paramount importance because he is the man who directs the activities of the Department and his attitude towards the problems which confront his Department largely determines what will be done about them.</P>
    <P>The Minister has the reputation of being very dedicated to the Irish nation, the Irish language, Irish culture. These are all very admirable. These are things of which we are all proud, but I wonder what is the Minister's conception and what is his vision of Ireland.  I have described the circumstancees under which many of our people live.  I have an idea that the Minister's vision of Ireland is a very romantic one of &ldquo;four green fields&rdquo; and I can imagine the Minister lying awake at night, listening to the sound of the bugle, watching the flag wave and hearing the tramp of marching feet, going northwards.  The commitment of James Connolly to this nation was unquestionable.  To show how different conceptions of this country may be I want to quote from James Connolly; I am sure the Minister will not be horrified:</P>
    <P>Ireland, without her people, is <Col N="1976" /> nothing to me and the man who is bubbling over with love and enthusiasm for Ireland and can yet pass unmoved through her streets and witness all the wrongs and sufferings, the shame and degradation brought upon the people of Ireland, brought by Irishmen upon Irish men and women, without burning to end it, is in my opinion a fraud, a liar in his heart, no matter how he loves that combination of chemical elements which he is pleased to call Ireland.</P>
    <P>James Connolly must have had someone like the Minister in mind when he wrote those words.</P>

      <P>Deputy Cluskey made some very serious misstatements in regard to our housing programme in Dublin city.  He produced figures which would suggest that the corporation and the Government of the day had deliberately tapered off the housing programme.  He did not advert to the serious economic circumstances of the period from 1956 to 1957.  Conveniently he ignored the fact that we had something in the region of 100,000 unemployed and a record vacancy rate in Dublin city for local authority houses.  The normal vacancy rate before that period was in the region of 200 houses per year and there was a dramatic rise to over 2,000 at the end of 1957 when the Coalition Government gave up office and the people returned Fianna Fáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been a public representative for many years and my recollection is that in those years conditions were so serious in this city that the people took to the streets, not looking for houses but looking for work.  There were thousands in the centre of the city and they petitioned this House which was sitting at the time and on the benches behind where the Labour Party normally sit&mdash;there is only one representative there now&mdash;was an unemployed representative who was elected during that critical period of our history.  As we know, he resigned subsequently.  The cry at that time was for employment and nobody can fault any reasonable Government for trying to produce stability.  Their first commitment and first obligation was to provide employment. People left the country in <Col N="1978" /> thousands to work in England and elsewhere and people who had undertaken to purchase houses found themselves in the same position.  There were something like 600 houses handed back to the corporation at the time.</P>
    <P>It was in that atmosphere that there had of necessity to be a slight tapering in the housing construction programme. The people had to be rehabilitated economically.  Election after election since then the people have endorsed that policy.  Listening to Deputy Cluskey, one would think that there had not been a general election last year when the people again endorsed the policies so energetically pursued by this Government and by various Ministers particularly the Minister for Local Government.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cluskey at great length and in great detail referred to the abolition of Dublin City Council.  He referred several times to the fact that it was a Fianna Fáil dominated council.  It was nothing of the kind.  The Fianna Fáil group were the largest group in the council but they could always be outvoted by a combination of Fine Gael, Labour and certain independent members. As a member of long standing of that body, I know that some years ago we had 20 members out of 45 and after successive elections that number was reduced to 17.  I am mentioning this for the purposes of the record, to show that Deputy Cluskey misinformed the House when he said that the council was dominated by Fianna Fáil.  The abolition of the council, which caused some controversy at the time, has not been referred to very much since and much to the dismay of the Opposition parties, I presume, it was not even an issue in the last general election.  The affairs of the city are proceeding normally and the policies of the Government are carried out through the agency of the local authority and are being pursued in the normal way.</P>
    <P>On the general question of housing, great play and a certain amount of emotive politicking have been taking place in relation to this subject.  While it is admitted by some Opposition speakers that a certain amount has been done in this respect, they ignore the fact that the population of this city has increased substantially in recent <Col N="1979" /> years.  Not alone have many of our emigrants returned from England, America, and other places, but there has been a considerable amount of migration from various parts of the country.  All of this has contributed to the housing shortage.  However, it has not been suggested that there is a housing emergency.</P>
    <P>Added to that, we have had a change in the general social pattern of the country.  Improved economic conditions are producing a situation in which young people are getting married earlier.  Anyone in touch with current affairs in this city and, indeed, in the country admits that this is a very welcome sign.  There are numerous teenage marriages and inevitably this is producing a social problem which Opposition speakers conveniently have been ignoring.  No agency in this country or elsewhere can, as far as I can ascertain, anticipate these trends. They have to be assessed in a normal way and policies readjusted to meet them.</P>
    <P>I believe the Minister for Local Government, through the White Paper and his very informative speech introducing the Estimate, has clearly shown that he is grappling with this problem and that it will be solved in a reasonable time.  It is well known, for instance, that the Minister has been responsible for contributing substantial sums towards the acquisition of land, and Dublin Corporation I understand have acquired thousands of acres.  All that is needed now is the requisite services and the capital to provide these services for the housing estates of the future.  The Government are proceeding on sound, sensible lines to solve this big problem.  There are, of course, other demands on our finances, other sectors such as education and health which are of great importance.  All of these matters must be dealt with in such a manner as to preserve the economy, to preserve the stability the people require to provide further opportunities for employment and to keep all sectors of the country moving in a smooth way so as not to cause disruption in any area.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1980" /> There are a few matters I should like to refer to in detail.  They are minor matters.  The Ballymun flats have been referred to by several speakers and some of the Opposition Deputies appeared to heap odium on that project.  I was very glad in its earlier stages to be associated with the then Minister for Local Government in the launching of that scheme.  It has won the congratulations and the commendations of many experts from outside the country.  We had responsible professional groups coming there who were impressed with the type of accommodation provided.</P>
    <P>I admit that because of its height some of the accommodation there may be unsuitable for some family units who may not like to live at such heights.  I believe, though, that the corporation, through their different departments, are arranging for suitable transfers from Ballymun for families who when they went there had only one child but who now have three or four and who wish to be provided with houses.</P>
    <P>The corporation also have embarked on a very ambitious tenant purchase scheme.  I should like to see greater emphasis on trying to induce many well-off tenants of corporation houses to leave their houses and obtain houses in the private sector.  That could be done, I suggest, by increasing the present grant of £275.  I suggest that if that were done more corporation houses would be made available for those on the waiting list.</P>
    <P>I should like also to see greater impetus given to groups to provide their own houses.  That was a feature of the early 50s: groups came together, obtained sites from local authorities not alone here but in areas throughout the country, and provided houses on a co-operative basis.  Dublin Corporation always had as their policy the aim to help people co-operatively to provide their own houses.  We know there are substantial grants available from the Department of Local Government to help people in that way.</P>
    <P>In the creation of future housing estates, I think more attention should be given to design and lay-out.  I should like to see housing estates <Col N="1981" /> being developed with all the necessary services being provided simultaneously. We had a situation in the past where housing schemes were built without churches or schools being provided. That does not apply in Dublin northeast, through the energy and initiative of Monsignor Fitzpatrick, who anticipated such developments in Killester. Housing schemes of the future should have all amenities provided simultaneously&mdash;playing fields, community halls, swimming pool and so forth.  The cost could, without much hardship, be attached to the general cost of the projects&mdash;a package deal if you wish to put it that way.</P>
    <P>The question of rates and rates relief has been referred to by previous speakers.  Some months ago the Minister for Local Government introduced a measure which, although very welcome, was rather restricted in its scope, but it was a start.  This measure provided relief from rates for persons living on social welfare.  I understand only between 300 and 400 out of thousands of applicants qualified for this rates relief in Dublin city.  I know of cases where widows living on £5 to £7 per week are denied the advantages of this scheme because they were not social welfare recipients.  I hope the Minister will give priority to such deserving classes in future rating reforms.  I suggest rating should be scaled according to income in the same way as applies in the renting system. Young married couples who enjoy a rate remission at the moment should be afforded further relief as their family responsibility increases.  This matter is outside the scope of this discussion but no doubt it will come up again.  Waiver of rates, even though it is only a restricted measure, has been welcomed by people generally.  I hope greater relief will be afforded to our community in the future.</P>
    <P>I agree with all that has been said by previous speakers about flat dwellers and the high rents they have to pay in the city.  I know many cases of young married couples being charged exorbitant rents for very inferior accommodation.  The flats are technically described as furnished but there is only a token of furniture in <Col N="1982" /> them, maybe a carpet and a couple of chairs.  Apparently, no standards are laid down about these types of dwellings. The introduction of flats tends to produce bad social conditions in a neighbourhood and the indifference of the landlords who own them is a matter of concern to many people. Some of the flats I have seen were in very bad decorative condition.  Legislation should be introduced to ensure that landlords keep their premises in good decorative condition.  My remarks apply particularly to those landlords who are charging exorbitant rents and yet have a complete disregard for the appearance of the property and the hardships such high rents impose.</P>
    <P>I want to refer again to the question of housing.  I am sorry to say that the allocation system is breaking down because of squatting in corporation houses.  Recently I heard of the pending vacancy of a corporation house and was approached by a constituent who was anxious to make representations on behalf of a family who were on the housing waiting list. That person subsequently returned to tell me that within an hour of the family vacating the house it was occupied by an illegal tenant.  I understand that this practice exists in most corporation houses and flats.  I regret to say that it is being encouraged by a certain element in this city who are vociferous in suggesting that we have what they term a &ldquo;housing emergency&rdquo;. While there is a housing shortage, such extreme action is not justified.  Squatting poses a great problem for those responsible for managing our estates.  I do not know what can be done about it but it is a matter which concerns very many people, particularly people involved in public affairs, who are anxious to see the most deserving cases dealt with first.</P>
    <P>I understand a public contractor is carrying out certain works in the Raheny area of north Dublin.  They have been in operation for many months and, in addition to causing inconvenience to the people living in the district, are causing hardship to the shopkeepers who are being deprived of their normal business.  I am sure in <Col N="1983" /> this age of the motor car, some system of carrying out road works more expeditiously could be devised.  I do not know whether the Minister has any function in that matter but, perhaps, he might through his office be able to do something about it.</P>
    <P>The only other matter I should like to refer to is access to our cities.  We have spent millions in providing roads around the country but our approaches to Dublin are deplorable.  Our traffic bottle-necks are the cause of frustration and annoyance to road users.  I hope the Minister will be able to tell us in the near future what plans he has to improve the situation which is growing daily worse.  Traffic in Dublin will get worse before it will get better.  For many years there has been talk of a tunnel or a bridge east of Butt Bridge but nothing apparently has emerged yet and no positive steps have been taken to bring that project to fruition. I would ask the Minister to give his attention to that as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>I have another point to make in relation to traffic.  I refer to excessive speeds on our roads.  I know the Department lay down speed limits but it is generally admitted that some motorists have a cynical disregard for the speed limits. These motorists are a great source of worry to pedestrians endeavouring to cross some of our roads.  It is a hazardour undertaking to cross some of our roads.  Providing pedestrian subways at some junctions was referred to earlier and this is something which could be followed up.  I know that the cost of providing facilities of this sort is very high but if we are to have modern amenities we must be prepared to provide them.  As public representatives, it is our duty to endeavour to provide them.  I should like, again, to congratulate the Minister on the job he is doing in relation to housing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne1969" hpid="Dr. Byrne Dr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the housing problem in Dublin it is interesting to note from the figures quoted by Deputy Cluskey earlier that the approved waiting list of Dublin Corporation has, in fact, increased quite appreciably in the past year.  The plans for the provision of houses to accommodate <Col N="1984" /> people on the waiting list are no doubt inadequate but we hope steps will be taken to cater adequately for the vast number of people who are on the official waiting list.  There are many others, of course, not on this waiting list, who require subsidised accommodation.</P>
      <P>When living in County Kerry, I knew a forestry worker who was waiting for a house for 12 years.  During that time he lost three of his children as he was living on the side of a mountain in an old mud hut.  When I saw him again some months ago he had not been housed.  That is a dreadful situation, especially in a county where the population is decreasing.  We know the Minister for Local Government accepts responsibility for the provision of housing for people in the country regardless of what area they are from and we know the housing problem is not confined to Dublin.  However, it may be at its most acute stages in the Dublin area now.  Not enough houses are being provided.  Also, the accommodation provided is not sufficient to cater for some of the families who are on the waiting list and who are being housed by the corporation.</P>
      <P>The Minister has provided recently, with the co-operation of the Itinerant Settlement Committee, some tigeens in the Ballyfermot and Finglas area in an effort to house the itinerants.  Each county council is making an effort to provide some form of stable, concrete accommodation for the itinerant section of the population.  I might mention in passing that, perhaps, the one big factor which brought our attention, efforts and resources, even slight though they may be, to bear on the itinerant problem was the fact that in 1964 there was more than 25 per cent maternal mortality among the itinerant population.  This rate was nearly twice that of any other west European country.  The World Health Organisation judging the standard of living of a country by its maternal mortality rate showed we had, in fact, one of the worst standards of living in Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We would, therefore, view possibly with a certain amount of suspicion the effort made by the Department of <Col N="1985" /> Local Government to house the itinerants. One would also, even at this early stage, like to carry out an investigation as to how satisfactory the itinerant housing programme is.  How, in other words, would the migration rate from the itinerant camp in Labouré Park over a period of 12 months compared with the average migration in the city of Dublin be the figure made available recently by a private firm? We would all hope that the itinerant settlement camps would not become ghettoes of second- or third-class citizens. Indeed, many people from all walks of life have made great efforts and sacrifices in order to provide some form of integration of the itinerants into the more stable section of the population.  Some of them have helped with schools and they have set up their own schools and many have attended the social functions which are provided in the settlement camps. One thing which the Minister might possibly consider doing for the effective resettlement of itinerants is the formation of committees by itinerants themselves thus helping those people to help themselves, which is a far more effective way of achieving the desired result than hand-feeding them at all times or saying how great we are that we have given this or that. It trains them to be far more effective than does the giving of social welfare benefits or other help.  Tunisia provided a very good example here when they directed the romany section of the population to participate actively in the tourist industry.  This is something the Minister for Local Government could investigate in regard to the setting up of local itinerant settlement camps.</P>
    <P>After we have housed the itinerant section of our population, we will have to turn to what could possibly be called the new itinerants of Ireland.  These are the people whom we see straggling along the Naas Road, at Clondalkin, and at Swords.  They live in secondhand caravans.  They try to rear their families in these caravans.  They are not of the old travelling-type people but they are the new unhoused people. They are people who perhaps do not qualify for housing accommodation or <Col N="1986" /> people who have been thrown out by their in-laws or who have not been able to afford the exorbitant cost of private rooms in the city.  This new section of our population will present a critical problem for Dublin shortly. Once again we will see an increase in infant mortality.  There will be an increased infant mortality in this particular group, not necessarily all over the whole city area.  The benefits of the community will be given to the itinerants as such, but they will be taken away from these people who are forced to live in these new caravan sites or these new camps of mobile homes.  It is the best that many young married couples can provide for themselves under present circumstances with the present wages level and the present prices of houses.  We should not ignore this fact.  The housing of such people has not been taken into account in the White Paper.  We should give our attention to this problem.</P>
    <P>Another system of housing provided is the housing at Griffith Barracks, where we have a separation of families. There is separate accommodation for the males and females.  I believe this is on the decrease.  I am glad this is so.</P>
    <P>What about the poor people who are provided with local authority accommodation? What happens when they fail to maintain the financial commitments necessary to keep their houses? What happens to them?  Where do they go?  They may be moved to this new showpiece of Europe at Benburb Street.  Keogh Square has disappeared. It was one of the worst slums in Europe.  It is being replaced by Benburb Street.  I am sure the Minister appreciates that this is no solution at all.  When a family is evicted, or when they get into trouble because of rent, they are sent to the accommodation with low rents at Benburb Street.  This does not solve their problem.  They are still in arrears with the rent and they must pay off the arrears before being considered for more favourable accommodation. Separation brings social problems and medical problems increase geometrically as the standard of accommodation drops.  It is a very hard thing for a woman to suffer a drop in her standard of living and to remain stable at the same time.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1987" /> The Minister is attempting to tackle the chaotic housing situation in Dublin. I compliment him on his efforts.  Unfortunately, the Minister has created working class ghettoes in the suburbs of Dublin city.  We have huge schemes at Finglas, Coolock, Raheny, Ballymun, Tallaght, Kilbarrack and Donameade. A further town is planned at Blanchardstown.  Unfortunately, these will possibly become ghettoes which will be isolated from amenities which the well-off and the middle-class sections of the Dublin population have available to them.  None of these areas has a swimming pool or sufficient playing pitches or football pitches. None of them has sufficient recreational facilities at all.  All these areas lack recreational facilities for young girls.</P>
    <P>This brings us to the question of the stress which the young Irish female goes through when she gets married and finds she has no home.  In order to get priority on the Dublin housing list she must get married young and have a large family and possibly a contagious disease.  Then she will get to the top of the list and will be housed.  It is a dreadful state of affairs to have reached such a situation in our city.  About ten years ago there was adequate accommodation for everybody.  The first breaking-point with these young girls comes after they have had a few children and have had many years of tension living with in-laws.  Suddenly they are put out to live on their own.  Their rent is assessed on what is known as a system of B-scale rents.</P>
    <P>I do not know where this system of B-scale rents came from.  It is in existence since 1966.  We have introduced this, with the best intentions in the world, to provide economic rents for the lowly-paid or unemployed tenant.  In fact, this scheme has backfired. The person today who is hardest hit is the lowly-paid or unemployed person.  A discussion of B-scale rents is something which is probably outside the bounds of this debate.  The emotional strains and stresses, the unstable family circles, and the insecurity of home which have followed from the <Col N="1988" /> B-scale rental system could well be discussed here.  This system of rental is just not working out in practice. Theoretically, it is possibly a very good thing, but in practice people are being faced with very large bills for back rent and in many cases then for arrears of rent.</P>
    <P>There is a difference between these. The difference between back rent and arrears of rent is something which took me some time to understand.  The stress and strain of a letter arriving with a bill for possibly £50, £100 or £150 is very often the crucial point in a woman's life.  This could even be the breaking point for her.  It could drive her to do things which she might not normally do.  I have come across cases in Finglas where some of the women were afraid to open the doors of their houses when they heard a knock in case a registered letter would come in. In Ballymun, the emotional stress and strains have increased fantastically among young women who have taken up tenancy there.  Many of them, for different reasons which cannot necessarily be related directly to B-scale rents or a back rent bill, have attempted to take their own lives.</P>
    <P>The biggest section of the population of the Ballymun town consists of young married women.  It is a terrible situation if any scheme of rent collection could, even indirectly, with the best of intentions, result in young children being deprived of the most valuable person in their lives and in their development, namely, their mother, even if it is only a temporary removal to a treatment unit or a temporary stay at the home of in-laws.  It is shocking. It is most unfair and it should be investigated immediately.  We have no figures here.  We have done no survey. We can prove nothing.  We know that. We are not trying to prove anything. It exists and the proof is there.</P>
    <P>The third big factor which very often contributes the <i>coup de grace</i>, so to speak, in the new housing estates is the increased cost of living.  The shops have a more or less captive clientele and they can charge what they like. They have no competition.  There is no price slashing in those areas.</P>
    <P>The central heating levy in the <Col N="1989" /> Ballymun housing estate is a compulsory levy on each house unit.  It is most peculiar and it should be investigated immediately I should like the Minister to take note of this.  The buildings which were erected at a cost of over £12 million were erected in such a way that, in order to render them habitable, central heating had to be an integral part of the structure. There is no point in our discussing this because last year, during the maintenance strike, we had a practical demonstration of what these flat units were like when the heating was cut off for something like four to six weeks.  The walls started to weep and the units of accommodation in the high rise dwellings became completely uninhabitable. There was mass migration from the flat units to relatives, in-laws and friends elsewhere in the city.</P>
    <P>Bearing this in mind, one realises that the central heating provided in Ballymun is not a luxury.  By virtue of the design of the buildings it is a necessity in order to render the units of accommodation habitable.  Because of this factor the design of the buildings was possibly ill-advised.  The Minister should consider this as a matter of urgency.  I am sorry he is not here because I should like to ask him personally to consider removing the central heating levy on all the flats in the Ballymun town.  The flat dwellers have very logical complaints: none of them has any control over the central heating and this central heating is not a luxury but an absolute necessity to make these buildings habitable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>When he comes in I might take leave to repeat them to him because I am given to believe that at present some of the flat dwellers from Ballymun are, in fact, lying on their backs on the Belfast Road.  Last night they blocked the traffic and they <Col N="1990" /> lay under buses and motor cars on the Ballymun Road.  Many of them have been driven to this because of the very high charges on their flats.  I know that the Parliamentary Secretary will convey my remarks to the Minister but the situation is so very urgent I would ask him to convey them to the Minister at the earliest opportunity and have the position dealt with as a matter of emergency.</P>
      <P>To alleviate the tensions in Ballymun we could completely subsidise the rates levy which is 11/10d per unit. National funds should take over this rates levy and we could then possibly get the rents down to a realistic level so that the lower paid and the unemployed could come closer to meeting their financial commitments.  They are not meeting them at the moment.  They cannot do so and they are all on the one-way shift down to Benburb Street. On another occasion I asked the Minister if a woman earning £6 a week could possibly be paying as much as £1 19s 1d to the local authority and he said that she would have to be earning £7 10s a week.  The local authority confirmed that this particular woman, who was not earning £6 a week but was subsidised from national assistance to the extent of £6 a week, had in fact to pay £1 19s 1d, which left her a little over £4 a week to keep four children and herself.  The levy here was in the region of 10/- rent, 11/10d rates, and 17/6 central heating.</P>
      <P>This central heating charge is for 12 months and the central heating is on for nine months of the year, the levy being spread over the 12 months.  With the removal of the central heating levy and the rates levy this woman could come closer to meeting her food bills and possibly be able to make some effort to provide for her family which she is completely and utterly incapable of doing at the moment.  Every Tuesday she is looking for money.  She is being driven into the category of a beggar.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know how much consideration the Minister has given to Ballymun town but last week a Deputy of the Fianna Fáil Party said the experts recognise that Ballymun is one of the best housing developments in Europe. This could only be the opinion of people who are interested in statistics, <Col N="1991" /> in calling houses units of accommodation, and in referring to people by numbers, because the accommodation which has been provided for the type of people who are living there is totally inadequate.  It is totally inadequate for the requirements of the family and it is the family we must think of here.</P>
    <P>Many women suffer from neurotic complaints because they live at a high level.  Some people who were never sick before in their lives can develop neurosis if they live at a high level. We all know of the small group of people who suffer from a condition called vertigo.  However, when a woman is put in a confined area and living eight or possibly up to fourteen storeys up, the rate at which these neuroses develop increases fantastically.</P>
    <P>The tragedy about Ballymun is that these neurotic complaints and grave phobias were noticed in similar estates in England and yet they are completely ignored over here, even though the complaints and neuroses had a higher incidence among women who had young children.  Once again they were completely ignored notwithstanding the fact that the vast majority of the women who would be going into Ballymun would have a far higher number of young children than they would have in England.  Not only did we ignore the signs and the warnings from Tiger Bay and Woolwich and other parts of England where these high dwellings were erected but we also ignored the warnings which came from the early flat dwellers in Ballymun in relation to the erection of further high dwellings in the city.  The corporation, under the National Building Agency, demolished Keogh Square, which was an excellent thing to do, but to replace Keogh Square by further high tower dwellings, which were an important factor in the development of neuroses among young women, was a grave mistake.</P>
    <P>Therefore, there is a combination of factors which is making life completely intolerable for many of the flat dwellers in Ballymun.  No. 1, there is the high B-scale rents; No. 2, the high dwellings which are unsafe for young children; No. 3, <Col N="1992" /> the central heating being uncontrolled; No. 4, the increase in neurotic complaints; No. 5, the increase in respiratory illnesses which has been reported in other countries as being associated with central heating and in relation to which there also would appear superficially to be an associated increase in Ballymun.  These excess medical expenses and inefficiency on the part of the mother have rendered certain parts of the Ballymun housing estate uninhabitable for certain women and certain families.  The writing was on the wall from Tiger Bay and from Woolwich.  It was there for us to see and we ignored it.  We have come to the terrible stage where a Fianna Fáil backbencher should say that this is one of the best housing developments in Europe.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, the wrong experts were picked to advise the Minister for Local Government on this.  There has been a very good concerted effort to provide local amenities in Ballymun, even if the shops are still being built after four years.  Schools are being built and even if there is a cement strike some effort is being made to provide schooling.  However, it does not get away from the basic problem that sections of Ballymun are uninhabitable for certain sections of our population.  This is something which requires immediate investigation.  For health reasons, people, particularly those who have developed health complaints since they went to live in Ballymun, should get priority transfer to adequate accommodation.  I call on the Minister to introduce complete relief immediately from the central heating charge because central heating is not a luxury but a necessity and this charge should be absorbed by central funds for the present.</P>
    <P>There are many other factors involved in living in these new ghettoes such as increased bus fares to schools in the city, to city hospitals and for visits to families and outings.  These are all added stresses and strains which these families must bear and which their pay packets are not meeting. Shops, schools, recreational facilities and such things as post offices are not available in these developing areas <Col N="1993" /> for years.  One must praise the Dublin Health Authority because they seem to be the first to move into any area and provide a dispensary or they help in some way.  Other amenities are very slow in coming and some never come. Ballymun is waiting four years and Finglas is waiting over 12 years.  There is plenty community organisation but there are no community centres.</P>
    <P>Again, living in Ballymun aggravates the difficulties of certain sections of our people.  For instance, a soldier housed in Ballymun must pay a fantastically high rent.  He has increased travel costs and the ancillary services which would be available to him in a military barracks are not available in Ballymun or Finglas or Coolock.  I call on the Minister, when he is reviewing the position, to try to come to some arrangement with the Minister for Defence by which all soldiers can be accommodated at a standard price equivalent to that which they would pay for similar quarters in a military barracks.  This is a very important factor.  We have now reached the stage, for the first time in our history, when our soldiers have to pay income tax. I know soldiers paying very high rents in the new areas.</P>
    <P>Something which could be considered at this stage is the laying out of sufficient green-space areas around these developing towns to allow for recreational facilities for male and female.  Something lacking in this city which other cities have is a municipal golf course where the over-30s could enjoy recreation and ease the increased strain and tension of city life in the case of both fathers and mothers.</P>
    <P>It is tragic that the highest rate of drug addiction, so far as we know it from figures available, is in the new housing areas: Finglas, Raheny and Ballymun.  Community facilities are not available to teenagers; there is not sufficient money to provide them.  The Minister should try to provide the money in some way at a low rate to the tenants' associations which are willing to, and capable of building and running these centres.</P>
    <P>On the north side of the city we have stacks of pipes and plenty of drains but no water.  We have one of the wettest <Col N="1994" /> climates of any European country but we have not sufficient water for houses on the north side.  I am not familiar with the situation on the south side but our leader, Deputy Cosgrave, indicated that there was water shortage in the Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown area.  In Coolock some families have not had baths for months for want of water.  In the Finglas east area some boiler tanks have blown up and have been a danger to residents.  I believe that, were it not for the damp climate we have, we would have in our suburbs shanty towns on a par with those in Portugal. All that has saved us is the fact that our climate is so wet and the rainfall so heavy that every dwelling must be at least reasonably waterproof.  Anybody who has visited Portugal has seen the shanty towns which provide accommodation there because they have a dry climate.  I know that many people who are dissatisfied with the accommodation provided for them here would get out if they could get dry accommodation elsewhere.</P>
    <P>The Minister is failing dismally in allowing people to proceed with development without sufficient water being laid on.  Even a slight rise in the elevation of the house can mean a tremendous drop in water pressure in that house.  The situation on the north side is really serious.  We were promised that it would be rectified by January. That has not happened and the position is worsening as a result of new estates being built.</P>
    <P>Things have reached a chaotic stage in regard to the housing of elderly people in Dublin city.  Of the 65,000 elderly people we have, very few are adequately accommodated.  The Minister should adopt a revolutionary approach to this problem.  We have had reported to us in this House that there is an increased rate of death among elderly people when they are moved from one area to another.  They fail to adapt and for some unknown reason or a reason which is too obvious to be appreciated they appear to die at a faster rate.  Doctor Dan O'Brien of Summerhill dispensary has reported this to the authorities.</P>
    <P>The revolutionary approach I advocate could take the form of providing grants to interested relatives who <Col N="1995" /> would look after elderly parents or in-laws.  Grants should be made available immediately, as has happened in some cases, to convert garages into self-contained flats for elderly people with separate hall-doors so that the old people would retain the individuality so important to many of them.  At the same time there would be ready-made attendance forthcoming from their own families who would not intrude on them unnecessarily but would be there in the event of sickness or accident.  If this approach, or some such approach worked out by the Minister or his Department, were adopted we would greatly diminish the number of people being thrown into Dublin institutions and would also greatly diminish the number of such people entering mental hospitals because of insufficient housing or some other reason, because they are driven half-crazy by vandals, or by noises, or by fear of losing their accommodation.</P>
    <P>Recently, I mentioned that some 48 people in the Chapelizod area are living in dread of losing their houses to a foreign-owned company which they fear will build on the ground where their houses stand.  This is a dreadful situation.  I should appreciate it greatly if the Minister would look into the housing of old people and use one of the best natural resources we have, the charitable attitude of the children of these elderly people who are willing to co-operate.  We have ready-made charge hands and nurses ready to look after their parents or in-laws if the extra accommodation is available.  I do not imagine the cost involved would be excessive.  If grants were provided in certain cases many elderly people could spend their last years in a comfortable environment.</P>
    <P>The situation of some of the old age pensioners in Ballymun following the recent increase of 10/- in their pension is deplorable, because, of the 10/-, two shillings are being docked for rent.  Some 20 per cent of their increase must go towards rent, and for a levy for central heating about which they have no say.  They also lose their turf allowance which, in terms of market value, represents <Col N="1996" /> about 8/6d.  Really these people are getting nothing.  They are being pushed out into the wilderness of Ballymun and, were it not for the many voluntary organisations working so efficiently in these areas, things would be critical.  The Minister should be grateful to the voluntary organisations running services like &ldquo;Meals on Wheels&rdquo; and others which keep things going until conventional services are provided.</P>
    <P>We all agree that our rating system is antiquated.  I believe even the Minister and Fianna Fáil accept this: that it is a double system of taxation and a most unfair one.  By and large, none of the medical facilities which are provided from the rates are available to the ratepayers.  The health services charge is the largest single increase and I think the Minister should investigate the prospects of removing health charges completely from the rates.  Anybody paying rates on a private house should qualify for income tax relief in respect of their rates.  The abolition of rates on private dwellings should be one of the primary objectives of the Minister.  The following steps should be considered: first, that rates should be subject to tax relief; secondly, all rates should be removed from people such as old age pensioners, widows, deserted wives and so on and borne by the Central Fund if necessary.  Then, all health charges should be removed from the rates and gradually transferred to the Central Fund.  Eventually, we might possibly reach a stage where we could have the removal of all rates from private dwellings but, for the present, even to allow relief from income tax in respect of rates would be a great help for the many people who are on the borderline of survival.</P>

      <P>A point which has been mentioned before is the dreadful Rachmanism which is going on in the city of Dublin. One of the groups affected most by this is nurses.  They are one of the lowest paid groups of workers and they do the best type of work which any girl could possibly do.  They must pay these exorbitant rents for flats close to the hospitals where they work.  I do not know how the Minister will get around this, but certainly some inevestigation should be carried out.  Many nurses live on the borderline of starvation. There was a deputation recently to the Minister for Health about this. They just cannot make ends meet because of these high rents.  The same applies to young civil servants and young waitresses coming from the country and paying £5 a week for a room.  It is absolutely fantastic.  These landlords are getting away with these rents and getting away tax-free sometimes because they have not declared the fact that they have turned their houses into flats.</P>

A landlord can evict by brute force a young married couple on to the streets of Dublin so that Dublin Corporation are forced to house them and he can then rent his room for a far higher rent.  This is going on and it is part and parcel of the housing problem. I have seen it.  I have had to attend to a case on one occasion: a young man and woman came home in the evening and, because they had a child born to them, they were thrown out.</P>

The city commissioner runs their affairs and he is responsible directly to the Minister.  He was appointed by the Minister, so the Minister must have some form of responsibility for this.  A landlord can throw out a couple because they have a child and the housing authority is obliged to house them.  I think this is most unfair even if I am out of order.</P>

      <P>Very serious consideration should be given to the traffic problem which is prevalent in Dublin city and also creeping into Cork and Limerick.  Dublin is becoming intolerable because of the number of private vehicles travelling through the city during business hours.  We should try to have an area in the city centre reserved exclusively for public transport&mdash;a shuttle-type service&mdash;taxis and commercial vehicles.  If one walks down Grafton Street, O'Connell Street or Capel Street on a Friday evening one will see what Dublin will be like every day in a year or two.  It was by the grace of God that the new tax on motor vehicles and hire purchase restrictions came in and cut down the number of cars being sold in the city. During the tourist season at any rate it is impossible for a doctor&mdash;perhaps this is a vested interest but it is very important&mdash;to travel around.  Ambulances get stuck in city traffic.  It is something that should be looked into now.  This is the responsibility of the Department of Local Government.  The possibility of banning private vehicles from the centre of the city or part of the centre of the city for a short time each day is something which would be worthy of consideration and something <Col N="1999" /> we should try.  We cannot lose anything by it and it would be interesting to see the reaction.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Local Government should give his immediate attention to the complete neglect of the north side of the city so far as the provision of business accommodation is concerned. He told us the other day that the north side of the city has a population of 163,000 compared with 159,000 odd on the south side.  Yet the south side has two universities and the north side has none.  There are 47 hospitals on the south side and 20 on the north side. I know that 20 is quite a lot and that there was a reference in the FitzGerald Report to the rationalisation of hospitals. However, this is an indication of how things are.  There are more playing fields on the south side.  There is only one rugby club on the north side. There are more golf courses and racecourses on the south side.  As the population increases and as people are moved from the city out towards Coolock, Finglas, Raheny, Donameade, Kilbarrack and the massive new town which is being planned for Blanchardstown, the Minister should seriously consider the erection of some accommodation for business on the north side.  There is a dreadful traffic situation involving people on the north side being stuck in the city centre while trying to travel to the south side.  They may work in one of the new office blocks built by some foreign company with foreign interests.  The Minister has great responsibility.  The lack of planning of these amenities on the north side of the city is a great tragedy and something which the Minister has possibly ignored.  Perhaps he has his own plans, but I do not think he has. I know that the population of the north side will increase and yet the amenities are not moving to keep step with the massive increase in population.</P>

    <P>It is a pity the Minister is not here tonight because in the autumn session of the Dáil I had to table 12 Questions before I could find out which Department was responsible for air pollution. After an initial denial the Minister eventually accepted that it was in fact the responsibility of the Department <Col N="2000" /> of Local Government.  It is a tragic state of affairs that air pollution in this city should have been allowed to get to the dreadfully dangerous stage it is at now where&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>We have a reasonable assurance that his Department is responsible for dealing with air pollution and this is an accepted fact.  Air pollution in Dublin has been completely uncontrolled and no legislation has been provided to deal with it.  I am anxious regarding water pollution and pollution of the sea but, as far as I am concerned, air pollution takes priority.  The smoke pollution in Dublin, as measured by one of the voluntary bodies, is twice that of London city.  I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary will agree that this is a dreadful state of affairs.  It is equivalent to the smoke pollution of Manchester and Sheffield, both of which have been regarded as emergency areas.  In fact, there is only one area in Europe that is conceivably worse than Dublin and that is the Ruhr Valley.  I am afraid it is even now too late for adequate legislation to rectify this matter.  When it was suggested a number of years ago that the cost of installing devices for the burning of smokeless fuels would be £7 per housing unit this was looked upon by the Minister for Local Government as being too expensive.  Now something drastic must be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2001" /> The pollution does not necessarily come from industry: in fact, much comes from private dwellings.  We appreciate that the Minister for Local Government, in collusion with the Minister who is responsible for Bord na Móna, would not like to see legislation introduced whereby consumption of briquettes was diminished.  However, we have got to rationalise&mdash;to decide whether we want to burn up our bogs or to burn up our chests, because research being carried on here at the moment shows there is a direct relationship between respiratory diseases and air pollution.  This research is also being very effectively carried out in Manchester and Birmingham where one day's fog was known to have indirectly caused 10,000 deaths when it was at its worst.  This is a fantastic figure and here we have the same problem.  One has only to drive up to the Dublin mountains at sunset and look down and see the smog which is settling down over the city.  Yet the Department of Local Government have not given priority to the problem of air pollution.  We are one of the worst cities in Europe in regard to smoke pollution and the measure of our sulphur pollution is equivalent to that of London.</P>
    <P>This is a matter on which I feel very strongly because one of the worst deaths a young person can suffer is a death from disease of the lungs caused by chronic bronchities&mdash;it is a long, slow and lingering death.  It is a problem that has only occurred to this great extent in the last 15 years and, whereas other cities in Europe are recognising this fact and doing something about it, we are doing nothing.  The situation is so bad that some Departments did not even know whether they were responsible for legislation to control air pollution.  That is an extreme point on which I do not wish to dwell but I would emphasise the fact that legislation for the control of fuels in this city is something that must have top priority in the Minister's portfolio.</P>
    <P>What situation would the Department of Local Government be in were it not for the voluntary bodies who are measuring air pollution?  However, those voluntary organisations are <Col N="2002" /> situated on an east-west line and cannot get an accurate figure for this city as a whole.  There is not any research available which could be statistically viable&mdash;if one did necessarily want viable statistical information&mdash;and it is up to the Department of Local Government to set up their own measuring stations around the city of Dublin in strategic areas.  The six existing measuring stations are situated in a straight line from east to west and the figures I have given are those from the Baggot Street area.  The results obtained by this voluntary body were brought to the attention of the Department of Local Government some years ago but nothing was done.  I should like the Minister in his reply to let us know some of the plans he may have to cope with this drastic situation.</P>
    <P>Regarding the preservation of the Georgian buildings in this city, this is a matter to which we should give full consideration.  It is very easy to knock down a building but extremely difficult to rebuild it.  With all the foreign firms who are coming in and erecting office blocks we should have regard to this heritage and not give in too easily to the economic and materialistic pressures of these foreign developers.  All further Georgian buildings should be investigated and possibly taken over by An Taisce for preservation; we should try, in this age of tourism, to develop certain parts of our city as Georgian showpieces and other buildings should be cleaned up and lighted during the tourist season.</P>
    <P>The following matter is possibly the responsibility of the Minister for the Gaeltacht.  Certain areas in County Kerry, where I worked, have not got electric light, have inaccessible roads, and the people are trained to be puppets for tourists in the Gaeltacht areas.  Their position is tragic: these people should get priority as regards the development of roads and the installation of electricity and water. Many of them have none of these things.  They are living very primitive lives in these Gaeltacht areas.  The conditions there amazed me when I worked as a doctor in the area some time ago.</P>
    <P>Another thing to which the Minister <Col N="2003" /> should give consideration is to the erection of a direct rail link between Dublin Airport and the centre of the city.  Many airports situated in proximity to large cities in Europe have, in fact, got such rail links.  A similar link here would relieve some of the traffic congestion on the north side of the city.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGeoghegan" hpid="Mr. Geoghegan Mr. Geoghegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Geoghegan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a matter for the Minister for Transport and Power.  It is not a matter for the Minister for Local Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne1969" hpid="Dr. Byrne Dr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister could consult with his colleague, the Minister for Transport and Power, to find a solution to the traffic problem on the north side and in the city generally.</P>
      <P>Many people are held up in their driving tests because of bureaucracy creeping into the mechanism of the driving test administration.  The streamlining of driving tests would be no harm at all.  It is a tragedy that the Harcourt Street rail link was closed at such a very important stage in the development of this city.  I know that is a matter for the Minister for Transport and Power but, if the line were still in existence, it would be a great asset now to the Minister for Local Government from the traffic congestion point of view.</P>
      <P>Deputy Foley talked about graveyards and their availability.  The north side of the city has fewer graveyards than the south side.  The north side has fewer amenities in general.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Road traffic accidents and fatalities continue to increase.  This is something to which we cannot give too much attention.  The problem is acute. If the present trend continues we will have injected into our society every year approximately 500 socially dependent accident victims.  The probability is that the figure will increase.  That has been the pattern in other countries and there is no reason to suppose it will be any different here.  We will also have to face an increase in the number of mentally retarded, physically handicapped and afficted children.  When housing is being planned facilities will have to be provided for them.  This is something of which the Department <Col N="2004" /> should now take note instead of waiting until the problem is beyond control.</P>
    <P>It is no harm to remind the Minister that in the week ending March 7th organisations representing a quarter of a million people will be marching in protest against the B-scale renting system.  They believe this system is unjust and incompatible with their conditions.</P>

      <P>If the Parliamentary Secretary will forgive me, I am not suggesting that what he said is untrue.  Far be it from me to do that and I think the Parliamentary Secretary should accept that more graciously than he has done.  What I am suggesting is that this House has a certain significance in the affairs of the nation and, at the moment, I think it should precede any deputation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The affairs of the city are proceeding normally&rdquo;&mdash;these words were uttered just a few moments ago in this debate by Deputy Timmons.  I do not know what city Deputy Timmons is living in.  I do not know what paper he reads.  I do not know what day he thinks it is but, in any case, this evening, Tuesday, March 3rd, 1970, over six columns in a paper not unknown to Deputies opposite these are the headlines: &ldquo;Airport Road Blockade&rdquo;; &ldquo;Rent War Hots Up in Dublin&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;As the Differential Rents war gathers momentum, with nation wide support for NATO's campaign against the system, it was announced this morning that a sit-down would be <Col N="2005" /> held by tenants at Santry tonight, on the Belfast Road&rdquo;.  That is in the Deputy's constituency, and mine.  I will not read the whole item, but this is the beginning of the coming to the surface of very widespread distress, and even desperation, in the housing estates all the way round from Coolock to Ballyfermot, as Deputy Timmons knows as well as I do, or better.</P>
    <P>At an earlier stage in this debate&mdash; this is one of the reasons why I am sorry the Minister is not here&mdash;the Minister, having threatened to cut me up&mdash;I do not know whether he meant metaphorically or physically&mdash;waved at me a paper about the Maoists, investigation into Maoists, or something of that kind, and I suppose we will be told in due course that the tenants who are engaged in this protest are Maoists.  I think Deputy Timmons at least knows that this is nonsense.  These people are his constituents, as they are mine, and they are out there not because of the thoughts of Chairman Mao but because of the conditions in places like Coolock.  These are ordinary people, serious people; they do not enjoy agitating for agitation's sake, but they have very serious conditions with which to contend and they are, at long last and after long and patient waiting, choosing this way to show how they feel about these conditions and to try to force some kind of investigation, some kind of inquiry into them, something different from the bland and complacent statements which we have had from people like the Minister and Deputy Timmons.</P>
    <P>This debate has been a very interesting and illuminating one.  I was not present for it all, as the Parliamentary Secretary, with complete propriety, reminded me.  Neither was the Minister present for it all, but those who were not present for the whole of the debate had an opportunity of reading the debate and I have read the whole debate to date.  It is full of interest, beginning with the important statement by the Minister himself, which deserves to be carefully, critically and widely examined, and continuing with a valuable series of interventions from these benches, beginning with Deputy <Col N="2006" /> Treacy and ending with an important and moving statement by Deputy Cluskey this evening.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer in particular and to recommend the reading of the very weighty, very thoughtful statement made by Deputy Garret FitzGerald in this debate.  I hope that the Minister, when he comes to reply, will answer the questions raised by Deputy FitzGerald in the detail they deserve and that he will not treat them in what is sometimes his rather offhand or peremptory way of dealing with questions or objections from the Opposition side, a manner which is not shared, I am glad to say, by his Parliamentary Secretary.</P>
    <P>Deputy FitzGerald said many things and I shall not go over that ground completely but I do want to pick out certain points and signify the agreement of those on these benches with the general tenor of this speech and in particular with certain major points he made.  I hope the Minister will answer what he had to say about the Buchanan Report and will not supply us simply with another stalling, offputting statement that a decision will be taken some day and it will then be conveyed to us.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that what is happening as regards this report, which was awaited for so long and remains in this curious political limbo, is that the Government are keeping their political options open so that they may do what it suits them to do in terms of their own political interests at some future moment, irrespective of what the report says, and if that fits the report at some point advantage will be taken of it; if not, then we will be told the Government are not committed to acceptance of the report.  The options are open and that, on a whole range of questions and policy, is the policy of the Government.</P>
    <P>I should like to turn to a particularly important aspect of the areas of responsibility covered by this Estimate and that is the question of land for development.  That is a very important constituent in the set of conditions which drove these people to sit or lie down on the Belfast Road tonight. The Minister had something to say <Col N="2007" /> about this question, something which is taken textually from a statement he made earlier in response to a question on this matter.  He said at column 595, Volume 4 of the Official Report:</P>
    <P>Before passing from the construction aspects of local authority housing work, I would like to comment on a feature which affects the progress and the cost of that work.  I have in mind in this regard the price and availability of sites.  The general problem of the rising cost of building land, which has been marked in some areas, is a cause of some considerable concern.  I have been giving careful thought to this problem with a view to finding some means whereby speculation in scarce, serviced land would be discouraged and the increase in the value of land, attributable to the provision of services and the designation of land for development by planning authorities to meet the needs of the community, would be recouped to the benefit of the community and not be turned to private profit.</P>
    <P>So far so good, but then comes the letdown. The Minister went on:</P>
    <P>The problem is a very complex and difficult one and there is no easy way of dealing with it.  It might appear that the obvious solution would be to bring all building land into public ownership, but this would entail the most serious constitutional, legal, financial and administrative problems and must be ruled out as a practical proposition.  Other measures to deal with the problem are being studied.</P>
    <P>At least we may say that there is in this a recognition of the existence of a problem and that may conceivably be at some future stage the beginning of something but there is also the standoff. This is terribly complex and difficult and there is no easy way of dealing with it, which means that the Minister has not yet decided that it is politically necessary to grasp this nettle.  It is possible that the things which are now happening, the pressure of the discontent in this city, will force if not the Minister at least his colleagues to recognise <Col N="2008" /> that they must take some action. There is one point which I should like to pick out and try to clarify.  It is where the Minister says: &ldquo;It might appear that the obvious solution would be to bring all building land into public ownership.&rdquo;  Now this was an issue in the general election and one on which the Labour Party policy, to which the Minister in his own way is referring here, was distorted.</P>
    <P>The policy of the Labour Party on land is very clearly set out in their programme &ldquo;The Labour Party&mdash;Outline Policy&rdquo; and I want to read this into the record because it has so often been twisted into this thing here, that the obvious solution would be to bring all building land into public ownership. What our policy says is something different and I think I have the right to set it out.  It appears on page 109 of this document which was approved by the annual conference in 1969.  It says:</P>
    <P>Labour believes that the use of land for social purposes should be subject to community control and that the present system of dealing in building land leads to speculation and exorbitant profits.</P>
    <P>The Minister is not in entire disagreement with that according to his statement. Our programme goes on:</P>
    <P>Society is frequently held up to ransom by being forced to pay greatly inflated prices for building lands and the cost of securing such land has seriously limited the ability of local authorities to secure adequate pools of land to meet their requirements.  Site costs at present are the main factor in the grossly inflated house prices and proposals to limit the cost of land would bring about considerable reduction in unit costs.  Society will benefit and in general those who will suffer are speculators and profiteers.  Labour will authorise local authorities to designate land for building purposes and all such land will be brought under community control at prices to be determined by the previous use of the land in question.</P>
    <P>That is the important sentence:</P>
    <P>Labour will authorise local authorities to designate land for building <Col N="2009" /> purposes and all such land will be brought under community control at prices to be determined by the previous use of the land in question.</P>

      <P>There are different wings in the Parliamentary Secretary's party also and some of them may be under strain.  Again on this issue of land, nothing is ruled out; mysterious, vague, constitutional difficulties are discerned as long as the Government intend, as they certainly intend at the moment, to do nothing about it, but we can be very sure that if the pressure of public opinion forces the Government to do something about this then these constitutional difficulties will be resolved in their minds and they will go ahead with it.

      <P>No, I was commenting on the possibility of human beings being able to acquire knowledge and information.  Deputy FitzGerald made some comments on the aspect about land and I quote what he said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Earlier, the planning that should have taken place did not take place and we are now in a position, as a result of the absence of developed land in the hinterland of Dublin, that the price of land has rocketed and that people engaged in speculating in land are profiteering for two reasons.  One is because the Government have made provision for and are putting in services, and owing to our economic system the profit accrues not to the public but to the owners of the land; the second is that all those people are making more money because the Government have put in services and, <Col N="2011" /> because of the artificial price of serviced land, prices have rocketed. One of the persons who has particular expertise in this sphere has given figures, and has given them to an official body, to the effect that the value of land in the hinterland of Dublin has been raised from £1,500 to £5,000 by the failure to provide adequate services for land.  The idea that the cost of a house should be increased by several hundred pounds because land is serviced or is not services seems to be ludicrous, one of the most peculiar examples of economic lunacy I have ever heard of.</P>
    <P>I should like to say I agree with what Deputy FitzGerald has said, with one significant reservation about economic lunacy.  I believe the policy faithfully and well described by Deputy FitzGerald is economic lunacy from the point of view of the people as a whole, from the social point of view, from the point of view of the community, but I do not believe that the Government or their friends who are engaged in this peculiar process of development are economic lunatics.  On the contrary, I believe they are quite sane people and that from their point of view the policy is sane.  There are people who are doing very well out of this; there are people whose interests are not the same as society as a whole, and the present Government and their associates are an integral part of that system. That is why they will not change it until they are forced to do so and nothing but the expression of the feeling of the people on this matter, growing all the time in this city and outside it, but particularly in this city, will bring about that necessary effect.</P>
    <P>The fact is that the Government have on the whole allowed the consequences of the expansion of the city to develop under general laws of <i>laissez-faire</i>.  One finds this going around my constituency. One sees it in people's houses when one talks to people at their doors; one sees it in every aspect of life in this expanding, grossly neglected city; but one sees it probably more clearly than anywhere else in those areas which should be public parks in newly <Col N="2012" /> developed estates.  I have in mind two parks not, I think, untypical parks. I use the worked parks in quotation marks.  One is in an area of open land in Coolock.  I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary knows it.  It is the Greencastle Road area.  It is a vast area.  Periodically machines go there to plough up its surface and it looks like a film set for a movie of the First World War.  It could be a very pleasant park for the enjoyment of the people in the area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGeoghegan" hpid="Mr. Geoghegan Mr. Geoghegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Geoghegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to interrupt the Deputy but I am sure he knows all parks are matters for the local authorities, not the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>This puts me in something of a dilemma because effectively this Government have abolished for the time being the local authority in question and have, in their wisdom, taken over the administrative responsibility for this area.  Having taken over this responsibility, surely they must answer to the House for it?</P>

      <P>This is somewhat strange.  When I interviewed some officials about this in 28 Castle Street they told me, among other things, when I asked them about priorities for park development, that they deplored the necessity for them to determine priorities in present circumstances because of the destruction of Dublin Corporation.  These men who appeared to be very co-operative, dedicated officials, said this in the course of conversation with me.  I presumed they knew what they were doing.  They said that in days before the corporation were abolished one of the useful things they could do was to help in assigning priorities in respect of parks.  Of course here I speak subject to the direction of the Parliamentary Secretary in these matters.  He has the facts at his fingertips. However, that is what they said, whatever technicalities may be invoked about this or that local authority, existing or abolished.</P>

      <Col N="2013" /> Surely, within the framework of the debate on the Estimate for the Department of Local Government I should be able to discuss matters which are of great importance to the lives of the people in this city and in particular my own constituency?  I should have a right, I think, to talk here about <Col N="2014" /> matters pertaining to that area.  The Parliamentary Secretary nods and I thank him for that signification.</P>
    <P>Progress reported; Committee to sit again.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.30 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Wednesday, 4th March, 1970.</P>

Exceptionally recognition has been accorded since 1950 to one organisation whose political affiliation subsisted prior to 1st April, 1949.  The Minister has no information as to what contribution this organisation makes to political party funds except that under an agreement of general application ordinary membership subscriptions to it are deducted from the pay of members; moneys collected under this arrangement may not in any circumstances be applied to subscriptions to any political organisation.</P>
