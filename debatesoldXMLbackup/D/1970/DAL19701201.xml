    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he will consider establishing a special hospital unit in Dublin city for the treatment of accident cases only.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>A hospital or hospital unit which is suitable for treatment of major accident cases must have facilities and staff providing for the investigation and treatment of a wide range of conditions involving consultants in the medical and surgical fields.  It would <Col N="2" /> not be desirable under present conditions to set up a hospital which concentrated solely on the treatment of patients who had been involved in accidents.</P>
      <P>The Report of the Consultative Council on the General Hospital Services recommended that major accident work in Dublin should be based upon the two main hospital groups which the report recommended for the city. The council also advised that separate accident hospitals should not be set up.</P>
      <P>At present the victims of accidents which occur on week-days in Dublin are normally taken to the nearest surgical hospital.  For night-time and weekends, accident cover is provided by five hospitals which operate on a rota basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister state if the general hospitals would be able to cope with a major disaster? Would their accident service be able to cope with any major disaster that <Col N="3" /> might occur?  It is a purely hypothetical question, I admit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as I know, they would be able to cope with a major disaster.  As the Deputy knows, in some cases the Richmond Hospital looks after accident patients where they have brain injuries.  There are some five hospitals working on a rota system for accidents and emergencies conveyed by the Dublin Fire Brigade ambulances.  I imagine that if there were a major disaster, even although they work on a rota system, the five hospitals that are used for accidents would be able to deal with the situation. I would hope such a situation will not arise.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasGODonnell" hpid="Mr. T. O'Donnell Mr. T. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Transport and Power whether his attention has been drawn to a statement that CIE have placed in Britain or are about to place an order for new railway carriages; if so, if he will state why this order has not been placed in Ireland; and if he will make a statement clarifying the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers (for the Minister for Transport and Power) Mr. Childers (for the Minister for Transport and Power)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers (for the Minister for Transport and Power)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by CIE that having sought tenders they placed an order for 62 railway carriages with a British firm on 31st October, 1970.  No tender for the carriages was received from any Irish firm.  Because of shortage of skilled craft workers CIE cannot, at present, undertake carriage building but if the position in that respect eases they will endeavour to negotiate with the supplier to have a proportion of the work carried out at Inchicore.  CIE inform me that discussions are still taking place with the trade unions to see how staff shortages might be overcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that CIE made many skilled workers redundant and that, if there were a shortage, it would be the fault of CIE rather than that of the workers? Is he aware that in August as many as 20 fitters who applied for employment were turned down and that at a seminar on 8th October, when the question of <Col N="4" /> overtime was raised, the workers were told there could be no question of overtime as CIE had never been better off for skilled workers?  How does he reconcile these facts with his statement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has only one side of the story in regard to this matter.  It is a matter which dates back for a very considerable time.  I do not want to prejudice the discussions that are still taking place with the trade unions to see how staff shortages might be overcome and it would serve no purpose for me to give the House the very long history relating to the whole problem.  All I can say is that a number of the trade union officials in the CIE group are still anxious to have negotiations in order that a proportion of the work can be carried out.  I do not propose to comment further.  There has been a great deal of press comment but, as the Deputy knows, there are at least two sides to this question.  For me to comment, particularly in the absence of the Minister, would be entirely wrong.  If the Deputy chooses to press this matter I would ask him to question the Minister next week and then perhaps, if the Minister thinks that because of the Deputy's allegations he must give the full history of the case, he can in his own right do so.  I should prefer to see these negotiations continuing in order to ensure that as much as possible of this type of work can be done through the contractor in the Inchicore engineering works.  The whole question goes back a very long distance; it relates not to what the Deputy suggests but to the facilities for building all-steel carriages.  It is a complex matter. I do not propose to make the position worse than it is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister say if a firm in Dundalk built some of these carriages a short time ago, if they put in a tender in this particular instance and if their tender got the consideration it deserved?  They did put in a tender and as far as I know they were not told whether their tender was accepted or not accepted and there were no further negotiations, which seems a pity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not tell the Deputy whether they were informed or <Col N="5" /> not but I imagine they were.  A firm in Dundalk did get a contract for heating vans some years ago.  They tendered for a new contract and their tender, I understand, was so high as compared with the others that even allowing for the normal percentage preference given to Irish firms it was not possible for CIE to award the contract to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that it could do more harm than good to go into great detail while negotiations are still in progress but there is one aspect I should like to press on the Minister. Is he aware that there is in fact no shortage of coach builders of whom there are 100 there, only 20 less than the maximum there have ever been, and could he say, therefore, whether, while the negotiations proceed with regard to the other matters, at least the coach building work on the under-frames could be immediately allocated to the Inchicore works as there is no problem in that respect?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as I know this relates to the building of all-steel railway carriages.  Whatever staffs there are whose particular duties relate to certain skills the difficulty is in finding the skill to build all-steel carriages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1961" hpid="Mr. P. Belton Mr. P. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>When CIE made it known that there was a shortage of skilled workers, surely at that stage the Minister for Labour should have come in and negotiated between the unions and CIE and not have waited until the order was given out?  Surely something should have been done three or four years ago?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to prejudice this matter.  I would prefer not to say anything more about it.  It does go back a considerable distance and I think if the Deputy were in the place of the Minister for Labour he would find that whatever negotiations took place would have to take place between the company and the Group Union Committee representing all the unions and, in consequence, further down with the various craft unions.  I do not think the Minister for Labour could have expedited the negotiations any more&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it a fact that the unions were never even told how many additional workers were required to be upgraded?  Does it not appear that CIE did not negotiate seriously in this matter? Is there not, therefore, a case for intervening now to make sure that any negotiations entered into are serious negotiations?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy can be assured that the negotiations are very serious.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it the case that the position has been prejudiced?  Has an order been given or is it still possible to retrieve the position if negotiations are successful?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>

If there is anything he can do which would bring these parties closer together in order to resolve this problem I am quite certain he will do it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Transport and Power if he will state in respect of the Bord na Móna Regular Works Employees Superannuation (Amendment) No. 4 Scheme 1970 (a) the date on which the outline proposals for the scheme were received in his Department; (b) the date on which the draft amending scheme was received in his Department; and (c) the date on which the scheme, which is effective from 4th June, 1970, was approved; and, if the scheme has not yet been approved, if he will state the reason for the great delay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Outline proposals for the new pension scheme for Bord na Móna regular workers were received from Bord na Móna on 14th October, 1969.  Following compliance with the statutory procedure a draft amending scheme was received from the board on 25th May, 1970.  The Minister for Finance and I agreed, as the Deputy is aware, that the new scheme would operate from 4th June, 1970.  Bord na Móna were so informed on 2nd June, 1970.  There were, however, a number of points in the draft scheme which required settlement with the board and the Minister for Finance.  These have now been resolved and the formal scheme will be made very shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>What would the Minister call &ldquo;very shortly&rdquo; in view of the fact that it is over 12 months since the draft scheme was first submitted?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not got the exact particulars of the date but as the scheme will go back to 4th June, 1970, the Deputy can be satisfied that no one will lose any privileges by whatever short delay takes place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Tánaiste <Col N="8" /> is aware of the fact that a retired worker cannot live on the promise that something will go back a few months. He must pay for his groceries at least and he cannot do that while the scheme is still before the Minister for Finance.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that many thousands of election addresses were sent to people in the Mount Merrion area and that the residents of South County Dublin are perturbed about receiving election addresses at their own expense?

      <P>Is the Minister aware that 35,000 officially printed election addresses, copies of which are available to this House and to Deputy Dowling, were issued through the post? This may be verified by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.  Those election addresses were sent out on good quality art paper by trade union labour in an official printing firm in this city and were issued to a number of families in the area in which I live.  I issued a circular by my own hand, as is the normal practice for Deputies in this House, in support of a candidate, bringing him to the attention of local residents in the area in which I live. Such issuing of occasional circulars in no way compares with the tremendous use of State cars&mdash;&mdash;</P>

As I pointed out to Deputy O'Sullivan in the original answer to the question, there is no preliminary scheme.

      <P>The issue of approved schemes of work under the Land Project in the south Wexford area in recent months was somewhat held up due mainly to urgent seasonal inspections under the Beef Cattle Incentive Bonus Scheme and also to absence of a senior officer on sick leave and the resignation of one of the staff in the area.

      <P>The conciliation conference to which the Deputy refers was considering an application for a wage increase by employees of the Drogheda Board of Conservators and this had to be dealt with in the context of similar applications on behalf of boards throughout the State generally.  The officer referred to in the question was present on the invitation of the conciliation service of the Labour Court.

What the ITGWU or anybody else does is a matter for themselves.

        <i>EEC Countries</i>
      </P>
      <P>The latest information available in the case of member countries of the EEC is in a study prepared by the European Centre for Public Enterprise based on statistics for the year 1963. Employment in public enterprise in each member country and the percentage which it represents of total employment by public and private enterprise is shown in the attached table.</P>
      <P>The main manufacturing industries in which the public sector participated were construction of motor vehicles and aircraft in France, shipbuilding and manufacture of motor vehicles in Germany, metal industry in Holland, metal industry and manufacture of transport equipment in Italy.  Public participation in manufacturing industry is negligible in Belgium and Luxembourg.</P>
      <P>Information is not available about the capitalisation of public industrial enterprise in the EEC.  In 1963 public enterprise accounted for 25 per cent of the total amount devoted to investment by the industrial and commercial sectors in the EEC.</P>

      <P>Some 8,000 to 10,000 children in the South County Dublin Constituency are out of school all this week and because of the Feast of the Immaculate Conception they will be out of school next Tuesday as well.  It is ridiculous in an age when prefabricated polling booths can be erected that schools should be shut from Monday to Friday inclusive.  Will the Minister make sufficient moneys available to returning officers so that schools would be shut from, say, 3 p.m. on Tuesday until 9 a.m. on Friday?  It should be possible to put up the equipment and take it down in three days.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if he proposes to give a loan of £17,000 from the Local Loans Fund to the New Ross Urban District Council, County Wexford, in order that they would be able to pay for a site acquired at Barrack Lane, New Ross, for the provision of swimming pool, ball alley, cafeteria, library, fire station, museum, conference hall, office blocks and housing; and if he will define another source from which a loan of £17,000 should be sought.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>Local Loans Fund moneys are reserved for the financing of major capital works involving heavy capital outlay and are not normally available for meeting the cost of land acquisition as proposed in this case.</P>
      <P>The other sources from which local authorities normally seek loans for this purpose are their treasurers or other agencies such as insurance companies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>Money from the Local Loans Fund is not normally made available to meet the cost of land acquisition in cases of this kind.  When the land has been acquired there will be a fair share of demands on State funds from the point of view of assistance, but at this stage it is felt that the urban council should endeavour to negotiate the loan from their treasurers or some other source.</P>

      <P>That the Committee of Public Accounts shall examine specially the expenditure of the Grant-in-Aid for Northern Ireland Relief issued from Subhead J, Vote 16 (Miscellaneous Expenses) for 1969-70 and shall furnish a separate report on this expenditure as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>This motion requires some comment before the House disposes of it.  The matter it is proposed to refer to the Committee of Public Accounts is a matter which has already attracted very considerable public attention.  Because of its nature it is a matter of considerable significance and the manner of its proposed reference to the Committee of Public Accounts is slightly unusual.</P>

      <P>If I might <Col N="46" /> answer the Parliamentary Secretary's query, the matter to be debated on this motion is whether the expenditure of the Grant-in-Aid should be referred for examination and report to the Committee of Public Accounts.  The matter itself cannot be discussed in the House; it is only a question of whether we should send it to the Committee of Public Accounts or whether we should not.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to interrupt the leader of the Opposition. I do not want to stifle any debate, but I thought it would be better if the matter went to the Committee of Public Accounts and then possibly the House could debate it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no desire to prevent the Committee of Public Accounts discussing this, but I have, I think, a duty to direct the attention of the House to certain limitations which apply to Select Committees and also to the operations of the Committee of Public Accounts.  Deputies who have been members of the Committee of Public Accounts are probably aware of these limitations.</P>
      <P>As I say, this is a serious matter.  It is somewhat unusual to proceed to have a special or a particular investigation by the Committee of Public Accounts in advance of the normal Appropriation Accounts being referred to it for investigation.  The particular limitation to which I want to direct the attention of the House applies by long-established convention to Grants-in-Aid, as they are called, and that convention goes back as far as 1896.  It is important that the House should be aware of this limitation.  I shall quote for the House Appendix No. 16 to the Third Report of the Committee of Public Accounts in the year 1896 which is entitled &ldquo;Grants in Aid&rdquo;. Briefly, the procedure is that the Public Accounts Committee does not go behind or beyond the Accounting Officer's certificate in respect of a Grant-in-Aid.  That is a particular limitation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The strictly conditional manner in which provision for public services is made by Parliament constitutes <Col N="47" /> one of the cardinal principles of our financial system.</P>
    <P>1.  Not only may no grants be exceeded without fresh Parliamentary authority, accorded by a supplementary or excess grant; but the only sums which are chargeable against grants must actually come in course of payment within the financial year to which the grants relate; and consequently any portion of the grant unexpended and remaining in the hands of the Accounting Officer on the 31st March, is returnable to the Exchequer, the surrender being, for the purposes of convenience, usually effected by a write-off of the unexpended sum against the grant of a subsequent year.</P>
    <P>Now, this is the important part:</P>
    <P>2.  The expenditure within the Parliamentary Grants has to be accounted for in detail by the Accounting Officer, and his account of the appropriation of the money, which is called the &ldquo;Appropriation Account&rdquo;, is directed by Statute to be examined on behalf of the House of Commons by the Comptroller and Auditor General&mdash;</P>
    <P>This, of course, has been changed by the Standing Orders which apply in our case.</P>
    <P>&mdash;who has to ascertain and report whether the conditions attaching to the grant have been complied with, and vouchers for payments are forthcoming.</P>
    <P>In the case, however, of one form of grant, that is, of grants which are technically called &ldquo;Grants-in-Aid&rdquo;, the conditions are less strict.  For, while such grants, which are in the nature of subscriptions or contributions, must like ordinary grants, be paid away within the year by the Accounting Officer, the receipt for the money in the lump, which he obtains from the grantee or grantees, is held to be a sufficient discharge; and the expenditure in detail is not necessarily followed up by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  I say &ldquo;not necessarily&rdquo;, because in these cases, though the Comptroller and Auditor General is often required, <Col N="48" /> under Section 33 of the Exchequer and Audit Departments Act, to examine and audit the account of the grantee, yet his statutory duty, in the absence of such requirement, is confined to seeing that the Accounting Officer is entitled to claim credit for his payment to the grantees.</P>
    <P>I direct the attention of the House to that Appendix to the Third Report because it has been since then the practice in respect of the Committee of Public Accounts and there is, therefore, an obvious limitation on the extent of the investigation, or investigations, which the Public Accounts Committee can make.</P>
    <P>There are, in addition, other restrictions on the powers of the Committee of Public Accounts.  As the House is aware, under Standing Orders the Committee of Public Accounts is selected from the different parties in the House. It has been the established practice for the chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts to be a Deputy of the Opposition rather than a Government Deputy.  The report of the committee can be approved only if it is assented to by the committee, or a majority of the committee, and, under Standing Orders, in the event of there being&mdash;I quote Standing Order No. 71&mdash;&ldquo;an equality of votes the question shall be decided in the negative&rdquo;.  This, I think, has rarely happened but, because of the special nature of this investigation, it is right the House should be aware of these limitations.</P>
    <P>The normal procedure is for the chairman to submit to the members a draft report.  Frequently that report is considered at more than one meeting and very often it is amended.  Finally, the report, as approved, is signed by the chairman and becomes the Report of the Committee of Public Accounts. Because of the terminology of the Standing Order, as applicable to either the Committee of Public Accounts or to any other Select Committee, in the event of a majority of the members not accepting the chairman's draft report or in the event of an equality of votes on any matter, then the question is decided in the negative.</P>
    <P>Although the committee may investigate the subject matter of the reference <Col N="49" /> included in the motion, the Grant-in-Aid for Northern Ireland issued from Subhead J, Vote 16 (Miscellaneous Expenses) for 1969-70, the precise terms of reference of the investigation have not been laid down other than anticipating that the Committee of Public Accounts will in the normal way investigate the matter; but, because of the limitation to which I have referred in the Appendix to the Third Report, which has governed the practice and procedure of the Committee of Public Accounts up to now, there is an obvious danger.  As the procedure is at the moment&mdash;this is an important matter for the House to consider&mdash;the Committee of Public Accounts will not normally go beyond the certificate of the Accounting Officer that the Grant-in-Aid has been paid and that he has got a receipt from the grantee.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I want to draw the attention of the House to the deficiencies in this procedure and to the possible need to provide certain additional powers for the Committee.  As the House is aware, under Standing Orders a Select Committee empowered to send for persons, papers and records may report its opinions and observations, together with the minutes of evidence taken before it, to the Dáil and also make a special report of any matters which it may think fit to bring to the notice of the Dáil.</P>
    <P>Under the procedure adopted in two earlier Select Committees, certain decisions were taken.  So far as I am aware the first was in respect of the Moneylenders Bill, 1929.  The Select Committee appointed decided in April, 1930, that witnesses would be allowed to bring advisers, including solicitors, but that it should not hear counsel.  At a later date the Select Committee on Mining Leases decided in July, 1935, that the Committee, if it wished, could hear counsel.</P>
    <P>Under the Oireachtas Witnesses Oaths Act, 1924, provision was made for each of the Houses of the Oireachtas and any Committee of either House and any Joint Committee of both Houses to administer oaths to witnesses.  There are penalties in the event of the witness giving false evidence. However, there is one notable <Col N="50" /> deficiency in that provision in that there is no power to compel a witness to attend before the Committee.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the motion before the House possibly suffers from a number of technical deficiencies.  Under the established procedure of the Committee of Public Accounts governed by the Minutes of the Appendix to the Third Report of 1896, it has not been the practice of the Public Accounts Committee to go behind the Grant-in-Aid. In other words, the practice has been that the Comptroller and Auditor General accepts the certificate of the accounting officer that the money has been paid to the grantee.  Under the provision of the Standing Orders I have quoted, in the event of an equality of votes on the Committee the report will be in the negative.  Lastly, under the Act I have quoted there is no power to compel the attendance of any witness to give evidence, although there is power if a witness attends to require him to give evidence on oath.</P>
    <P>Without going into the matters with which this motion deals, according to the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance in answer to questions here there are other investigations being undertaken by the Garda.  The House is entitled to know whether it is proposed to furnish to the Committee the results of these investigations and whether all the documents and records will be put before it.  It is important to clarify this point because all that is provided in the motion before the House is:</P>
    <P>That the Committee of Public Accounts shall examine specially the expenditure of the Grant-in-Aid for Northern Ireland Relief issued from Subhead J, Vote 16 (Miscellaneous Expenses) for 1969-70 and shall furnish a separate report on this expenditure as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>There is not included in the terms of this motion any power or directive to send for persons, papers and records. The established procedure of the Public Accounts Committee, long sanctioned by usage, is that the accounting officer, usually the Secretary of the Department concerned, is entitled to bring along and frequently asks permission of the <Col N="51" /> Committee to allow a subordinate official of his Department to answer specific queries on particular aspects of the matters under discussion.</P>
    <P>The established recognised procedure so far as this country is concerned and the established procedure in Britain since 1896 is that once a Grant-in-Aid payment is vouched for, and the receipts accounted for by the accounting officer as having been paid to the grantee, that is the end of the matter. The House and the country should be aware of the very serious limitations in the established practices and procedure. They have not been extended by the terms of this motion; in fact, it is quite terse in its phraseology.  Although there is the implication that the Committee of Public Accounts is investigating the circumstances in which this money was expended, and the manner in which it was spent, now is the time for the House to realise that on the established procedure that has operated the Committee of Public Accounts would not normally go beyond the actual terms of the receipt issued by the accounting officer.  It is essential at this stage that this aspect of the matter should be mentioned.</P>
    <P>Attention should also be drawn to the fact that a committee of the House, or for that matter the Dáil itself, may deliberate in public or in private.  It is the practice of select committees, including the Committee of Public Accounts, to deliberate in private.  The report is subsequently made public, including the minutes of evidence and any observations the Committee may make.  In this instance I believe there is a strong case for hearing the evidence in public but the Committee might appropriately, and possibly more effectively, deliberate in private.</P>
    <P>However, having regard to the practice now in operation and in the absence of a definite decision to the contrary, the position is that committees of this character operate in private but make the report public.  I believe that it is right that these aspects of the present situation should be brought before the House for consideration. The House is entitled to an <Col N="52" /> assurance on behalf of the Government, whether by the Taoiseach or some authorised Minister, that all the facts relating to this matter, and including the Garda investigation which has already taken place, will be made available to the Committee, and that, if necessary, powers will be taken to compel the attendance of witnesses. Lastly, and not of least importance, there should be no attempt to frustrate the report of the Committee by a negative finding.  This is a matter which involves the whole credit of Parliament and the accountability of public expenditure.  General experience has shown that the Committee of Public Accounts has functioned in the past in a non-political way.  However, this is the first investigation of a character such as this, where special reference was made as distinct from the normal reference of the Appropriation Accounts, which are normally considered approximately one year or even 18 months in arrears.  In this particular case the special reference is unusual. For that reason it is important that all aspects of the situation should be fully considered by the Dáil before deciding that the procedure adopted is the most likely to achieve the result which, I believe, is in the public interest.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>At first glance this motion which has been moved by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach seems harmless, even though it is unusual that a matter such as that contained in the motion should be referred to the Committee of Public Accounts. There are a few points which disturb the Labour Party in so far as this motion is concerned.  Not the least of them is that the public would not be kept informed from day to day while the Committee is sitting.  My view, and the view of my party, is that no matter what investigation there is to be, it should be conducted in the full glare of publicity.  I must confess we are very suspicious of this apparently harmless motion.  I would prefer if the Government would propose that there should be a Special Committee of the House appointed to investigate the subject matter of this motion.  During the famous debate in May last I proposed, in respect of the allegations that <Col N="53" /> arms were illegally imported into this country, that a Select Committee of the Dáil should be appointed.  That was rejected by the Taoiseach.  In view of what has happened since last May I believe the Taoiseach should seriously consider the appointment of such a committee as per Standing Orders of this House.</P>
      <P>It has been said that this Committee would have no real power to call witnesses or to demand papers or records to be given to them.  During the past 12 months, when the accounts of the Department of Justice were being considered by the Committee of Public Accounts, one distinguished civil servant refused to pass over a particular file to the Committee or to the auditors. I believe that this proposed Committee would be far too limited in its scope and its terms of reference in investigating what has come to be regarded as a near scandal.  There is doubt surrounding the expenditure.  The doubts have been hinted at by the Taoiseach himself. There have been veiled suggestions and innuendoes to the effect that the money was misspent.  Why is this course being adopted now?  In May last the Taoiseach said he had certain information which suggested that certain members of his Cabinet should be dismissed. The Taoiseach also suggested that the information he had would be given to the Attorney General in order that the Attorney General might decide whether there should be a prosecution.  The Attorney General decided that there should be a prosecution.  We all know now what the conclusions of that trial were and what happened to the Taoiseach's allegations.  There is now a shadow of suspicion over those who were charged with the spending of the £100,000.  Why was this tidy little method of trying to determine what happened decided on?  I am very disappointed that the Parliamentary Secretary merely moved item No. 3 on the Order Paper.  He would have saved the House time if he had expanded a little more, for the benefit of Deputies and for the benefit of the public, on what the real functions and powers of the Committee of Public Accounts would be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would, therefore, suggest that the <Col N="54" /> Taoiseach should treat this matter a little more seriously than it appears it is being treated now.  If the Taoiseach has certain information, or if as a result of the Garda investigation he has more convincing information, why would he not adopt the course which he adopted last May?  Why not refer the matter to the Attorney General to see whether or not some criminal action has been committed?  On that particular occasion in May last the Taoiseach refused to have a Committee of the House set up.  The Taoiseach preferred to be a little more pure-souled and sent the information which he had to the Attorney General.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the Leas-Cheann Comhairle is empowered under the Rules of the House to accept an amendment, but if I have his permission I would add an amendment proposing that a Committee of the House should be appointed to investigate the expenditure of the £100,000.  It has been pointed out that this Committee could make its own set of rules, could decide that all the records and papers involved would be at the disposal of the Committee.  The Dáil should direct that the investigation be in public.  Certainly, there is doubt and suspicion about the expenditure of this sum.  I am satisfied, and my party are satisfied, that this is the best and cleanest method of investigating this matter.  We would re-echo the call we made last May.  We ask that the Government accept the suggestion of a 17-man Committee of the House to investigate the expenditure of the £100,000 which was supposed to be for the relief of people in Northern Ireland.</P>

      <P>I wish to deal briefly with the main points mentioned by Deputy Cosgrave and by Deputy Corish.  I agree that the country is entitled to know what the functions of this Committee will be.  I refute any suggestion or allegation, as made by Deputy Corish, that we, on this side of the House, are trying to stifle any matters relating to this particular situation. Two main points have been mentioned. They are the question of the Grant-in-Aid and the question of dealing with this matter in public.  These points have been referred to by Deputy <Col N="55" /> Cosgrave, Leader of the Opposition and by Deputy Corish, Leader of the Labour Party.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Cosgrave's first point was that normally, and under the precedents under which the Committee operate, there is, in effect, no examination of a Grant-in-Aid.  I think it would be fair to describe it in that way. However, I would draw the attention of the House to the wording of the motion which is as follows:</P>
      <P>That the Committee of Public Accounts shall examine specially the expenditure of the Grant-in-Aid for Northern Ireland Relief issued from Subhead J, Vote 16 (Miscellaneous Expenses) for 1969-70 and shall furnish a separate report on this expenditure as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>It seems to me that the wording of the motion makes it quite clear that the procedure which would normally apply in the examination of a Grant-in-Aid by the Committee would not apply in this case because the House would have decided to get the Committee specially to examine this particular Grant-in-Aid and the expenditure under it.</P>
      <P>The next point made by Deputy Cosgrave was, I think, in relation to the power to compel attendance of witnesses. There is, it seems to me, some slight area of doubt in this field as to the powers of the Committee.  I do not think the suggestion of a Select Committee of the House will overcome that doubt or that difficulty.  It does seem to me that there is a great deal to be said for the House to follow, as far as possible, the normal procedure which they would adopt in the investigation of expenditure of any moneys voted by this House: to use the machinery which we have in that regard&mdash;the Committee of Public Accounts&mdash;over which, as Deputy Cosgrave pointed out, traditionally, a member of one of the Opposition Parties is chairman.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a lot to be said for using the normal existing procedure.  I do not think we should anticipate that that procedure will be inadequate for the purposes required.  If it should transpire that the procedure is inadequate for the reason mentioned&mdash;a lack of power to compel attendance of witnesses&mdash;it <Col N="57" /> seems to me that it is open to the Committee to come back to the House and for the House to decide what action, if any, should be taken in that regard. There is a great deal of force in the argument that we should as far as possible utilise our normal existing machinery.  I have a feeling that, as far as the public are concerned, this is what they would expect us to do and that to adopt any other procedure might well raise certain doubts as to whether we were not adopting another procedure for ulterior motives.  I think that as far as possible this expenditure should be examined in the same way as all other expenditure incurred under the authority of this House is examined.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of disclosure to the Committee, I would refer the House to a statement I made on 26th November, 1970, in reply to questions by Deputy FitzGerald.  It appears in the Official Report at column 2326 and is as follows:</P>
    <P>If this motion is adopted the Committee of Public Accounts will be in a position to examine the various transactions connected with the Grant-in-Aid.  While a detailed account is not, generally speaking, submitted to the committee in respect of expenditure from a Grant-in-Aid, my Department will, in this case, provide for the committee full details of the payments made, together with all other information available from its records or obtained from the gardaí.</P>
    <P>It is our intention to make available to the Committee all the information that we have available.</P>
    <P>The question of the procedure to be adopted by the Committee&mdash;in particular, whether their hearings should be in public or in private&mdash;is a matter for the Committee themselves.  I would think it wise for the House to leave it to the discretion of the Committee to decide which procedure should be adopted in that regard.  If there is dissatisfaction with the procedure of the Committee, there is another way of dealing with it.  I do not anticipate any difficulty in this regard.  The reason I suggest that, rather than direct the Committee in this and that it ought to <Col N="58" /> be left to their discretion, is, as Deputies are aware, that certain names may crop up in connection with this investigation which most Deputies would prefer were not published.  This is a possibility.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is possible that the Committee might take the view that some names&mdash;in particular of people in Northern Ireland&mdash;which might crop up in connection with this matter should not be published.  This, of course, does not mean that the details should not be made available to the Committee nor does it mean that the Committee are bound to decide that such names should not be published.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to me better that the members of the Committee should be allowed to get the detailed statements which they will get from my Department and, having considered those, then they might be in a better position to decide what should or should not be made public.  I do not wish to tie the hands of the Committee in any way, either to full publication or to no publication or to partial publication.  I am suggesting that it would be better that the Committee should get the opportunity of looking at the information available before they make such a decision.  This would be in accordance with our normal procedure.  While one could anticipate certain difficulties, in certain circumstances, it might well be that such difficulties will not arise at all.  If they do arise, the matter can <Col N="59" /> come back to the House and the House can decide what to do.  If they do not arise, there is a great deal to be said for following our normal procedure in this regard.</P>
    <P>I would also point out that a number of Deputies from the other side of the House from time to time have asked the Government to refer this matter to the Committee of Public Accounts.  In particular, Deputy Cosgrave has done so in his question No. 108 on 29th October this year when he asked the Minister for Finance &ldquo;if, in view of the growing public disquiet at the disclosure of irregular expenditure of money voted by Dáil Éireann being applied for purposes other than those covered by the Vote of the Dáil, he will refer the matter for special investigation by the Committee of Public Accounts as a matter of urgency&rdquo;. This motion does precisely that: it refers it to the Committee of Public Accounts as a matter for special investigation and as a matter of urgency.  That is indicated by the terms of the motion which calls for a separate report as soon as possible.  We are doing precisely what Deputy Cosgrave asked us to do and what other Deputies also asked us to do.</P>
    <P>I mention that because I think it is important that no suggestion should be allowed go forth from this House that the Government's approach to this matter is in any way motivated other than towards ensuring that this House, which is the supreme authority in regard to the voting of public moneys, will be given full authority and full facility to investigate this matter.  If the procedure we are adopting is the one suggested by the Leader of Fine Gael, whatever else may be said about it, it cannot be said that it is designed as a method to ensure some advantage to the Government.  If we are adopting precisely the suggestion made by Deputy Cosgrave it cannot be disputed that we are doing it in such a way that no advantage or disadvantage will accrue to any party in this House as a result.  Anybody who is concerned with the House and with its standing, having examined the position can, I think, only come to the conclusion that <Col N="60" /> the correct procedure for this House to adopt in present circumstances is the one enshrined in this motion and the one suggested to us by Deputy Cosgrave.</P>

      <P>First, I should like to say to the Minister for Finance and to the Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Andrews, that if there was any misunderstanding&mdash;there seemed to be some on the question of the taking of this motion which came up last week&mdash; it was a genuine misunderstanding.  As far as our side of the House was concerned it was not understood that any formal approach had been made to take this motion quickly.  Had that been understood, we would have been more than willing to accept it.  It was a genuine misunderstanding.  In the heat of the moment we, perhaps, spoke more strongly to each other than the facts justified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Secondly, it is important that this matter should be debated here in the same spirit as the Committee of Public Accounts conduct their own debates.  I have been a member of that Committee for upwards of a year and I have been impressed by the way in which debates are conducted. By and large, I think if there were an audience, which there has not been for the ordinary meetings, the audience would not easily detect which were the Opposition Deputies and which were the Government Deputies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that in the presence of an audience the debate might be different.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I completely accept that that could happen.  But from the way members of all parties have spoken it is unlikely.  It is fair to say that the Committee have always carried out their functions impartially and I think we should debate the matter here in the same way.  The Government should appreciate that on this side of the House we are concerned that through no inadvertence should any failure occur in carrying out this particular function.  The points Deputy <Col N="61" /> Cosgrave raised are all valid ones, ones that need attention, and ones to which the Minister has directed himself, but there are one or two further things I should like to take up.</P>
      <P>The power to compel attendance of witnesses does not appear to exist at present.  The Minister feels there is some doubt about this and I think a doubt is sufficient to make it difficult for the Committee to proceed should any witness refuse to attend.  He said that in such circumstances the matter could be brought back to the House by the Committee.  I think he could have gone further and I hope the Parliamentary Secretary's reply will go further to say that if such a difficulty arose the Government would initiate the necessary legislation to deal with the matter by extending, for example, the powers to compel witnesses' attendance under the Tribunals of Inquiry Act, 1931. We are entitled to an assurance that this would be done and I think the Minister implied this in what he said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>May I interrupt?  What I tried to convey was that we should not anticipate the difficulties but if the kind of difficulties we both anticipate did arise then they could, I think, be approached in at least two if not three different ways.  I suggest that if such a difficulty occurred that would be the time to consider which of these ways would be the best way to approach it. The House can certainly have my assurance on behalf of the Government that it is our intention to take such steps as are necessary to make a full investigation possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I take that assurance to mean that while the Minister does not want to commit himself to a particular method of compelling attendance of witnesses the Government do not intend to allow this inquiry to be vitiated by the refusal of witnesses to attend?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Minister that there is no need to anticipate this problem which may not arise.  I also put it to him that it has been necessary to get his assurance and his &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; just given is important <Col N="62" /> because some witnesses might be minded not to appear but if they know their intention will be frustrated by the House because the Government have given this assurance, then I think the difficulty will not arise at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I was going to add one slight qualification and it is this.  While this debate at the moment is being conducted on the kind of level on which I should like to see it conducted, the Deputy will appreciate&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>You may thank us for that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I think you can thank this side of the House also for a certain amount of it.  What I want to say is that it is not unreasonable that we on this side of the House might fear that certain difficulties would be created for party political purposes.  My undertaking on behalf of the Government relates to the steps necessary to ensure that all relative information is produced. It does not relate to dealing with every possible point brought up by a member of the Opposition for party political purposes as distinct from trying to get at the truth of the matter. The Government are in the position that if they refuse to co-operate on what is a genuine request only they will lose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, although some time might elapse before they might lose.  I think the Minister is raising a difficulty here because I am not too sure who is to decide impartially whether something is being pressed as a legitimate inquiry or as a matter of party politics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Ultimately, the public will.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but I fear this takes away somewhat from the Minister's assurance and this is a pity.  I had stressed the importance of approaching this in a non-party manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the Government's intention&mdash;to approach it in a non-party manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It might have been better if the matter had been left like <Col N="63" /> that rather than introduce this curious qualification.  In the few seconds since the Minister spoke I have been desperately trying to envisage what kind of questions we could put which would not be necessary for the inquiry, which would require the attendance of a witness who had refused to attend and which would be for party political purposes.  I cannot easily think of how we could, with any pretence of legitimacy, proceed along those lines.  The Minister is raising an unnecessary hare. It is a pity he has raised it and that we have such a qualified assurance.  If we, on our side, say we will pursue this investigation fully and thoroughly without fear or favour and confine it, of course, to the matter at issue then we are entitled to an assurance that if we are frustrated and some witness, who is essential for the clarification of the whole question as to what happened this money, refuses to attend, the Government will, in those circumstances, take the necessary action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>You have that undertaking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>In the light of the way the debate has gone that is as far as I should like to press the matter at the moment.  The question of whether the Committee should meet publicly or privately is, I agree, a matter for the Committee.  I see arguments both ways. I think the public would expect in these circumstances that the Committee would meet publicly but that is a matter which the Committee will have to consider when they meet.</P>
      <P>There is a problem that Deputy Cosgrave raised which has not been met by the Minister.  It is a difficulty which arises from the fact that on this Committee there is equality of membership and whereas normally we might expect the chairman's casting vote would decide an issue there is a provision specifically written into the Standing Orders that govern the working of the Committee that if there is an equal vote on an issue the proposal shall be negatived.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is genuine fear on this side of the House that, in certain circumstances, if the report did not meet the <Col N="64" /> views of the members of the Government Party, and they decided they would be better off without this report, and better off to accept the odium of frustrating the report than to have the report, if they took such a decision, they could so frustrate the publication of the report.  I think we are entitled in these circumstances, bearing in mind the manner in which this Committee have always proceeded and bearing in mind, if I may say so on behalf of my absent colleague, the manner in which the Chairman of this Committee has proceeded, and bearing in mind the fact that the report will be drafted by him to ask the Government for an assurance that, such a report having been drafted by him, and debated by the Committee, and amendments made in the spirit which I have already mentioned, under no circumstances would the publication of that report be frustrated for party political reasons.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to intrude this concept into the debate but the Minister having introduced it on one side, I am equally entitled to raise a fear on the other side. This is our fear and it is one thing on which I should like an assurance that in those circumstances the publication of the report would not be frustrated for party political reasons.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I can certainly give that assurance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>So long as it means what it says.  We have been told that the result of the Garda investigations will be secured, and that is all right. There is one other matter, however, about which I am a little bothered because I see here some contradiction. I had questions down to the Minister last week and he refused to reply to them.  I have already adverted to that and I do not wish to comment further on it now in its own right.  There is one problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of my questions related to funds paid into this account&mdash;and we have been told by two witnesses and I think by prosecuting counsel that these funds were paid into this account-funds subscribed by members of the public in response to a specific request from the Minister for Finance that they should subscribe money to this fund. <Col N="65" /> They subscribed their money to the Irish Red Cross in accordance with the Minister's request and it appears that moneys were paid into this fund from these subscriptions, out of which the attempted arms purchase was financed.</P>
    <P>The Minister refused to answer the question on the grounds that this matter would be covered by the inquiry.  On reading the motion I cannot quite see that it is covered by the inquiry because the motion refers to &ldquo;the expenditure of the Grant-in-Aid for Northern Ireland Relief&rdquo;.  The fact is, however, that other moneys have been abused in a curious way from what we understand, through first of all the Government and the Minister for Finance's predecessor requesting the public to subscribe to one particular fund&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, might I suggest that the Ceann Comhairle's ruling on this earlier on was that what we were to discuss was whether or not this should be referred to the Committee of Public Accounts. I appreciate that the Deputy has to make certain points but, nevertheless, I would suggest that if we can confine ourselves to that we will maintain the standard of the debate, but if the Deputy tends to wander off into the actual subject matter, things will change.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been trying very hard not to refer to the subject matter except to the extent necessary to make my point.  I think it is necessary to make my point here because the Minister refused to answer a question of mine on the grounds that the subject of it would be a subject of this inquiry.  It does not seem to me that the motion covers it.  I do not know if I am even entitled to ask the Minister for an assurance that, in the light of what he said in the Dáil last week, the other moneys involved would also be covered by this inquiry.  It is true that they must be covered incidentally in so far as they have been merged in a fund with this £100,000, but it is one thing that they may be covered incidentally and it is another thing to investigate them fully.  I should like to hear from the Minister on this point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>On a further point of <Col N="66" /> order, may I submit that if Deputy FitzGerald is right in his contention that in fact this matter does not come within the terms of reference he is not in order in raising it now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I want to know.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is another matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister is submitting that, he is also submitting that he acted irregularly last week.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I am not.  If Deputy FitzGerald's contention is correct, and I told him last week that it was not, and if he is still contending that it is, then he is not in order in this debate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Although Deputy Tully does not think so, Deputies on this side of the House, Ministers or back benchers, have as many rights as Deputies over there and that includes the right to make a point of order.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry if I offended but what I am trying to do is even more fundamental than discussing why it should or should not go to the Committee.  I am concerned to raise the question of what should go to the Committee, which I think is pretty fundamental.  We have had a statement from the Minister in this House which he has just repeated now if I understand him aright, that a matter which did not seem to me <i>prima facie</i> to come within the terms of the motion does so come within the terms of the motion.  I simply seek clarification on that.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>What I am talking about now is money subscribed by the public and which the Minister stated last week would be covered by this inquiry.  He has repeated this assurance here.  The Chair will appreciate my dilemma when I have contradictory assurances as to the scope of the motion from the Chair and the Minister.  I seek clarification on this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Denis Francis Jones">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The position in regard to the Chair is that <Col N="68" /> this motion was put down and there was time for Members to submit amendments.  This has not been done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>There is difficulty. To submit an amendment one would need to know what the motion means. I read the motion as meaning one thing and I had a solemn assurance from the Minister that it meant something different.  I can only put down an amendment if I discover whether, in fact, my initial interpretation of the motion is correct or whether the Minister's assurance is correct.  When that has been clarified it might be necessary to propose an amendment.</P>
      <P>We have come to this motion in rather peculiar circumstances, circumstances in which we have been given an advance interpretation of what it would mean when it came out.  It did not seem to me that the wording of it entirely justified the Minister's assurance but I did not wish to challenge his assurance by putting down amendments as if I did not accept what he said.  I now seek clarification that, despite the appearance of the motion that it does not extend to moneys subscribed by the public, the Minister is right in the assurance he gave me last week and the assurance he has given me just now that the inquiry will fully extend to these moneys.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>This bears out the point I made last week that you cannot take particular items in isolation and that, in practice, I would suggest that what the Deputy should do is to see the report and so on which come from my Department and he will then find something of the extent of the inquiry and, indeed, the Committee may go further than that.  I think he will find that what I said is correct but if he does not he can always come back with a question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a difficulty now because it is one thing to say that the reports to be submitted to the Committee will deal with other matters and it is a different thing to say that the Committee are entitled to investigate these other matters fully.  I thought I had an assurance from the Minister last week and again from the Minister a couple of minutes ago that the Committee could investigate fully <Col N="69" /> the disposal of these sums of money. From his last statement I have now been put in a position of some doubt because he talks of coming back if necessary.  Why should it be necessary to come back if I am assured that we can, in fact, investigate these matters?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>On the basis of what I said, I have contended that the Deputy will find&mdash;if as I anticipate he is a member of this Committee&mdash;its investigations covering the items to which he has referred.  But if he is not satisfied that the inquiry goes as far as he wants it to go, to that extent he can come back with questions in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate the position of the Chair in regard to the matter. There is an appropriate motion before the House in regard to it and this motion has been there for some time.  No amendment has been proposed to it.  It would have been open to any Member, before the debate in due time, to put down an amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason why there is not an amendment down is because of an assurance the Minister gave, which he has, I think, repeated here, that this motion does, in fact, cover these other moneys, that they would be fully covered by the report, that the Committee would be able to discuss them.  He has expressed then some doubt, if a difficulty arose, about a comeback by question and answer.  It is a quite different thing to dealing with it by way of this Committee.  I am not at all clear from the Minister's statements, which seemed to me not to have contradicted each other but to have varied in tone, and from your ruling as to whether, if I drop this <Col N="70" /> matter now, the Committee will be in a position to inquire fully into the sums subscribed by the public.

      <P>It is not possible to give a straight answer to the question the Deputy is putting.  I tried to convey that to him before, because his interpretation and mine might well differ. What I am suggesting is, I think, a reasonable proposition.  Let the inquiry go ahead and if the Deputy finds that, as the inquiry is going ahead, it does not appear to be covering what he thinks it should be covering, although it is covering what I was referring to, then he has a remedy.</P>

What I have said is that this matter will be covered by the inquiry but it may be that the Deputy will decide that the extent of the coverage by the Committee is not the full extent that he thinks it should be, in which event I will have been right in what I said and the Deputy will have been right, but he will not be left without a remedy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I just cannot accept that the question of the extent of the coverage could be an issue.  It is a matter of fact for us to decide now in interpreting this motion as to whether this motion does or does not entitle the Committee to inquire into the disposal of funds subscribed by the public and merged in a bank account with funds from this particular account.  Either it is entitled to inquire, in which case it can ask questions on oath and it can report on the matter, or it is not entitled to inquire.  The question of how far it inquired is something that does not arise.  The Committee adopts a procedure of questioning people and then writing a report.  There is no room for disagreement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not as simple as that, and the Deputy, I suggest, should wait until he sees the full report and he will know what I am talking about.  It is just not as simple as a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>Unfortunately, one cannot wait and see because if one sees at the end that one is not getting what one has been assured one will get one will not be permitted to come back <Col N="72" /> apparently and get this motion amended to extend the inquiry.  All one would be entitled to do would be to ask questions in the House.  The Minister ought to appreciate that no Member of the Opposition will want to fall into that kind of trap.  He may not feel he is setting a trap but it is a potential trap from our point of view.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>No, my objection is that this is a matter in respect of which information was sought in this House by way of question.  That procedure is a standard procedure and it extracts useful information.  But clearly this matter cannot be adequately dealt with by that process in view of the limitations of that process and particularly in view of the fact that it extracts information only from the Minister in respect of matters for which he is directly responsible and does not extract information from other people who have been involved in this affair. Therefore, the Minister and the Government have agreed to refer this matter to the Committee of Public Accounts.  Now the question arises of what is referred to that Committee.  As the Minister refused to answer a question of mine in respect of these public subscriptions on the ground that the Committee's inquiry would cover it and as he has told me repeatedly here today that it will cover it, one would have thought that ended the matter.  But I am in a dilemma because the Leas-Cheann Comhairle would appear to have indicated that the motion does not cover that and that, should I wish it to be covered, I should have put down an amendment; and the Minister himself has cast some doubts on the extent to which he is fully convinced that it is covered by saying that I may not be satisfied with the extent of the coverage in which case I can come back and ask further questions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>There seems to be some confusion between the Chair's and the Minister's interpretation of the scope of the motion.  As it would appear that the Minister is anxious that <Col N="73" /> all moneys, including that subscribed by the public, should be properly investigated, could it be resolved by all parties in the House agreeing that an amendment would be accepted that would broaden the scope?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be in some difficulty about that because I would not know the implications of this for the particular society concerned.  However, I would suggest&mdash;it is very difficult to explain this because Deputies have not got the facts of the situation &mdash;that when Deputies do get the facts they will see that their inquiries will extend to some of the activities of this particular society.  I do not want Deputy FitzGerald to say that I have misled him or misled the House afterwards and I am trying to guard against this possibility.  What I am suggesting is that, if the Deputy finds that the coverage of the inquiry is not sufficient in his view, that he is not then left entirely without a remedy.  In my view, as I can see the situation, the Committee will make some inquiries into moneys coming from this society.</P>

      <P>Deputy Cluskey's suggestion is a good one.  While the Minister naturally will not want to accept an amendment when he has not even heard what it is, may I put it to the Chair that in the special circumstances of the case and in view of the confusion we have got into, which is nobody's fault, a late notice amendment might be accepted along the following lines:</P>
      <P>after 1969-70 to insert the words &ldquo;and any other moneys transferred by the Irish Red Cross Society to an account to which moneys from this Vote were lodged.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is specific and clear.  It confines it to the moneys that were lodged by the Irish Red Cross Society into this same account as moneys from this Vote were lodged.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Minister's difficulty.  Naturally, he would require time to consider the amendment but I am sure he will appreciate my difficulty in that this was the last point of my remarks.  However, I shall recapitulate the points I have made so that the House may see where we stand now on the various issues raised.  On the power to compel attendance we have assurance from the Minister that if witnesses whose presence is required for the purpose of this inquiry fail to attend, the Government will be prepared, if the matter is brought back to the House, to take the necessary steps to ensure the attendance of such persons.  The Minister has said there are two or three different ways of doing this but he has no wish to commit himself as to which one might be adopted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="75" /> We have been told by the Minister previously and during this debate that the results of the Garda investigations and any other inquiries carried out will be communicated to the Committee. That is satisfactory.  The question of whether the discussion will be in public or in private is a matter that is being left to the Committee.  The Minister has raised the point about the publication of names in the case of people from the North of Ireland who might be prejudiced if their names were published. At this stage I would like to make the point that if there were pub-public hearing and if this matter arose, it could be met by the way in which it was met in the court, that is, by the submission in private of a particular name and by referring to a particular person as &ldquo;Mr. A&rdquo; or &ldquo;Mr. B&rdquo;.  This would avoid disclosure.  I make this point merely to suggest to the Minister that his objection while it is one that may have some validity is not one that should prevent the holding in public of this inquiry should it be decided by the Public Accounts Committee that the inquiry should be held in public.</P>
    <P>The final point I made was about the power to investigate the disposal of these funds&mdash;funds that finished up in the same account but came from a different source&mdash;where there is an element of public responsibility because of the circumstances in which the account was opened and because of the circumstances in which people were asked to subscribe to this fund.</P>
    <P>These, then, are the points I wish to make and I wish to reiterate what I said at the outset that it is important that this matter should be debated here and by the Public Accounts Committee in a non-partisan atmosphere.  One of the disadvantages of Question Time is that when one puts down a question one does not always receive a reply that might be regarded as satisfactory. Further, in the ensuing to and fro, there can be generated more heat than light and it may appear to the observer that there is a partisan atmosphere even though one is trying to obtain information in an objective manner.  Because of the way in which the Committee has <Col N="76" /> operated heretofore, this difficulty does not arise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as I am concerned, this amendment is acceptable because, as I endeavoured to indicate, this is what we contemplated would happen.  If the House is happier to have this amendment inserted, I have no objection to its being inserted.  However, for the record, I should point out that under Standing Order No. 127 the Committee of Public Accounts examine sums granted by the Dáil to meet public expenditure.  I do not think that covers what is here.  As far as I am concerned and in so far as the Government are concerned we are not raising any objection but I am merely drawing formal attention to that point.  We are prepared to accept the amendment.  I would add that the word &ldquo;other&rdquo; in relation to moneys should be left out so that the amendment would read:</P>
      <P>and any moneys transferred by the Irish Red Cross Society to a bank account into which moneys from this Vote were or may have been lodged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that as an improvement but I wish to point out that the point raised by the Minister in relation to the Public Accounts Committee is not one which should concern us.  In this instance we are not simply handing over to the Public Accounts Committee a matter that they must consider as a part of their normal duties.  We are specifically referring particular matters to a Committee of the House which, for this purpose, is being asked to do things which they would not normally do.  If we were not doing that, the motion would not be necessary but since there is a special motion we are entitled to request the Committee to consider a matter that is outside their normal duty.</P>
      <P>I thank the Minister for accepting this amendment and for the way in which, through this method of dialogue we have been able, I hope, to ensure that a full and impartial inquiry will be carried out.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to amplify what has been said briefly by my colleague, Deputy O'Donovan.  My period of experience on the Committee of Public Accounts is a brief one&mdash;it is the period of the life of the Dáil.  However, during that time I have become acutely aware of the inadequacy of the Committee even in dealing with the routine matters that come before us.  Time and again we have been cut off at the point where inquiries were only becoming interesting.  I have never been satisfied with the degree of availability of information. In trying to equip myself a little to function on that Committee I have read back through some of their reports.  I have not done this as closely or over as many years as I ought to have done, but from what I have read I have noticed the sense of inadequacy that not only applies to my own immediate experience but that seems to apply to all the functioning of the Committee with which I have acquainted myself.</P>
      <P>Therefore, though I am touched by the appeal of the Minister for Finance that we maintain this debate on what he chooses to call the high level on which it has been conducted, may I say, that while I hope we can continue to be patient and reasonable, what I have to say is a good deal more disapproving of this motion than have been the speeches of my colleagues from the Fine Gael Party.  I say this because I cannot help noticing the structure of the debate on this motion so far.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a very important motion but it was moved without any introductory speech by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach, which is perfectly proper, but it is interesting that he should have chosen to do that.  Then, though the Minister for Finance was here, and obviously was very well briefed&mdash;the extent to which has been shown by what he had to say&mdash;we very nearly had the situation in which the Parliamentary Secretary closed up the whole debate again quite quickly. I feel inclined to look a little at some of the things we have been told in the light of the interesting structure of this debate, which did not perhaps evolve as was intended, although it very nearly <Col N="79" /> did.  Had we not clarified that the Parliamentary Secretary was making an interjection rather than a closing speech the whole matter would have been settled by now and a great many things which obviously the Minister for Finance was prepared to say, and came briefed to say, would not have been said.  This strikes me as interesting.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary assured the House that he was not trying to stifle debate on this motion.  This was an interesting form of words particularly in view of the form the debate has taken.  The Parliamentary Secretary said further: &ldquo;We do not want to make this a political matter&rdquo;.  My reaction at that moment was to interject.  Perhaps it was as well that I did not because we often get more said more effectively if we maintain a less partisan manner but there is no way by which anybody in this House can persuade me that this is not a political matter. It very obviously is a political matter.</P>
    <P>We are faced with the difficulty that over and over again Deputies have tried to use the mechanism of a parliamentary question to elicit information but they have been swept aside and treated with contempt in a profoundly, political way by Ministers. Although not all of his colleagues do this the Minister knows that what I say is a fair criticism of the mechanism of the parliamentary question as I have experienced it during my period in the House.</P>
    <P>When the Minister for Finance assures us that if certain things do not work out to our satisfaction we have the protection that we can come back into the House and ask parliamentary questions, I can only say that my experience convinces me that we will be treated in a cavalier, party-political and perhaps offensive way and swept aside by Ministers.  If Ministers had not been doing this for the past 18 months we might be disposed to accept that assurance.  It is nicer to be able to have reasonable and frank relations with people, even with members of different political parties.  I cannot accept this because it does not correspond with my experience.  This is the <Col N="80" /> price you pay for treating the mechanism of the parliamentary question with such contempt.  Perhaps this has been going on for longer than my time in this House.</P>
    <P>The Minister said to Deputy FitzGerald: &ldquo;The Deputy should wait until he sees the full report&rdquo;.  If we had had a period since last May when we could have had some trust and frankness this would be a reasonable thing.  I interjected the remark in the closing moments of the confidence debate in early May: &ldquo;We have been told nothing&rdquo;.  We have had the same situation ever since, including the treatment of Deputy FitzGerald's questions, to which some reference was made by both Deputy FitzGerald and the Minister for Finance.  Therefore we do not have a situation in which we can be legitimately called on to extend the normal trust and confidence.  This has not operated over the last six months.</P>
    <P>Let me turn to the motion itself.  It is extraordinarily brief.  This may not be an exact quotation because I do not write shorthand&mdash;if I am misrepresenting the Minister he can correct me&mdash; but I believe he said: &ldquo;It is our intention to take such steps as are necessary to make a full investigation possible.&rdquo; If this is the Government's intention why did they not do this in this motion?  As Deputy Cosgrave pointed out the Committee of Public Accounts do not possess the power to carry out a full investigation.  He pointed out, unanswerably, the ways in which they did not possess the power.  The Minister has given us some partial assurances about this but if the Government really wanted to carry out the Minister's words: &ldquo;It is our intention to take such steps as are necessary to make a full investigation possible&rdquo; then why this motion in this form?  If there are no doubts there is no basis for the motion at all.  We all know, however, that there are doubts and this is why the Government have introduced this motion.</P>
    <P>The Government have introduced a very weak and a very limited motion It is a motion which is not half strong enough to cover the situation.  The course proposed is not an adequate one.  This party did not at any stage <Col N="81" /> call for the handing of this matter to the Committee of Public Accounts because we do not believe the Committee of Public Accounts have the power to deal with it.</P>
    <P>The Minister talks about the steps necessary to ensure that all relevant information will be produced.  In order to do that we would be going to and from the Committee of Public Accounts and the floor of the House over and over again.  Why not write the necessary mechanisms into the motion now, giving the required power to the Committee of Public Accounts?  This might be a messy way and might involve a major violation of the tradition which that Committee have evolved.  Why not choose another mechanism of investigation which would possess the power to get persons and documents, if the intention is really to make a full investigation possible?  I accept the assurances, although we might quibble about the interpretation, of the Minister for Finance that it is his wish that a full investigation should be possible.  I am bound to say I do not accept it for the whole Government.  I do not accept it for the reason that we have seen what has been happening since this crisis began.</P>
    <P>We would be fools to accept that they want a full investigation.  Many of them have shown very good reasons for not wanting a full investigation.  In the case of others who do want a full investigation we may have our private suspicions as to why they want it.  Of course this is a political issue and we are being treated as if it could be dealt with by, in the phrase the Minister for Finance used over and over again, these normal procedures of the Committee of Public Accounts.  He said we should not anticipate difficulties in regard to the Committee of Public Accounts.  Of course we should anticipate difficulties because it is as plain as a pikestaff that they will arise.</P>
    <P>One interesting thing about this is that plenty of time will pass.  The members of the Committee of Public Accounts would be failing in their responsibility to the public if they did not pursue this question to the limit of the powers they possess.  In that sense this motion is redundant.  In that sense <Col N="82" /> it does not need to be said at all.  Of course the Committee of Public Accounts will do it.</P>

      <P>They would go as far as they could in the normal course of events, but they would come smack up against this precise situation that it is a Grant-in-Aid and they could go no further.  Though we are urged to do so and directed by this motion to do so in the Public Accounts Committee, the mechanism for obtaining the persons and the documents is not built in. There would be need to come back to the floor of the House over and over and ask the House to direct that X, Y or Z should attend.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>There are other ways of dealing with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree there are other ways of dealing with it but let me come to that.  The Minister says in reference to this matter : &ldquo;We would have the attendance of witnesses if the attendance was necessary.&rdquo;  But who judges when it is necessary?  In that case it would be the Dáil that would be judging when it was necessary.  The decision of the Dáil would be taken by the Government majority of the Dáil, so that the decision as to whether attendance was necessary would in fact be taken by the Government and in reality by a very few people in the Government. Therefore, that would be a question of interpretation and it would be interpretation by the people who had a profound interest in a political matter, and I repeat it is a political matter. That assurance about the availability of witnesses to the Committee of Public Accounts does not satisfy me the least little bit.  Neither do assurances about the availability of documentation-perhaps, <Col N="83" /> we are back in the &ldquo;perhaps&rdquo; world again.</P>
      <P>Our attitude on this is that the Committee of Public Accounts, governed as they are not just by Standing Orders but by a body of tradition and evolved behaviour, are not a suitable body to deal with this.  The exhortation to make a separate report as soon as possible is an exhortation that has very little meaning in reality.  A very considerable amount of time would elapse before the report was made.  Then there is the elegant possibilities of ping-pong in relation to putting down parliamentary questions because you do not think the matter has been adequately investigated. Then you get the sort of treatment of parliamentary questions I have seen here; I hope it was not always so, but it certainly has been so in my period in the Dáil.  Then we try to reopen it if we are dissatisfied with the way the parliamentary questions have been dealt with, and by this time, 12 or 18 months on, everybody is sick to death of the sordid affair.  As time passes, it recedes into the distance and it is bundled out of the way without ever having been fully investigated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If that is a harsh judgment or a political judgment, the Government have brought it on themselves by the way in which they behave towards full disclosure since these events erupted. With whatever provisos we are promised, the Committee of Public Accounts does not have the power.  If it was the intention to give the Committee that power, then it should have been incorporated in the formulation of the motion.  This cannot have been done in haste.  If we see a form of words on a very sensitive and crucial point we have the right to assume that a great deal of thought has gone into the drafting of these words.  When we see what are to me enormous omissions &mdash;we have had from the Minister promises open to multiple interpretations covering these omissions&mdash;we must assume the omissions are for a very good reason.  As far as I am concerned the situation is quite simple.  The reason for the omission is that the Government wish to choose to investigate this matter a structure, the Committee <Col N="84" /> of Public Accounts, which does not possess the power to do so, which cannot be given the power to do so, which will take some time in failing to do so and which will generally confuse the situation.  Therefore there will be a sense of impatience and disgust at the whole thing and it will be permitted ultimately to be bundled out of the way without full disclosure taking place.</P>
    <P>That is absolutely in line with the attitude revealed by the Government since rumours first started to circulate at the end of April, rumours of a more explicit sort; of course the other sort of rumours had been circulated for very much longer.  It seems to me an effort to frustrate the right of the public to know; it also seems to me an effort to renege on promises that were given in this House that full investigation, full disclosure, would be made.</P>
    <P>Therefore, to propose referring this matter for a speedy report to the Committee of Public Accounts is to me, speaking for the Labour Party, an entirely unsatisfactory, trivial and evasive way of dealing with what is a profoundly serious matter which ought to be dealt with differently, more deeply and more fully.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know how serious a matter this is but I take the quite specific view that it is a political matter.  I agree entirely and completely independently&mdash;we did not discuss the matter&mdash;with my colleague, Deputy Keating, that the Public Accounts Committee is not a suitable place to discuss this matter.  I can give a variety of reasons for that, but before I do so I should like to thank the leader of the main Opposition party, Deputy Cosgrave, for the clear exposition he gave of a certain aspect of the matter.  The dialogue which subsequently took place between the Minister for Finance and Deputy FitzGerald did anything but clarify the matter.  They went into various side issues which were not germane to the main issue in this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy and the Minister exchanged a great deal of <i>obiter dicta</i> on various aspects of the matter but certainly nothing was clarified.  Deputy Corish and Deputy Cosgrave got to the heart of the matter but only in a certain way.</P>
      <P>I want to tell the House why I do not regard the Public Accounts Committee as adequate.  When the Fianna Fáil Party first came into the Dáil and Mr. MacEntee was chairman of the Public Accounts Committee, it was a worthwhile body; but with the passage of time it has almost fallen into desuetude.  The first worthwhile comment I have heard from it in years on any subject was one I heard a few weeks ago that the standard of people taken into the Civil Service had gone down very much.</P>
      <P>A Special Committee of the House should have been appointed to deal with this matter.  We have had inquiries of various kinds this year and perhaps the Government are heartily sick of inquiries.  They may well have said to themselves, &ldquo;Let us give this to the Public Accounts Committee&rdquo;.  I am not making any allegations against the Government in relation to the manner in which this was handled; all I am saying is that it is a completely inadequate procedure.</P>
      <P>Let me give an example.  Some time about 1950 a body named An Bord Fógra Fáilte was set up as an additional body to Bord Fáilte.  I take it from its title that it was concerned with advertising in connection with tourism and it wanted to get into action.  The Department of Finance was asked whether it would allow a sum of £20,000 to be paid from the contingency fund for the financing of An Bord Fógra Fáilte pending the moneys being voted by Dáil Éireann.  I remember quite well the reply, because it subsequently came up at the Committee of Public Accounts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was: &ldquo;You cannot pay that amount from the contingency fund.&rdquo;  It <Col N="86" /> was an excellent reply.  It came up before the Committee of Public Accounts because the £20,000 was paid from the Vote for the Department of Industry and Commerce.  It was paid out by the then secretary who did not care two-pence about the Department of Finance; he just paid the £20,000 out of the Vote for the Department of Industry and Commerce.  Any Deputy interested in that affair can read about it in the pusillanimous report of the Public Accounts Committee.  There was no question of threatening or surcharging the accounting officer, although the House had not voted the money.  This is an example of what the Public Accounts Committee is worth in this context.</P>
    <P>My colleague, Deputy Keating, touched on the next point I am going to make.  Let us suppose the Irish Red Cross Society say to the Public Accounts Committee, &ldquo;Look, you have nothing to do with us.  Go and take a jump in the Liffey&rdquo;.  All the Public Accounts Committee can say to them is, &ldquo;Dear sirs, you are not being very co-operative in relation to our investigations. You are not being helpful.  We, as a Committee of Dáil Éireann, regret that you should behave like this.&rdquo;  If they are spending moneys subscribed for relief and distress in Northern Ireland, which they handed over to this bank account, they would be quite within their rights to say to the Public Accounts Committee &ldquo;Go and take a jump in the Liffey&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>There is much more to it than that. Quite apart from the serious point raised by Deputy Cosgrave that by tradition the Public Accounts Committee have no right to investigate Grants-in-Aid there is the point, and I quote from the motion: &ldquo;That the Committee of Public Accounts shall examine specially...&rdquo;.  The word &ldquo;specially&rdquo; might mean it was to take this examination out of order; in other words, before other matters.  It could be argued that is all it meant.  The next time they meet they might well say &ldquo;Right, we shall go ahead with this.&rdquo; The motion goes on to say, &ldquo;and shall furnish a separate report&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I am not making any allegation.  I believe what the Minister has told us that he and his Department are going <Col N="87" /> to help out all they can in this matter and put all the information they have before the Public Accounts Committee. The fact of the matter is that by long tradition the Public Accounts Committee have no power to query the reasons for an administrative decision. At any stage the accounting officer concerned can say to the Public Accounts Committee &ldquo;Now, look, that decision is an administrative matter.  I am not prepared to answer it&rdquo;, and that is the end of that.  No more can be said about it.</P>
    <P>I have said all I want to say on this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I should just like to make three brief remarks.  I know the Parliamentary Secretary is anxious to get in and get this concluded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Not at all.  I have no reason not to want other people to speak on this matter.  I have no special anxiety to get in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not suggesting the Parliamentary Secretary has any ulterior motives but, like everyone else, he would like to get his tea.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>My lunch, actually.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>My sympathies are with the Parliamentary Secretary on that particular point.  First, I do not think the Public Accounts Committee, by any stretch of the imagination, can be the right body to deal with this matter.  If it were the right body some proviso should be written into the Dáil regulations that matters like this would normally go before the Public Accounts Committee.  This is an exceptional thing.</P>
      <P>I do not know what to make of people who try to make out that this is not a political matter.  Of course, it is a political matter.  It is something which, no matter how we try to dodge it, must be treated on a political basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think the Public Accounts Committee are the right body to deal with this for another reason.  We all know the internecine strife which has occurred in Fianna Fáil and is still going on.  Certain people in Fianna <Col N="88" /> Fáil, disappointed at the way the courts dealt with one aspect of it and the way it turned out, may now feel they can at another time have another &ldquo;go&rdquo; at the people concerned.  For this reason I do not think that those on the Fianna Fáil side of the House who want this matter put before the Committee of Public Accounts want it put before that Committee for the same reason.  Some want that procedure because it is an easy way out: the report may not come out, as it normally does not, until next September or October when everything will have been conveniently forgotten. Others are very anxious that it should go before the Committee of Public Accounts because they feel this is one way of having a &ldquo;go&rdquo; at the people concerned and they will be able &mdash;I think this is the word that was used before&mdash;to &ldquo;shop&rdquo; them on this particular issue.  That being so, it is difficult to understand how we will get agreement from the Government on what exactly they want.  I know what the public want.  As someone said to me the other day, the public have one hundred thousand reasons for this particular matter to be discussed and debated openly, and cleared up finally, once and for all.  I do not think it is doing anybody any good to have this sort of thing dragging along month after month.</P>
    <P>I do not know&mdash;it is very difficult to find out&mdash;who is innocent and who is guilty, but it does appear as if there is guilt somewhere and, if there is, then that guilt should be brought out into the open as quickly as possible.  It is quite possible, as has been said, that certain people who have been dismissed from the Cabinet, dragged through the courts and put in a very awkward position may be entirely innocent: if they are, surely any fairminded person must have an urge to see they have their names cleared as quickly as possible? If, on the other hand, they are not as innocent as they say, then the matter should be put right so that all may know.  If there is one thing more than anything else that leaves a stigma it is a suggestion that someone is fiddling with funds and, if the funds arc public funds, that makes the situation all the more damaging.  For that very reason, if for no other reason, and in <Col N="89" /> order to give these people an opportunity of clearing themselves, this matter should be investigated as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corish suggested&mdash;the suggestion was repeated today&mdash;that this should be decided by a Special Committee of this House, a Special Committee which would be given the authority to bring before it the witnesses necessary, either to clear the matter up once and for all or find out if there is anything to be cleared up.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>It is ridiculous for a Minister like the Minister for Finance to come in here and say: &ldquo;If we find there is any difficulty about bringing these people and getting this evidence we could make the necessary regulations.&rdquo; I hope I am not misquoting the Minister.  He is always accusing me of misquoting him; he says stupid things and, when they are repeated, he complains he is misquoted.  He said that we could send for witnesses.  Deputy Dr. O'Donovan asked how could one ask the Red Cross to come in if they did not want to come in.  Again, the suggestion made by Fine Gael, and I can see an argument against the suggestion, that the matter should go to the Committee of Public Accounts as quickly as possible does not meet the situation because, if there was a discussion and investigation, and if finally there was an even vote, then the matter drops.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>May I interrupt? Deputy Tully said we suggested it should go to the Committee of Public Accounts.  I do not think this is quite accurate.  This motion came before the House in the normal way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of that. Deputy FitzGerald apologised to the Minister for Finance and said that if he had been aware the matter was being referred to the Committee of Public Accounts then the hee-haw kicked up last week would not have been kicked up and he was very sorry for the way in which the matter had been handled then.  He felt a Public Accounts Committee discussion would probably be the best way to deal with <Col N="90" /> the matter.  I was rather surprised at that and I am not surprised that the Fine Gael Whip seems to be taken at a disadvantage now.  This is what I am referring to.  I honestly believe this is a matter which should go before a Special Committee of this House&mdash; a committee of 17.  I believe this is the way to deal with it.  It could be dealt with very quickly in that way and everybody's mind could be set at rest.</P>
      <P>One of the things irritating people at the moment is the fact that, while this thing is dragging on, there does not appear to be any sense of urgency on the part of the Government; they do not seem to be doing anything at all. They seem to be going around in circles wondering what is to be the next move and which is the best political move they can make.  When I hear the Minister for Finance say that this is not a political matter I wonder does he realise exactly what he is saying.  I think this matter could be dealt with very, very briefly. It is not something which should drag on for 90 days, until next autumn, as it may do if it goes to the Committee of Public Accounts.  Since there is at present no body set up to deal with matters of this kind, I believe there should be a body specifically set up now to deal with it and it should be dealt with as quickly as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Finance has already dealt with the main points raised by the leader of the Fine Gael Party and the leader of the Labour Party.  Other speakers who intervened, with all due respect to them, made somewhat similar points. I suggested earlier that there might not be much merit in discussing this matter until the full facts were made available through the deliberations of the Committee of Public Accounts and, when the Committee had finalised their deliberations, the matter would then be referred back to the Dáil.  I was suggesting that there might be some repetition.  At this point of time we are more or less discussing the matter in <i>vacuo</i>.  Deputy Cosgrave was correct when he said the public were entitled to know the actual workings of <Col N="91" /> the Committee of Public Accounts in relation to this specific item which is to go before it.  Of course, the public are entitled to know and they are entitled to have the answers to the questions put to the House by both Deputy Cosgrave and Deputy Corish.  The Minister for Finance dealt in depth with the matters raised by these two Deputies.</P>
      <P>I was glad, as a former member of the Committee of Public Accounts, to hear Deputy FitzGerald state that this matter should be discussed in the House in a non-political fashion.  The Labour Party saw it differently.  As far as they were concerned, this was a political matter.  That is their opinion and they are entitled to it.</P>

I even said I did not know whether it was serious at all or not.</P>

      <P>Being a former member of the Committee of Public Accounts I was glad Deputy FitzGerald made that point.  It is reasonable to expect that the normal procedure will be followed.  It is important to stress that the Committee of Public Accounts is an all-Party Committee of the Dáil; it is made up of 12 members, six from the Government Party and six from the Opposition parties. The chairman is always a member of the Opposition.  It is just as well to stress this.</P>

      <P>There seems to be some doubt in the minds of Members <Col N="94" /> of the Labour Party on the question of witnesses.  I will reiterate what the Minister for Finance stated, that we should not anticipate difficulties that may arise in the future.  If and when difficulties arise we will meet them. The manner in which this debate has been conducted, particularly having regard to the fashion in which the motion was put on the Order Paper and the fact that the Minister for Finance willingly met the amendment by Fine Gael, shows that Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil are of one mind on this motion&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proper that this discussion should be conducted in a civilised fashion and, in the main, that has been the case.  In fairness to Deputy Cosgrave I should state that at column 341, volume 249 of the Official Report, he asked the Minister for Finance:</P>
      <P>if, in view of the growing public disquiet at the disclosure of irregular expenditure of money voted by Dáil Éireann being applied for purposes other than those covered by the Vote of the Dáil, he will refer the matter for special investigation by the Committee of Public Accounts as a matter of urgency.</P>
      <P>We are meeting that point and I think we have been more than co-operative in meeting the amendment put to the Minister in a fair fashion by Deputy FitzGerald.  In turn, this was met in fair fashion by the Minister, and Deputy FitzGerald has conceded this.</P>

      <P>There is no question of grabbing at straws.  This has been the correct approach.  Other committees have been called for by the Labour Party but it would be a reflection on this most esteemed and respected all-party Committee of Dáil Éireann, namely, the Committee of Public Accounts, if it were not to be entrusted with the functions which it is now being asked to exercise.  The Committee should be allowed to deal with this matter in the manner requested by the Government.  Are we to suggest that 17 members of some other type of committee&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I am trying to be as pleasant as possible and the Deputy seems to be taking another angle.  There is no point in repeating what the Minister for Finance has stated.  The Minister has met the points made.  Some of the points were constructive, particularly those made by the Fine Gael Party. The Minister has tried to meet the demands or requests of the Labour Party, but, apparently, no matter what answers are given, they are totally unacceptable to them.</P>

      <P>May I ask the Parliamentary Secretary a few questions? I wish to ask him, or through him the Minister, if I understood from <Col N="97" /> both of them that they are concerned to have this matter dealt with as expeditiously and effectively as possible? We have accepted, in this part of the House, the Minister's assurance that if problems arise about compelling witnesses to attend, the Government will be prepared to take the necessary action.  There is a difficulty which I would like to mention.  The Committee will, I am sure, deal with this matter expeditiously.  A period of two months which has been mentioned seems to be too long.  I am sure the Committee will wish to get through their work and report very quickly.  They could find themselves dealing with this job within the next couple of weeks after the Dáil has adjourned.  The Dáil may not resume until the middle of February. If difficulty arose about compelling witnesses to attend I take it, from the concern of the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary, that this might be dealt with expeditiously and that the Dáil would be recalled to prepare the necessary legislation for this purpose. I think the situation would require legislation.  It is important that we should have that assurance.  It would be very unsatisfactory if, through any confusion here, we got into a position that as soon as the Committee started work that work was immediately frustrated and the Committee had to wait for two months for a meeting of the Dáil to enable them to continue the work.  I am clear that that is not the intention of the Minister.  I thought it proper to raise this matter at this point so that there would be no doubt and no hold-up of any kind in the work of the Committee through any such defect in procedure.</P>

The possible circumstances visualised by Deputy Dr. FitzGerald may not arise. Different situations could arise.  Some situations might call for what the Deputy visualises.  Other situations <Col N="98" /> might be dealt with in some other way.  I cannot give a specific undertaking that the House would be recalled in any circumstances that would arise.  I certainly would not rule out the possibility of such happening if the circumstances could not be dealt with in any other way.</P>

It would be unreasonable to expect them to bring in a report in view of the fact that we are only a few weeks from Christmas and the Dáil will be in recess until the end of February.</P>

      <P>I accept that.  I want to refer to the possibility of the Committee's work being frustrated by the negativing of the report by certain members of the Committee.  Much stress was laid on the party political reasons.  This makes me wonder are we talking about the same thing.  I am talking about a situation where the evidence has been heard and the chairman of the Committee&mdash;who, the Minister knows, is a distinguished Parliamentarian who has acquitted himself well in that office&mdash;drafts a report&mdash;and we can rely on his judgment to draft a fair report&mdash;and this report is debated in the Committee, amendments are considered and taken where appropriate. We fear that this report might be frustrated at any stage by negativing. I seek an assurance that that would not happen.  Have I got that assurance or is it being hedged round by the intrusion of the words &ldquo;party political practices&rdquo;?</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Fahey, on his new appointment and to wish him luck in the Fisheries Branch.  Fisheries do not get the recognition which they should get.  Many years ago there was a separate Ministry for Fisheries.  Then the Fisheries Branch became attached to the Department of Lands and, more recently, it became attached to the Department of Agriculture.  We have a practically unlimited opportunity for <Col N="101" /> expansion in this sphere.  The Parliamentary Secretary in his opening speech tried to prove that we had achieved considerable expansion in fisheries but our record is pretty well static.  There has been some advance but of a limited nature only.  It is difficult to understand why we are so slow to exploit an industry the raw material for which is to be found in abundance around our coast.  Over the years the fisheries of Ireland were inshore fisheries and to a large extent they have remained so.</P>
      <P>With regard to our proposed entry into the EEC, we have another five years in which to put our fisheries in order.  We have a lot of leeway to make up.  Our fishery protection limit was extended to 12 miles but once it was extended to 12 miles whatever protection we had collapsed there and then.  We have practically no protection at the moment.  If we can catch anybody inside the 12-mile limit we may prosecute them and confiscate their gear.  This is a deterrent but in the herring season one can see ships from all over Europe poaching the rich harvest particularly along the Wexford and Waterford coasts.</P>
      <P>Our application for membership of EEC comes at a time when the situation within the Community itself is very confused.  After considerable debate there is really no hard and fast decision so far as fisheries are concerned. Norway were concerned about fisheries because they have the greatest fishing industry in Europe and possibly in the world.  Norway objected very strongly because the EEC had no fisheries policy.  The Community summoned their members and produced a fisheries policy&mdash;which really means nothing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should be greatly concerned about fisheries so far as our EEC membership application is concerned. Our Department of Agriculture and Fisheries have issued no statement whatsoever on any discussions with our Minister for External Affairs in relation to our fisheries.  We have had no statement.  Apparently, when our Minister for External Affairs went abroad he did not get any distance in his discussions&mdash;admittedly he had to come home as fast as he could a few weeks <Col N="102" /> back to prop up this shaky Government. Apparently he was not in a position to make a statement in regard to this country and the EEC fisheries policy as a whole.</P>
    <P>The EEC have an annual fish deficit of 500,000 tons whereas the applicant countries have a fish surplus of 700,000 tons.  If the Six become the Ten-as is possible in the not too distant future&mdash;the EEC fish deficit may become a surplus of 200,000 tons.  Most of the fish is harvested by Norway. Norway has made a very good case for herself.  She has to protect her fishermen who are entirely dependent on the harvesting of fish for their way of life.  All this is very vital to the Norwegian economy.  The same can be said about France in so far as the Breton fishermen are entirely dependent on the harvesting of fish for a livelihood.  France, therefore, is very interested in securing that her fisheries will be preserved.</P>
    <P>We ourselves have an enormous fisheries potential which we do not show much sign of developing.  We are always expanding on paper in this country.  I want to get down to hard facts.  We have a vital interest in maintaining and expanding our fisheries.  If a fisheries policy is drafted in the EEC that is suitable to us, to Norway, to France&mdash;and other interested parties&mdash; then we have a tremendous opportunity for expansion in this sphere.  Speaking from memory&mdash;unfortunately, I do not speak from notes&mdash;we export about £3 million worth of fish per annum. That figure has risen gradually.  It is always well to remember, when dealing with cash, that prices have gone up. The price of fish is much dearer now than it was a few years ago.  We have made a very modest expansion but we have still an inshore fishing economy.</P>
    <P>We have not sufficiently expanded our fishing fleet.  We have not developed floating factories such as other European countries, particularly Norway and France, are using.  Therefore, we are not in a position to compete with them.  Although, probably, there is little the Parliamentary Secretary can do about it, I want him to bear that in mind; it is a matter for the Government. Here is our opportunity.  We are <Col N="103" /> to become a member of the EEC.  We shall suffer in some directions such as by reductions in certain employments. Therefore we must expand in other directions in order to keep our economy in a sound position.  This is something that should have been done in the past 30 or 40 years but it is not too late.  We now have five years to do it.</P>
    <P>Generally, it is thought that the common time limit for all four entrants will be five years if they are to enter together.  The Parliamentary Secretary should use whatever influence he has and, no doubt, the Government will listen to him since they have made him their Parliamentary representative in regard to fisheries and it is up to him to impress on the Minister for External Affairs that he should negotiate strongly to save and protect the livelihood and employment of our fishermen and whatever limited money is invested in Irish fisheries.</P>
    <P>Obviously, in order to do that, he should work in liaison with Norway and France who are both vitally interested in that they have people in wholetime employment in fisheries whom they will be protecting.  It would be purposeless for us to go to discuss fisheries with the EEC without allies. All our approaches in the EEC will be a matter of barter.  Many people say we should not go in because we shall have only one vote but that vote can be very valuable.  It can be used or can be sold to advance our interests. This is one of the matters on which we can come together with Norway and France as a group to put our case most forcefully so that we shall not be exploited by others who have no interest in fisheries except to get a cheap and plentiful supply of fish.</P>
    <P>The investment in Irish fisheries is totally inadequate.  The system of procuring boats is unsatisfactory.  Bord Iascaigh Mhara have had a pretty free hand to do what they like and, frankly, I do not think they have been successful. Not everything they have done is wrong but they have fallen down in many ways and they could have made more progress in others and kept in touch with the times.  They should, with the support of the Department, <Col N="104" /> ensure that we get the proper type of boat.  Let us hope they will do that in the five years available.  Otherwise, how can we compete with the type of continental fishing boat that comes into our own waters?  Anybody who has visited fishing centres&mdash;I have been in Cork and other places&mdash;must realise that the small inshore boats we have cannot compete with the floating factories our competitors have.  A much greater investment in Irish fisheries is necessary if we are serious about the matter and want to make progress.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary said that there is an income of about £4 million a year from inshore fishing and that sort of thing but that is not facing up to the issue.  Our fishing grounds are underfished and stocks of fish have accumulated but if other people are to come in with better methods of catching fish, with better equipment, not only will we lose what fish we have but we shall have every fishing fleet in the world here to compete with us.</P>
    <P>Other countries have developed their fisheries.  The Icelandic people live entirely on the proceeds of their fishing. I think they have only two exports, sheep to Russia, I think, and to America, and fish.  They have a very small population of about 158,000.  Yet they have developed first class fisheries and have managed to keep their economy sound and have been able to protect themselves by using fishery protection vessels to preserve their 12-mile fishery limit.  We have a fertile fishing ground.  I have always thought that we have adhered to inshore fishing because of the very heavy seas particularly off the west coast.  A naval officer told me that the worst seas he had ever seen were off the west coast of Ireland.  I was told by one of the crew of a destroyer that the vessel rolled so much there that the oil came out of the sump.  For that reason we have been unable to do any worthwhile fishing off the west coast.</P>
    <P>The Continental Shelf goes out a considerable distance into the Atlantic. There is a very rich harvest there that is completely neglected.  For that purpose much money is required.  We spend a great deal of money trying to encourage industrialists to come here; we build factories for them and so on.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="105" /> We have even brought people here to start industries for which raw material must be imported.  Our fisheries could help the economy.  If Bord Iascaigh Mhara accept that this kind of expansion is possible and that the type of boat they have been hiring or leasing is inadequate for future needs, that we require boats three or four times as large, we can gradually build up a very fine fishing fleet.  We shall then discover the value of our fisheries.  We do not know what it is at present.  Ministers or Parliamentary Secretaries come here, in Dáil after Dáil, and recite a litany of the amount of different types caught and say that we export very little, that we meet our own requirements and so on.  I should say we are catching only one&mdash;tenth of what is available.</P>
    <P>I strongly advocate that the Department should build up a suitable fleet to fish the untapped grounds off the west and south coasts where strong seaworthy boats are needed and that they should have a &ldquo;coalition of thought&rdquo; immediately with France and Norway who are, like ourselves, interested in fishing, to ensure that the EEC, even before we participate in it, will have a fishery policy or agreement that can be discussed when the applicants accede to the EEC.  These things are absolutely necessary.</P>
    <P>We must also utilise fish to the fullest degree as raw material.  We have done practically nothing along that line.  Really, the policy of the Fisheries Branch is: catch fish and export that fish to Britain where there is an open market for it.  It is something the same as the policy in relation to agriculture of having one market only. The policy is: export the fish there; by doing that you are all right; do not process the fish; have your supplies ready all the time and send them over there; they want fish; they want cheap fish; they want fish they can get easily. They do not care tuppence about our economy.  Why should they?  They are only responsible for and interested in their own economy.  We should look after our own economy.  We should realise the tremendous advantages that can accrue to it.</P>
    <P>I earnestly exhort the Parliamentary Secretary to consider these two points <Col N="106" /> and to remember that time is running out.  Five years is not a long time in which to revolutionise a policy.  If we go into the Common Market in five years time with our present fisheries organisation, I envisage that we will be poached out of existence, that we will have every other fishing fleet here. They can even afford to leave their own areas to develop for a season, all of which are overfished by the way.  They will come in here and not only will they take all the fish but they will also destroy our breeding grounds.  A journal called <i>European Community</i> produced in Brussels pretty well agrees with the view that Ireland must look after her own interest and see that she protects what she has and develops for the future.</P>

      <P>Concluding his opening statement the Parliamentary Secretary said:</P>
      <P>I feel that Deputies will be satisfied that approval of the Estimate should lead to further expansion of our fisheries, both sea and inland, and that the sum provided should be a worthwhile investment for the country as a whole.</P>
      <P>I cannot see the justification for that statement.  What are the grounds for suggesting that the industry will expand as a result of this Estimate?  Is it not quite evident that this industry has been dragging its feet not only this year but last year and in previous years.  Everybody who knows anything about fishing will agree that we have failed in our efforts to develop our fishing industry around the thousands of miles of coast we have.</P>
      <P>Comparisons have been made with other islands.  Deputy Esmonde mentioned Iceland.  I think you may as well compare chalk with cheese as compare our fishing industry with that of Iceland. I have been to Iceland.  I think I should thank Deputy Esmonde for that.  In any case, I had the opportunity of seeing the fish-processing plants there and hearing lectures about fishing and fish processing from people qualified to lecture on that subject.  I was able to get first-hand information as to how 90 per cent of the relatively small population of 200,000 could derive their income from fishing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="107" /> Deputy O'Connor from Kerry some few nights ago drew our attention to the position of the Faroe Islands.  I am not conversant with the population there but he mentioned that it was something in the region of 5,000 or 6,000 and that their fish catches were ten times ours.  He was reflecting on the Government's policy.  I am assuming that these figures are correct.  This indicates again how we are lagging behind in development.  If the Faroe Islands fishermen can do what Deputy O'Connor suggests they have done, there is something wrong here.</P>
    <P>In his opening statement the Parliamentary Secretary said:</P>
    <P>The amount sought represents an increase of £510,400 on last year's figure, due primarily to the provision of £396,100 to enable repayment to be made to the Central Fund of advances made to An Bord Iascaigh Mhara which were issued by the board to fishermen for the purchase of boats and gear and were later written&mdash;off as irrecoverable in the board's accounts.</P>
    <P>Taking this into account, the actual increase is £114,300.  Surely this is not even keeping pace with last year's Estimate, taking into consideration the continuous depreciation in the value of money and the increases in salaries and in expenses of all kinds?</P>
    <P>I should like to get some information on this £396,100.  We were told later by the Parliamentary Secretary that this was money that had accumulated over the years.  Is that not evidence, if evidence were required, that the fishing industry is in a bad state when, in this relatively small country, loans made from public funds to fishermen to the extent of almost £400,000 have been written-off?  In terms of money and relating it to expenditure on fishing and to the income from fishing and exports and so on, this is a sizeable sum.</P>
    <P>What happened?  Are we to assume that the fishing industry is not a paying proposition and that those who got this money were unable to make ends meet, and unable to repay their commitments, and that together with the grants which were made available to <Col N="108" /> them the loans too went unpaid and had to be struck off: John Citizen pay up?  Or are we to assume, on the other hand, that the wrong type of people got these loans?  We have known down through the years that influences were at work and that if you wanted to get loans, or Government help, or a Government grant, the usual thing to do was to go to people with influence.</P>
    <P>I have referred in this House time and again to this type of influence being used.  At present if you are looking for something big, such as a new boat or a van or other Government favours, some people think the best way to approach the subject is to become a member of the latest subsidiary body of the Government, set up some few years ago, the Taca Association, to buy a ticket, buy a pass, and get help and money from Government funds.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary must tell this House more about this £400,000 of public funds.  It is not good enough to say that it is a sum accumulated over a number of years.  He must give us more detail than that.  How did it happen? Who made the mistake? There are not so many answers.</P>
    <P>The first answer is that this industry is not paying at all and that people could not possibly repay the money. I doubt if the position is so bad that that is correct.  Living at the seaside myself I am reasonably familiar with the fishing industry and I would be surprised to hear that a capable man getting a boat with the loans and grants available from public funds would not be in a position to make a living and repay the loan.  I have said &ldquo;a capable man&rdquo; because only capable or skilled men should be considered for such loans and grants.  Are we to assume that incapable men got these grants and loans from public funds through An Bord Iascaigh Mhara and are unable to pay their debts and now the State must pay £396,100 in the current year?  If that amount of money were available for, say, improvements to small harbours and slips, or other desirable improvements, it would make a considerable impact.  Something is wrong, someone is wrong, when public money goes down the drain.  We just <Col N="109" /> cannot pass over that.  It is not good enough to say that these debts cannot be recovered.</P>
    <P>I do not want to labour this point but I would like to comment on the regulations as I understand them.  If I have a boat from the board and I am incapable of managing it, if I find it is a bad proposition to continue and I have no hope of repaying the board and I am &ldquo;baling out&rdquo; I understand that I am legally entitled to sell the gear and pocket that money.  Has this happened in any of these cases?  Surely that type of regulation should not exist. I was dumbfounded when I learned that that could be done legally.  Public money must be more carefully safeguarded than that.</P>
    <P>I would like to see the regulations tightened up because, despite the complaints that are made by some fishermen that it is difficult to make ends meet, I am satisfied that if proper care and attention were given to applications for grants there would be no question of writing off £396,100 today. These applications come before the board.  The board is, to some extent, a political body.  The Government have nominees on the board and some of them have been nominated because of their political affiliations.  It is because of the accumulation of all this that there is this preliminary statement to the Parliamentary Secretary's remarks on the fishing industry for the year 1970-71.</P>
    <P>I am quite satisfied that the Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Fahey, is a man of the highest integrity.  I have no doubt about that.  However, I have complained down through the years that the person in charge of the Fisheries Branch is always somebody from an inland county.  We have Deputy Fahey today; Deputy Childers was in charge of the Fisheries Branch for a time as were also Deputy Brian Lenihan and Deputy O.J. Flanagan. I am not saying they were not all qualified but I still think&mdash;this is no reflection on Deputy Fahey, I would be the last to reflect on him&mdash;that a person from a maritime county who has a more intimate knowledge of fishing, its hazards and its problems, and who has opportunities of meeting fishermen and <Col N="110" /> agents and distributors of fish, would have more first&mdash;hand knowledge of the industry than a man from an inland area.</P>
    <P>The big question in the minds of fishermen today is the one referred to by Deputy Esmonde&mdash;what will happen to us when we get into the EEC? That is what fishermen are asking me and asking Deputy Esmonde and other Deputies all round the coast.  They are trying to get information from any source they can.  It has been represented that once we become members of the EEC we can down our tools, that once we get into that wealthy group of 200 million people a population such as ours, less than three million, will have no problems, we will be spoonfed. Like Deputy Esmonde I have had the opportunity, on a number of occasions, of visiting all six EEC countries and nothing could be further removed from the truth than that idea of getting benefits without putting work and industry into our efforts, without improving on the efforts that are being made here at present in different spheres.  We are speaking today about one particular sphere&mdash;fisheries.  I do not see that there is any easy money to be got from membership of the Community.  I was pleased to see that in France, Germany, Luxembourg and Holland people seem to be doing well.  Perhaps that is the reason why we are not supposed to lose by joining.  Industries seem to be thriving particularly in those four countries.  However, it struck me that people there are working harder than people in Ireland.  That is the impression one would get.  On the assumption that we will become members of the EEC, we must consider what will be the position of our fishermen in those circumstances. Is it not laid down that the transitional period cannot be for more than five years?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Labour Party have sent a number of delegations to the EEC headquarters so that we might have first hand information pertaining to all matters, agricultural and fishing as well as others.  I happened to be a <Col N="111" /> member of one such delegation.  It was made clear to us that the transitional period will not be for more than five years except in the event of there arising very unusual circumstances.  At this point I should mention that towards the end of October and during the month of November this year herring fishing was very good both in relation to catches and in relation to prices paid on the piers, where herrings fetched up to £13 a cran.  So far as I know, all the herrings landed on the southern coast were purchased by Dutch buyers.  Our fishermen are anxious to know whether there is a likelihood that, if and when we become a member of the EEC and after this transitional period has expired, instead of the Dutch or any other European people coming to buy our fish, they will come instead to catch the fish themselves.  These pepole would then have the same rights to fish our waters as would our own fishermen.</P>
      <P>We are all aware that some few years ago there was uproar along the southern coast between Irish and foreign fishermen.  I am speaking now of herring fishing.  In the confrontation the Irish fishermen were successful.  At that time we were entitled to take action by virtue of the fact that we are a free and independent nation.  However, when we join the EEC we shall not be able to say to these fishermen that they must go back to Holland or to Belgium or to France or to wherever they may have come from because they would have the same rights as would the fishermen from Schull, from Castletownbere or from Dunmore.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary referred to this question in his statement and he tells us that all the steps that can possibly be taken are being taken to deal with the matter.  I understand that on 21st September the Government commenced taking such steps but we have not been told how successful have been the efforts so far.  From questions I have asked and from speaking to members of the commission, I am satisfied that in the event of our joining the EEC it is most unlikely that we would get any preferential treatment in relation to fishing.  It may be possible, of course, that our fishermen could go to <Col N="112" /> England, to France or to Italy or elsewhere to fish in the same way as people from these countries could fish in our waters but I understand from the general trends of events obtaining within the EEC there will be no concessions granted to us.  Perhaps when the Parliamentary Secretary is replying he will throw some light on this matter.</P>
    <P>I am asking whether it will be a matter of a free-for-all within the EEC conditions.  In so far as I can see, that will be the position.  I hope I am wrong.  Those people who buy boats intending to make fishing their career would like to know the answer to that question.</P>
    <P>We are told also that the progress made in recent years will continue to be made and that a healthy air obtains now within the industry.  The person responsible for that statement may be a little too optimistic but perhaps this may be better than being too pessimistic. I am not aware of any such healthy air.  Our coastline must extend for about 2,000 miles but, in spite of that, the figures for landings are relatively small.  In so far as shell fishing is concerned, this branch of the industry is progressing reasonably well.  It is progressing more than white fishing.  I am particularly pleased that this is the case because it is easier to handle and easier to dispose of.</P>
    <P>In my own town of Schull we have what used to be described for many years as the &ldquo;inter-party white elephant&rdquo; by Government representatives in that part of the country.  Some of us had the feeling that because that plant was erected during the inter-party period, it was ignored since then, left idle, looking very white, but fortunately its colour has now changed.  It is a natural colour now thanks to some people who came along some years ago.  It is now doing well despite all the pessimism about it from Government sources.  It provides a ready market for the local fishermen.  This plant was idle for 14 or 15 years.  It was said at one time that the Government would have it turned into a dance hall.  I suspect, although this is no reflection on the present Parliamentary Secretary, that the Government deliberately neglected expanding that plant <Col N="113" /> because what has happened this year could have happened in the 1950s or the 1960s.  However, it is working smoothly now.</P>
    <P>I cannot see any mention in the Parliamentary Secretary's statement of the fish processing plant to be located on Dinish Island, Castletownbere.  Why has this been omitted?  This plant is supposed to be set up next year.  Preparations are being made to acquire the land for the erection of this fish processing plant.  Why is it not mentioned in the Parliamentary Secretary's statement?  I know this is the Estimate for 1970-71 which ends on the 31st of March next, so I hope the fact that it is not mentioned does not mean that it is shelved.</P>
    <P>I often criticise boards but I am quite satisfied that An Bord Iascaigh Mhara played an important role in getting this industry for Castletownbere. It may not be the job of the Fisheries Branch to buy land but when this industry is closely connected with fishing they should take an interest in the acquisition of land and see the man who owns this land for the erection of this plant is paid for it.  I do not like the way they are treating the owner of Dinish Island in that they are offering him an entirely inadequate sum for an island of almost 30 acres.  We should not wield the big stick over people like that and say: &ldquo;If you do not sell to us at this price you will be responsible for keeping away an industry which will employ quite a number of people.&rdquo; I avail of this opportunity to say that when a State body, a Department or a local authority acquire land by compulsion they should pay for it.  Compulsion was not necessary in this case. The owner only required what any of us would require: a fair price for his holding.  He is not getting that from the people who are negotiating for its purchase. It is time to give this man a fair price for his land.</P>
    <P>Those of us who live around the coast make representations from time to time with regard to the erection or improvement of harbours, piers and slipways.  The prospect is not very bright so far as County Cork is concerned. The only place mentioned is Reen, on which the work is almost <Col N="114" /> completed.  There is no work mentioned for the coming year.  I should like to have some information on the availability of money for harbours, piers and slipways.  I appreciate it is difficult to estimate the requirements of the different areas all around the coast.  At Schull it is estimated that it would take more than £100,000 to do a reasonable job on the pier there.  Possibly half that amount would be required for Union Hall and quite large sums of money would be required for other centres on the south Cork coast.</P>
    <P>At the moment we have a survey of harbours and piers taking place.  I believe this is only a tactic to let people know that the Government are doing something about this matter.  The survey could go on for years and years and not much might come out of it in the end.  We have experience of surveys being carried out by different Departments. They are usually set up to keep people off the back of the particular Department.  If the Fisheries Branch cannot get money from the Minister for Finance the Parliamentary Secretary should tell us this.</P>
    <P>I am pleased work on Castletownbere pier is going along reasonably well and that it is expected to be completed by 1973.  I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to take into account other piers in south-west Cork. I know he has to deal with these matters on a national basis but he will find that a great deal of money is needed.  I think my friend here, Deputy Kavanagh, who has moved down in the Cork direction, was interested in Bally-cotton pier about which there was a deputation to the county council meeting. It was agreed by all that this work was of urgent necessity.  We should have got a little more information on the availability of funds for harbours and piers.</P>
    <P>From the day I came into this House I have been agitating on the Estimate for Fisheries that our fishery waters be nationalised.  That issue has been taken up by other people in the last four or five years but I am now interested in the justification for such a measure. I would never agree that fishery waters along any part of our coast or indeed our rivers should be privately owned.  I <Col N="115" /> remember when the Tánaiste was Minister for Lands and Fisheries he said that fisheries were private property and we had no right or entitlement to take them over, that once they were in private ownership we should respect that, and so on.  In some parts of the country, including my own, respect for fishery laws was at a low ebb in the not too distant past.  If a man was brought before the courts for breaches of fishery regulations, particularly if it was in relation to fishing on a privately owned stretch of river, his neighbours did not regard that as an offence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Denis Francis Jones">

      <P>Legislation was enacted here in 1959.  If that were given effect to, it would cover this.  I suppose the Government do not like treading on the corns of these private individuals, first of all because some of them may be good contributors to their funds, and secondly, because they have some doubts about compensation. Legislation was passed here in 1959 which gives us power to do what I am suggesting, so that on that basis it is relevant to this discussion.  It is not a question of legislation but a question of implementing legislation already in existence.  The Fisheries (Consolidation) Act of 1959 went at least part of the way in providing for the taking over of privately owned waters and the payment of compensation.  I do not intend to dwell on this question, but I am satisfied that we went part of the way and then stopped.  Possibly influences were at work to ensure we did not go all the way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>According to the Parliamentary Secretary's statement the Department are not satisfied with the distribution of fish to inland places in Ireland. They claim that our fish consumption has risen to 10½ lbs.  per head of the population.  I take it that is an annual amount, which is exceptionally small. This is a recurring question.  What steps have the Department and the <Col N="116" /> board taken in recent years in relation to the better distribution of fish even here at home not to talk about abroad? There is an advertising campaign costing £30,000 annually, and there are the board's fish cooking advisory activities which involve hotels, institutions and guesthouses.  We are asking for help from organisations, but we do not seem to be making any headway in having fish delivered to inland towns in this country, small as it is.  I suppose there is no part of it 100 miles from the sea.</P>
    <P>Quite recently I attended a fish market at Bergen in Norway.  It was away beyond anything here in Ireland or beyond anything inside the fish market in Dublin.  I am not reflecting on our own people.  There were all types of fish there.  It was laid out on tables in stalls.  The presentation and everything else was 100 per cent, and buyers were plentiful.  Of course, the Norwegian people eat more fish than we do but, at the same time, the way the fish was presented for sale was an added inducement to people to buy it. Our marketing system here falls far below the standard obtaining there.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary said that the low level of fish consumption in inland areas due to lack of proper fish distribution presents a problem in any speedy effort to organise more effective distribution, that the best we can expect is that better distribution can be phased in line with gradual increases in fish consumption in those areas.  This is an admission that either the Department or the board, whoever is responsible, is incapable of doing that job.  It should be handed over to private enterprise who, I am quite certain, would do the job.  Everyone associated with this industry seems to find every task insurmountable.  I believe we could get people in inland towns like Cashel, Cahir, Mallow, Fermoy and such places interested in fish consumption if we went about it in the proper way.</P>
    <P>I should like briefly to refer to the French boats.  There was a television programme quite recently on the French boats.  These French boats are not what they should be.  I should like to know what happened in this connection. I do not like prejudging the issue <Col N="117" /> and I do not like blaming the board. I have seen fishermen going over to France and other places to find boats. The board must help them buy the boats.  If the board are reluctant to help they are very often pressurised into doing so and this may be what happened in these cases.</P>
    <P>I want to refer briefly to representations I have made on behalf of the salmon fishermen of Kinsale.  These fishermen are capable men who understand all about the salmon fishing industry.  They are anxious to preserve and develop it and make the best living possible out of it.  They have made representations to the Department that the season should be extended by two weeks from 31st July to 15th August.  The present season in the Kinsale district is five and a half months whereas in Youghal it is six months.  An extra fortnight would mean a great addition to their income from fishing.  They are satisfied beyond doubt that it would not be harmful in any way to the industry.  If they thought it would be harmful, they would not look for this extension.  In this country there are &ldquo;experts&rdquo; in every field.</P>

The season should not be extended.&rdquo;  We have far too much of that.  I have tried to get this matter dealt with locally.  An officer from the Department, who was reasonable and fair enough, called but I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to have another look at the question and extend the season from 31st July to 15th August if at all possible.</P>

      <P>As a Deputy from the Atlantic shelf, where fish were first discovered, I must speak on this Estimate. I am sorry the Parliamentary Secretary is not here but I should like to congratulate him on his appointment even though he comes from a <Col N="118" /> county where, I understand, many people do not yet know fish have been discovered.  However, being the type of man he is, I believe he will get over that trouble.</P>
      <P>I live in a town that is surrounded by fish.  They are usually winking and laughing at us.  To get out and catch them is another day's work.  We caught £3½ million worth of fish last year but there is no reason in the world why that figure could not be £23½ million or more.  I have seen Spanish, French, British and Dutch trawlers a few miles off our coast making a fortune from the fish they have caught there.  They were there until the 12-mile limit was enforced.  Indeed, they were there until I brought up in this House the question of the smuggling of brandy.  As a result of my intervention they cleared.</P>
      <P>Our methods of fishing are like the ones used by St. Peter on the Lake of Galilee when Our Lord had to intervene and help get the nets in.  Until we realise that fact and decide that fishing is an industry and not the cinderella of our economy we shall not get anywhere.  We do not do any research, we do not even know where the fish are.  It is generally accepted that the famous tuna fish, which is worth millions and is found in the Mediterranean, passes our coasts and yet in a century only one has been caught.  We do not know where they are and we have not tried to find out. We sent out a boat called the <i>Cú Feasa.</i> Where did she go?  She went only a mile or two off the coast and if she had gone out any further the crew would not have been able to find their way back.  They did not have an idea where they were going.  I remember the famous case of a boat leaving the Blacksod country to go to Sligo.  The crew were supposed to be famous seamen but they did not know where they were.  Eventually a big branch of a tree came in through one of the portholes and one of the crew said: &ldquo;A chaptaen, sílim go bhfuilimid goirid don talamh anois.&rdquo;  That was the first time they knew where they were and by that time they were well up the river.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am probably the only Deputy who spends his time in the fishing business. <Col N="119" /> I even went to the trouble of spending two years in Billingsgate Market studying the business.  Consequently, I know that what I am saying is accurate and I will not listen to experts.  I will not listen to the type of expert who, because he does not drink tea, or because he does something abnormal or subnormal, gets himself designated as an expert, like the genius who calls himself a psychiatrist or puts a brass plate up and calls himself a consultant and people eventually believe what he is saying.  We have no experts here on fishing, none whatever, and any man who knows anything about fishing knows that.  We have no experts on fishing even if some people write articles in the <i>Independent,</i> or the <i>Press, or the Irish Times.</i> I know their background&mdash;I am a lot older than I look&mdash;and I know what they are and I know their experience.  They have no experience.  They are misleading the fishermen.  They are misleading the Government and they are misleading us.</P>
    <P>I would rather pay £40,000 or £50,000 to some sane man from Norway or Greenland or Iceland, where they live by fishing, to come in here and show our people how to fish.  The finest fishing grounds in Western Europe are only a few miles from my door.  I saw the Spaniards and other foreigners take a fortune from these grounds because they knew how to fish.  Today there is nobody in them because the people do not know how to fish them; they have not been properly trained and they have no proper boats. They have been neglected.  The fish are there.  They are there to be seen and, unless they come in and give themselves up, they will be there for a long time to come.</P>
    <P>I saw the Parliamentary Secretary's speech on this Estimate.  I had a copy of it but it was taken from me.  It was so bulky someone thought it was the final report of the Vatican Council.  I do not think the Parliamentary Secretary believes a great deal of what was written in that brief.  Obviously, it was written by his civil servants who would not know the difference between a fluke and a trout if they saw the two side by side.</P>

      <P>I will get over that one.  The Parliamentary Secretary is responsible for the civil servants.  I am not mentioning any names.  Spanish and other foreign trawlers fished off our coast for well over 100 years.  They have disappeared now.  There is the question of their coming back if we go into the EEC.  That is another problem. If we had any commonsense there would be no place left for them to come back into but, at the rate we are going, and because we have failed to change and move with the times, they probably will come back.  I see Killybegs men coming up to within a few miles of Belmullet where they catch all their fish and then they go back to Killybegs, a tremendous distance, to get their fish to the market.  If we had any sense we would put a pier in Broadhaven where these people could land their fish.  The Aranman has trouble also, and so has the Errisman, in landing his fish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a sad reflection on us that we have done so little for our fisheries. Anyone where I come from can stand on the shore and see the fish winking at him and codding him but, if he goes out to catch them, his wife will probably find herself a widow the next morning because he has no place to land the fish.  For an expenditure of a few hundred thousand pounds these difficulties could easily be overcome. Everyone in that part of the country knows that.  There are £3½ million worth of fish taken in this country every year.  We are importing practically the same amount.  We live on sardines and tinned salmon from Canada.  I did a good deal of fishing when I was a young fellow and I have given many bits of good advice to fishermen over the years.  We are in the middle of the fish and, unless they jump into our boats or on to the shore, we do not bother about them.  By the grace of God, you might get out and in successfully during the summer; you will get out all right but getting in is another day's work.  I appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary to have enough <Col N="121" /> commonsense to deal with places on the west coast like Broadhaven and Inishere in the Westport area.  Broadhaven is the big fishing centre and it is the place where a pier should be put.</P>
    <P>We are up against a big problem with regard to boats.  I refer to marine insurance.  This is becoming a tremendous problem.  The fishermen are now being charged a higher premium for insurance than the repayment on the boat.  It makes the whole thing a bit ridiculous.  They can go to Northern Ireland companies but there appears to be some argument as to how right or wrong that is.  The Government should establish a fund to cover the insurance of these boats.  If we are to develop our fishery industry properly that will have to be done.</P>
    <P>I have no grievance with Bord Iascaigh Mhara.  Their boss is a good friend of mine.  Bord lascaigh Mhara have done a good deal but I believe they are misled by the alleged experts. It is there most of our troubles lie.  I do not know who brought up the one about the worms in the French boats, but it is quite true.  French boats were brought in and they certainly had worms.  I do not know what other diseases they had.  In a country in which you have so many unemployed and so many vocational schools, a country from which people emigrate to America and Britain and become famous in a very short time because of their skills, why should it be necessary to ask the French, or anybody else, to build boats for us?  The biggest joke of all was when we went into Central Europe, into Poland, to get boats built.  The Poles never see the sea at all.  What they sent could have been yokes for dipping sheep, but the experts passed them and we had to pay the subsidy on them.  We have plenty of boat-building yards.  We have expert boatbuilders. If their services were utilised and if they were given the same subsidies as the French and the Poles were given there would be no problem about building boats here.  There is no scarcity of money.  We operated for almost eight months without a single bank being open.  Did anybody find any difficulty in getting money?  I think it was more plentiful than ever.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lenehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would say it is. We could have built a good many boats during that period.  It is a shame. Boatbuilders in Killybegs and other places like that, even in Verolme, could be left off work while we send our money to foreign countries.  They do not send us orders to build boats nor do I see any reason why we should ask them to build boats for us.  There is not a more suitable place in which to establish a boat-building industry than the Belmullet area where the piers and sites are available.  However, I do not want to insist on this location as against any other part of County Mayo.</P>
      <P>When President de Valera first assumed office he sent for Mr. C.O. Stanley, a man who eventually became the owner of the firm of Pye. He asked Mr. Stanley for his views on the establishment of industries and he was told that it was essential to set up industries that were based on native products.  Had we followed that advice we would have a much different nation today.  For instance, Gaeltarra Éireann should co-operate with An Bord lascaigh Mhara to establish a boat-building industry in the Gaeltacht areas. There is no better place to estabish such an industry than my own area: the people there are tourist-minded and they are aware of the potential value of the fishing industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no reason why they should have to buy boats from foreigners.  I admit the engines must be bought from abroad; usually the Lister engines are used.  One of the biggest problems for fishermen is the fact that the engines and boats are too small.  There is not any service organisation.  I remember at one time making an appointment with the firm of Blackmore Lister to train a man to service engines.  It is very important that there should be a service organisation set up because if an engine is not in working order there is great danger to the fishermen at sea. The man whom I selected for training with the Lister organisation refused to go and we are in the same position as before.  It is all right for somebody cruising around Dublin Bay; all the services are available there, but on the west coast, at Killala, Erris Head and <Col N="123" /> Blacksod, it is a different matter.  Most of those areas have not got even a life-saving service.  I have spoken on this matter on a number of occasions but to no avail.</P>
    <P>Marketing poses another problem for the fishermen along the western coast.  There is no use in catching fish unless it can be sold at economic prices.  Transport charges are abnormal by any standard.  There must be a tremendous difference in price for the haddock or hake landed at Howth and that landed at Broadhaven.  Fishermen from the western counties must travel long distances to Dublin and when they have paid the costs of transport they find they have very little left. A subsidy should be given to CIE or to some other organisation for the transport of fish to Dublin so that financially the western fishermen will be in the same position as the fishermen in Howth or along the east coast. Anyone with commonsense must agree that I am stating facts.</P>
    <P>Most of the fish processing factories do not get sufficient quantities of fish and this is particularly the case in the Erris area.  However, no effort is being made to set up a processing plant or to establish a boat-building industry in the area.  Candidly, no effort is made to establish any kind of industry there.</P>
    <P>It is well known that nowadays oysters and mussels are the money-spinners. Two hundred years ago some of the best oyster beds in Western Europe were situated in the Erris area. In some cases sand enveloped the beds and they were destroyed.  Unfortunately the other oyster beds deteriorated because they were not properly fished; they were not dredged and the oyster fishing deteriorated.  The area is ideally situated for the development of mussel fishing but, again, nothing has been done about it.</P>
    <P>I must admit that the Inland Fisheries Trust annoy me.  However, I admit that if we did not have inland fisheries we would not have drift netting and so on.  Very many of our rivers are owned by foreigners or by persons who will not associate with the ordinary people of the country.  There is a lack of conservation and protection. <Col N="124" /> Fish stocks are falling.  Some people blame the fishermen of Greenland and Iceland who, they say, caught many salmon and reduced the stocks of our rivers and of the sea around us. The lack of conservation is to blame for the declining stocks of salmon.</P>
    <P>Some years ago a west coast salmon fisherman said to me that we were heading for disaster.  I did not realise how accurate he was.  He talked about the rainbow trout farms and said that they would bring the curse of God on salmon fishing.  I was actively engaged in the fishing industry at that time.  I now realise how right the man was.  We are heading for disaster.  When the diseased salmon were discovered they were referred to as having ulcerated dermal neurosis.  As a Latin student I never heard such a term.  I am sure that neither Cicero, Livy, Horace nor Caesar ever heard the expression either.  That was the name put on the disease afflicting the rich man's fish.  If the disease had occurred in mackerel it would have been called scab.  Who is being fooled?  The man who spoke about the rainbow trout bringing the curse of God on the salmon fishing was not far wrong.</P>
    <P>Many years ago when fishermen went to sea they brought Old Moore's Almanac with them.  They relied on it and very few of them were drowned. Now fishermen listen to forecasts being broadcast, and they are certainly being drowned.  I do not agree with the predictions of Old Moore, but they were at least as effective as the predictions today.  Something should be done to ensure that the weather forecasts are reasonably accurate.  Many of them are sheer bluff.</P>
    <P>I am sorry that the Parliamentary Secretary was not here earlier to hear me speaking about fishing boats and their allocation.  This is one of the greatest frauds of all time.  If I want a pleasure boat I have only to go to someone whom we will call &ldquo;Michael Murphy,&rdquo; and ask him to put his name down for a fishing boat.  He will agree, and I will pay the deposit.  The said Michael Murphy will forget to pay anything for the boat and after a few months it will be put up for sale and I, knowing what to do, send in a tender <Col N="125" /> for the boat.  I would also get two or three friends to send in tenders and then get the fellows with the higher tenders than mine to withdraw.  Of course I will then get the boat.  It is time that such blackguardism was exposed. I personally do not deal in fishing boats.  Blackguards are operating such a scheme.  My good friend from the southern Atlantic shelf could probably agree with me on this.</P>
    <P>I understand that An Bord Iascaigh Mhara own boat-building yards and that what they build is acceptable even if it is made of inferior materials.  If people with private boat-building yards try to build boats they find themselves in trouble.  A ridiculous thing came to my notice recently where a boat was built with one-inch planking&mdash;that is the timber which goes around the boat on the outside.  In respect of the boat to which I refer, some self-appointed genius from An Bord lascaigh Mhara discovered that the timber was one-quarter inch too thin.  He issued instructions to the builder to have this corrected, even though the boat was at sea.  I do not know how such alteration could be done.  If a wall was too thin it could be plastered to increase its thickness but I do not know what one could do to thicken the timber of a boat by one-quarter inch.  I have the document about this boat at home.  The boat was built and was at sea when the man got the notice that no grant would be paid until the timber was thickened by one-quarter inch.  How does one cope with that kind of thing?  Maybe he could accept it.  I would not, anyway.</P>
    <P>There has been an absolute lack of research into the fisheries industry in this country and it is a great shame. Off Erris, we have the best fishing area in Europe.  Long before the Famine, people went from this country to places such as Iceland and brought fish back to this country.  They even sold some of it in Britain.  Our present figure of £3½ million is only a joke.  It should be £33 million.</P>
    <P>Our marketing methods must be the most primitive in the world&mdash;a hit and miss affair.  Just consider, too, the fact that fish caught off the Mayo coast must be brought for processing to Killybegs, miles and miles away, by <Col N="126" /> truck.  Valuable time is spent carting the fish to Donegal when the men could be fishing if a plant were at their disposal in Broadhaven Bay.  If a pier were built there, the men of Erris and of Achill could bring in their boats there.  They would get a higher profit because valuable time would not be wasted travelling.  In a country surrounded by sea and by fish it is remarkable that nobody in the midlands seems to know what fish is.  Very few hotels in Dublin serve fish for breakfast. If you went to Longford and asked for fish&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is not.  If 300 girls were going in for that cookery competition you could take it that 295 out of the 300 of them never saw a fish until the competition started.  This is true especially of the midlands.  What happens then?  She gets this thing.  She does not know whether it is fish, flesh or a tractor gate or a tyre or what it is.  She will have to produce something out of it.  With a bit of luck, it is quite possible that the lady making the decision never saw a fish until she saw this thing on the plate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our advertising system for fish is completely and entirely behind the times.  If we want to make progress in our fisheries we should stop fooling around with BIM and a lot of these <Col N="127" /> other self-appointed, self-opinionated experts.  We should get in a few people from countries where fish is the staple diet and where fish is the main source of livelihood.  They will have to come from some of the northern countries. The Parliamentary Secretary was not here when I started my speech.  I wish to congratulate him on his appointment even though he comes from a county where, according to some people here, fish have not yet been invented. It is not too late to try.  I am sure he is a very able man who, like myself, can persevere.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly if I had the appointing of a Minister for Fisheries I would hardly go beyond the last speaker.  His turn may come yet. I hope it will.  I do not believe in attacking BIM.  They have done the best they could with the money available. We have to go back further than that to put our finger on the cause of our neglect of our fishing industry. About 40 years ago we had a separate Ministry for Fisheries.  The first thing we should do is to make this branch a Department to look after our fishing industry which is more important now than ever.  I trust I shall live to see the day when fisheries will have a separate Ministry and when more money will be available for the improvement of this very vital industry.</P>
      <P>We have up to 500 miles of coastline in my constituency.  We are one of the few countries in western Europe with a big fishing potential. The trawlers of the world are creeping in around our coasts into our harbours and into our fisheries.  I have seen trawlers from France and Spain shell fishing inside our limits.  They have been doing so for years; they are doing it today.  It is a sad reflection on our Government that we cannot protect our greatest industry next to agriculture.  This cannot be denied.  I could get plenty of witnesses to prove it.  Somebody is to blame for the fact that through the years there was not sufficient foresight to protect this industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the new Parliamentary Secretary, who has a great deal of work to do.  I hope he will do his best while <Col N="128" /> in office.  I can assure him that while we are speaking and sitting here our fisheries are being raided all round the coast.  We must also consider sea angling and tourism.  I can speak for my own part of the country.  Around Kinsale we have great potential for sea angling not only from Kinsale but also from Schull, Courtmacsherry, Union Hall and the Beare Penninsula. Thousands of people come there every year for sea angling.  The last speaker spoke of the novice who came over and caught a fish.  Certainly, fish are plentiful enough for this to happen.  Not only is sea angling beneficial to the fishermen but it is a great tourist attraction and when hotels are not being kept full at certain times of the year. The Minister should direct his attention to this aspect of the business.</P>
    <P>Prices for shellfish are very good at present and there is fear of overfishing around our coast.  I hope the Department will bear this in mind because overfishing would be disastrous and between home and foreign fishing there is a danger of this happening.</P>
    <P>I want to pay tribute to those who have restocked salmon and trout rivers, especially the ESB, and others who are striving to maintain our stocks of fish. Pollution problems should also be tackled.  The Blackwater and other rivers have been polluted, especially in summer when the volume of water is very low and fish stocks have been depleted as a result.</P>
    <P>I come now to what I consider to be a very important aspect of the fishing industry, the training of young men as future fishermen.  Our efforts in that respect have been very small, but if we are to interest people in fishing we must train young men.  It is not enough to say at present that we have a few schools doing that.  These should be established all around the coast.  We have not even one school in the vast area of County Cork providing this training.  Vocational schools should be able to offer young men suitable training, especially in the maritime counties.  They should be trained in thousands because there is no use in putting a man into a boat unless he has some experience or knowledge of the fishing industry.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="129" /> I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to consider that aspect of the industry and seek the co-operation of the vocational committees and schools in attracting and training young men for the industry.  I feel sure there would be many applicants if this training was fully advertised and if the young people realised the importance of the industry and the amount of money that can be made in it.  It is now more important than ever if we are to enter EEC where prices will be better than they have been in the past.</P>
    <P>The previous speaker referred to the marketing of fish.  We have no marketing system and people living within five miles of the coast who are anxious to get fish at least one day a week cannot do so.  Why have we never established a marketing system?  The demand exists and this is a need that should be attended to.  In fact, much of the fish we export could be used at home because there is a market for it.</P>
    <P>We have a number of boat-building yards and these are not being given the help or the orders sufficient to keep them going.  I am glad to say that Baltimore yard in my own constituency is now building boats up to 75 feet long. I trust that yard will be kept going, that it will expand and be able to build even bigger boats.  I am sorry the Deputy who has just left did not remain to hear this.  I know a family with eight boats fishing out of Union Hall.  They bought a 75-foot boat recently.  A pier was being extended there.  One of the problems of the fishermen there is that the piers are too short to shelter boats of that size. At Green Pier, outside Union Hall, an extension was being provided for boats up to 40 feet but this man acquired a 75-foot boat and it was impossible to bring it into that harbour because of lack of shelter in bad weather.  I know this does not come within this Estimate.  The Board of Works deal with it.  I am showing that there is no good in having boats unless we have harbours for them.</P>
    <P>We have been hearing for a number of years that we are to have a fishmeal plant at Castletownbere.  This has been said for so long and so little has been done about it that the people <Col N="130" /> there think it is just another false alarm.  I have been speaking to the people concerned and I am told that it will come, but the time is now ripe to provide it.  We are importing an amount of fishmeal for use in rations for every type of livestock while on our own coasts we have the coarse fish which are suitable for a fishmeal plant.</P>
    <P>In Castletownbere the pier has been extended and improved and I want to congratulate all those concerned.  It is magnificent.  I hope it will be finished very soon and it will then be availed of by the fishing industry there.  We badly need the facilities to deal with the fish when they are brought in. When we have the harbour surely we must have a plant to deal with the coarse fish that is thrown back into the water from the boats because it is not of commercial use?  We could easily keep a factory going there and give employment to fishermen in lean times.  I would appeal to all concerned to see that a fishmeal plant is provided there as soon as possible.  When the Parliamentary Secretary is replying I should like him to give us the information we want.  Will we get it? When will we get it?  I should also like to impress upon him the necessity for the plant.</P>
    <P>Another important matter is the safety of our fishermen.  Our coasts are very exposed and very wild.  At various times men and boats have been lost.  We had a terrible tragedy on the Kenmare river a few years ago when several fishermen and a boat were lost.  It is my belief that fishermen could be saved if we had a lifesaving service for them when they are out in bad weather.  Probably a number of people are dissuaded from applying to join the fishing industry when they find that no provision is made for their safety when they are engaged in fishing and are caught out in bad weather.</P>
    <P>At present we are negotiating to join the Common Market.  As I said at the start, there are great possibilities.  We must safeguard out territorial waters from incursions by foreign trawlers.  I should like some information about our fishery limits.  At the moment we cannot protect what we have, and what <Col N="131" /> will happen to us when we get into the Common Market?  The Norwegian Government consider this so important that they are undecided about joining the Common Market unless they can have limits within which they can fish themselves and keep out other fishermen from foreign countries, and even from Common Market countries.  This is especially important for us because we are not as advanced as Norway. Our coastline is nearly as long as theirs and our fishing around the coast is nearly as good as theirs.  We really are not prepared for entry into the Common Market in this respect.</P>
    <P>Off Kinsale Harbour every year fishermen come from all over the world practically to fish for blue shark and other fish that are plentiful there.  They have mother boats to which they transfer their catch to take it back to Norway to be cured.  We have done nothing in that regard.  There is a great potential there for some type of factory to process this type of fish.</P>
    <P>To summarise, I consider the provision of a separate Department as the No. 1 priority.  I put protection as No. 2. If we cannot protect our fisheries we have no business in the industry.  If we can see trawlers coming in all around our coast and taking away the fish which should be ours, what business have our fishermen going out if their boats are too small to stay out in the very bad weather in which these big Spanish, French and Dutch boats can stay out in safety?  No. 3, I would put the training of our young fishermen. This is very important.  A school should be provided along the southern coast to train young fishermen and the vocational schools should be asked to provide students to be educated in the fishing industry.</P>
    <P>I have already mentioned the fishmeal factory at Castletownbere.  It is about time this was provided.  We have the harbour there and a magnificent pier.  We have the fish just outside and in the harbour.  This factory would not only give employment to fishermen there but it would also give a lot of employment where it is badly needed in the Beara Penninsula.</P>
    <P>Members of An Bord Iascaigh Mhara <Col N="132" /> are smiling and I hope that is a good sign.  If they were looking any way gruff I would say it would not be coming but by their expression I can see they are agreeing with what I say on that matter.</P>
    <P>It is very important that our negotiations for entry into the Common Market are successful and that we have people who are able to negotiate on our behalf in the Common Market. If we lost that advantage it would be a national loss.</P>
    <P>More should be done by the Department to promote sea angling.  It is a money spinner.  People not alone from England and Scotland but from the Continent are coming to our shores and are very happy with the results.  We should have better facilities and better boats for them.  They are an important part of our tourist industry.</P>
    <P>We should not go to Norway or to Poland or to France for fishing boats.  We have in Cork harbour a shipbuilding yard which gives employment to many people.  That yard should be able to build the biggest boats and should have been building them for years.  I would like the Parliamentary Secretary to get in touch with these people and find out what they can do and if they want something provide them with whatever they want so that they will be able to build our own boats.  I have spoken to fishermen who have told me that the boats built in this country are better than any boat that has been imported.  We may not be able to build the big ones in some yards but in the boatyard in Cork we certainly could build them up to the capacity, size and tonnage of any of the foreign boats that have been brought into the country.  I appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary to get in touch with this yard and to see that they are given provision to build the boats, to employ Irish people and to keep our money at home.  We are not getting much from Norway or from Poland and the least we should do is to give our native boatyard the work. If we want bigger boats the dockyard in Cobh should build them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy M.P. Murphy referred to the extension of the salmon fishing season and I should like to <Col N="133" /> comment on it with regard to the Boyne.  The Boyne, where it runs into the sea at Mornington, is a very good net fishing area.  People who are real fishermen live in Mornington.  They live off the sea and off the river.  They do not do any other type of work and they do not draw social welfare benefit. To use their own expression, they want nothing from anybody.</P>
      <P>Salmon fishing there for a long time has been from 12th February to 12th August.  Some years ago they made an application for an extension of the season.  They did not mind whether they got an extension at the beginning or at the end.  They felt they would not be doing any damage to the fishing or to the salmon stock if they were given the extension.  If they got an extension at the beginning they would catch more small salmon for a longer period, and if they got an extension at the end of the season they would probably catch a smaller number of larger salmon.  The price would be much lower of course at that period.  One of the people Deputy J. Lenehan was talking about earlier held an inquiry into the matter and decided they would not get an extension at either end.  I do not know why this decision was taken but that was it and they had to abide by it.  I do not agree at all with Deputy Lenehan's comments on the Fisheries Branch.  They do a job and I am quite sure they do it to the best of their ability and they do what they think is correct.  Experts are useful sometimes even if some people tend to scoff at them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The salmon fishing season varies from one river to another.  If one can catch salmon on 1st January in the Liffey I do not understand why one must wait until 12th February to catch salmon in the Boyne which is only 30 miles away.  There must be a reason for it.  The Parliamentary Secretary might, as part of his job, ask for a report on the dates of salmon fishing in the various rivers and find out whether there is any reason for the big disparity in dates.  It means a lot to the fisherman who is depending on fishing for his livelihood.  It may not mean so much to the man who goes out with a rod and line.  He may <Col N="134" /> catch an odd salmon and sell it.  If he does not, he does not go hungry. The netman does.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Boyne, the Parliamentary Secretary is aware that there is a big harbour project commencing there.  The Drogheda Harbour Commissioners propose to move the harbour from Drogheda to the very mouth of the Boyne at Mornington.  This may have an effect on the salmon fishing. It depends entirely on how it is carried out.  Every effort should be made to ensure that the least possible damage will be done.  In addition to this, arterial drainage of the Boyne is in progress and this is bound to affect salmon fishing.  The Parliamentary Secretary may say that the Drogheda Board of Conservators are looking after the fishing interests there.  While some people would agree with him I would not.  I know they are doing a job but it is generally recognised that since their main interest is angling their sympathy for the net fishermen may not be as great as some people would imagine it should be.</P>
    <P>With regard to re-stocking, we had lectures from some Deputies on whether or not stocks are going down.  I do not think many people who have spoken here understand that when re-stocking is carried out by boards of conservators or by fishing clubs, they put into the river literally millions of ova or eggs and if even a fraction of those are hatched out and go down to the sea and if the stock of salmon in that river does not increase as a result then there is something more than the infamous salmon disease, to which Deputy Lenehan referred, affecting the fishing. I would suggest there is a lot in the suggestion that people who catch the salmon on the way to the river are scooping the result of a lot of the re-stocking which is carried out and there is very little we can do about it.  That is their means of livelihood and if they take a big proportion of the salmon that would normally find their way back up the river then it cannot be helped.</P>
    <P>When rivers like the Boyne are drained there is a lot of interference with the spawning beds.  I know the Board of Works are attempting, by doing various sections and leaving some <Col N="135" /> tributaries completely undisturbed, to allow the salmon to use these tributaries.  This may or may not be effective.  Most people know that a salmon usually goes right back to the same spawning bed and if it is torn up it does not as a rule go into one nearby but probably returns to sea.  I am sure that for a number of years there will be quite a lean time for the fishermen in Mornington following the cleaning, deepening and widening of the Boyne. I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to extend the season.  At least let them get what they can for a longer period because it does appear that they will not be able to live on what they will get from February to August.</P>
    <P>When the salmon fishing season is over those people live on mussel fishing. I might say here that the Boyne mussels are perhaps the best mussels not only in this country but in this part of Europe.  However, it also is the case that for some hundreds of years past sewage from the town of Drogheda has been poured into the Boyne with the result that the shellfish is contaminated.  However, an extraordinary feature in this regard is that, although the people of the area eat the shellfish, they do not appear to suffer any ill effects from it.</P>

      <P>I suppose they are immune to it from the time they are born.  If the fish were to be eaten raw by an outsider, such person would probably suffer serious effects, whereas the processed fish is safe for human consumption.  People in this area pick the mussels and sell them either for processing elsewhere in the country or abroad, or else they are sold for bait. On every occasion on which I have spoken here on fisheries I have asked why a processing plant or a purification tank cannot be given to those people.  If it were the case that only a couple of hundred bags of mussels were concerned, I could understand why this could not be done; but every <Col N="136" /> year, even at the low price paid for contaminated fish, there is picked and sold thousands of pounds worth of fish in the area.  Approximately 40 families live by mussel fishing in the area.  Sometimes it is easy to get a market, but at other times it is not easy.  Last year, as on a previous occasion, I found it necessary to go to the present Minister's predecessor to ask for assistance in finding markets for the mussels.  I am glad to say that the Department did everything possible to find such markets.</P>
      <P>At present the widening of the Boyne and the changing of the harbour by the Drogheda board is having an effect on the river bed.  At one time the fishermen were satisfied that their livelihood would be taken away completely. Some experts from the Department went down to the area and reported on their findings.  It was suggested that the loss to the mussel-men, as they are called, would not be so great because the mussels would live even in deep water.  Mussels are raised in different ways in different parts of the world. The Mornington men raise them by means of a rake.  The snag here in relation to the report was the proposal to deepen the waters to a depth of 20 feet.  Since these people could not use a 20 or 24 foot rake to reach this depth, the suggestion that there would be no change in their livelihood was a little ridiculous.  I suggested that the Department might perhaps introduce skin diving there but it was pointed out to me that since mussel fishing was done during winter that might not be the answer either.  Maybe if there were pearls to be found in the mussels, somebody might be interested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These people maintain that they are not being looked after properly by the Department.  From time to time I have led deputations who were complaining about what Drogheda Harbour Commissioners had being doing to them and who, on other occasions, were seeking markets.  I understand that Drogheda Harbour Commissioners have a job to do but, nevertheless, I should like to point out that for several hundred years fishermen from that village had the right to fish there for both salmon and mussels.  This right should not be taken away without some <Col N="137" /> form of consideration being given to them.  Compensation was suggested but I would not consider that to be the answer.  The peculiar position is that there might be as many as seven members of one family engaged in picking mussels.  Some people might be engaged in a part-time capacity in this work.  The system which they have operates well.  All I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to do is to request a senior official to ensure that the interests of the fishermen are properly looked after.</P>
    <P>On one occasion last year following discussions with Department officials, an official came to Mornington to meet the fishermen and I was there.  Arrangements were being made for the setting up of a co-operative.  A further meeting was arranged and this duly took place.  However, after a third meeting had been arranged the official who was involved in making the arrangements telephoned me to say he was sorry he could not come because he had been told by a more senior official he was not to have anything to do with these arrangements.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the change of mind came about because it was I who was involved.  I suggested that if that was the obstacle I would opt out of the discussions.  Possibly the change was because of the widening of the river, the work on which was soon to commence.  At any rate, no further interest has been taken in this project. It would be a great pity if the mussel industry were allowed to be damaged irreparably.  After the floods in 1955 or 1956, the Department put up about £1,100 for the purpose of reseeding the mussels there.  One of the interests who had been taking mussels from the fishermen put up a similar amount.  Subsequently, another concern agreed to put up money for this purpose.</P>
    <P>I wish to make it clear that the crop of mussels in the Boyne at the present time is the best that has been there for many years but there are portions of the river where the mussels grew well a few years ago but where they are no longer growing because Drogheda Harbour Commissioners cleared away the beds.  Arrangements were made for the beds to be re-seeded by bringing the <Col N="138" /> dredger back up the river and putting them in the place where they had been previously.  However, this was not done.  The tops had been removed from the sand banks and anybody will know what happens if a scoop of mussels are thrown into a fairly fast flowing river.  They will not go to the bottom. Rather, they will go out some distance and be lost completely.</P>
    <P>I am spending some time on this matter because of the importance of the industry.  I know the efforts that have been made by the Department to have the industry established elsewhere. But when one finds a place where an industry is already established and where there are people who know the business, these people should get whatever consideration can be given.</P>
    <P>At one period one of the men there thought he would be able to make a success of processing the mussels himself. After he had started to do so he received a number of orders but there was a snag.  The permit he got for processing the mussels was issued subject to the mussels being sold abroad.  He could have got many orders in Drogheda for canned mussels, and the temptation to fill these orders was very great, but since the permit would only enable him to process for export he was forced to give up the idea.  This is a matter which the Parliamentary Secretary might have investigated by somebody.</P>
    <P>A number of Departmental officials have been down there for some time but some of the people cannot see the wood for the trees.  A fresh approach to this is needed by somebody who would go down there and take an unbiased look at the whole thing.  Even though the work done by some of those people is excellent and some of the reports which I have been supplied with show exactly what mussels are there and where they can be found, it is not enough to prove they are there and then go back to Dublin and say: &ldquo;Did we not do a good job?' That is not the answer to the matter.  It should be dealt with in another way.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary referred to two fishmeal factories and mentioned <Col N="139" /> that one of them was at Mornington but, having said that, like the moving finger, he moved off.  He did not go into any detail as to exactly what was the position there.  That fishmeal factory on the mouth of the Boyne does not appear to be getting the supply of fish which it requires for full-time operation. If it were in Bangor Erris it would be supplied with all the fish it required but for some reason the factory at Mornington is not being supplied with the fish.  I would like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary how much research was done before the factory was sited in a place where there does not appear to be a sufficient supply of fish.  I know certain fishermen would kick up a row and say: &ldquo;We are doing well; the fishmeal factory is doing a very good job.&rdquo;  I am not faulting the factory but I deplore the fact that for some extraordinary reason the factory does not appear to be able to get enough fish to keep it going full time.</P>
    <P>When Meath County Council gave permission for the factory to be built there it was then an amenity area and they had to break all the known regulations in order to give permission to build the factory there.  The factory having been built with the OK of the county council members, certain stringent conditions were laid down, one of them being that fish should not be carried to the factory in an open lorry. There have been suggestions that this regulation is not being carried out and that open lorries go at a very fast pace towards the factory, go round a corner and dump fish on the side of the road. I do not know if that is true but the complaints have been made to me. If it is true, it should not be allowed. People on the far side of the river in County Louth have been consistently complaining about the bad smell.  Some of them have had to leave their game of golf and the local pub because of the smell of fish.  I live within 2½ miles of the factory but I am fortunate because I have never found the smell of fish affecting the area in which I live. I have met people who say that at times the smell can be very unpleasant. If the regulations are laid down the Parliamentary Secretary's Department <Col N="140" /> should ensure that they are carried out. Perhaps when he is replying to the debate he will let us know the value of fish received at that factory and the value of fishmeal which has gone out.  I have been adding up the amount of fish caught and it appears as if the sand eels and sprats he referred to as being the fish which is to go there, must be in a relatively small quantity because they do not seem to make up a lot of money.  I would like the Parliamentary Secretary, if he has got the information, to let me have it.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary also referred to the importation of fish. He made this rather extraordinary statement:</P>
    <P>The imports of fishery products in 1969 were valued at £1,863,000 but tinned salmon, sardines, et cetera accounted for £863,000 of the total value.</P>
    <P>Apparently it is felt that since a little over half of the total imports, £863,000, is tinned salmon it does not matter so much.  Would the Parliamentary Secretary tell me what is the position about tinning salmon here because there is a large supply of salmon? Surely it should be possible for the home market to supply tinned salmon?</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to the cooking of fish and the price of fish. Deputy Kavanagh spoke about this last week.  With regard to the supply of fish in hotels, when one asks if the salmon is fresh, one is told that it is.  Some of the people who say that consider that fresh out of the fridge is fresh.  I am told it is very difficult even in the height of the season to get fresh salmon.  Those of us who have eaten very fresh salmon get put off by something which has been in the deep freeze for a very long time.</P>
    <P>Salmon, like trout, cannot be badly cooked; it is eatable no matter what way it is cooked if it is fresh.  Other types of fish served in hotels and restaurants in this country often put people completely off eating fish.  I cannot understand why so-called first-class hotels do not understand that there are many ways of cooking fish besides frying or grilling.  If you go to any other country you will find that fish is supplied in so many different <Col N="141" /> ways that sometimes it is difficult even to realise that it is fish you are eating; it is eatable; and the customer will demand the same dish again and again.</P>
    <P>I have gone to hotels in this country where the price of fish was high and the fish was high also.  This is not good enough.  It is bad enough to get stale fish but to have to pay a fancy price for it is not good enough. It should be easy enough to get a supply of fresh fish but it still appears to be very difficult for some people to get it.  I do not agree with Deputy Lenehan when he criticised the fish cooking competitions.  He was most unfair to the girls who take part in these competitions.  Every county has its own competition.  This is a great thing because many of those people never saw fish until somebody taught them to cook it.  They now know how to cook it.  I decry somebody coming into this House, and I am quite sure getting a considerable amount of adverse publicity for it, saying something like this.  This is one of the good things about those competitions which should not be run down.  It is only fair to say that Deputy Lenehan knows a lot about sea fishing.  Somebody said to me a long time ago when I criticised something I saw: &ldquo;Do not criticise.  There is a use for everything.&rdquo;  Deputy Lenehan is good at sea fishing.</P>
    <P>The question of the ownership of inland fisheries has been mentioned here and this brings up a couple of problems to which I would like to refer.  At the present time the only good thing about the system of ownership that I know is that the people who own the fish try to preserve the waters and in many cases restock them.</P>
    <P>Poaching is carried out.  It is not exactly a crime; it is a game some people love to be involved in because it is against the law.  They get a thrill out of it, and I am sure there are many Members of the House who from time to time have enjoyed a poached trout or salmon.  I would suggest, without in any way encouraging that sort of thing, that pollution is a far greater killer of fish than the poacher, but I do not think anybody even this year is doing very much to try to end the <Col N="142" /> pollution of our rivers.  The amount of damage is realised only when somebody points out hundreds of dead trout or salmon killed because somebody was careless with either an effluent from a factory or more often the stupid use of some type of weed killer or farm effluent which has not been channelled away properly.  It is amazing all the big fish that come to the surface of a river when something like that comes in.</P>
    <P>It is an awful thing to find that the farmer who is so proud of his right to own his land in Ireland very often is not allowed to fish off his own land. Some of us will say that the landlord who held on to the fishing rights, and in some cases the game rights, although they do not arise here, when the land was being taken over by the Land Commission, and continues to use them is committing a terrible crime.  I would call it just as much a crime if somebody&mdash;and the Land Commission is one of them&mdash;holds on to these rights and sets them out to somebody else who will also be prepared to say the farmer is not entitled to fish off his own land.  That is entirely wrong.  I believe eventually this country will have to reach the stage, no matter what Government are in power, where the fishing rights will be retained on a public ownership basis.</P>
    <P>I do not mean we should be prepared, as some people suggest, to walk into somebody's house or castle and as a gesture put up a flag over the front door and say: &ldquo;We own the fishing rights.&rdquo;  What that has to do with it I do not know, but if compensation has to be fixed, then compensation should be fixed, so that eventually the people will in a reasonable way be entitled to use the inland waterways for recreational purposes.</P>
    <P>There are certain gentlemen who have been making quite a lot of money out of the fishing rights.  They are usually people who do not need money. Some of them have a lovely arrangement whereby the man or woman who wants a day's fishing pays&mdash;unless they are film stars, in which case they do not pay anything&mdash;five, six or seven guineas per day.  They are allowed to catch as many fish as they are able to <Col N="143" /> but they are allowed to hold on to only one; the rest must be handed back to the owner of the right.  These people have been doing this for a long time and their fathers and grandfathers before them and they consider they have a divine right to do it.  I believe this right should cease.  While the antecedents of some of these people may have been foreigners, British people who came in here and got control of the land they hold by conquest, they themselves through the fact that they are living here for so long and intermarried with the Irish, have become, in the words of the cliché, more Irish than we are.  Some of them are; but many of them still preserve a phoney English accent and like to give the impression they belong to a different race and that we are the type of serfs with which their greatgrand-fathers dealt 100 years ago.</P>
    <P>The time is coming when something will have to be done to settle this problem. It should not be left to either illegal organisations or other outside groups who can claim that it is as a result of pressure they are exerting that these changes are brought about. This is a matter for which the Fisheries Branch should have responsibility and for which they should show they have responsibility.  I know you cannot snap your fingers and produce money to pay off these gentlemen, but if it has to be done the best way to do it is to estimate what it would cost and, if necessary, pay it by degrees.  If that was attempted it might remove one cause of dissension, and we shall still have enough left even if that is gone.</P>
    <P>I mentioned earlier that there is re-stocking of lakes and particularly rivers, and but for this I am sure the fishing stocks would have gone completely. Again, some of the people I have been criticising have, to be fair to them, participated in and, in many cases, spearheaded this restocking.  It is not enough for the State or whoever else takes over to say: &ldquo;There is your river.  You will have to carry on.&rdquo; Somebody must do the work, and therefore the responsibilities will fall back on the State or some State body.</P>
    <P>In addition to this, the various boards <Col N="144" /> of conservators have a number of people they call fishery protective staff. These men mainly prevent poaching and do a good job.  For a number of years the rate of pay they were getting was very small and during the past two years an effort has been made to improve their pay.  Somebody said some years back that since they were from the country the proper thing to do was to pay them the same rate as farm workers.  The reason of course was that the farm worker was the worst paid man they could think of and so he was the right example to take.  However, when they found there was a fairly hefty overtime rate for Saturday afternoon, Saturday night and Sunday they did not want to pay the overtime. They have never paid it even though the fishery protection staff are required to work on these days.  Sometimes these workers come across an awkward person who will not be very interested in what he might get in the river, who would rather have a row than his breakfast and so will hit the water protection man with something, and some of these men have been grievously injured.  Despite this the rates of pay are mostly very low.</P>
    <P>The trade union I represent has some of these people and another trade union has more of them.  Various claims have been made for them, whether or not they should have the same rate as gardaí for doing the same job and doing a more dangerous job in some cases.  Others say they should be paid a reasonable rate; I do not know what a reasonable rate is.</P>
    <P>One board in particular agreed in July last that until some kind of general wage rate had been agreed they would pay £1 a week to their staff; then they raised it to 30s.  They sent this proposal for sanction to the Parliamentary Secretary's office but it was never sanctioned.  Subsequently, when the agreement for £2 10s from April and 30s or 34s from January was passed the board sent it for sanction by the Department but it was never passed.  It has not been passed since because they now say the Prices and Incomes Bill which, if Deputy Colley gets away with it, is only dated back to 18th October, is preventing them from sanctioning something which <Col N="145" /> was agreed upon last July.  I mention this in passing because this is the sort of stupid approach which an intelligent man like the Parliamentary Secretary should not allow to happen under his nose.  If he does not know that it has happened I would advise him to have a look at it.</P>
    <P>I had a question down today because I had a case about it in the Labour Court.  An official, a very decent and efficient man from the Parliamentary Secretary's Department, came as adviser to the two sides, the Fisheries Board and me.  I did not ask for him, and certainly he gave me no advice except that he did not want to pay.  Eventually he brought the representative from the Fisheries Board outside because he said he was giving away too much, or words to that effect. We should treat these people as ordinary, intelligent workers and they should be paid a rate for the job.  I suggest the Parliamentary Secretary take a look at it because I believe the thing has gone a little too far.  They are still working on the 11th round wage increase when all others have got their 12th round and are now looking for the 13th round.</P>
    <P>A couple of years ago when the Fisheries Consolidation Bill, which Deputy Murphy was talking about, was introduced it was suggested that a second Bill should be brought in to do certain things, one of them being to introduce a pension scheme.  The Bill was brought into the House one day and it had a pension scheme for inspectors only.  The others were not mentioned; they did not exist.  The Bill has gone out again and a gentleman in the Labour Court told me it will be brought up for redrafting.  I do not know but maybe the Parliamentary Secretary will say if it is proposed to bring it in again and, if it is, is it proposed to cover ordinary mortals? I think it is wrong to cover one section and leave out the people who really need protection.</P>
    <P>The EEC has been mentioned and a member of the Labour Party will deal exclusively with it.  When one begins to talk about the EEC the first thing that comes up is: what kind of defence are we putting up now against <Col N="146" /> fishing by foreigners?  What kind of boats are we putting out to compete? I know An Bord lascaigh Mhara have been helping out considerably with the supply of boats.  I know too that some of the people are not very happy with the boats they have got.  Will the Parliamentary Secretary tell me who took the policy decision that the boats which these people are getting were not to be made in Irish boatyards?  It turns out that because of soft wood or something else, which is unsuitable for sea water, these boats now require complete refitting.  Everyone else has asked that question so I am skipping it.</P>

They are repairing boats, because they cannot get the orders which BIM gave to a foreign country.  I realise it is very easy for me to talk and I know I am making suggestions without knowing the full facts but, to my mind, there is absolutely no excuse for the fact that boats were bought abroad when they could be produced at home.  When the boats turn out to be duds, BIM and the Government raise their hands and say: &ldquo;The fault was not ours; you got what you asked for.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am advocating that it should be compulsory, as far as possible, for fishermen to buy Irish boats. There may be engines and some other parts which have to be bought abroad, but it is a scandal, particularly in view of the fact that boats can be produced here, that they are not produced.  I am quite sure the Parliamentary Secretary has seen fishermen who require a boat with tools which are long out-of-date. The Parliamentary Secretary knows when it is finished the job will be a good one and the boat will be on the water for a long time.</P>
      <P>In this case big boats, which would have brought a great deal of employment into boatyards in this country, were bought abroad and they turned out to be duds.  It is not because they turned out to be duds that I am blaming the Parliamentary Secretary.  I am blaming whoever made the decision that the boats should be bought anywhere other than here.  If, as the Parliamentary Secretary has said, the BIM boatyards are full, then we need more boatyards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy J. Lenehan very correctly said that for an island race we do not <Col N="148" /> know very much about fishing and it is an extraordinary thing that we do not.  In regard to the one thing in respect of which we could do well, we do not appear to be doing well.  I agree also with Deputy J. Lenehan that when an industry is being established, an industry which can be supplied from local raw materials should be encouraged.  There may be dozens of answers to what I have said. The Parliamentary Secretary's head is probably buzzing with all the answers he could give to shoot me down, but I am giving him the story as I see it. Every effort should be made to ensure that in future Irish-made boats are used.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer now to the question of the training of fishermen. Again, let me come back to Mornington to point out that the situation there is that practically every boy from the age of about 16 years goes to sea. It is an extraordinary thing; without any fuss, when he reaches a certain age, he goes to sea and he travels all round the world for five, six or ten years.  Some stay on, but most come back and start fishing on the Boyne. Is it not even more extraordinary that no effort ever seems to have been made to try to recruit these for an Irish fishing fleet?  Why has no one ever gone along and talked to them and told them what the advantages would be if they were trained to do the job properly, particularly now with the fishmeal factory there in which extra fish is needed? Is it not extraordinary that BIM, for instance, do not see their way to sending someone along to talk to these young men and advise them to acquire boats of their own so that they can assist in supplying fish to the local factory?  It does not seem to have struck anyone that this is the right thing to do.  These young men go to sea anyway.  This is their way of life as it was the way of life of their fathers and grandfathers before them.  I suggest that there would be very fruitful results if someone would go along and encourage these people to engage in an industry which is on their own doorstep.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJVMeaney" hpid="Mr. Meaney Mr. Meaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary on the introduction of his first Estimate.  We do <Col N="149" /> not pay nearly enough attention to our fishing industry.  I agree with Deputy O'Sullivan's suggestion that we need a special Ministry to deal with fisheries. The Parliamentary Secretary has a very challenging job but I know he will cope with it.</P>
      <P>It is strange that an island people like us are not great exporters of fish or great eaters of fish.  Our total exports in 1969 amounted to something like £3½ million.  This is certainly an improvement on the early sixties when our exports were approximately £1½ million, but it is far short of what it should be.  I see no reason at all why our total exports should not be in the region of £70 million or £80 million per year if we paid proper attention to the industry.  I suppose it is easy for me to say that; by tradition, we are not a great fish exporting nation.</P>
      <P>It is sad to see how few fish we eat per capita.  I note that domestic fish consumption has risen from 7.5 lbs in 1963 to 10.7 lbs per capita in 1969. As Deputy J. Lenehan said, many people in inland areas never get fresh fish at all.  I know there are promotional campaigns costing approximately £30,000 per annum.  Nevertheless, it is very difficult to get fish in hotels, for instance, be the hotels big or small. One is told that there is no fish available at the moment.  That should not happen. We must overcome these difficulties.  On the occasions on which one actually gets fish the cost is far in excess of that which the fisherman who caught the fish received.  That shows there is something radically wrong with our system of marketing. Fish is ferried to and fro across the country, between processing and everything else, and this adds to its cost. By the time it reaches the table its price is almost prohibitive.  To give one small example of the difficulty of procuring fish, if one asks for a sandwich one is never offered a fish sandwich.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister will have to step up his publicity campaign through the medium of television, radio and so on. Something on the lines of the bacon promotional campaign-Bring Home the Bacon-might pay dividends.  Friday is out as a special fish day.  I do not think it ever was any advantage to <Col N="150" /> the industry, but some day should be a fish day.</P>
    <P>There is the national fish cookery competition.  Apart from training young girls in the preparing of fish it is a good advertisement.  In the last eight years approximately 130,000 girls went in for this cookery competition.  This may seem a big figure but, if one breaks it down, it is not that big at all.  There is a good deal of leeway to be made up.  More advertising could be done through the vocational schools.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully suggested that when grants and loans are given under the marine credit plan for the purchase of new vessels and gear it should be a condition precedent that these should be made in this country.  This is something the Parliamentary Secretary could examine.  He has stated that the various yards are full for the next 12 months but, if he looks around the coast, he will find yards that could be utilised.  Such a development would give a good deal of employment. In Cork harbour there are facilities which would enable the biggest fishing vessel required to be constructed.  It is a shame that an island people like us should have to go abroad for boats and gear.  Perhaps there was no other choice, but it is something to be deplored. We could easily produce these things ourselves.  Our boat builders are first-class.  That has been proved over the last decade.  If they get the chance they will produce the goods better than their counterparts elsewhere.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to fishmeal factories.  There is one in Killybegs and one in Momington.  Along the big stretch of coast from the mouth of the Shannon to the mouth of the Blackwater we have as yet no fishmeal factory.  I believe there is one in the pipeline.  It has been there for some time now.  We are all looking forward to the day when it will become a reality. It will be very welcome if it is located where it is rumoured it will be located.  It will provide much needed employment in that area.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary referred to the Commission which has been established to report on inland fisheries. The terms of reference of the Commission <Col N="151" /> are wide in scope in order to enable it to investigate all aspects of inland fisheries.  I am more acquainted with inland fisheries than with fishing around the coast and I should like to raise a few points in this regard.</P>
    <P>We are all aware that pollution is causing grave damage to the fishing stocks in our rivers.  When it is discovered that many salmon and trout have died as a result of pollution there is a tremendous outcry and the fact gets much publicity in the newspapers. I suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that he should ask the Commission to take special note of what happens in the spawning grounds.  During November there is much flooding in the rivers, the trout and salmon leave the large rivers and go up the tributaries to spawn.  Very often they travel upstream to a point where the river is only three or four feet wide.  They lay their eggs there, the young fish are hatched and the salmon and trout then return to the larger rivers.</P>
    <P>However, the greatest danger is the pollution that occurs in the very small rivers.  Much of the effluent from small towns and villages, as well as from farmlands, enters into the small streams and I can assure the Parliamentary Secretary that more damage is thereby done than by pollution of the larger rivers.  The Commission should investigate the damage that is being caused to the young fish in this way.  I do not know the solution to the problem.  I know that many farmers have gone to considerable expense to construct pig-fattening plants and one cannot expect them to spend much more money in an effort to stop effluent entering into streams.  This leads to the conclusion that we must have more salmon and trout hatcheries; we must ensure that the young trout are kept in the hatcheries until they are released into the larger rivers.</P>
    <P>I hope the Commission will investigate conditions in my constituency. The River Lee was once noted for salmon and trout fishing until the advent of the ESB generating station. These stations are essential for the advancement of the nation but I would <Col N="152" /> be grateful if the Commission would investigate and see if something could be done to improve matters.  They might also consider if something could be done to develop two beautiful lakes in the Lee valley-one is near Inniscarra and the other at Carrigadrochid. These lakes have considerable potential and they should be developed.  The Commission would do a worthwhile job if, by their efforts, they could ensure that these areas were developed.</P>
    <P>In the Minister's statement mention was made of fish disease.  This has been occurring for some years past and it has been prevalent in the Blackwater, in the Lee and the Bandon and in rivers in County Kerry. This year the reports regarding the incidence of UDN in the Blackwater are not very favourable but I do not think very much can be done until the disease has run its course.  The Parliamentary Secretary stated that a survey was initiated by his Department in June, 1966, and completed in 1969. The survey involved investigation into the effects of various sources of pollution in the rivers Blackwater and Martin in County Cork.  The main concern was with the change in the quality of the water caused by discharge from industrial undertakings based on milk, beet, sugar and food processing and from domestic sewers. The conclusion was reached that the pollution problem was not too grave and that if there was a good flow of water there would not be any ill effects on the fishing stocks.</P>
    <P>Last year there was an abnormally low level of water and large quantities of fish were killed on the Blackwater. However, it must be stated that most of the industrial firms located on the banks of the Blackwater have done their best to filter the effluent before it enters the river.  The Department should give this matter special attention because there are many industrial firms throughout the country who do not make sufficient efforts to minimise the dangers of discharging effluent into rivers.  The factories near the Blackwater have spent much money in efforts to filter the effluent before it enters the river and their good example should be followed by other undertakings.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="153" /> We hear much about inland fishing but it is my belief that we should develop more centres for coarse fishing. This kind of fishing is very popular with cross-Channel anglers and not long ago a competition was conducted by coarse fishing associations in England.  The final was held on the River Blackwater near Fermoy and this brought many tourists to the area.  We should advertise abroad much more extensively about our coarse fishing and we should make an effort to have certain parts of our rivers stocked completely with coarse fish.  Any expenditure in this direction will be more than repaid by the increased numbers of anglers who come to this country.  There is a great potential in these centres for development of the tourist industry.  The person who comes for the coarse fishing on the Blackwater is usually a good fisherman and a good spender.  That is what this country wants.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary mentioned our proposed membership of the EEC.  Many people dread the consequences of going into the EEC.  We must prepare ourselves for entry.  There is much to be done to prepare our fishermen.  We will be in competition with countries like Iceland and Norway who have a fishing tradition and who export each year nine or ten times more fish than we do.  These countries employ advanced fishing techniques. We are only building up our fishing fleets.  Our views must be heard at the bargaining table.  We must protect our coastal waters and ensure that they are not overfished.  The Parliamentary Secretary and his officials must see that our fishing grounds are properly safeguarded. We are up against keen competition from the countries I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>We often think of the total money derived from fishing as coming from the fish which is caught for consumption at home.  We must look more carefully on fishing from the sporting angle. There is good shark fishing for the visitors.  Many commentators have remarked on the excellence of our shark fishing.  We should advertise this in foreign papers.  It is good to see people coming here for holidays.  They can go shark fishing and come back pleased <Col N="154" /> with the results.  How many of our own people know of these facilities? We must make this type of fishing popular with our rural population.  I do not know of any organisation which runs excursions for a shark fishing expedition. People enjoy this sport and we should popularise it at home and abroad.</P>
    <P>Most of the points I have mentioned here have already been raised by other speakers.  The Inland Fisheries Commission should look at every aspect of fish life.  Times are changing and what was good enough 20 years ago no longer applies.  Nowadays chemicals are used on the crops and they seep into the rivers.  Effluents seep from factories and farmyards into the rivers. We must be careful to ensure that the rivers will not be completely devoid of fish in future years, because they could then offer no pleasure for the tourist or the fisherman at home.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary should clarify another point for us.  Summons have been served on people who have been caught fishing in the River Feale without licences.  One man had his rod taken.  He was not brought to court because it was not considered to be a serious offence.  This man had gone to a person for a licence on his way to the river to fish.  That person had told him that there was no licence available that day.  In all good faith and having offered his money and being told that a licence was not available that day he went fishing and his rod was confiscated after a short time. Although he was not brought to court I think that he should get his rod back immediately.  I have already got in touch with the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries about this matter.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="155" /> The Parliamentary Secretary mentioned the nationalisation of the rivers. We have a campaign to nationalise the rivers for the people of the country.  I know some people who would not let anyone touch their own private property.  No one should have the right to own a fish pass across any river and to say that only so many trout can go up that river in 1971.  There should be a free run of fish to all parts of the river.</P>

      <P>Many farmers who own land cannot fish from their own banks.  It will be a long time before any change comes.  However, Deputy Tully suggested that some money should be provided to compensate those who own fishing rights.  We have all seen farms sold on the banks of rivers where the new owner did not get the fishing rights. The fishing rights might cost him thousands of pounds.  Such a man probably knew the day he bought the land that he was not getting the fishing rights.  The person who owns the fishing rights is entitled to compensation. There are many people who take a chance, but if they owned the rights they might not let anyone put a foot on the land.</P>
      <P>In recent years I have wondered about the fishing stretches on our rivers which have been sold to foreign enterprises.  So far as I know these stretches are controlled by the Land Commission.  I would like the Parliamentary Secretary to deal with this matter when replying.  There has been a great deal of agitation.  If we want to get fishing stretches back we will have to compensate the people who really own them.</P>
      <P>I wish the Parliamentary Secretary every success in his position.  There is a challenging time ahead of him.  When a man starts out in charge of Fisheries he should be left there a good few years so that he can report progress. There is a long way to go before we can be half-satisfied as regards our fisheries, whether they be coastal or inland.  I have complete confidence in the Parliamentary Secretary and in his officials.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>While concurring in the good wishes to the Parliamentary Secretary, I have some difficulty in agreeing with the sentiment Deputy Meaney expressed that he should be left there for a good many years-unless he crossed to the other side of the House. I propose to direct my attention exclusively to the question of EEC fisheries policy.  This is a matter of considerable importance.  I am not satisfied that the full picture is known to the general public.  I am not satisfied that the Government have shown an adequate appreciation of all the issues involved.  Certainly, with respect to the Parliamentary Secretary and to his presentation, he dealt with this matter summarily and in what seems to me to be a cursory and unsatisfactory manner.</P>
      <P>I want to say a general word about EEC policy in relation to the timing of its announcement and enactment.  The attitude of the EEC in this matter appears to be that they are entitled to develop any new policies that they, the present Six, think fit and, having implemented them during the period of negotiations, it is up to the applicant countries to accept them and to leave the matter at that.  I can understand why they believe this.  It would certainly complicate their own internal affairs greatly if they had to take account of all the individual views of applicant countries on every matter concerning the present Six, when it remains possible that these negotiations might not succeed.  In cases like fisheries policy, one finds that the Community has fallen behind its timetable and is only now dealing with matters it should have dealt with, by its own timetable, years ago.  One can appreciate a feeling, on their part, that because they have fallen behind in their timetable, they should not have to consult in great detail with the applicant countries on fisheries policy just because they happen to be reaching a point of decision at a time when negotiations are proceeding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are certain cases in which the relative magnitude of the interests of the applicant countries and of the member countries are such that this principle, if one can so dignify it, cannot <Col N="157" /> really be sustained in all logic and commonsense.  The attitude of the Community on this has been set out on various occasions.  I think their reply to the Norwegian position, at discussions about 22nd September last, helps to illustrate this.  As I understand it, on that occasion, the Community representatives expressed the view that the common fisheries policy&mdash;such as it would be adopted by the Community in the following months&mdash;would be part of the decisions of all &ldquo;kinds&rdquo;&mdash; a term in quotation marks because it is a technical reference&mdash;reached since the treaties came into force and the applicant countries have to accept them.</P>
    <P>The Community view was that it was not possible to go beyond recognising that the question of fisheries posed special problems for applicant countries, in particular Norway.  The delegation went on to say that there should be confidence in reciprocal understanding and, in the political sense, of the Council, which would never claim to impose unacceptable provisions on a member of the future Community; at the same time, for any Community regulations to be entirely questioned, and re-negotiated after the enlargement would constitute too dangerous a precedent to be accepted.  That is one statement of the Community position.</P>
    <P>I think that another reference which is contained in the Community's own English language bulletin-European Community. November, 1970-sets out the Community position as follows :</P>
    <P>The Community standpoint is that if Norway were to take part in the current talks and the details of the policy this would set an unacceptable precedent.</P>
    <P>Norway is mentioned specifically because of their interest in fisheries.  The concern for precedent is the kind of thing we get thrown at us in this House by the Government.  It struck me, in reading through the relative documents to do with these negotiations on fisheries, that the applicant countries and the present Six are in much the same position as an Opposition vis-à-vis a Government.  The same kinds of attitudes are shown by the Government side as are shown by the Six and <Col N="158" /> the same kinds of arguments are used about not creating precedents. Therefore, one feels at home in tracing the line of argument between the two sides because of the resemblance to the kinds of argument in this House.</P>
    <P>That is the Community attitude. They have given the Community view and, having said that, one can see why. It has to be said that, in this instance, this point of view is not acceptable : it does not wash.  It needs to be said and some of the applicant countries have said it-not, as far as one can judge, our Government, which has not expressed any strong views on this subject, but I shall come to that in detail later.  However, other Governments have expressed views, notably the Norwegian and British Governments.</P>
    <P>The Norwegian Government, in the discussions of 22nd September last, made a number of important points They consider that the common policy for fisheries which is to be decided upon by the Six and which is valid for the present Community cannot be valid for the enlarged Community since the situation as regards fisheries will be radically transformed by the enlargement. It is thought that a declaration of goodwill was not sufficient in this particular sector in which Norway alone represents more than all the Six together from the point of view of production. How could it be claimed, the Norwegians asked, that the common policy of the enlarged Community should be defined without the participation of the main producer?  The Norwegians produced some interesting figures to back up their statement.</P>
    <P>Last year, the total fish catch of the Six was about 1.7 million tons while that of the four applicant countries was 4.8 million tons.  So, in fact, if the fisheries policy of the enlarged Community is to be determined, as the Community now claim, by the present members, it is certainly a case of the tail wagging the dog.  Something like only 27 per cent of the output of the enlarged Community is represented by the Six, yet those responsible for the 27 per cent are claiming the right to determine substantially the fisheries policy for the whole of the enlarged Community.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="159" /> It is not merely a question of the relative size of output of the applicant countries and of the Six.  There is the fact that the whole balance of supply and demand would be altered as a result of membership by Norway, Britain, Denmark and ourselves.  In the existing Community there is an annual deficit of about 500,000 tons. They are short of fish.  They are a fish importing economic unit.  The four applicant countries have a surplus of 700,000 tons of fish.  Therefore, the enlarged Community will be one in which there will be a surplus of 200,000 tons of fish as against a deficit of 500,000 tons.  It is scarcely probable that the kind of market policy adopted, and mechanisms for maintaining the market, by a Community with a large deficit of fish would be likely to prove appropriate to a Community in which there will be a fish surplus.  The Norwegian catch alone is larger than that of all the Six put together.  On that account, the Norwegians said it was totally unrealistic to establish a fishing policy based on a deficit situation and then to apply the same policy to an enlarged Community in which there was a surplus.  I think it was fairly argued. Indeed, similar views were put forward by the British delegation in the course of their discussions.  A strong case was made that it was quite improper and inappropriate for the Community to proceed to settle their own internal fisheries policy and to propose to impose this then on the enlarged Community.</P>
    <P>What is our position in this matter? It does not stand up very well to inspection in the light of the strong attitudes taken up by the British and Norwegian Governments.  Our Government did not show much alertness in this matter or give any clear indication that they understand the problems likely to arise.  As late as April this year in a White Paper produced by the Government the section on fisheries consists of two-thirds of a page, giving a fair indication, I think, of the importance the Government attach to fishing.  In this White Paper we were told that membership of an enlarged Community should be advantageous for the fishing <Col N="160" /> industry inasmuch as trade with EEC, which is Ireland's biggest customer for fish, would be on more favourable terms and should be capable of considerable expansion if production could be increased.  It was, however, admitted that we would lose our preference, the preference at present enjoyed in the British market, but it was asserted that the advantages of improved access to the EEC market should more than offset this.</P>
    <P>It may be noted that in these vague generalities which take up two-thirds of the page there are no practical references to the facts.  We are told that there will be more favourable terms-how much more favourable?  One can contrast what is said about fisheries in this vague way with the much more concrete information given in this document concerning agriculture.  I had occasion to remark previously that the agricultural section of this document, even if one leaves out of account the enlarged and extended agricultural White Paper produced separately, is in fact quite good, well-produced and gives hard, concrete facts.  Nothing of the kind is to be found in other sections such as I have mentioned before, the industry and commerce or the fisheries section.  This is a document which is for general consumption.  There is, of course, the more specialised document for the agricultural sector. I shall have more to say about that.  This general document deals in a practical way with agriculture and gives farmers a pretty good indication of what relative prices will be&mdash;a useful document as far as agriculture is concerned&mdash; but on the fisheries side we are only told that there will be more favourable terms for fisheries.</P>
    <P>What about the question of access to our fisheries which is now causing such concern?  What does the White Paper say about this?  It says:</P>
    <P>In addition, some difficulties could arise from any decision which might be adopted by the Community, within the framework of the proposed common policy for fisheries in regard to access to fishing grounds within the exclusive fishery limits of the member States.</P>
    <P>It added :</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="161" /> The elimination of quantitative restrictions on imports could lead to greater imports of demersal fish, whiting, cod, plaice et cetera, and possibly to a slight reduction in the prices of the varieties most sought after by Irish consumers.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to reconcile the reference to more favourable terms for our fish and the reference to the fact that the fish we actually eat in this country and the fish which, therefore, our fishermen largely catch will be sold at lower prices.  No attempt is made to reconcile these or to indicate how the net balance of more favourable terms is struck.  I am not suggesting that the overall effect of EEC upon prices of fish in this country will not be favourable : I do not know.  I seek information on this which I am certainly not getting from this White Paper.</P>
    <P>However, that was the first reference made to access, that some difficulties could arise.  That is all it said.  Then we come to the Irish application on 30th June.  What was said in this document about fisheries on 30th June, the very day, in fact, on which the council of the Community was sitting, having sat also on the previous day, to take a crucial general policy decision on fisheries?  We were there in Brussels, if not in the same building at least in the building on the other side of the street, on the same day as the Council of Ministers had fixed for deciding this crucial policy that will have such effect on us.  How much alertness did our delegation show to this issue? It must be said that they mentioned it in these terms :</P>
    <P>It may also be necessary to raise particular points in regard to other agricultural matters including future arrangements for fisheries&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>Fisheries get five words :</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;which may be the subject of Community decisions before the accession negotiations are complete.</P>
    <P>That is all that is said about fisheries. Whether the Government were unaware through negligence of what was going on or whether they did not think it mattered or were afraid to speak out as other countries have done, I do not <Col N="162" /> know, but certainly it is a disappointing reference.</P>
    <P>In the Parliamentary Secretary's speech he has something to say on this subject.  He devotes to it two columns out of 28 or 7 per cent of his speech.  Perhaps the format of the speech is traditional.  Many Estimates speeches produced in this House are written by taking last year's speeches and substituting this year's figures and any other little matters that turn up. Perhaps that is how this speech was concocted in part and that the Parliamentary Secretary was handed it and told : &ldquo;This is the annual speech.  We have put in the new bits and changed the figures.&rdquo;  Perhaps that is why EEC figures so little in it.  The mere listing of places where harbours have been improved, the mere naming of them, takes up half as much space as the whole EEC fishery policy.  I shall not detain the House with references to these places with euphonious names, which in any case I should also almost certainly mispronounce through lack of local knowledge, but it is quite striking to see column 2286 packed with beautiful Gaelic names, somewhat distorted in the English version, and you turn over the page and find in columns 2287 to 2289 that there are two columns, twice as much, devoted to the entire EEC fishery policy as in listing the names of the places where something is being done to improve the pier.</P>
    <P>This is a clear reflection of the kind of priority the Government give.  There are votes in naming piers in an Estimate debate.  Every one of these piers has at least one family living within half a mile of it and a possible vote. The EEC fisheries policy is a thing best not spoken much about because there are no votes in that.  There might be votes lost by talking about it.  Therefore, let us dismiss it as briefly as possible.</P>
    <P>What did the Parliamentary Secretary say in his brief reference to EEC policy?  He spoke of &ldquo;valuable price supports&rdquo;.  This is equivalent to the reference in the White Paper to the price improvements but although there is reference to &ldquo;valuable price supports&rdquo; we are not told anything about what their effect is.  There is no reference <Col N="163" /> in his speech to the House to the fact that the price of the kind of fish we eat will be reduced, to the consumers' advantage, be it said, but not to the advantage of the fishermen. The House is not told that.  There are &ldquo;valuable price supports&rdquo; which will have the effect of reducing the price to the fishermen of the kinds of fish sold in this country.  They are the kind of price supports the consumers may like to see but scarcely ones the producers would like to see.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary went on to refer to producer associations in the Six.  He said that producer associations will play a prominent part in the marketing arrangements which are envisaged.  Member States will be empowered to give aid for the establishment of these associations and the cost of this will be recouped from Community funds.  I shall have occasion later in my speech to deal with the role of producer associations in the marketing arrangements proposed in the fisheries policy of the Six but if the Parliamentary Secretary is going to refer to producer associations in the Six he might at least have referred to the fact that there is considerable unrest in the Community and in the parliamentary Community over the whole proposal that the maintenance of reasonable price levels for most kinds of fish for sardines and pilchards, I think, is to be left to producer associations and that they will have to carry part of the burden themselves; it will not all be financed from Community funds.  The Parliament of the Six has, in fact, been so incensed by this that they have produced a supplementary report of which I trust the Parliamentary Secretary is aware, criticising the proposed policy adopted last June on these very grounds.</P>
    <P>I should have thought that the producers' associations in Ireland, such as they are, would have been interested in this and that the Parliamentary Secretary might reasonably have drawn it to their attention in the same form. He does not make clear that the reason aid is being given to producers' associations is that some countries do not have them and where countries do not have them it is necessary for <Col N="164" /> the Community to finance these support measures itself and that they are only going to give aid to producer associations to get them established so that the producers can &ldquo;carry the can&rdquo; themselves.  What is given here as a great gift is, in fact, rather a trap set for producer associations, as far as I can understand the policy.  Nobody would know that from reading the Parliamentary Secretary's words.</P>
    <P>What about access?  It must be said that since last April when the White Paper was produced and since last June when we sought membership of the Community, the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries have woken up to the fact that there is a problem here. The previous references to having to raise particular points about future arrangements for agriculture and the reference to some difficulties that could arise&mdash;these slight but not by any means alarming references&mdash;are now replaced by something stronger because we are told now in this debate that the adoption of this policy of free access to fishing waters would cause severe hardship for the inshore fishermen who depend almost entirely on landings from our own exclusive fishery waters.  The Parliamentary Secretary goes on to say that this matter has been strongly pursued in, I think, rather excessive terminology for what has happened so far, in the entry negotiations.  He mentions the meetings at which it was taken up and he assures the House that every effort has been made and will continue to be made to safeguard the interests of Irish fishermen in an enlarged EEC.</P>
    <P>There is enough in this speech, be it said, to indicate that the Department and the Parliamentary Secretary are aware of the fact that there is a serious problem, a fact of which there was no sign of any awareness in any previous contribution from the Department or their political spokesmen and, to that extent, I suppose, it is progress.  When we take this in conjunction with the actual proposals the Irish delegation have made in Brussels&mdash;as I shall do later&mdash; and the actual approach to it, and when we contrast the Irish position with that of the Norwegians and the British, I do not think there is real evidence that the Government and the Department <Col N="165" /> have taken this, even yet, with adequate seriousness.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned producer associations and perhaps I should say a little more about that before moving on to deal with the whole question of market organisation and then structural reform and access because these are, I think, the four areas which concern us.  They are ones in respect of which the House has heard very little.  In fact, the only reference to producer associations is the misleading one about the assistance to establish them so that they can &ldquo;carry the can&rdquo; and relieve the Community of the process of subsidisation.  That is not a very helpful reference to this matter. In relation to market organisation there is reference to valuable price supports, totally undefined. On structures, no reference whatever, and no reference whatever to the crucial point that on the question of structural reform the entire burden of the social measures involved in coping with any redundancy that may occur, will rest on the member State and not on the Community.  There is no reference whatever to that.  As I have said, on access at least the speech shows a knowledge that there is a problem. One could not put it much higher than that.  There are four major issues in relation to the Irish fishing industry. They have been treated, one almost might say, with levity in this speech.</P>
    <P>Let me say a little more about producer associations.  First of all, it is evident that it is the producer associations who will be mainly responsible for the process of financial support for the fishing industry.  In fact, the main principle of the proposals adopted on 30th June was that the producer organisations would be mainly responsible for the management of the market. Public intervention would be permitted provisionally only for certain products such as anchovies and sardines.  I said pilchards and sardines a few minutes ago but I should have said anchovies and sardines-not of major interest to this country.</P>
    <P>In countries such as France and Italy, in which producers organisations do not yet exist but are for the moment in embryonic form, during a three-year transition period the forming of such <Col N="166" /> organisations should be encouraged so that they can take over the job of subsidisation and organising the subsidies and, indeed, as far as I can make out, carrying part of the cost.  On this detail I am not entirely clear because the terminology in some of the EEC material when translated into English is by no means explicit, and I must admit to a sense of confusion and frustration in trying to understand some of it. Later on I will have to ask the Parliamentary Secretary to explain to me precisely what is meant by some of these provisions or at least to give an indication to the House as to their significance from the financial point of view to this country and to our fishermen.</P>
    <P>The significance of the role being given to producer associations has been noted by the European Parliament.  The Parliamentary Secretary is aware, I hope, of the supplementary report of the agricultural commission, document No. 67 of the 1970-71 session, where M. Kriedemann, the Rapporteur, sets out the difficulties the Parliament has, this Commission has, with the proposed fishery policy which was to be put forward shortly afterwards.  This document is dated 16th June and it relates to the proposals which were put to the Council of Ministers and adopted in substance of 29th/30th June.  It notes that the proposal of the Commission to make producers participate in the intervention costs of the market introduces into the common agricultural policy a new element which departs from the earlier conceptions of the Commission and the opinion expressed on this matter by the European Parliament. That is a clear statement.  I am reading from the preamble to the Committee's opinion.</P>
    <P>I will not detain the House at length by going through the details of the report itself but that statement is made there and the whole purport of the report is that the Commission has itself departed from its original proposals and from the whole outlook of Parliament on the matter.  Going at times its own somewhat bureaucratic way and at times following a course of collaboration with the Council of Ministers which is not to the taste of the European Parliament, it has departed <Col N="167" /> from the views of Parliament on this matter and has transferred the whole burden of organisation and obviously some part of this burden of paying for the support of the fish market to the producers themselves, although this was not originally intended and seems to have been done under pressure from the Council of Ministers.</P>
    <P>It is worth commenting that these are not the only complaints that Parliament has in relation to the question of the fisheries policy and the way it has treated them.  It is of some importance to note the degree to which at this stage the democratic arrangements of the Community are defective. As most people in this House will know, I am a strong supporter of Irish membership.  I am also a strong supporter of reform of the institutions upon which I think there is a growing body of opinion being brought to bear now. As an illustration of the defective character of the present arrangements I will just refer to the fact that, among the other items mentioned in the preamble to this report, are the following : that the agricultural commission or committee of the Parliament note with regret that the Council has refused to consult Parliament on the modified proposal for regulation of the common market organisation in the sector of fisheries products despite the fact that this modified proposal has an importance at the level of principles.  The House will forgive my somewhat clumsy translation.</P>
    <P>Secondly, the Committee note, among other things, that the Commission has not takes up any of the modifications on amendments proposed <Col N="168" /> by the Europen Parliament to the proposal of the Commission, modifications which without exception had as their object to ensure a common market for the principal products of the fishery sector and to ensure equal conditions of competition for the products of this sector.  Again, the complaints of Parliament and its views were ignored.</P>
    <P>These are ancillary to my case but I think it is worth noting the feeling of the European Parliament on this matter, the feeling that its views were not being taken into account.  The particular importance of this to what I am trying to get across at the moment lies in the irritation expressed in this document at the fact that the producer organisations are being brought into the game at this stage, without any warning, without Parliament being consulted on an important development, and being asked to organise the market for products with the exception of sardines and anchovies and being asked to carry part of the financial cost.  Of all that the Parliamentary Secretary tells us nothing.</P>
    <P>The producer organisations, on reading the Parliamentary Secretary's speech, could be forgiven for thinking there is some kind of a bonanza coming up and that they were going to get nice subsidies to help them to operate. Indeed, they are-nice subsidies to get them going so that they can &ldquo;carry the can&rdquo;, but that was not explained by the Parliamentary Secretary.</P>
    <P>Progress reported; Committee to sit again.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.30 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Wednesday, 2nd December, 1970.</P>
