      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if the Government accept in principle the NIEC Report No. 27 on Incomes and Prices Policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer the Deputy to the statement issued by the Government and presented to the Dáil regarding the National Industrial Economic Council's Report.  In this statement, the Government indicated that they were inviting the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the Irish Employers' Confederation to join with them in a statement of commitment to, and support for, the principles and objectives of incomes and prices policy as set out in the report.  Government Ministers and I met representatives of these organisations on Friday last to consider the report.</P>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I am circulating with the Official Report the text of the press release which was issued after that meeting:</P>
      <P>Following is the text of the press release:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach, accompanied by the Ministers for Finance, Labour and Industry and Commerce met representatives of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the Irish Employers' Confederation to discuss the NIEC Report on Incomes and Prices Policy.  It was agreed that a small <i>ad hoc</i> working party be set <Col N="1546" /> up consisting of representatives of ICTU, IEC and the Government, in its capacity as an employer, to consider what arrangements might be made to establish the new employer/ employee body envisaged in the NIEC Report.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>While welcoming the initiatives the Taoiseach is taking in this matter may I inquire, in view of the importance of these recommendations, if the price surveillance machinery should be specially strengthened and enlarged if the Government intend to act promptly in this particular section in addition to the incomes field?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I indicated to the employers' and workers' representatives last Friday that the Government were willing to strengthen each of these institutions, the prices section of the Department of Industry and Commerce, the Fair Trade Commission and the Labour Court, in so far as it would be necessary to carry out the desires of the report.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries whether arising out of a reply on 9th July last he has since instituted an inquiry into the number of people entering agriculture with appropriate training; and, if so, when the results of this inquiry are expected to become available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Haughey) (for the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries) Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Haughey) (for the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries)</NameTxt>
      <P>An average of 536 students attended residential agricultural colleges for training in agriculture over the past three years.  Of these, about a third go back to farming and most of the remainder either pursue courses such as those leading to degrees in agriculture, dairy science and veterinary medicine or obtain employment in services and industries serving agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Part-time courses such as are provided at winter farm schools and at winter agricultural classes conducted by the agricultural advisory service also provide very suitable training for young people engaging in farming. Over the past three years the average <Col N="1547" /> annual number of students attending the winter farm schools was 642 and the average annual attendance at winter agricultural classes was 3,877. The farm training centres, to which I referred in my reply to the Deputy's question on 9th July last, will provide more extensive facilities for these schools and classes.</P>
    <P>It is envisaged that the major share of the 300 additional places being planned at the agricultural colleges will be filled by future farmers.  It is estimated that up to 4,000 people enter farming each year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister say what proportion of that 4,000 have what he regards as appropriate training?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I can only repeat the figure I have given.  The nearest I suppose would be the numbers attending the winter agricultural classes, 3,877, only they might not all be new people coming into agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I was asking what proportion of entrants for the first time have the appropriate training.  In a previous reply the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries said an inquiry was being carried out and I was anxious to know the result of that inquiry.  The Minister is dealing with a separate matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries the relationship between current Irish prices for cattle and beef, pigs, wheat, barley and sugar beet and the prices which Irish farmers would be likely to receive for these products at this time if Ireland and Britain were members of the EEC <Col N="1548" /> making due allowance for transport costs between Ireland and countries to which Ireland sells or would under EEC conditions be likely to sell these products.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 and 4 together.</P>
      <P>Information on the lines sought by the Deputy&mdash;to the extent that it is practicable to compile it&mdash;is included in the White Paper on membership of the European Economic Community which has just been issued.  Further information will be contained in the special study on Irish agriculture and fisheries in the EEC, which is to be issued very soon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that the study published today does not, in fact, answer the question here, that it gives details and comparisons in a number of instances between the EEC target, or intervention price, and the present Irish price but it does not take account of the question of the transport of goods?  Will the study take account of that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that the Deputy wait until the more detailed White Paper on agriculture is published next week.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

In view of this, and as an interim measure, a certificate was sent to the applicant for completion, to enable an instalment of the grant to be paid and this instalment has now been paid.  A further inspection will be carried out shortly and the balance of the grant will be paid without delay if all relevant works are found to be satisfactorily completed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice (a) the average delay in the hearing of criminal cases which came to trial in Dublin in the past three months and (b) the minimum and maximum delays in such cases.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume the Deputy <Col N="1554" /> is referring to trials in the Dublin Circuit Court and I would refer him to my replies in detail of 11th and 12th February.</P>
      <P>As then indicated, an accused person who is returned for trial in custody normally has his case heard within the term.</P>
      <P>In the last three months the interval between the return for trial and the actual trial of accused persons who had been admitted to bail has been about 12 months.  There were longer intervals in a small number of bail cases arising from difficulties of the defence or prosecution.</P>
      <P>I might add that special arrangements have been put into effect to reduce arrears and the number of cases awaiting hearing at the end of last term was 172 as against 256 at the commencement of the previous term.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not totally unsatisfactory that, normally, a period of 12 months should now elapse before the hearing of cases where people are admitted to bail and that, because of the Minister's inability to make provision for such cases to be heard in time, a situation has arisen under which he is seeking to interfere with the rights of people on bail by the introduction of amending legislation?  If the Minister had made adequate provision for the hearing of these cases, this problem of people on bail for committing crimes having to wait for such a long period would not have arisen.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> I take it the Minister agrees that it is unfair that a person returned for trial, even on bail, should have to wait 12 months to have his case disposed of? Could the Minister give any indication of the steps he is taking in this connection and when he hopes to be able to bring these cases to trial, say, within three months at the maximum?</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> Is part of the trouble not the fact that, even if the Minister had additional judges, he has not suitable courtroom accommodation within easy reach of the Four Courts?

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>As I indicated in reply to the Deputy's question of 17th July, 1969, the view was then being formed that it would be preferable to proceed by way of a loose type of consortium, rather than the establishment of a private development bank, as the best means of mobilising capital for industry.  Since then, general agreement has been reached with the Irish merchant banks on the establishment of a loose consortium with a view to devising improved arrangements for the financing of large-scale industrial investment where the amount of finance involved would be greater than one bank alone would be able to provide, the aim being to secure the best possible pooling of the available resources. My Department has arranged with the International Finance Corporation that, in any instance where the total resources available are inadequate, the corporation will be prepared to consider providing assistance to fill the gap.</P>
      <P>I am hopeful that these arrangements will be adequate to cater for the future needs of industrial financing, and in the circumstances the question of establishing a private development bank is not being pursued.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Presumably the Deputy has in mind the additional personal allowance granted in respect of a wife's earnings (over and above the ordinary earned income relief that may be available).  The full year cost to the Exchequer of increasing this additional allowance so as to raise the weekly tax-free allowances in respect of a wife's earnings to £2 10s, £3 10s, £4 10s, and £5 10s is estimated to be £1.2 million, £1.9 million, £2.5 million and £2.9 million respectively.</P>
      <P>I should like to explain that where the combined incomes of husband and wife do not exceed £2,000 the wife's earnings qualify for the normal earned income relief of one-fourth in the same way as the husband's earnings.</P>
      <P>The tax-free allowance of a married woman claiming no relief other than the wife's earned income relief (together with earned income relief) is at present £60.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the House adjourned last week I had been endeavouring to point out the imbalance in the educational system created by the number of post-primary pupils who in past years followed purely academic courses, who in the main proceeded to universities where they <Col N="1566" /> graduated as teachers, doctors, lawyers or in other professions.  The very great weakness heretofore in our educational system was the lack of vocational and technical training.</P>
      <P>This imbalance is being remedied rapidly but I think the public have not been educated to realise that training and education other than academic are very important not alone for our children but for the country generally. Here we require a first class career guidance service which would be available for consultation by parents.</P>
      <P>Other countries have developed such a service and parents can get the very best information on career guidance. This development should be encouraged here and an organisation should be set up by the Minister for Education which would provide this much needed facility.  It is important that parents should not pre-determine from the day a child is born what career that child will follow, because this is neither fair to the child nor to the teacher nor even to the parents.</P>
      <P>A pupil should not be encouraged to make the permanent decision for himself until his late 'teens and with the guidance of properly informed parents.  For this reason I strongly suggest that the Minister and the Department of Education should give more attention to this great problem. The provision of such a service would have a dual effect: it could discourage unsuitable pupils from following the type of academic careers I have been talking about and it would guide young boys and girls into other professions and trades.  In this way we would have better returns for the amount of money we are spending on education.  It would be better in every way for everybody concerned with education.  Above all, such a service would be of great advantage to the pupils.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Side by side with a career guidance service there should be a job guidance or placement service.  Many young boys and girls leave secondary schools, universities and technical schools without having a clue as to the career they will pursue.  Advice is required in this respect also until such time as <Col N="1567" /> we have further vocational and technical facilities provided by the regional technological colleges.  Pupils leaving technical schools at the moment find it difficult to get jobs although there may be jobs for which they are suitable about which they are unaware. Employers are unaware of the availability of such pupils and of the training they have received.  I suggest, therefore, that side by side with a career guidance organisation we should have a placement service.  Perhaps the new organisation.  AnCo, would be the best organisation to provide the placement service.</P>
    <P>On graduation, many university students find, as other Deputies have indicated during this debate, that there are no employment opportunities for them in this country.  This is an historical problem.  There are many reasons for it.  This problem could be remedied to some extent, if not entirely.  There are many firms in this country who could profitably employ university graduates.  This is a feature of employment in industry in Britain and in other west European countries where many firms are realising the necessity of having highly skilled personnel.  There are many firms in this country who could usefully and profitably employ some of the graduates who may be going into industries in Britain and thereby helping them to compete with Irish firms.</P>
    <P>The question of corporal punishment in our schools has been very much in the news recently.  However, it is my opinion that the publicity given to this matter is very much exaggerated because in the majority of schools corporal punishment, in the sense of using a cane or other physical means of punishment, is not administered.  There is a strict rule about this.  Unfortunately, we hear of the occasional case of abuse but corporal punishment is not a problem in our schools.</P>
    <P>Ten years ago a booklet entitled <i>Punishment in our Schools</i> was widely distributed in this country but at the time we were unable to ascertain either its origin or the identity of the publishers and authors.  This booklet was an attack on the religious orders of <Col N="1568" /> nuns, Christian brothers and priests who were then in charge of primary and secondary education.  On reading the booklet it was clear that its object was to discredit the religious communities because 90 per cent of the cases mentioned referred to members of religious communities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>However, if there is any trace left of this antiquated system it should be abolished and the offenders penalised.  Corporal punishment cannot result in good teaching. The teachers whom I know have not any means of corporal punishment in their schools.  This practice has gone out as have many of the other practices that may have been in vogue many years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next matter to which I should like to refer is that of compulsory Irish. I do not think anybody will disagree with the policy that we must preserve the Irish language.  Our language is much too important to lose.  At the same time, the use of Irish in schools creates a problem in so far as the teaching of other subjects through the medium of Irish is concerned just as Irish as a compulsory subject for the leaving certificate creates a problem. Many pupils fail their leaving certificate because they do not succeed in Irish.  I have heard the argument put forward that the rule for national schools lays down that subjects through the medium of Irish should not be taught except where the pupils are capable of assimilating the knowledge and where the teacher is capable of instructing the pupils in that subject through the medium of Irish.  I remember on going to the school where I began my teaching career I discovered that history, geography and mathematics were being taught through the medium of Irish.  On examining the marks for these subjects in previous annual examinations I found that they were very low and within a very short time I decided to teach these subjects through the medium of English.  I notified the school manager and inspector. The manager agreed and it was not necessary for me to have the agreement of the inspector who did <Col N="1569" /> call some time later and said the step was a backward one but that we would wait and see what would be the results in the three subjects mentioned.  The results did improve.  I quote this as proof that it is not obligatory to teach these subjects through the medium of Irish.  A teacher can use his own discretion, subject to managerial approval.  If the teaching of subjects through the medium of Irish is damaging to the pupils' knowledge the method should be changed so that the subjects can be taught through the medium of English.</P>
    <P>This brings me to the subject of the Irish language itself, both oral and written.  This is a matter to which we might give some consideration.  I have found that pupils whose parents return from England when the children are nine or ten years old or even older cannot qualify in Irish at the national school leaving age.  One cannot expect these children to be successful in Irish in their leaving certificate unless they are very brilliant.  I suggest to the Minister that a strong case can be made for the awarding of the leaving certificate on the completion of a secondary or vocational course in cases in which the pupils qualify in all subjects but Irish.</P>
    <P>There should be a certificate which would indicate that the pupil has got either a pass or honours in Irish; on the other hand, there should be an award of a certificate even in cases where the pupil has not passed Irish; after all, it is a certificate obtained on leaving secondary school having taken the appropriate courses.  Of course, for university entrance Irish is necessary; in some cases so are Latin and French, but I am talking about the award of a certificate which is very necessary for the pupil.  Take the cases I mentioned, of pupils, the sons and daughters of Irish parents, returning to this country having finished their primary education in England and wishing to pursue secondary education here.  Even if they do not pass in Irish they should be given a leaving certificate; otherwise they will regard themselves as second-class scholars.</P>
    <P>The debate so far has been very thorough and informative, and many points have been put to the Minister. <Col N="1570" /> I know he is taking his position as Minister for Education seriously, and we look forward to steady progress during the year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasGODonnell" hpid="Mr. T. O'Donnell Mr. T. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>In the light of the most comprehensive and detailed speech of my colleague, Deputy FitzGerald, there is very little left for me to say in a general way about the Minister's speech.  However, there are some items on which I should like to comment.</P>
      <P>I must confess that I, too, have been most disappointed in the Minister's introductory speech on the Estimate. His speech was disappointing by reason of the fact that he refrained from outlining future Government policy in relation to the entire field of education, and he very cleverly refrained from any personal comment on certain important issues in relation to education, issues which have been very topical recently.  Without reflecting on the Minister personally, I have noticed of late that education seems to be reverting to the half a century old tradition of being tied up with Civil Service red tape.  A few years ago, under the direction of one of the Minister's predecessors, there was a breakaway from the Civil Service mentality in relation to education.  I am greatly afraid the Minister has shown no signs of being imaginative or revolutionary in his views on education.  I sincerely hope that the great ferment of opinion and discussion which started a few years ago will continue and that the development of education will not be restricted by the Civil Service.</P>
      <P>I wish to quote a statement by the Minister at column 1319, volume 245, of the Official Report of Wednesday, 15th April, 1970:</P>
      <P>The provision for grants for the colleges of the National University and Trinity College in 1970-71 has been made on the basis that the total income of the Colleges should be augmented by an increase of 25 per cent in the tuition fees.</P>
      <P>The Minister tries to justify this by saying:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has not been a general over-all increase in these fees since 1963-64 and having regard to the <Col N="1571" /> general improvement in salaries and incomes in recent years such an increase in tuition fees must be considered as moderate.</P>
    <P>I want to protest very strongly against this substantial increase in student fees, and I fully support the case made by the Union of Students in Ireland to the Minister yesterday.  I have here a statement of the views put forward to the Minister by the Union of Students. This major increase of 25 per cent in student fees is unjustifiable and indefensible. The Minister's decision is a retrograde step and represents a shortsighted policy in relation to the whole question of financing higher education.  If this type of stop-gap measure is to be employed to finance higher education in the future, then one shudders to think what the outcome will be.  I would appeal to the Minister to defer implementing this decision until the over-all situation regarding the financing of our future needs in higher education has been assessed and is fully known.</P>
    <P>The Union of Students in Ireland, in a well documented case, have put forward various arguments against this sudden increase in fees, apart from the most obvious one, the almost intolerable burden which this increase will impose on the parents of many students who are attending college.  It is noteworthy that a recent survey carried out by Monica Nevin in UCD, UCC, UCG and Trinity College shows that 73 to 74 per cent of the student population intended to work during the summer in order to help finance their courses at the university.  It is a well-known fact, and I am sure every Deputy is aware of it.  I am probably more conscious of this question of the cost of university education than most others because I secured my degree by attending college at night and working during the day.  As I have said, the Minister should have second thoughts about this whole question.</P>
    <P>Another important factor is that the differential in costs for different courses has now been widened.  The fees for the arts course will be £244.  The fees <Col N="1572" /> for the agricultural science course will go up from £450 to £562.  Five hundred and sixty-two pounds is a lot of money for an agicultural science course.  This sum does not include the extra cost of laboratory equipment, or the cost of accommodation which, as everyone knows, is very expensive in Dublin and other university centres.  I am sure Deputies on all sides of the House are aware of the fact that a considerable number of students pursue university courses through great personal sacrifice on the part of their parents and by working during the holidays.  I fully support the Union of Students in the case they have made to the Minister and as he is a reasonable man I hope he will accept their request and defer implementing this increase for a while.</P>
    <P>I am in favour of greater participation by university students in the affairs of the university.  University students, as a body, are probably the most maligned and misunderstood section of the community.  This phenomenon is not peculiar to Ireland; it seems to be worldwide.  I have considerable contact with university students and I want to go on record as saying that the vast majority of university students in this country are people of responsibility and idealism.  Many students do a tremendous amount of social work and charitable work but unfortunately the long-haired weirdies get all the publicity even though they are a very small minority.  While it might be presumptuous of me to speak authoritatively about university students, as there are two distinguished members of universities beside me, I want to state from my own contact with university students that I believe they are responsible people anxious to play a part in fashioning a university system which will meet the great challenge of the future.  I believe it is vitally important that student potential should be tapped. The university authorities should endeavour to encourage maximum student participation at all levels of university life.  I welcome the decision to appoint a student under-governing body in University College, Dublin.  I hope the same thing will be done in other universities.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1573" /> I became a Deputy in 1961 and when I first spoke on education in that year I advocated Limerick's claim for a university.  Down through the years I continued to press the case for a university in Limerick.  I welcome the developments which have brought about the establishment of a third level institute in Limerick.  I trust this third level institute will be a full-scale university college with the same status as existing universities, with the same entrance standards and the same degree standards.  The people of Limerick, who campaigned for so long and have been so successful in securing higher education facilities for their children, will co-operate in every possible way to ensure that this institute will live up to expectations.</P>
    <P>It would be very remiss of me, as a Deputy representing Limerick city, not to pay tribute to the Limerick University Project Committee who have campaigned valiantly for the past decade for a university.  This committee can now rest happy in the knowledge that their efforts have not merely been appreciated by the people in the region but have been recognised by the Minister and his Department.</P>
    <P>I detest the description &ldquo;third level institute&rdquo; but we shall have to use this terminology until we can think of a better description.  The concept of a technologically-orientated institution in Limerick is good, particularly in the light of the industrial developments that have taken place in the region. Whatever Cardinal Newman's concept of a university may have been we have to face the facts and recognise the technological revolution that has taken place and will continue to take place.</P>
    <P>In certain areas higher education facilities have not been available and certain types of qualified personnel have had to be recruited from abroad to fill industrial posts while we, on the other hand, are exporting graduates in considerable numbers.  The Minister referred to this in his speech and I agree basically with what he said but we must assess the situation now in the light of present and future needs. We must find out what types of graduates will be needed and then provide <Col N="1574" /> the necessary facilities to produce them.</P>
    <P>Limerick college will fill a great need.  I sincerely hope it will not become a narrow, specialist technological institution.  From the information made available to us I understand there will be courses in arts, languages and the humanities.</P>
    <P>I understand also that it is the intention, in conjunction with the Mary Immaculate Training College in Limerick, to provide a new type of degree course leading to a Bachelor of Education.  This, again, is a very desirable development particularly logical in the light of what the Minister has said in relation to teacher training and the link up between the teacher training colleges and the universities.  The new director of the college, Dr. Walsh, has, since his arrival in Limerick, made a tremendous impact down there.  He is a highly qualified man but despite his qualifications and his wide experience he has not come into Limerick and tried to impose his will on the people. He has spent most of his time up to now on a fact finding mission and it is no harm to acknowledge the fact that he has consulted all interests, even local Deputies, with a view to finding out what particular types of course are necessary, what are the needs down there and what should be provided. The planning committee is at work at the moment and a site has been secured.  It is the Minister's intention that the college will be ready to accept the first students in 1971.  I sincerely hope everything will go according to plan and I look forward to the opening of this college.  I want, again, to remind the Minister that the view of everybody in the Limerick region is that the college will become a fully recognised university institution.</P>
    <P>There are some other points in the Minister's speech on which I should like to comment.  By a strange coincidence I want to illustrate my points by certain developments that have been taking place in my constituency. Limerick is not the place that many people are led to believe it is.  Certain other important educational developments have been taking place down there.  Apart from the new third level <Col N="1575" /> institution, there is another rather new development in the field of education in Limerick.  This is the new comprehensive school which is to be set up at Dooradoyle in co-operation with the Jesuit Fathers in Limerick.  It will be known as the new Crescent comprehensive post-primary school.  This is a rather unique development as it links one of the oldest teaching orders in the Church with the most advanced concept in post-primary education in modern times&mdash;the comprehensive system.  This idea of the comprehensive school is a very good one.  I certainly am fully in favour of it and I speak as a past pupil of Crescent College where I received most of my secondary education. This is a very good development and judging by the excellent series of articles which have been published recently in one of our daily newspapers by Father Morrissey who has been appointed director of the college, it holds out great hopes for the future of post-primary education in Limerick. There is one small point which I should like to bring to the Minister's notice in relation to the comprehensive school. It may be an academic point&mdash;and perhaps one would need to be an educationist to pronounce on it&mdash;but I shall just pass on to the Minister what the views of the people whose children will be attending the school are.</P>
    <P>It has been traditional at the Crescent College to have a four-year course leading to the intermediate certificate. I understand that the Minister has been approached in this matter with a view to having a similar situation obtain in the new comprehensive school.  While there may be mixed views on whether or not a three-year course to intermediate or a four-year course is the better, certainly in so far as the parents whose children will be attending this school are concerned there seems to be a desire that this traditional system of a four-year course should continue in the new comprehensive school.  I understand that representations have been made to the Minister and I should like to add my voice in support of this.</P>
    <P>I come now to another part of the Minister's speech&mdash;in fact, the opening part of it&mdash;which will lead me into the <Col N="1576" /> realms of controversy.  I have to bring up again a case which was the subject here last November and October of several Dáil questions and which gave rise to much acrimony.  The Minister says at column 1308 of the Official Report for Wednesday, 15th April, 1970:</P>
    <P>Since the introduction of the policy of closing small schools the total number of schools has been reduced by 724.  Of the number of schools closed 390 were one-teacher schools and 307 two-teacher schools. One hundred and ninety-three schools were closed during 1969, and the result of this reduced the total number of schools in operation on 31st December, 1969, to 4,144.</P>
    <P>The Minister, having stated the actual statistical position, then goes on to express certain views regarding the closure of small schools.  He says:</P>
    <P>I would like here to pay tribute to the co-operation which I am receiving from managers, teachers and parents generally in the implementation of this policy.  It is only the rare cases in which trouble arises that receive publicity: peaceful progress does not usually make headlines.</P>
    <P>The Minister then goes on to outline the various advantages of amalgamation and the need for co-operation between parents, teachers and managers. Without going into the full details again and repeating the whole case, it is true that in many cases and, perhaps, in most cases, the decision to amalgamate and close down small schools has been accepted peacefully but there have been exceptions as the Minister has acknowledged.  I am very conscious of this fact and the Minister must realise that his Department can make mistakes too.</P>
    <P>When a row starts in a parish over the closure of a school, and when the full glare of publicity is focussed on it, the Minister must realise that his Department can make mistakes too.  The case that hit the headlines perhaps more than any other, the case of the Montpelier national school at O'Brien's Bridge on the Limerick/Clare border, proved to be the most serious and difficult of all.  The pros and cons of this case have been debated at length in <Col N="1577" /> this House.  I was deeply involved in it.  I make no apology to anybody for having been involved in it because, as a public representative, I felt it my duty to come to the assistance of the small local community in this village which is one of the smallest villages in the country.</P>
    <P>The most significant outcome of the Montpelier case is the lesson which it should teach to the Minister and his Department.  It is a lesson which I sincerely hope the Minister has learned. I trust such a situation will never arise again.  The trouble at Montpelier was due to bad handling and very bad public relations on the part of the Department of Education.  The Minister, of course, had to accept the report of his inspectors but the plain fact of the matter was that the inspectors who went down there originally and met the parents came away with a completely false picture of what the feeling of the parents was.</P>
    <P>We read in the paper and it was stated here that the inspectors reported back to the Minister that all except six of the parents were in favour of closing the school.  The reason for this was that only six parents spoke at the meeting.  What the unfortunate inspectors failed to recognise was that those six parents who spoke at the meeting were speaking on behalf of all the parents.  Montpelier was badly handled. It was a bad mistake.  The school should not have been closed because of the fact that it was a marginal three-teacher school.  There was every indication that it could and would become a viable three-teacher school.</P>
    <P>I sincerely hope that in future great care will be taken by the Minister and his officials when the question of closing any school arises.  With all due respect to the academic qualifications and so forth of the Minister's inspector's, they will have to realise that, even though a school which is about to be closed may be in an isolated rural area, the people are intelligent and are interested in the welfare of their children.  They are entitled to express their views about where and in what manner their children should be educated.  In the Montpelier case the parents did not give their consent to the closure.  Subsequent events proved <Col N="1578" /> that they were violently opposed to it. Yet, in the light of that, the Minister went ahead and persisted in his decision.</P>
    <P>The story of Montpelier has been written.  It has been misrepresented and falsely presented by certain sensation-seeking journalists and others.  I deplore in particular the television programme that was transmitted on this matter in the early days of the row.  The screaming women and so forth were highlighted but no attempt was made to get down to a discussion on the basic issues involved.  It seems to be the attitude that a rural community does not count any longer.  Dr. Lucey said a decade ago that rural Ireland was stricken and dying.  The attitude seems to be that a big stick can be held over small helpless rural communities.  Fortunately&mdash;and this will be more marked in future&mdash;these small rural communities will fight for their rights.  The Minister and his Department will have to be very careful and they will have to get goodwill and co-operation all round.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of education on which I have spoken on previous occasions.  I cannot find any reference to it in the Minister's speech.  I may be wrong, but I have read the Minister's speech and cannot find any specific reference to adult education, a topic which has been receiving increasing attention in recent times.  There is a subvention for the Catholic Workers' College and other institutions.  The need for adult education is now beginning to be recognised.  Over the past week-end a conference on adult education was held in Limerick city. A new national organisation has now been established under the title of Aontas.  I understand that Mr. Con Murphy, who was a pioneer in this field, has been carrying out a survey into the prospects for adult education. I do not know when a report of this survey will be available but there are one or two points which I should like to make.</P>
    <P>Adult education has been developing in this country in a rather haphazard manner.  No one is able to define clearly what is meant by the term &ldquo;adult education&rdquo;.  We must not lose sight of the fact that it is an integral part of the <Col N="1579" /> educational system in most civilised countries in the world.  It is also noteworthy that particularly in Great Britain and the United States of America the universities have participated very significantly in the promotion of adult education.  For example, in Great Britain, 21 universities operate extension courses mainly in co-operation with the workers' educational association which is an offshoot of the trade union movement.  In the United States it is estimated that 76 universities are providing extension courses.</P>
    <P>In this country in 1946 an important development took place involving the first important contribution by our universities in the field of adult education when the then illustrious president of University College, Cork, Dr. Alfred O'Rahilly, introduced a system of extension courses which operated in towns and rural areas throughout Munster.  Since their introduction in 1946 hundreds of people have been able to pursue courses in economics and sociology and various other disciplines.  I do not think the other universities have even attempted to follow the lead of Dr. Alfred O'Rahilly in University College, Cork.  The whole approach to adult education in this country has been haphazard and has been looked on more or less as a pastime.</P>
    <P>As one of the few Members of this House who, perhaps, has had experience of adult education I shall try to put the record straight in this regard. There are two countries in which adult education has greatly contributed to the growth of the economy.  They are Denmark and Canada.  In the case of Canada I refer in particular to Nova Scotia.  The dramatic results achieved and the tremendous contribution made by the folk-schools in Denmark to the economic and social development of that nation are well-known.  In Northern Canada, the University of Anti-gonish in the Province of Nova Scotia, sent out its staff into small rural villages and by educating the local people in community co-operation have been able to transform the economic life of the poorer parts of the province.</P>
    <P>Quite apart from the work of Dr. <Col N="1580" /> Alfred O'Rahilly, I am aware of the very good work being carried out by the Catholic Workers' College and I should also like to pay tribute to the trade union movement for its contribution in this field.  With the establishment of this new national organisation, Aontas, I hope the time is not far distant when there will be a comprehensive national policy for adult education.  It is an important factor in any modern democracy and such a policy should be implemented here without further delay.</P>
    <P>Another point which arises in connection with this matter is the question of youth clubs.  We hear much about juvenile delinquency; people speak a lot about the problems of youth and so forth.  Many organisations here are doing tremendous voluntary work for the youth of this country.  That is true of Limerick city and I was horrified to find out some time ago that a youth club run by the Augustinian Fathers, catering for 300 or 400 young people has been informed that the Department of Education can no longer pay the very meagre stipend which to date they have been paying to the instructors in this youth club.</P>
    <P>For the past few years this club had been availing of the services of physical training instructors and others in the employment of the vocational education committee.  In respect of this valuable work the instructors received a very small fee from the Department of Education&mdash;I do not know the exact figure but it is something in the region of £100.  The instructors involved in this project are professional men and have done tremendous work for the young people in the clubs.  It is a disgraceful and deplorable state of affairs that the Department have now announced that they will no longer pay this meagre sum.  It is all the more deplorable in view of the fact that the Minister has a Parliamentary Secretary one of whose responsibilities is to look after the youth of this country.  The Augustinian Fathers will continue to run their club with the aid of a voluntary committee of lay people in Limerick.  I might add that we are not all bigots in that city.  The vast majority have a social conscience and <Col N="1581" /> many of our citizens are quietly and unobtrusively engaged in social work.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister realises the implications of this decision of the Department. The country must be completely in the red when it has to take such measures.  I am not competent to speak on the finances of the country, particularly when Deputy FitzGerald is sitting beside me and Deputy O'Donovan is also here, but this whole affair appears to me quite appalling.  Representations have been made to the Minister and the reply from the Department has been published in the local papers: &ldquo;We regret to say we cannot continue to provide the funds....&rdquo;</P>
    <P>A matter I should also like to raise concerns career guidance and all that that implies.  On many occasions I have deplored the lack of such facilities in our schools.  I am glad to note from the Minister's speech that it is his intention to have a qualified career guidance teacher attached to all post-primary schools, and this I regard as most important.  On many occasions I have seen boys and girls leaving post-primary institutions&mdash;many with good leaving certificates&mdash;and they have not the foggiest notion of what they wish to do afterwards.  In many cases they drift into occupations for which they are temperamentally and otherwise totally unsuited.  The fact that there will be a qualified person available in post-primary schools to guide these young people is very important.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank Deputy Thornley for allowing me to take precedence.  I think he realised what I have gone through as I have been sitting here since the Minister read his speech.  The debate is now moving into its third day and so far only four Deputies have spoken.  That must be a record&mdash;four Deputies covering the best part of two days' debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First of all, though it is no part of an Opposition to do so, I compliment the Minister on his treatment of the reformatory schools.  Last year he doubled the grant.  I am glad to see that there has been a sizable reduction in the number of boys and girls in these schools.  It is just possible that there is a connection between the two things. <Col N="1582" /> The Government deserves credit for what they have been attempting to do in education.  Whether or not they have achieved all that some people would desire is another matter.  I think that there was too great a rush where secondary education is concerned.  We live in the jet age.  The least we expect is an express passenger train.  I fear I am a bit like an old goods train, but I hope that people like myself succeed in carrying the goods safely and, for that reason, they are, perhaps, better goods eventually.</P>
    <P>One reason why the Government deserve credit for what they have done in education is that between 1924 and 1964 practically the only change in Irish education was the introduction, under John Marcus O'Sullivan, of the vocational education system.  The 1930 Act has not been changed by so much as a comma hardly since then.  That shows how excellent the work done by the committee was.  But there was no worthwhile change in education generally in a period of 40 years and, even if the Government have not achieved as much as one would like, they, nevertheless, deserve credit.</P>
    <P>Some speakers said they did not think there was a great deal in the Minister's brief; it was not as big as his colleague's, the Minister for Local Government, but I do not think size determines quality.  I do not think a plethora of what looks like new ideas necessarily improves anything.  Neither does a great deal of <i>obiter dicta</i> on this and that.  Despite what Deputy Cunningham said&mdash;I am not saying his contribution was by any means the least to which we have listened&mdash;on the whole I think we understand what good education is.  Even those who may not regard themselves as well educated understand what good education is.</P>
    <P>Let me give an example.  In reply to a question by me some time ago, in which I was complaining about the grants to one particular university, the Minister said the universities might modernise their methods.  The Minister is not on a very good wicket there because the methods should have been modernised 300 years ago when printing became widespread.  Up to the Middle Ages the professor or teacher <Col N="1583" /> had the manuscript and the students, I presume, used slates and slate pencils. That was about the only method then. The lecture method has not changed an iota in that 300 years.  There is a certain amount now of visual aids but, generally speaking, the method is the same as it was 300 years ago.  I do not think it will be easy to get universities to modernise their methods.  One has to have experience of some other methods somewhere other than in Western Europe before deciding to discard the existing method.</P>
    <P>We have had a multiplication of documents on financial matters and I suggest that there is probably only one Member of this House who will diligently peruse those documents. Reading them is a herculean task. Digesting them would be nearly impossible. I thought I discerned evidence of groups of people trying to outdo one another in producing documents on the eve of the Budget. Masses of documents do not necessarily add anything to anything and, from that point of view, I support the Minister for a certain degree of brevity.  There are no new ideas but it might be a good thing if we tried to digest fully some of the new ideas we have had on education in recent years before we start complaining about this kind of brief.</P>
    <P>On the question of the school leaving age I just cannot understand the attitude.  The Government decided they would raise the school leaving age to 15 this year.  It is now being deferred until 1972.  The number of pupils, 6,000, represents only 1 per cent of the number in the schools. There is a reference to committees investigating this.  We are chock-a-block now with committees investigating this, that and the other.  The Minister used the word in the plural.  The thought of a number of committees discussing for hours around tables whether one could provide for 6,000 extra pupils and the problems that might throw up makes me shudder.</P>
    <P>I see one difficulty in this.  In the case of large families it will not be possible to compel the children to stay <Col N="1584" /> at school unless the children's allowances are doubled, making them equal to what they are in Britain, and, in Britain, they are only half what they are in France and Italy.  Even one extra year would make a difference. I do not know whether or not these proposed committees will discuss that aspect of the problem.  I would dearly love to know what is the real reason for the postponement.  There is a great deal of verbiage in the Minister's brief in this particular context.  There seems to be a great belief in verbiage these days.  As one who has not a great belief in verbiage I was left with the feeling that the problem has not really been dealt with at all.  It is possible that the Minister had so many other problems to digest that he had, in fact, to postpone this one.  There is one particular social basis on which one can criticise this.  It will obviously make a good deal of cheap labour available. This, in itself, is extremely objectionable from any point of view, though there are some who may disagree with me on that.</P>
    <P>Talking generally for a moment, I agree with Kaim Caudle that a community will get more value for £1 million spent on primary education than from £1 million spent on any other form of education.  Until we have dealt comprehensively with primary education we should not do more and more other things, trying to make progress in all directions at once.  During the first world war, when the great offensive took place it started at 5 a.m. we were told, and they were progressing on all fronts.  Gains of five or ten miles had already been made.  The next day things were more stabilised and after a week or ten days when one saw the map of the lines it was seen that actually they had gained about 100 yards in some small places and that generally they were back where they started. That is what happens when you try to advance on all fronts.</P>
    <P>I have been informed that the headmaster of a primary school in Dublin in an area where teachers would like to teach has been instructed by the Department of Education that he may not employ more teachers although there are 60 pupils to each member of <Col N="1585" /> the staff in this school.  If the Minister would answer this question immediately I would appreciate it. Could this be correct?  The Minister may not know the answer of his own knowledge but if what I have stated is true I would regard it as extremely objectionable just as I would agree fully with Deputy Dr. FitzGerald that having a fixed age limit of 12 for going into the secondary system is all &ldquo;my eye&rdquo;.  Many people believe that the time to change is between the age of 11 and 12.  There were very definite objections to the system in Britain when they had the scholarship at 11 years of age but the objections did not mean that the age was wrong.  Experienced teachers have told me that this is the right age to change but, in fact, as sometimes happens in the country, pupils are, or in the past were, delayed because of an attempt to keep up numbers until reaching 13 and that this was bad for their education.</P>
    <P>I do not know this of my own knowledge.  Although I was a long time being educated.  I feel my knowledge of education is extremely limited.  If I were to indicate in what part of our educational system the Department have been most successful I would go back to the vocational system.  That has been the greatest achievement in education in this country on the whole. Vocational schools now exist in most small towns where there are no boys' secondary schools.  To the best of my knowledge there is still no boys' secondary school in Bantry.  That was confirmed as a result of a question asked here last week.  At one time I wanted a particular political party to put it in their programme but certain people were not prepared to do so although Deputy Declan Costello was strongly in favour of it.</P>
    <P>If you are going to have technological colleges, the vocational schools should really go up to the general certificate of education standard which is, on the whole, what they will do. In many avocations the right age for change is about 16 when boys become apprenticed to various trades.  Earlier than that, perhaps, they are not physically and mentally prepared for the change and after that is, perhaps, <Col N="1586" /> unsuitable.  From my own limited experience, I object to the policy of abolishing two-teacher schools.  I have a personal reason for that.  I was in a two-teacher school in Tipperary and left at the age of 11½.  I was by no means the youngest in the class in case anybody would accuse me of claiming to be a whizz kid; there were three or four others younger.  The particular teacher we had covered a remarkable course and I should like to pay tribute to him, the late Dick Griffith.  When he retired he managed one of the Griffith shoe shops in this city.</P>
    <P>What had he done with us? He had done all the main elementary parts of arithmetic, square root, proportion and so on, including interest.  He had done the first book of Euclid, mensuration, Greek and Latin roots, a play of Shakespeare, <i>The Merchant of Venice.</i> We had done elementary botany and some elementary chemistry.  All this was done in a two-teacher school where his only assistant was a junior assistant mistress.  The regrettable conclusion I must draw is that if the Department now insist on abolishing two-teacher schools, obviously such men are no longer around or they may be around but are not in primary teaching.  When I hear it said that this or that cannot be done unless you have five teachers in a school I can only recall my own experience.  I never remember that teacher getting the Carlyle and Blake premium although I remember another teacher who taught in a much narrower field who, in fact, did get it.</P>
    <P>The national school was a centre in a locality.  If you take out of these villages the dispensary doctor and the national school you are left with the parish priest.  You are taking away long-term institutions and the bus pulling up in the mornings is a poor substitute for your own school.</P>
    <P>I am told that pupils coming into secondary schools from national schools are not as good in recent years as they were in the thirties.  Subject to certain qualifications the leaving certificate standard of secondary schools was not at all as tough in recent times as it was in the first years of its existence, say, from 1922 to 1935.  I am not criticising this.  It may be desirable to give each <Col N="1587" /> child leaving school, or 95 per cent of them, a certificate.  When the teachers in the universities all clubbed together &mdash;this is something I do know&mdash;in about 1956 or 1957 and said that the standard of English of students coming into universities was deplorable, I noticed that within a couple of years there was a decided improvement.  This shows that if you can get the academics to agree with each other they can achieve something.</P>
    <P>I was always very proud in the UCD faculty of commerce that while in the fifties the students who came in wrote very bad English and their spelling was deplorable, eventually the year came when for a final paper there was not a single spelling error among 120 students.  It may not be a very high level of education by certain people's standards but certainly there was a tremendous improvement in their standard of basic education in their three years there.  One achieves what one can and that is all there is to it.</P>
    <P>I noticed that Deputy Dr. FitzGerald disagreed with the requirements for entrance to the universities; the Department have one view and the universities have another.  There is no reason why people should not differ about these things but I see that even Deputy Dr. FitzGerald has come around to the view that the NIEC&mdash; that unanimous body; it is always unanimous&mdash;is not at all the body certain people were making it out to be.</P>
    <P>I should like to make a few suggestions to the Minister about secondary schools.  I fail to understand why service in secondary schools in Northern Ireland and Great Britain is not recognised for incremental purposes in this country.  Service in the missionary colleges, for example, is recognised. The missionary colleges may be very good but I would bet that service in the secondary schools in Great Britain and Northern Ireland is better.  It is an extremely narrow view unless a change has been made recently.  It is a very harsh rule that a man who goes abroad for five years and gets, say, a responsible position in charge of mathematics in a comprehensive school will <Col N="1588" /> not have that service recognised for incremental purposes when he returns. I will finalise my remarks on this by saying that the Department will soon recognise that service because if the Louden Ryan attitude to salaries continues there will be an emigration of good secondary teachers under thirty years which this country will not forget for a long time and then the service will be recognised.  I am not going to make things difficult for the Minister. He has my sympathy in regard to the final paragraph of his speech.</P>
    <P>I come now to the question of textbooks for secondary schools.  I have seen textbooks of English literature from the United States which are models and which come right up to date.  One book I saw was from the State of California but New York and other States also produce them.  I am also told by professors of classics in UCD that there are similar types of textbooks for Latin and Greek on the Continent.  One thick book can cover a number of years and the obvious advantage would be that this would reduce the cost, which is a very serious matter.  In some country areas I am told that a farmer with a valuation of up to £60 is supposed to be a poor man.  Quite well off people can get free books in the country areas.  Despite what Deputy Tom O'Donnell said the country does not lose all the way.  In Dublin in my own constituency certain poor people complain that they cannot get these free books.  I am talking about people who would have the equivalent income in real terms of a man with a £15 valuation and not a £60 valuation.</P>
    <P>The objections to the present system of free education as it has transpired and built up, especially in the boys' schools in the Dublin area, are serious on social grounds.  We are going to set up what will be our equivalent of the English public school system.  Having to a remarkable degree had a one-class society it is just too bad that we should now be doing something that will set up a class society.  The Americans were always fond of the attitude that one American was as good as another but they had a lot more class distinction than we had in Munster.  I suppose the same applies to other Provinces but I <Col N="1589" /> can only speak for the Province I know.  What is the difficulty here?  The difficulty is that very soon the plum institutions in our capital society&mdash;or call it our form of capitalism, which is a good enough phrase to describe it&mdash; the banks, the insurance companies and the different walks of life will all recruit their staffs from these schools which have not entered the free education system.  A person might say that that would not be so but again I would be prepared to back my opinion with a little money.  Give it time and we will see.</P>
    <P>In regard to the question of university fees I am not prepared to oppose the increase as the system of grants is rapidly becoming more extensive and since the Minister said in his speech, unless I am wrong, that he would increase the grants by the amount involved.  However, there are two snags.  I have already made representations to the Minister for Finance on behalf of one group, and I have had correspondence with him and I hope that something will issue from the Budget tomorrow in regard to this group.  The group to which I am referring are the night students who should be allowed to have the cost of their fees free of income tax.  This is only fair because the parents of the others are getting an income tax allowance on £150.  In the case of night students it would be the tax on £70.  Another aspect is that when students go to the university there is an implied contract that the fees will remain the same through the course.  I know that in UCD this has been covered by a note stating that the fees may be changed but there was a period, unless my memory plays me false, when in the fifties the fees were increased only for incoming students.  This is a reasonable approach especially as there is a fair number of people who are just outside the grant system who will suffer a fair amount of hardship.  Government Departments are not too generous and therefore the figures for qualifying for grants are not placed at too high a level.</P>
    <P>A tragic error was made in regard to the new building at Belfield and that was not building the library at the same time as the other buildings.  That <Col N="1590" /> has happened and there is no more to be said about it.</P>
    <P>I want now to speak about a topic which I mentioned on the Supplementary Estimate.  The Minister promised to see how the grant to UCD compares so unfavourably with the grants to other institutions.  I know there are a couple of plum parts of UCD&mdash; Veterinary Medicine and Agriculture&mdash; attached to the Department of Agriculture, different from anywhere else, but they are special and have nothing to do with this problem.  The Minister said there are 800 extra full-time students: I take it he means day-students. I got out the figures and I found that 443 of these are in UCD. Comparing last year with this year, I noticed, when I went on to compare the increases in the amounts of the grants, that there is nothing like the same increase for UCD as for the other colleges.  Cork has got a sizeable increase though I do not see any great objection to that: a good deal of it is for the cost of furniture and equipment, which is part of the general grant.</P>
    <P>No matter how one looks at it, we are still left with the case that the grant per student to UCD is substantially less than the grant per student to the other three colleges&mdash;TCD, UCC, and UCG &mdash;which are all on the one foot.  The answer the Minister gave to me the last time was interesting.  He spoke about a small institution.  None of them is now that small.  There was a time when there were only 250 students in Galway which meant larger overheads per student.  I have noticed, though I do not regard it as much of my business, a definite scarcity of money in UCD over the past year.  Deputy FitzGerald, who is on the governing body might be more aware of this.  I have noticed this.  Why?  Forgetting the Veterinary College and the Faculty of Agriculture, UCD consists of three places&mdash;Earlsfort Terrace, the science buildings in Merrion Street and the new conurbation in Belfield.  Owing to the non-completion of the library, only 1,200 commerce students are out there at present in this huge building.  Their overhead costs must be enormous. Earslfort Terrace or Belfield would be as big as either UCC or UCG.  I am <Col N="1591" /> not shooting down what the Minister said as an argument but I am shooting it down on the facts.  As I have said, I got no permission from anybody to make this case.  I do not think I will get any thanks for doing so.</P>
    <P>Another matter which concerns me&mdash; not, again, of my own knowledge&mdash; was mentioned by Deputy FitzGerald and I agree with him about it.  The case of the two instructors in architecture has created considerable concern in UCD among the non-statutory staff. The recent considerable disquiet that has arisen is because, there, two professional men were discharged without any stated cause.  They were just not re-appointed.  The system, for good or evil&mdash;a person like myself would probably say &ldquo;for evil&rdquo; beyond question&mdash; of appointing everybody every year, of giving them formal letters of appointment each year, enabled this to be done.</P>
    <P>I understand, also, that when the committee of inquiry into the architectural faculty met, 12 students appeared separately before it to give evidence or to state their opinion.  I have been informed that all 12 of them said that one of these two men who has been discharged was their best instructor. Whether or not certain conclusions were deduced from this, I do not know. I am aware that the architectural students have kept long records of what was going on in the faculty.  This was unusual but architectural students are unusual.  It is deplorable that a long tradition of 66 years, since UCD became a statutory institution, has been broken.  I know of only one case previous to this, a case which I might describe with some amusement.  About 50 years ago the name of a classics teacher who did not come into the institution for two years was left out of the list&mdash;after two years and for not having been near the institution for two years.  Perhaps this is a bit extreme but it shows a certain approach towards university education.  In Germany, for instance, the students wandered around from one university to another&mdash;there being only one form of degree, the Philosophy Doctorate&mdash; until they met one professor whom they <Col N="1592" /> liked.  They attached themselves to him, wrote a thesis and had it printed. I think that this remarkable freedom in Germany had something to do with their very fine system of education.  As it happens, I know one of these men who were discharged from UCD: that is only incidental.</P>

      <P>In justice to the people concerned, to the college authorities and to everybody, one has to be careful about a matter of this sort.  I believe that the decision about a university college at Limerick was misconceived.  Let us recall the university at Nottingham and the university at Reading: these are examples of colleges which became full universities. If the third level college being set up at Limerick does not start as a university college I believe it will be a university college within a limited period of time.  I feel the committee made a bad blunder in demanding a medical school for it.  Medical schools occupy a special place in a university: a medical school is not necessary in this connection.</P>
      <P>In his brief the Minister says:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We cannot go on producing more and more graduates in some form of vacuum.  Not only must the numbers be taken into consideration but the type of graduate produced; if we go <Col N="1593" /> on spending more and more money on higher education, we must ensure that we secure the maximum benefit for the nation from the expenditure involved.</P>
    <P>I accused the Minister of talking <i>ex cathedra</i> here the other day.  Perhaps I might do so myself now on this subject. It is not possible to ensure this aim with this kind of approach.  As an example, I look back to when we were talking about manpower policies on television programmes a few years ago. Two people were interviewed.  One of them was the headmaster of Bolton Street College.  Three hundred students were leaving Bolton Street that summer.  The other participant was a member of the staff of UCD and he was talking about the manpower policy and how it should be decided how many carpenters would be required at some future date.  The interviewer said to the headmaster of Bolton Street: &ldquo;Could you tell me, Mr. Cranley, what are the 300 students leaving Bolton Street this summer going to?&rdquo; Mr. Cranley said: &ldquo;I have not the foggiest notion&rdquo;.  That is not nearly as bad as it sounds.  People like myself believe that water finds its own level.  I was regretting once that some students had not done better and someone said: &ldquo;They will find their own level&rdquo;.  You can plan yourself out of existence to the extent that you get yourself tied up in knots.  The present Minister personally is not to blame for such defects as there are at present in our system.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>If there is one point more than another on which I should like to compliment and congratulate the Minister for Education it is in regard to what he said in the final paragraphs of <Col N="1594" /> his introductory speech.  I have been watching with an amount of satisfaction the Minister's patience and sympathy and the manner in which he has been trying to resolve the difficulties that exist in so far as teachers' salaries are concerned.  There are difficulties, and there will continue to be difficulties, so long as we have a continuation of the situation which existed heretofore where the different classes of teachers have been placed in the categories of primary, secondary and vocational.  Arising out of all the deliberations which have taken place on this matter, it may become obvious to all concerned that a teacher is a teacher irrespective of the branch of education in which he finds himself and that all teachers are entitled to parity in salary, status and esteem.  There should be no question at all of any case being made for one teacher receiving more than another except in specific circumstances.  It should be shown that a certain teacher has more to offer in the matter of teaching, and not merely that he has an honours degree, before he receives more than another teacher</P>
    <P>I appreciate, so far as national school teachers are concerned, the desirability of their having the benefit of two or three years in university.  But no reflection can be cast on national school teachers.  As I see it, they are the best qualified teachers, whether or not they have been to the university and can boast of a degree.  We should be very careful not to accept the proposition that anybody who has studied education is bound to be a better teacher.  I say this from my own experience. In certain cases, the higher the qualification the less value we obtain from the teacher.  I would not like to generalise on that; I merely mention it as a word of warning.  High degrees do not guarantee better teaching.  In the past we had the kind of teacher about whom Deputy Dr. O'Donovan spoke. They may not have had the benefit of university training; they were trained at St. Patrick's Training College.  They had the responsibility of educating the child right through his school career. They did a first-class job&mdash;that has been acknowledged by everyone concerned. I must reiterate the warning <Col N="1595" /> that it must not be assumed that the more one reads about education the better qualified one is to teach.  Teaching requires certain characteristics which are not improved by one's attendance at university.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to Deputy Dr. FitzGerald's remarks on post-primary education, as reported at column 1414 of the Official Report of 16th April, 1970:</P>
    <P>There is also a problem arising out of the existence of this very large private sector in secondary education, the fact that our secondary education system is entirely privately owned&mdash;a problem which the Government have not yet succeeded in resolving.</P>
    <P>It struck me as being rather strange that when talking about post-primary education, Deputy Dr. FitzGerald generally seemed to make two divisions.  He talked about vocational and secondary education, and he is not alone in this thinking.</P>
    <P>When he spoke about secondary education, privately owned, was he or was he not looking on post-primary and vocational education as being part of secondary education?  To me it is. There is not any difference, as I see it.  I often wonder at the origin of the words &ldquo;vocational&rdquo; and &ldquo;secondary&rdquo; in so far as education is concerned.  In so far as secondary education is a sequel to what has happened in the primary school, I can see why it is so called, but in so far as post primary education is also a sequel to that which has occurred in the primary school, surely it merits the description of secondary education?  Because vocational education generally aims at the preparation of the student for a way of life, for a calling, whether he will be called to work as a labourer, as a professional or a craftsman, is it not all part of secondary education?</P>
    <P>The fact that one person opts for one type of post-primary education as against another arises from the situation in which we ourselves are suggesting there is something different.  I think we should now discard the terms <Col N="1596" />&ldquo;post-primary&rdquo; and &ldquo;vocational&rdquo; and talk about the entire field as it is and refer to it as secondary education. If we did this it might help to eliminate some of the problems to which Deputies refer.  There is no doubt that among the people at large there is an inclination to think about secondary education as that which existed 20 years ago, to think in terms of the only type of secondary education which was available years ago.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the Department should engage in certain publicising activities so that it would be made clear to Irish parents&mdash;it is the parents more than the students whom we must enlighten in this respect&mdash;that in what were formerly known as technical and vocational schools there now exists the opportunity for every student to pursue a secondary course comparable with any course he could pursue in any other secondary school.</P>

      <P>It has the advantage that he may opt for what is described as an academic course or a technical course or for a combination of both, and we should make it known to our people that the conditions that existed in the past when secondary education meant an opportunity for a person to elevate himself&mdash;if he did not have secondary education he was a labourer: if he had it he was something else&mdash;no longer prevails.  New problems have arisen and if there is any want in the system that exists&mdash;Deputy Cunningham referred to it&mdash;because of the foolish attitude of people and the mistaken views they have about secondary education, it is that we have thousands of boys and girls moving to leaving certificate as a result of which they are not fitted for anything.</P>

      <P>I am afraid that we will always have people who will make <Col N="1597" /> the point that there is a superior form of education to be found in one school as against another.  If those people were in earnest, if they had what we would expect from them, a proper Christian outlook, they would be prepared to admit, they should be prepared to admit, that what they criticise is not the fact that equal education is not available in one establishment as against another but that attendances in one establishment oblige a student to mix, to sit beside and to play with youngsters whose parents may not be at the same bank balance level.</P>

      <P>I do not deny the right to any person to pay and to have for himself that which he is prepared to pay for, but I object when we have a line of thinking which would criticise education and would attempt to make a point against education or educational merit from wrong motives.  If this is allowed to continue we will have a situation in which what the community is doing and what the Government are doing is the making of money available for certain schools, and, instead of reaching the desired social position to which we want all to move ultimately, we will get a situation in which the better the capacity to pay the better will be the type of education. If this is allowed to continue you will get a movement of a certain type student into one type of school and another student into another type.</P>

      <P>Therefore, the results, if we take examination results, will be better in school A than in school B and ultimately we may reach the point at which anybody really interested in education for his children will not have any option but to move them to school A as against school B.  I compliment the Department on what they have done to date in this respect and I compliment the Minister.  The Department must be adamant in this.  In some areas there were what we call post-primary schools&mdash;to me they are secondary schools&mdash;where vacancies existed, and in any case where <Col N="1598" /> vacancies exist in any kind of post-primary school, where it can be shown that the student entering is at liberty to pursue any course leading to the leaving certificate, in no circumstances should the Department in the name of the people be prepared to spend money on the building of another type school to satisfy the vanity and the unChristian attitude of people.</P>
      <P>There are two points to which I should like to refer by way of reference to contributions already made.  I have referred to the contribution of Deputy FitzGerald and presently I shall return to another point made by him on which I should like to take issue.  To keep a balance, however, I should like to refer to a point made by Deputy Desmond.  I have been with Deputy Desmond at one or two functions at which he, I and other people spoke to teachers on education.  I listened to him here and I have said before that I am mindful of the worthwhile contributions he makes in this House.  Indeed, there are times when I envy him his knowledge and his ability to get his points across.  There is one matter in the course of his contribution which is topical and which I should, perhaps, mention.  It has had, perhaps, too much publicity and from Deputy Desmond's contribution a false notion might get abroad.  The point to which I refer is in relation to corporal punishment.  At column 1529 of the Official Report he is reported:</P>
      <P>There has been a considerable change in the educational system. The abandonment of the results system whereby you could almost have said the pay of the teacher depended on the answers given by the children has certainly meant getting rid of any understandable physical violence against children in school.</P>
      <P>Here we have a very serious charge against our national teachers, a suggestion that national teachers beat children for the sake of getting results in examinations.  This point is extended further on.  Later in the same column the Deputy spoke about &ldquo;this behaviour&rdquo; inevitably bringing down the good name of the teachers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy might <Col N="1599" /> quote that entire section of my speech. It is quite short.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>If I am saying anything to which the Deputy objects as being incorrect I shall be quite happy to withdraw it.  The kernel of the two paragraphs in question would suggest that because of the changes that have occurred and because of the lack of pressures on national school teachers it has contributed towards their not beating children as they did when these other pressures were on them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is taking it out of context.  Let him quote the speech in full or not quote at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall quote in full:</P>
      <P>There has been a considerable change in the educational system. The abandonment of the results system whereby you could have almost have said the pay of the teacher depended upon the answers given by the children has certainly meant getting rid of any understandable physical violence against children in school.  The abandonment of the primary certificate examination system has been of immeasurable benefit and has led to the elimination of a physical reaction towards children on the part of parents or teachers in respect of the educational system.  The introduction of the new curriculum has helped enormously in the development of enlightened attitudes.</P>
      <P>There are still isolated incidents relating to corporal punishment which are indefensible.  We must be concerned about this because if it is only one case per annum it inevitably brings the good name of teachers down.  It must be dealt with and be seen to be dealt with by the Department.  Any excessive dependence on corporal punishment is to be deplored apart from the fact that increased severity is increasingly ineffective.  Furthermore the use of corporal punishment is contrary to the dignity of the child itself.  If we resort to violence against children we cannot expect to command their respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1600" /> And so on.  I think I have quoted sufficiently, and, perhaps, if I had not quoted at all it would have been more favourable to Deputy Barry Desmond.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has not quoted the section in full.  I also quoted what the Minister said.  There are several other paragraphs relating to corporal punishment.  I like to see things in their proper perspective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am suggesting that the point being made was that with the elimination now of the primary certificate, with the change in the curriculum and because national school teachers are no longer required to show results examination-wise, that means, as far as Deputy Desmond is concerned, they will not beat the children any more.  As I see it, that is the point the Deputy made and I have some slight knowledge of English and some slight respect for my own ability to interpret what is said.</P>
      <P>Again on the question of corporal punishment, as one who would have some knowledge of teaching I would say, contrary to what Deputy Desmond or other people might think, the incidence of corporal punishment in our primary schools has been exaggerated out of all proportion.  I am not in complete agreement that its total elimination would be beneficial to education. I would be prepared to argue that the student welcomes a certain amount of corporal punishment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>I would have proof of that and I have discussed this with students; a certain amount is not unwelcome in so far as an occasional tap to a student will be an indication to him of the teacher's genuine concern for him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Could we have a definition of &ldquo;a certain amount&rdquo;?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>I said an occasional tap.  If the Deputy does not know what an occasional tap is, then I cannot make it any easier for him.  It would be very unwise to accept the situation that has been accepted in what some <Col N="1601" /> people call progressive countries, that children welcome absolute and uncontrolled freedom.  They do not.  Children are happiest when there is an element of control.  They feel more secure when there is an element of control.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>Certain children welcome the type of control that is applied in their own homes, and I hope that henceforth there will be less criticism and fewer charges of the type that has been made by Deputy Desmond.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not made any charges whatsoever.  I made a number of observations which the Deputy did not elucidate fully to the House.  I referred even to the Minister's own views on corporal punishment which I fully accept.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>Before concluding, I wish to say a word about higher education, that is higher education as it exists at university level.  I would hope that every child who would be capable of deriving benefit from university education will have the opportunity of pursuing that education.  As I see it and not withstanding the efforts that have been made, this will not be easy.  In this regard I have certain doubts as to whether it is wise to introduce a final year post-leaving certificate standard. At the moment a student who has completed his secondary education finds himself in the position of being able either to enrol at a higher regional college of technology or to go into employment.  I am concerned now about the student who comes from a home that is not a wealthy one.  However, with the introduction of a third year such a student would have to spend an additional year at a secondary school and because of the increased demands on the parents' purse, they would probably opt for his going either to a regional college or into employment as against allowing him to remain at secondary school for a further year.  If a higher leaving certificate is introduced it will be desirable that any student whose parents are of limited means would get a special type of scholarship or would get special grants which would compensate <Col N="1602" /> for the loss of earnings to the parents.</P>
      <P>There has been much talk about autonomy of the universities.  Deputy Dr. FitzGerald spoke on this matter and I was interested in this contribution because at the outset he spoke of a certain lack of involvement on the part of the Department and the Government in the field of education, but by the time he had finished speaking he had criticised the manner in which the Department and the Government were involving themselves at university level.  The universities are not entitled to any considerations other than those extended to other educational institutions.  It would be difficult to understand how, in a situation in which the majority of the Irish people would be contributing towards the staffing and maintenance of the universities, the elected representatives of the country should not have at least some voice in the management of the universities.</P>
      <P>I do not accept and neither can I imagine the people of Ireland accepting that universities should be managed with no regard whatever for those who have been elected to speak, on behalf of and to involve themselves in the general interest of the community.  University professors, lecturers and graduates are no more free from human imperfection than any of the rest of us and it could be highly undesirable to leave the management and the control of the colleges solely in the hands of the professors and staff.</P>
      <P>If there is any problem it is, to my mind, because of the existence to date of this autonomy.  I spent some time in one of these establishments and I must confess that while there I became very much aware, as did the other students of the autonomy of the institution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of staff-student relationship, I read recently of the amount of time which the lecturers and professors must spend in consultation and deliberation with their students. The situation must have changed since the time I was there which was not as long ago as it might seem&mdash;it was in the 1950s.  In so far as I saw it then lecturers and professors set themselves up as a type of intellectual leper.  It <Col N="1603" /> certainly did not appear as if they would welcome a student's views on any point.  They would make the case that because of pressure of work they did not have sufficient time.  Certainly, I would not be prepared to give to university professors and lecturers any more autonomy than that which they enjoyed while I was there.</P>
    <P>Although some people may point a finger at the Government with regard to student botherations, some of those botherations may stem from the fact that there is this difficulty in the student being able to make known his views to the professors or lecturers.  There is a reluctance on the part of students to accept outdated knowledge.  In so far, then, as autonomy is concerned, there must be some guarantee to the students as well as to the people that their interests will be safeguarded.</P>
    <P>With regard to university education I would hope for a time when we would bear in mind the extension of night classes.  In existing circumstances, a student, on completion of his secondary education, will be told by his parents that he should pursue a certain course.</P>
    <P>I do not think many students aged 17 know exactly what their abilities are.  It would be a good idea if students left school, took up employment and mixed with people in society before going on to university because they would find out exactly where their abilities lay.  Very often a youngster mistakenly thinks that his abilities lie in the subjects at which he is best in school but subsequently discovers that is not the case.  The Department of Education in consultation with universities, should make available more courses for people who have left school and taken up a job before deciding where their ability lies and what to study at university.  In many cases when a youngster leaves school the only direction he gets to follow a particular course is from his parents and the course usually decided upon is that likely to be most rewarding financially.</P>
    <P>Education has enjoyed a certain affluence in the last decade.  There has been a great investment in education and this has resulted in increasing numbers <Col N="1604" /> in our schools but the one big disadvantage about all this is that we are telling our youth that they are better educated than their parents are. This is most harmful and most dangerous. Just because they have a knowledge of trigonometry and logs and are able to give the módhfóshuiteach láithreach does not mean that they are educated in the sense I would like.  Our education system should be concerned with giving real education for the betterment of mind, body and character.  It must not be forgotten that parents can play a great part in guiding their children to lead useful lives as Christians in the hope of attaining the ultimate reward.  Children can learn much more from their parents than they can from any educational system.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Thornley</NameTxt>
      <P>This has been a long debate and as Deputy Dr. O'Donovan said it has precipitated some long speeches.  I have listened with considerable interest to quite a number of them and those I have been unable to hear I have read in the Official Report.  One thing which has struck me is that the proportion of teachers in the Dáil must be higher now than it has ever been before.  I found Deputy Tunney's speech admirable.  I agree with much of what he said, and apart from the brief lapse into sado-masochism I tend to think he is very much to the left of the Fianna Fáil Party.  It is nice to feel they have some eggheads on their side of the House too.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Due to the recent by-elections my brief is not as well prepared as otherwise I would have liked it to be. Nevertheless, there are a number of points I want to make.  Like Deputy Dr. FitzGerald I start off with an initial sympathy towards the Minister and towards the traditional pattern of operation of the Department of Education under him and his predecessors during the last decade.  I am very conscious of their problems and I am very conscious of the achievements they have made.  I regard those achievements as far in excess of the bad old days of the twenties, thirties, and forties when it seemed to be the common view among all parties that the function of the Department of Education was simply to <Col N="1605" /> keep the ship inching along at a minimal rate without any intervention in its philosophy or its sense of direction.</P>
    <P>I approach the Minister's speech with a degree of disappointment which far exceeds that of most of the previous speakers.  It is presented as representing significant increases on previous provisions but I really cannot accept that this is so.  At column 1307 of the Official Report of 15th April, 1970, the Minister said:</P>
    <P>The net provision for Primary Education in Vote 28 for 1970-71 is £25,258,000, an increase of £796,000 over the provision for last year.</P>
    <P>Allowing for the depreciation in the value of money and allowing for salary increases and that kind of thing I find that the grant&mdash;and this is reflected over most areas&mdash;is either static or has been cut.  It seems to me that the revolution in education generated by the Minister's predecessors has not merely ground to a halt but has been put into reverse.  I am very much afraid, and I mean no disrepect to the Minister when I say this because I know it would not be his own wish, that the Department of Education is in the process of being downgraded from the status of a growth Department, a revolutionary thinking Department, to which it had been lifted by the late Deputy O'Malley in particular.</P>
    <P>In his statement the Minister gave statistics about school closures but he never really grasped the nettle of the problem of primary schools.  At column 1308, the Minister went on to say:</P>
    <P>Since the introduction of the policy of closing small schools the total number of schools has been reduced by 724.  Of the number of schools closed 390 were one-teacher schools and 307 two-teacher schools.</P>
    <P>On 4th March last I asked the Minister to make a general statement on Government policy regarding the closure or retention of three-teacher national schools throughout the country.  In his reply at column 2030 of the Official Report of 4th March, 1970, he said:</P>
    <P>Accordingly, if it became a practical proposition to provide, in a <Col N="1606" /> parish, a central school with five or more teachers and this involved the closing of a three-teacher school which was due for replacement then efforts would be made to have the three-teacher school closed and to give all the children in the parish the benefits of the larger school.</P>
    <P>I am not one of those people who view with horror and consternation the closing of one-, two-, or three-teacher schools in all circumstances.  Departmental policy has come in for a lot of unfair criticism in this regard.  As far as I am concerned if children get a better education by being brought some distance to large schools with better facilities then the policy of the Department of providing these better facilities in larger schools is the correct one.  I have no hesitation in saying that no matter how unpopular it may be in some quarters.  However, I think we are entitled to ask the Minister to fill in one of the many vacuua in his statement by telling us what the Government's overall policy is towards the closure of three- or even four-teacher schools.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, what is his policy with regard to the degree of consultation which takes place with parents before these closures are brought to a conclusion? On the same day, the 4th March, I asked the Minister if the consultations with parents were carried out by his Department in all cases of national school closures before a final decision is made and if he would outline in detail the nature of such consultations. The reply I got was:</P>
    <P>The purpose of such consultation is to inform parents of what is contemplated and to place before them the educational advantages to be gained from the attendance of their children at larger school units.</P>
    <P>This is a form of consultation with which those of us in the universities are very familiar, the form of consultation which involves the descent of emissaries to tell people what is contemplated after the decision to do it has been taken.  I do not call that consultation. This is what worries me.  Let me tie this in with one of my pet hobby horses&mdash;this is something in regard to which I love to hound the Government <Col N="1607" /> on&mdash;the whole issue of Buchanan, FitzGerald and regionalisation.  Perhaps, the Department should close smaller schools, perhaps they should even close three-teacher schools, but they cannot do this like a thief in the night.  They must inform the people. They have a moral obligation to inform the people just how far they want to carry this process and how far it ties in with an ultimate picture of a regionalised Ireland in which our children will travel very substantial distances to large conglomerate schools.  Is this what lies ahead?  I think we should be told this and it is the function of a dynamic planning Minister for Education to tell us this.</P>
    <P>I want to touch on a thorny issue which I know will walk me into all sorts of misrepresentation if I am not careful but I must approach this with complete honesty.  I feel that, as a facet of this process of the rationalisation of the smaller primary schools around the country, the Minister and his Department will have to face up to a long deferred problem, the question of the effective functioning of the managerial system.  I am not one of those&mdash;if there are any on this side of the House&mdash;who regard the managerial system as necessarily wrong in itself or always incompetent or ineffective but we must recognise that it is a bad educational system where the effective functioning of a primary school may depend on the age or degree of interest of a particular parish priest in a particular area.  It just is not good enough when one reaches the point where primary school headmasters cannot get funds in some cases&mdash;I am not suggesting it happens in all cases&mdash;cannot get facilities, cannot get their houses decorated, because they are at odds with an old-fashioned, out-dated manager.  This is an unsatisfactory situation and the ultimate losers are the children.  We must face up to that.  I am not pretending that this is anything like a universal or even a majority problem but it is one that does exist, as the Minister well knows, in many cases.  It must be thought about and faced up to soon because that is one of the functions of Government&mdash;to face up to hard questions. <Col N="1608" /> I should like to add another word in support of parent-teacher associations. I do not regard them as the be-all and the end-all for ensuring a perfect system of education but they are a very effective means of communication between the parents and the teachers and can help to avoid many of the troubles which we see in some schools in this country.  It is strange, in a country whose Constitution and whose ethics place such stress on the role of the family in the upbringing of the child&mdash;Deputy Tunney has referred to this quite rightly&mdash;that for many years the advocates of parent-teacher associations have been represented as alien, strange, subversive sort of people.  I do not understand it.  I am glad that those days are going but I should like to see the Minister doing more to expedite the development of these associations.</P>
    <P>I also feel that the Minister should be doing much more about the size of classes in primary schools.  This brings me to a point to which I shall refer again.  Deputy Desmond made reference to this too.  I have asked the Minister repeated questions about the size of classes.  I asked him two questions in particular on the 10th December. In the first case I asked the number of pupils in each class in the different levels and the ratio of pupils to teachers in each case.  I was told:</P>
    <P>It is not possible to furnish the information requested by the Deputy.</P>
    <P>Then I was given the average number. In another question about overcrowding in secondary schools in the Dublin city and county area and the teaching of mathematics and science in these schools by qualified people I was told:</P>
    <P>The information already complied in my Department is not in a form which enables these questions to be answered.  In order to abstract the information which is being sought by the Deputy it would be necessary to commit staff to the examination of documents relating to every school and to each teacher concerned. If this were to be done it would interfere with the carrying out of the ordinary work of the secondary branch of my Department <Col N="1609" /> to a degree which would be unwarranted.</P>
    <P>Is this the language&mdash;this talk, this failure to supply information&mdash;of the same Department which generated such excitement in the period of the OECD survey on <i>Investment in Education</i>?  Is this the language of a Department which prides itself on being orientated towards education?  I do not think it is. This is the language of the Department of 20 or 30 years ago.  &ldquo;We do not know; we are not interested; it is not our business; it runs itself largely.&rdquo; With respect to the Minister I do not think it is good enough.</P>
    <P>I am inclined to register what for me is rare&mdash;but it will not be the only occasion in this debate&mdash;disagreement with Deputy Dr. FitzGerald in regard to his dislike of the age limit of 12 years for entry into post-primary education. I feel this was the proper decision to prevent the poaching of bright children&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Deputy knows the sort of phenomenon I mean, the recruiting, whereby children of superior abilities would leave primary schools in my opinion prematurely.  I feel the then Minister's arguments in this were correct.  The revision of the school leaving age&mdash;15 years in 1972&mdash; is too little and too late.  There is nothing to add to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To turn to secondary schools, I have a few points to make about the pay dilemmas which attend the three grades of teacher to which Deputy Tunney referred but I want to leave that for a moment because it is a separate and highly complicated issue.  One thing I should like to say&mdash;and this echoes the sentiments of other Deputies on this side of the House&mdash;is that we may now accept that the phrase &ldquo;free education&rdquo; should be driven from the terminology of contemporary Irish politics because there just is no such thing. Unless adequate steps are taken to provide maintenance grants to parents it is absolutely ludicrous to pretend that the provision of £25 a year to schools renders education free.  Deputy Desmond and I, Deputy Dr. FitzGerald <Col N="1610" /> and others have pressed the Minister from time to time in Parliamentary questions about the degree to which so-called voluntary schemes function in secondary schools by which the parents of children are asked to make contributions to the building of libraries, swimming pools and gymnasia over and above the so-called non-fee paying status which they allegedly enjoy.  The Minister, I am afraid, has been pretty evasive in answering these questions. He has tended to retreat into the policy of saying: &ldquo;I do not know.  It is not my business.  These are independent institutions.&rdquo;  We all know this goes on.</P>
    <P>Let me make it quite clear that I am not necessarily attacking the schools.  The point which I think was made by Deputy FitzGerald is that the schools were simply pressed into a situation, in many cases, where on £25 a year they were not viable as educational units.  These schemes are accordingly necessary.  Therefore, as was pointed out very well, I thought, by Brother Aidan Beegan at a seminar some time ago, the Government are having the best of both worlds.  They are claiming the political kudos for so-called free education while, in fact, they are getting education on the cheap by throwing back upon the religious orders the obligation to service education by whatever means they can secure by their own efforts.  This is unjust to the religious orders and it is unjust to the children who are exposed to these devices.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, it is absolutely farcical to pretend that secondary education has become open to the children of the working classes when the loss of their potential earnings is so considerable. Only the other day I came across a case of a man who at great sacrifice to himself had kept his youngest daughter in school until she completed her intermediate certificate course.  After that she was instantly to leave to get a job. No leaving certificate for her.  No university for her.  She sits her inter in June.  She was 16 on 1st April so the father loses the children's allowance and the social welfare benefits even for those remaining three months.  This is a sacrifice and a blow for that man. There is an enormous disincentive for <Col N="1611" /> someone in that position to keep his children on at secondary school.</P>
    <P>I came across another case of a young person who had a corporation scholarship for £50 a year from which the school deducted £25 in lieu of fees. Is that free education?  I do not think it is.  We have got to accept that this device which was admirable as a starting point&mdash;and I agree with the late Deputy O'Malley and with Deputy Lenihan that this is what it was: a very good starting point&mdash;has not been developed.  Two or three years later it has not been developed and if this is a standard of the degree of financial commitment on the part of the Government to the development of secondary education, it will not be adequate, and every day it becomes more and more ludicrous.</P>
    <P>Another small point I should like the Minister to think about&mdash;and again I hope he will not say to me that this is not his business; I hope he will not retreat into the argument that secondary education is autonomous, as Deputy Tunney projects in the case of the universities&mdash;is the marvellous phenomenon of the entrance examination or the intelligence test or the interview for entry into secondary schools.  This again is a device which is being misused throughout the country to keep children out of what I can only define&mdash;and I can see Deputy Tunney nodding&mdash;as snob schools that want to handpick&mdash;and not always on intellectual grounds&mdash; the people they are prepared to let in. I know many children who are being turned away from secondary education. This is wrong and here I totally agree with Deputy Tunney's view of autonomy.  The State is paying increasingly for these schools.  No longer is it true, as it was 20 years ago, to say that the maintenance of our educational system costs us virtually nothing. If the State pays the piper, it has the right to call the tune.</P>
    <P>I want to turn now to the vocational schools.  I share to a very great degree Deputy Tunney's admiration for and particular interest in our vocational schools.  They are potentially, perhaps, <Col N="1612" /> the most exciting development area of our whole teaching structure.  There are one or two points I should like to make here.  The first is a complete digression which is related simply to the recent strike.  It is in order because it relates to a document which comes from the secretary of the Department of Education.  The document was dated 3rd November, which was after the vocational teachers' strike.  I need not quote the whole letter because that would only bore the House.  It notified headmasters and the chief executive officer of each vocational education committee of the fact that, under the Local Government (Superannuation) Act, the Department were not prepared to pay people for that period of time during which they had voluntarily withdrawn their services from vocational teaching.  With it was included a document for circulation to vocational teachers which read:</P>
    <P>I ... a wholetime vocational teacher in a vocational school ... declare that at all times on the days, 26th and 27th May, 1969.  I was prepared to render the full services required of me as a vocational teacher.  I would have taught and conducted classes during the whole period had that been possible. I did not assist in, co-operate in or support in any way the suspension of classes.</P>
    <P Just="Right">Signed ...</P>
    <P>Shades of Jim Larkin! Shades of William Martin Murphy! Do we really have to sink as low as that when people strike in conscience, whether rightly or wrongly? I want to ask the Minister does he accept the responsibility for the issuing of that document and does he approve of it as Government policy? I should like him to answer that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidThornlet" hpid="Dr. Thornley Dr. Thornley">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Thornley</NameTxt>
      <P>To do him justice I doubt it too.  I also deprecate the slowness in the development of comprehensive schools which seemed such an exciting phenomenon a few years ago.  In the educational reviews now periodically published in the <i>Irish Times,</i> to which Deputy FitzGerald <Col N="1613" /> correctly paid high tribute, this was brought out very clearly in articles on 24th and 25th November.  One of these articles said that the results&mdash;that is to say the results of the co-operation between the secondary and vocational schools in moving towards the comprehensive concept&mdash;had so disappointed the secretary of the Department of Education that&mdash;I understand &mdash;he wrote an angry rebuke last July to Catholic school managers accusing them of non-co-operation with State policy.  I should like to ask the Minister is that correct?</P>
      <P>If it is correct does he intend to do anything about it because I am extremely dubious about the extent of the co-operation which prevails between the traditional secondary school and the vocational school.  Here I am completely at one with Deputy Tunney.  I know of many cases where the facilities of the vocational school are made available to the pupil of the secondary school to go down the road and learn technical subjects.  I do not know nearly so many cases where parallel facilities are made available by the secondary school for the pupil to go down the road and learn Latin, or Greek, or whatever.  This should be a two-way traffic.  I am not saying there is any special beauty or merit in Latin or Greek or the traditional academic subjects as Deputy Tunney calls them.  I do not think there is, quite frankly, and my colleagues in Trinity College will not like me for saying that.  If the concept is to be really comprehensive the traffic must be two-way.</P>
      <P>These are subjects upon which I have addressed questions to the Minister, to which I have not got satisfactory answers.  For example, on 9th December, 1969, I asked the Minister the extent to which the reciprocal facilities were provided and he said&mdash; and here we go again:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While my Department does everything possible to encourage co-operation between secondary schools and vocational schools wherever such is necessary and practicable these schools are not required to furnish details to the Department of <Col N="1614" /> every instance where such co-operation takes place.</P>
    <P>The information which would be required to answer the Deputy's question is not therefore available.</P>
    <P>There seems to be very little information of a constructive kind available these days and coming to us in the Dáil from the Department.</P>
    <P>I want now to take up a point mentioned by Deputy Tunney.  I fully agree that a child may go to a vocational or technical school and get an education which is every bit as good as the one he would get in one of the 30 secondary schools which opted out of the free scheme.  I agree this is possible and I agree that the ideal situation would be one where that possibility existed in every vocational school and if these schools existed in very great numbers everywhere.  I would still ask Deputy Tunney in all conscience, if a boy goes to a vocational school, while he may get just as good an education as he would have got if he went to Glenstal or Clongowes or Blackrock, will he be as well equipped in competitive terms in the way our society is run at the moment?  Will he, without the badge of the old school tie to help him to make money, which is what our society seems to be about, be as well equipped in competitive terms?  I do not think he will be.  This is where a shot in the arm is needed from the Government to increase the emphasis upon the comprehensiveness of education and to increase the status of the vocational teacher to the point where it appropriately belongs.</P>
    <P>I want to turn now to about the most complicated subject, short of the Schleswig-Holstein Settlement, that I have ever encountered, that is, the glorious immemorable Ryan Tribunal and the present state of dissatisfaction on the part of almost every teacher at the way he is paid.  I want to try to be constructive.  I am not trying to probe any wounds.  In this phoney conflict just about everybody has been wrong in some way or another.  There have been faults on all sides.  The concept of the Ryan Tribunal, the idea of all teachers being on one basis, was perfectly correct in my opinion.  When <Col N="1615" /> secondary teachers talk about some beautiful abstract thing called &ldquo;the quality of teaching&rdquo; I do not know what they are talking about; it is indefinable. The same applies when university professors talk about &ldquo;the quality of academic teaching&rdquo;; this is also indefinable.</P>
    <P>The principle of the Ryan Tribunal is admirable and I have no hesitation in saying that I should like to see it extended to university teachers.  I have little doubt when, to their horror and consternation, they are dragged kicking and screaming into the twentieth century they will find it is applied to them.  However, the mistake made in the first instance by the Ryan Tribunal was that the whole concept of the salary range was set too low.  In particular, sufficient money was not paid in respect of allowances for additional qualifications.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Tunney that the possession of a B.A., M.A. or Ph.D. does not prove that one man is better qualified than another to be a teacher &mdash;just as the fact that one boy gets five honours in the leaving certificate does not prove he is more brilliant than a boy who did not finish his secondary school education.  However, I would say to Deputy Tunney that, fallible as these qualifications are, nothing has been invented to take their place.  When Deputy Tunney speaks about assessing the degree of contribution made by an individual teacher he is talking about a process which a Department of Education could not possibly sustain in financial terms.</P>
    <P>What the Minister, with his characteristic and extremely attractive exuberance, was trying to do was to bring about a highly desirable general revolution in the status and pay of teachers.  However, as is the wont of the present Government, he was trying to do it on the cheap and the result was that he antagonised everybody. The next mistake was made by the Minister's predecessor in the settlement concluded in March, 1969, which, while it did not give any further money to the secondary teachers, succeeded in shattering the principle of the Ryan scheme to a point where it antagonised <Col N="1616" /> everybody except the secondary teachers.  In their innocence the secondary teachers went away thinking they had won a great victory; in fact they had been bamboozled and the vocational and national teachers were furious at the breaching of the scheme.  Now the price is being paid for the sleight of hand that went into that superficially clever settlement in March, 1969.  The architects of that settlement, whether they were the then Minister or senior officials of his Department, have much to answer for by trying to be too clever by half and it has now rebounded on them.</P>
    <P>The reason I am so interested in this is that we had been doing a series of &ldquo;Seven Days&rdquo; programmes at that time and I had to digest all the data in three weeks flat.  When the secondary teachers went back thinking they had won a victory I nearly wept with amusement.  They subsequently discovered that this was not the case.  They have paid a high price and I have sympathy for them.  They have lost the responsibility posts which they might otherwise have had open to them and which would have given them status in clerical schools.  One of the provisions recommended by the Ryan Tribunal was that 50 per cent of these responsibility posts would be reserved for secondary teachers.  I know clerical school headmasters who were bitterly disappointed by that settlement which abolished the responsibility posts because they were looking forward to appointing their first lay vice-principals. That was taken away from them.</P>
    <P>We now have a system whereby&mdash; the Minister knows this and admitted it in reply to a question of mine on 4th December, 1969&mdash;responsibility posts are no longer recognised and the teachers are being paid on a seniority basis.  Perhaps something might be worked out whereby the most senior maths teacher would assume the additional burden of locking the door of the school before she left at 4 o'clock in the afternoon, but, effectively speaking, the principle of the scheme had been breached.  In this matter the Minister was wrong.</P>
    <P>I am bound to say in defence of the secondary teachers that the manner in <Col N="1617" /> which the ASTI were forced, against their will, to see their own conciliation council dissolved by ukase of the Government and they themselves forced into a common conciliation and arbitration scheme in which they constituted a minority understandably annoyed them.  This was particularly so since they sincerely believed that a verbal promise had been given them by the late Deputy O'Malley that they would not be coerced in this way.</P>
    <P>I make these remarks in defence of the secondary teachers.  The secondary teachers, in turn, are guilty of having a long tradition of snobbery, regarding themselves as superior beings to the national and vocational teachers.  They have suffered from this delusion about the quality of teaching.  Perhaps it is not a great coincidence that some of the most vocal elements in the ASTI and some who have contributed least to arriving at a satisfactory settlement have been people with the minimum qualifications, the pass B.A. and pass H.Dip in Education.  The only answer for the Minister is to spend his way out of trouble&mdash;otherwise he will have three groups of sore-headed teachers. There is no sign of this money here.</P>
    <P>Some faults lie on the side of the national teachers.  With due respect to Deputy Tunney, and meaning no criticism of teacher training colleges, one cannot equate in financial terms the rewards appropriate to the sacrifice, on the one hand, of taking a two year teacher training course and, on the other hand, taking a full four or five years university course to attain a B.A. and H.Dip. in Education.  These qualifications are necessary for secondary teaching and at the end one is still not qualified to be a national teacher. How can we speak about mobility in the profession, which was supposed to be one of the aims of the Ryan Tribunal, when this is the case?  The whole matter is an appalling mess: it was a good idea at the beginning, bull-dozed through with excessive exuberance and fouled up in the middle by clever sleight of hand in March, 1969. The whole matter has become so ravelled that it will require a very persuasive, patient and wealthy Minister of Education to buy his way out of it. I hope we have him. <Col N="1618" /> In regard to the universities one of the most regrettable aspects of the Minister's statement is his bland decision to increase university fees by 25 per cent.  I am not playing to a student gallery when I say that I consider this deplorable.  I do not think it was deplorable&mdash;and here I shall get into trouble with my colleagues in Trinity College&mdash;because it was done without consulting the university heads.  Like Deputy Tunney, I do not revere the idea of autonomous universities.  The concept of university autonomy has been abused both by those who defend it and those who attack it.  Those who defend it very often use the idea as justification for the retiral by the academic into the condition of sloth, inversion and privacy which Deputy Tunney described.  This is the academic who does not do any research, who gets out the same lecture notes every year for 50 years and then retires into the obscurity, to which he should have been committed many years before, to pot geraniums.  I admit that, used like this, the concept of university autonomy is wrong.  The concept of university autonomy has been used to defend the assumption that Latin and Greek are wonderful and indispensable to human happiness, but that thermonuclear dynamics, or engineering, or economics, or social sciences are low-class qualifications which do not belong on the university campus at all.</P>
    <P>I have said that there is something to be said on the side of the university. The university is the cockpit of truth.  There may be excesses, there may be over-exuberance, there may be follies of one kind or another, but we would be much poorer as a nation if we did not have something of Newman's philosophy surviving, because all the errors made by the young and by their teachers, costly as they may seem at times to be, justify themselves in the long run in their contribution to the purely intellectual mentality of the nation; and the nation which tries to stifle that is on the way to that situation which ultimately grew up in Hitler's Germany and Mussolini's Italy.  We do not want that here.  I would defend Deputy Tunney's right to argue that the State pays the universities and has, therefore, the right <Col N="1619" /> to say they should teach some things and should not teach other things and to say: &ldquo;You may not go on turning out barristers and doctors&rdquo;.  I defend the Deputy's right to say that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I accept that, but I would not accept the outburst of a certain Senator about a certain individual lecturer in University College, Dublin.  To my mind, that kind of approach to university autonomy is absolutely unforgivable.  While I deprecate the increase in fees, I deprecate it because of the people whom it will hit. It will hit the very people who are now availing themselves of secondary education in ever-increasing numbers.  They are coming more and more into the universities.  I find them in ever-growing numbers in my classes.  That is very welcome as compared with the Oxford rejects who were there when I was at university myself.  These people are getting in by the skin of their teeth. Very often they are not in a position to benefit from Government grants. They are the ones who will be hit hardest.  It is ludicrous to produce a situation in which there is, on the one hand, a policy of free secondary education, which can only terminate, if it works, in the production of ever-growing numbers capable of entering university, and then adopt a fiscal policy towards university fees which results in blocking the door to the university.  There is no logic in that at all.  Consider the case I mentioned of the man who, with great personal sacrifice, puts his daughter through secondary school; she gets three honours in her leaving certificate, but she does not get a grant.  She is told she cannot do agriculture in TCD unless she pays fees of £162 per year out of her own pocket.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regret very much the cutback which the Minister has made, at the behest of his colleagues no doubt, in the final Higher Education Authority request for £24 million.  That request was reported in full in the newspapers.  I quote from one which says the logic of <Col N="1620" /> free post-primary education has come home to roost.  The Higher Education Authority presents the bill.  The Minister comes in here and, with what I can only describe as absolutely staggering arrogance&mdash;not a vice I associate normally with this particular Minister&mdash; says:</P>
    <P>Members will recollect that the Higher Education Authority in a recent report estimated that £24 million would be needed to meet the capital requirements of the universities in the coming six years.  This estimate and the accommodation planned in relation to it has been very carefully examined by the special Building Unit in my Department.... I am fully satisfied that accommodation of the magnitude proposed by the Higher Education Authority can be provided at a cost not exceeding £15 million.</P>

He retreats behind the authority every time he is asked a hard question with regard to his functions where the universities are concerned, the merger and the future of technological education.  Having done that, he blandly turns around and says: &ldquo;These 16 `nits' are so bad at their sums that my boys have come up with the right answer and what the authority says can be done with £24 million can, in fact, be done with £15 million.&rdquo;  The Minister immediately undermines the credibility of the Higher Education Authority.</P>

      <P>That may be, but the next time I address a question to the Minister and he says that I will have to ask that question of the Higher Education Authority I shall give a loud horse laugh.  It seems the function of the Higher Education Authority is to present reports which, if they suit ministerial policy, are endorsed and, if they are not acceptable, are thrown in the wastepaper basket. <Col N="1621" /> This sort of cutback in university education must be taken in the context of a substantial freeze on Government spending on the universities for some considerable time.  Taking these together&mdash;the relatively static nature of the university grant, the cutback from £24,000,000 to £15,000,000 in university capital expenditure and the 25 per cent increase in fees, all one can say is that this is a sadly destructive blow to the development of university education for our people.  I say &ldquo;our people&rdquo; advisedly.  Our universities were and still are to a great extent the monopolies of the privileged classes.  This is wrong.  I find it appalling going around my constituency and seeing young people who will never get nearer to the inside of Trinity College than a No. 11 bus passing by the railings outside.  Certainly they will never get inside the college.  Again, instead of pursuing policies which will make it more difficult to get into university, we should, if we mean anything in our educational philosophy, be increasing maintenance and scholarship grants and making every effort to get these people into university.</P>
      <P>These are most of the broad points I want to raise.  As previous speakers have said, the Government have failed steadily in relation to the staff/student relationship.  If, as Deputy Tunney argues, this has contributed to malaise, gross overcrowding has also contributed to it.  This, again, is part of Government policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To get in a little plug now for my university, capital provision, as distinct from current provision, for Trinity College has been rather neglected in recent years.  I agree that the Government should encourage the teaching of theology in the universities.  Every modern Catholic theologian is convinced that the place of theology is in the existing universities.  I asked the Minister a question about this and I was blandly told that it was not his business; the Higher Education Authority were thinking about it.  When, if ever, their thinking reaches the light of day I hope there will be provision made for it.  This is part and parcel of another aspect of the inactivity of the Department over many years; I <Col N="1622" /> refer to its terror in approaching anything with religious implications.</P>
    <P>I am glad Deputy FitzGerald mentioned the Hierarchical approach to Trinity College.  The ban is now recognised as a nonsense.  Many requests have been made repeatedly to have this ban removed and these requests have invariably been turned down on the political excuse that nothing can be done to determine the Trinity College position <i>vis-á-vis</i> the Catholic Church until the Government have made a final decision on the future position of university education, but the Government cannot do that until the Higher Education Authority makes up its mind or the delegates of the two universities get together.  I suggest the position is ridiculously outdated and the Hierarchical ukase which prevents people receiving university education is a matter for the State as much as for the Church.</P>
    <P>Carrying a little further Deputy Tunney's analogy about the relationship between the State and the professors, I think the total inactivity of the State in making representations to the Church here is to be regretted.  If, with due respect to Deputy Tunney and other Deputies, I may adopt the slightly cliché-ridden argument that was recently used about corporal punishment, the well-known one, &ldquo;I had it, and look at me now.  I am all the better for it,&rdquo; may I say that as a Catholic who went to Trinity College, without suffering mortal, moral or any other kind of damage, I cannot see any reason for the ban at all.</P>
    <P>I should like to add my pleas to those of others that the Minister would now actively interest himself in the preservation of historical records.  This is something in which I am very interested and I think we are in great danger of allowing a large part of our historical legacy to disappear down cellars and such places where they are inadequately stored through no fault of the staffs of the institutions concerned. Now that we are at last reaching a point when history can be objectively written in Ireland it would be rather a pity if we allowed this material to disappear.</P>
    <P>I do not know what the merger position now is.</P>

      <P>I know.  I was very fond of that merger and the Minister knows this.  I gave his predecessor and his predecessor every possible assistance with the hope that merger would come to fruition.  I still think unrepentantly that it was a good idea for bringing the universities much more into the service of the community and I hope the Minister will stick to his guns and will not be cheated or twisted by individual pressure-interests in this matter.  If there was to be a situation where the future provision of university education&mdash;this is putting it only a little strongly&mdash;for the children of Dublin was to be decided by interhospital and inter-faculty knife fights in medicine and engineering, it would be a very bad day for Ireland.  I think it is another instance of what Deputy Tunney refers to.  Some of these chaps should have their heads knocked together very hard.  We are producing too many doctors.  I wonder if the Minister is talking to the right people and whether he might do better to talk to some of the younger people in university administration in both colleges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the new curriculum on the whole but I would make one point about it.  I asked the Minister a question about this: When the provision was made by the Department for oral assessments in modern languages in the intermediate certificate in 1969 I asked him did they take place and, if not, in what manner the 40 marks allowed for them were allotted.  He said that about one-third of the secondary schools carried out these assessments and where they were not carried out pupils were not penalised in relation to the marking.  Pressed by supplementary questions he said that a little sum had been done and that the marks had been moved up by the appropriate figure relative to 40 per cent.  The same forms asking the secondary teachers to make these oral assessments have gone out this year and, as far as I know, the secondary teachers will not do it this year either because, understandably, they want to be paid for it.  They would also prefer a situation in which they would make assessments of other <Col N="1624" /> people's pupils rather than their own and with this I fully agree.  The oral assessments in Irish in the leaving certificate are paid for.  Why not the oral assessments in modern languages in the intermediate certificate?  The situation at present is that those who take the leaving certificate in 1971 will have been following an improved curriculum geared to oral examinations and will never have had an oral examination. Something should be done about that.</P>
    <P>I should like to agree with one point Deputy Tunney made about the advance to the additional year in the leaving certificate.  This is a subject&mdash;I can see Deputy FitzGerald beginning to grin already&mdash;on which Deputy FitzGerald and myself have crossed swords over the past ten years in very strange places all over Ireland.  I think it is vitally important that the terminal examination which the great bulk of our students take at the end of their secondary education should also be the qualifying entrance examination for our universities.  If not, a further class barrier is being erected to filter secondary students before they can go to university, if they go there at all.</P>
    <P>Some of my remarks have been quite hard but may I now come back to the sympathetic stance I took at the outset. Much that the Department have done over the past ten years is worthy of credit and much that was done recently is worthy of credit.  I very much welcome the interest of the Minister and of his Parliamentary Secretary in the financing of sporting activities.  This is a very good thing. The Minister and the Department have come in for much unfair criticism.  It seems the Department of Education cannot win.  If it sits back in its chair just watching education run itself then it is accused of apathy and indifference. If it comes out from behind the Department desk and writes articles like Mr. O'Connor, it is accused of being dictatorial.  I have sympathy for the Department in this situation and I do not wholly agree with those who say that the Department should not take a formative or leading role in education because it does not possess professional educators.  I do not know what a professional educator is; I never <Col N="1625" /> met one and I do not regard myself as one.  I do not think such an animal has ever existed.  I am much happier with a dynamic, outward-looking Department of Education which knocks together the heads of clerical managers, university professors and a few other people like that, than a Department that does nothing.  My main criticism of the present attitude of the Department is that it seems to me that it is lapsing back into its quiescent ways from what I thought was going to be a potentially exciting period in Irish education.</P>
    <P>I find no cause for excitement in the Minister's speech, only cause for depression and for feeling that what is already a class system of education in many respects will become possibly more so because of these policies. Although the Minister has my sympathy he has not, in this instance, my support.  Education is the most precious commodity we have; that sounds a cliché but it is true.  All these strikes would be solved if it was recognised that, putting aside snobbery, these teachers are invaluable to us and they should be paid the rate for the job. They are filling a key role at every level in education.  Equally, it is a heritage that should be available to our children.  I think Deputy Tunney said education was a process of vocation by which one was called to be one thing or another, doctor, barrister or labourer.  My objection to our present system of education is that the direction of the vocation is established for the child long before he gets to the conclusion of his educational process. It is not a vocation that comes of his own free will but one made for him by his social ambience and the capacity or incapacity of his parents to pay.  That we have not changed and there is nothing here to suggest that we shall do so in the very near future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBegley" hpid="Mr. Begley Mr. Begley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Begley</NameTxt>
      <P>When we hear the word &ldquo;education&rdquo; today the word &ldquo;change&rdquo; immediately comes to mind and I think it is time we got rid of the straitjacket which imprisoned all the initiative of those involved in education. I welcome the introduction of the new curriculum in the primary schools. It got considerable publicity in the <Col N="1626" /> newspapers and on television but, strangely, those intimately involved did not receive a copy from the Department. The first time they saw it was when it appeared in <i>An Muinteoir Náisiúnta</i> and it is well know that 25 per cent of our teachers, including religious orders, are not members of the INTO.  It is not beyond the capacity of the Department to send a copy of the new draft curriculum to every teacher, whether religious or lay, whether in the INTO or not.</P>
      <P>This new curriculum will require considerable capital and I hope the Minister will be as generous as possible. I should like him to state the grants he will give towards it.  I appeal to him to give a special grant of £20 to every teacher teaching an infants' class.</P>
      <P>Recently, I asked the Minister why free books were not available to pupils in the entrance class and he replied that very few books were required. Something in the region of £1 is involved for such books as a catechism and Irish and English textbooks and I do not think the ratepayers would object if the money was made available for each pupil attending an entrance class. Teachers would welcome it and the Minister would see an improvement overnight.  I do not intend to spend any more time on the question of the new curriculum except to say that many teachers were bewildered that the first time they saw this new draft programme was when the booklet was issued after the last election.  If this curriculum is to be a success the Minister will have to have many courses for teachers.  I would suggest that the money he has made available for transatlantic tours for teachers should be diverted to sending teachers to Scotland instead because I am told that the new curriculum is very close to the curriculum they have in Scotland.  One teacher went so far as to say that the only difference was that there was a shamrock on the cover of the Irish and a thistle on the cover of the Scottish one.  The Minister should encourage teachers to go there and see how things are working out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of schools for retarded children is quite a problem here.  In <Col N="1627" /> Kerry we were very lucky that an order of nuns set up a school in Beaufort which has played its part in alleviating distress in Kerry and outside it.  Strangely enough there is no school as far as I can see for mentally disturbed children.  Such children are certainly a burden on their parents; when they are sent to school they cause trouble and so they are sent from pillar to post.  It is a sad reflection on our society that we have not such a school for disturbed children and an effort should be made to supply this want.</P>
    <P>One aspect of the primary school education system to which I should like to refer is the use of the word &ldquo;inspector&rdquo;.  In this day and age the word &ldquo;adviser&rdquo; would be more apt and there would be better relations between the teacher and the person concerned.  We know that a certain friction exists in regard to the visit of an inspector.  Were he to come as an adviser to eliminate the little mistakes which are being made and not come as a disciplinarian it would be much better.  Another matter to which I should like to refer is the school card on which the occupation of the parent must be inserted.  Parents feel that this will tell against the children later on.  I do not know if there is justification for this card but the parents maintain that if the father's occupation is given as &ldquo;labourer&rdquo; then later on if something is going the very fact that the word &ldquo;labourer&rdquo; appears on the card will militate against the child.  Mr. Seán MacBride brought in legislation regarding the birth certificate and reference to the father and mother was cut out and only the date on which the child was born was put on the certificate. We should stick to that system in regard to this card.  This applies particularly to adopted children.  We know that there is a new and very welcome trend in this regard but where there are illegitimate children the name of the father cannot be put down.  Such cases may be few but in the interests of that minority the parent's occupation should be omitted.</P>
    <P>In regard to the school transport system any Deputy or councillor knows how many people think that their <Col N="1628" /> children are entitled to this transport. Certainly it is very hard on some children to see empty buses passing in wet weather and they are not picked up.  It is terrible that there should be such a distinction, that if one lives two miles from the school one gets transport but if one is a mile and a half from the school he is out.  Commonsense should be used as far as this transport system is concerned.  I know that the Minister has played his part in the past in regard to specific instances but the rule should be less rigid and when the bus has empty seats there is no reason why the child who lives one and a half miles from the school should not be taken up.  As it is some children arrive at school with dry clothes while the clothes of others are very wet.  Perhaps the Minister could see a way out of this problem, particularly in mountainous districts.</P>
    <P>As far as vocational schools are concerned the Minister should reexamine the whole structure of small schools.  In Dingle vocational school we have 84 pupils and it is sad to relate that only 4 of them sat for the intermediate certificate last year.  Two of them passed and two of them failed.  It is about time that either the school be closed or all the schools in Dingle examined and amalgamated if necessary.  Certainly I would not object if the Minister did something like that. It is just a little bit ridiculous to be paying a supervisor to supervise an examination for four children.  Perhaps, the same could be said about other vocational schools around the country.</P>
    <P>I would suggest to the Minister that when the Department are providing a new school in any locality they should acquire at least two acres for sporting and recreational facilities of one sort or another.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to give students training to be teachers the same facilities as university students. If a boy attending the university is within the means test he will get more or less free education.  A boy going for teaching should be entitled to the same grant as university students.  The vast majority of boys going forward as teachers got five or six, or more, honours in the leaving certificate and <Col N="1629" /> they should not be handicapped <i>vis-à-vis</i> university students.</P>
    <P>It would seem that there is a shortage of mathematics teachers in the country at the moment.  I urge the Minister to select the cream of our students from the leaving certificate or from the training college and to sponsor them through university just as the meteorological service is doing.</P>
    <P>Rule 128 of NSR states that the Department will not enter into correspondence with teachers.  It seems rather a high-handed rule.  Many matters of a personal nature require communication between teacher and Department. Teachers are responsible people.  It is time civil servants were put in their place so far as this rule is concerned. If something important crops up, the Department should write and negotiate with the teacher.  He is there to look after the pupils.  He will know more about the matter than anybody else. The Department should be at liberty to write to the teacher whenever a teacher requires that type of communication.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision of £100,000 for sporting facilities.  I was rather concerned because national organisations get this £100,000.  Perhaps, this year, the Minister and the Department will remember the many different sporting organisations in Mayo, Cork, Kerry, Waterford and other places&mdash;little rural organisations&mdash;to whom a grant of £500 would mean so much.  In a rural community, it takes a lot of gathering to accumulate £500.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. J. Lenehan Mr. J. Lenehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lenehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it must be admitted that education and educational requirements have changed pretty rapidly in recent years.  I often wonder if the education authorities have succeeded in changing sufficiently rapidly so as to provide the type of education required by our youth of the present day.  In the past, a very limited range of subjects was taught in secondary schools, especially in western secondary schools.  When I went to secondary school in 1929 we had no choice of subjects: they were inflicted on us&mdash;Irish, English, mathematics, history, geography, Latin and Greek. There were no subjects such as science, French, Spanish, and so on, available <Col N="1630" /> to us then as are now freely available. We can see today the results of the type of teaching available in those days gone by.  I am particularly interested in western schools.</P>
      <P>I do not know to what extent schools have overcome the difficulties I have mentioned.  When a boy went into one of those secondary schools it was taken for granted that he was heading for the Church.  His parents took it for granted that, once he went there, he would never have to do a day's work.  The type of education he received was best calculated to ensure that he was most unlikely to do any type of work unless he got some kind of a profession: whether or not people in professions work is something I have never been able to discover.  It is time we got away from all that kind of thing.</P>
      <P>Some schools have not advanced very much since the time of the Druids. It is a fact that, with the standards we are led to believe obtained at the time of the Druids&mdash;if we must draw comparisons&mdash;the type of education given then was more practical than the type of education given today&mdash;and this applies to schools of alleged high standing. I must say, in favour of a great many schools, that there is a much more broadminded approach to education. I remember a time when the play of Shakespeare were heavily censored. Indeed, poor Ovid probably never escaped the blue pencil.  One of the reasons we became adepts at Latin was because we picked out the blue pencil parts and, whatever about the rest of Ovid's work, we translated those parts. Eventually the teacher tore out certain pages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Education is becoming more broadminded but, in some cases, it is not improving.  I have recently become aware that nuns have introduced their pupils to such gems of the dramatic art as <i>Big Maggie</i> and <i>The Field</i>.  No doubt, these plays have had a very elevating effect on the minds of the pupils and will enable them to write much better critiques of such outmoded plays as <i>Hamlet, The Merchant of Venice,</i> and so on.  No doubt the pupils are wondering why those gems of the dramatic art, to which they have recently been introduced, were not put <Col N="1631" /> on the curriculum for their examinations instead of what is on the curriculum.</P>
    <P>Times are changing.  I am not exactly sure that, in all cases, they are changing for the better.  It is nice to see that our teachers and educational authorities are becoming more broadminded. After I had passed my leaving certificate examination I sought entrance to a well-known commercial college in this city.  I was given a general knowledge examination paper.  One question on it was to name four modern authors. I did not know much about them at that time.  I wrote down A.J. Cronin, W.B. Yeats, Sean O'Casey and James Joyce.  The headmaster of the school was standing behind me and was very surprised to see these last two names. This was about 1936.  He asked me what did I know about O'Casey and Joyce.  Each was <i>persona non grata</i> at that time.  They were not accepted in the higher echelons of society.  I said I knew a fair amount about them and that I read their works when I had nothing else to read.  The headmaster took it for granted that I was not a Catholic, and being a non-Catholic himself, was very friendly with me from then on.  Things have changed very much.  Today anyone who admitted that he did not know all about these people would be regarded as uneducated. I knew about these writers because the professor of English in the college I attended had spoken of them in critical terms saying they were atheists and communists.  Things have changed for the better in some of our schools.  In other schools, things are static.  Science is taught in a haphazard and ineffective way in many of our vocational and secondary schools.  Standards must improve. Some of our teachers are still far behind the times and I do not know what can be done about them.  Efforts are being made to get away from ineffective nonsense which is of no value to anyone.  The sooner it disappears from the curricula of the various schools the better.</P>
    <P>In primary schools educational standards vary very much.  There does not appear to be a fixed set of standards for the pupils.  I know of a case <Col N="1632" /> where an examination was held for entrance to a vocational school and it became perfectly clear that some people leaving national school and getting no further education could not read anything except what they wrote themselves.  That is six or seven years ago and standards may have improved since then.  Some Deputy may say this is due to the fact that Irish is being taught in my area.  I say that schools in which Irish is being taught are the schools which have the highest standard of education.  When I went to secondary school I found that the pupils who came from the areas where Irish is spoken and taught in the schools were much better than those from the areas where there was no Irish.  I have never regarded Irish as having any detrimental effect on the education of the children.</P>
    <P>There is a prize known as a deontas of £10 given where Irish is the normal language of the household.  There seems to be a great deal of injustice in the distribution of this money.  The Department are not responsible for this injustice.  It has been stated by certain officials that teachers have no say in the question of the granting of this deontas.  I understand from recent inquiries that that is not so.  It is even distributed on political grounds, and not on behalf of Fianna Fáil.  If this is true, it is an absolute shame that a teacher could influence the giving of this money.  I know of people who knew very little Irish getting the grant and I know of households where the money was not given at all although Irish was the language used there.  It is unfair that the money is not paid on merit to the child alone without reference to the teachers.  In many country areas there is often serious bias and ill-feeling as between teachers and parents, and even pupils in some cases.</P>
    <P>Coming now to the question of corporal punishment, I have never heard of corporal punishment in the national schools in the west.  I have no complaints about corporal punishment there.  Most of the stories which I have heard about corporal punishment are a figment of perverted imaginations.  I have never heard of a teacher beating a child.  There is no use bringing up <Col N="1633" /> one particular isolated incident.  It is ridiculous that much of the nonsense we hear from certain people about alleged corporal punishment in schools should go unanswered.  There is no use bringing up single cases or in bringing a person into a pub, plying him with drink and getting him to say that his child was beaten.  People should be told that the children were not beaten.</P>
    <P>In the other House it was alleged that I made a statement on behalf of the teachers.  I am under no obligation to any teacher.  I believe in justice and in many cases the teachers are not getting justice.  The yellow press in this country, as in Britain, are trying to put it across that there is corporal punishment in our schools but the teachers are not in a position to defend themselves with the same kind of publicity as can be got by our smart alec gentlemen who concoct these stories. Recently, one admitted the whole thing was a fabrication from beginning to end.</P>
    <P>We have been talking about education for the youth of the country, but what about the people between the ages of 35 and 55?  They were educated at a time when the educational system did not qualify them for the type of work they have to do today.  Can anything be done to improve adult education? Very little is being done about it.</P>
    <P>With the aid of television tremendous improvement could be made in this respect.  Television would be much better employed in giving adult education courses than in reproducing many of the silly, outdated, long forgotten films which are not worth keeping one's eyes open to look at. Surely, television could be used to improve adult education?  Another thing in this respect is that school buildings, primary, secondary and vocational, are used only for minimum periods.  They could be used very effectively to improve the education of adults.  People are travelling more extensively these days and they will have to travel farther if we manage to get into Europe.  If they are not taught languages, at least they can be taught geography.  It will be a devil of a thing if we get into Europe to find that we <Col N="1634" /> have to pin labels on our people as we did in the days of the Famine.</P>
    <P>I repeat that we should not forget that the education given between 1930 and 1950 was of a type which did not fit people for the requirements of today.  The result is that a great many people who went to school in those days require further education to meet modern requirements.  Many people in those days went to secondary schools for status reasons.  I know people who spent three, four and five years in secondary schools.  They were sent there just for status reasons and they left without having learned how to read or write.  Most of them have got some common sense in the meantime and must realise how inadequate their education is.  Something should be done to improve that position.</P>
    <P>I pointed out that our school buildings are vacant for long periods each day, each week, each year.  They could be used during these periods.  I realise there is a conflict of opinion as between the vocational and secondary school authorities, but these must be ironed out so that there can be an interchange of teachers in these schools</P>
    <P>Many of these teachers are not qualified at all&mdash;they have no qualifications in the world.  There are secondary schools in which headmistresses have got only the leaving certificate, many of them without honours.  It is difficult to understand how such schools can operate successfully.  When new vocational and secondary schools are being built they should be erected as closely as possible to each other to allow for an interchange of teachers, especially in the west of Ireland where there is not the slightest hope of getting sufficient staff to operate the schools, if they are kept segregated as at present.</P>
    <P>I have often wondered what happens to the money allocated in the Estimates for such things as school books, cleaning, heating and lighting.  Though we see these figures in the Book of Estimates each year, I do not know anybody who has ever seen that money.  We should ensure that it goes to the teachers in order to provide requisites and to pay for the heating <Col N="1635" /> and cleaning of schools.  I do not see why youngsters should be held back after school to clean up, getting dust into their lungs.  There should be somebody to do this work and to keep the schools properly lighted and properly decorated.  There is nothing more conducive to turning a child into a slovenly adult than to ask him to attend at a school which has not been painted, decorated or properly cleaned. Many schools are very poorly kept and it seems as if they were not painted or decorated for years.  In recent years that has been altered but not as rapidly as we should like it to be.  It often appears as if schools have been neglected for years, waiting to be abandoned.</P>
    <P>School transport is welcomed but it could be improved at practically no cost.  Deputy Begley said that some school buses are half-empty and I agree with him.  It happens all over.  I cannot understand why one child living two miles from a school can have transport but a child 40 yards nearer must walk.  It does not make sense.  If a bus is travelling half-empty all the children should be accommodated, particularly in wet weather.  The original assessment of what are called catchment areas should be reviewed. There are places where children, even when transport is provided, will not go to certain schools.  There are areas even in the west of Ireland where not a word of Irish is spoken and there is no point in sending the children from these areas to schools where the curriculum is entirely in Irish.  They have never attended these schools but because the bus happens to be going in a certain direction they are now expected to attend there.</P>
    <P>This is particularly evident in the Mulranny area of County Mayo.  Pupils have refused to go to school there and are now paying their own fares to and from Westport because the school at Achill is not suitable for them.  In most of these cases it is only a matter of extending the bus service by about a mile.  Of course, there are local pressures from teachers and teachers' organisations in an effort to keep up the numbers on the rolls in certain <Col N="1636" /> schools but the requirements of the pupils should be considered before those of the teachers.  Such cases, of course, are isolated but they should be reconsidered at this stage so that they might be rectified.  In most areas in which there are such problems it would be very easy to have them rectified.</P>
    <P>Another small point in connection with school transport is that there appears to be some effort to replace private transport.  I do not agree with that because if the contract is taken from a private individual, it will probably mean another family for the Dún Laoghaire boat.  These people have been providing a wonderful service and CIE should not be allowed to ride roughshod over them.  Again, there are only isolated cases of such efforts.</P>
    <P>With regard to the building of national schools I must say that one of the greatest areas in which there has been neglect is in relation to the provision of recreational facilities.  In many cases these are non-existent.  It is, of course, difficult to acquire land particularly in the Erris area of my constituency, but when one sees land being sold in the west of Ireland at £1,000 an acre, it is time to take note. At any rate, every effort should be made, when purchasing land for school building, to ensure that sufficient land is provided for playing grounds and ball alleys.  If this were done not many of our young people would be running off to the dancehalls and other dens of iniquity because, in the first place, they were never given a chance to become interested in sports and recreation so that they become aimless rambling around during the day waiting for night to come when they go to the places I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>There are many old schools vacant in various parts of the country.  It appears that most of these buildings, in the past, were vested in church authorities and managers so that it seems to be impossible to acquire such buildings.  Many of these might well be used for small industries or for other purposes.  Perhaps one or two of them might be made suitable as places in which mildly handicapped children could be given tuition.  However, it <Col N="1637" /> would appear that they are left until they are blown down by the wind or until some blackguard throws stones through the windows.  Since the Department are giving such colossal grants, particularly in the west, towards the building of new schools, perhaps, it might be well if they would consider the possibilities of these old buildings in relation to adult education or some other purposes.  The Department should insist upon old schools being handed over before arrangements for new schools are finalised.</P>
    <P>A matter about which I have been concerned for some time is the question of teachers, before they can draw their salaries, having to go cap in hand to school managers to ask them to sign some document.  I wonder how Deputies would react if they had to approach some manager before they could draw their salaries.  The managerial system means nothing in this day and age.  In one diocese it might be possible to have 50 different types of management.  That makes no sense. Teachers should be able to draw their salaries without having to approach anybody.  This practice smells of British landlordism.  Those days are over and should be forgotten.</P>
    <P>In reference to the movement to discontinue examinations, I fail to see how satisfactory it would be if every teacher were allowed to mark the cards of pupils with regard to the pupils' aptitude.  If examinations are discontinued there will be no method of ascretaining the IQ of the pupils.  As I see it, there must be some kind of examination.  There could be also, of course, some assessment of the intelligence of pupils by the teachers but I would not agree with the abolition of examinations which is what seems to be intended by some teacher organisations.</P>
    <P>I mentioned earlier the question of co-operation between secondary and vocational schools.  The west of Ireland is lacking in higher educational facilities and steps should be taken to make every effort to ensure that any pupil who can benefit from higher education should be afforded that opportunity. The building of a highly complex structure in Athlone is of no use to the people of Mayo, Sligo or parts of <Col N="1638" /> Donegal or Leitrim.  Even with the latest education grant payments people in these areas are not in a position to send their children to the universities. We must remember that the education provided in secondary schools does not prepare our youth for what they will have to face in the changing world of today.  There was a time, also, when a man who obtained a BA degree, because he might have a glib tongue, could masquerade as, say, an economist but those days have gone.  In the future anybody who wishes to prove his skill will not get away with masquerading under some degree or other.</P>
    <P>I see from the Estimate that we are spending a large amount of money on the College of Art which is the famous headquarters of the hairy ainus and other anthropological oddities.  One often wonders for what purpose these people go there in the first place but there should be some way of ensuring that money granted to the College of Art is properly spent and that there is some return for it.  I see that some of it is spent on models, accessories and materials.  Certainly, there are models there but they are the fishiest models that I have ever seen.  They are more a distraction than an attraction.</P>
    <P>Much of the money spent on universities is probably also going down the drain.  If anyone goes around by Lincoln Place or College Green or, indeed, Earlsfort Terrace one can see some of the greatest oddities and weirdies.  I do not know whether it is their parents or the people of this country who are paying for them, but there should be some method of ascertaining annually whether these people are advancing educationally. If it cannot be shown that they are progressing reasonably well, I cannot see why public money should be spent on them.  In the days gone by the county councils gave scholarships to students in secondary schools and a very strict check was kept.  I wonder how strict the check is now or is there any check at all on these students? When the people see protest marches and fellows lying in the street they are under the impression that they are paying out of their own pockets for a great number of these weirdies, pseudo-aesthetes, while their own <Col N="1639" /> families are not able to avail themselves of university education.  It is hard to blame the public for feeling sore about it.  Every day I walk up the street I see minis, minis, maxies, hairy ainus, all kinds of funny fellows who have not washed their faces since they left home or in some cases since they were baptised.</P>

If people are to get free education&mdash;if there is such a thing as free education, and I doubt it; somebody is paying for it&mdash;they must toe the line, and I would ask the Minister to make them toe the line.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The field of education is one that is subject to much criticism and to many changes of wind in the matter of what policies should be introduced and the administration of policy.  I sympathise with the Minister in his task and I do believe, as other speakers have said, that there has been at times much unnecessary criticism of the Minister and of the Department. Nevertheless, we are in a very changing atmosphere so far as education is concerned, but the Department is not changing as quickly as it should.  It is dragging its feet, and I do not necessarily blame the Minister for this.  The attitude among civil servants in the Department is far too Victorian, far too staid.  I should like to see a change in the approach of the Department on many issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This may not be popular, but I am not in agreement with the merging of University College, Dublin and Trinity College, Dublin.  It will serve no purpose in the long term.  I am all for competition in the various institutions of education.  I should like to see Cork, Galway, UCD and Trinity College operating independently.  If any one <Col N="1640" /> faculty or number of faculties cannot be supported within one of them let them drop that faculty.  I am a firm believer in competition especially at university level, which should be of benefit to the general body of education.</P>
    <P>There will be an increasing number of people seeking university education, and the more faculties that are available the better.  If an independent system of universities were established it would be necessary to have a properly constituted higher education commission which would supervise such things as standards of entrance and standards of examinations in general and other administrative problems.  The high percentage of failures in the first year of university education points to something being wrong.  Whether it is a changeover from the secondary school system to the university type of education or not, I do not know, but something should be done to reduce the high percentage failure rate in the first year.</P>
    <P>In the matter of secondary education I was disappointed to note that the Minister has decided not to bring up the minimum leaving age to 15 this year.  This has been postponed until 1972 and it is unfortunate.  I believe the leaving certificate should be abolished.  A large number of our students leave school after the intermediate certificate.  The course leading to the certificate and the examination itself should be modernised and should equip children better to face the world.  There should be greater emphasis on foreign languages, French and German, and less emphasis on Latin, Greek and other such subjects. This will be necessary if the standard of education for our children is to remain competitive.</P>
    <P>The examination content and the content of the courses in secondary schools are far too cramped.  There is too much to be done in too little time and the children suffer in so far as they do not really get a mature outlook on learning, and this affects them in later life.  After the intermediate certificate there should be a pre-university type examination with a reduced number of subjects.  There should be more specialisation after the intermediate <Col N="1641" /> certificate.  This would equip people for whatever field they wanted to enter. If it is the university well and good, but there should also be facilities for people who wish to enter the professions or, indeed, to enter any trade if they think such a course will be beneficial.</P>
    <P>Recently the Minister rejected proposals for a new secondary school in Tramore, County Waterford, under the aegis of the Christian Brothers.  The Minister's rejection of the new Tramore boys' school was unfortunate because it introduced the problem of co-education. The Minister gave us to understand that he would be in favour of a secondary school based on the system of co-education. I have sympathy with the idea of co-education because I think it could be beneficial but if parents in a particular community are against co-education their wishes should be taken into account.  The bland rejection of the boys' secondary school in Tramore was wrong because the parents do not want a co-educational school, and I do not think the Department should force one on them.</P>
    <P>I agree that one- and two-teacher schools should be closed where better facilities can be provided in three-, four- and five-teacher schools.  Again, the wishes of the parents should be respected.  It was decided to close the national school in Coolnasmere, County Waterford.  While the parents want better educational facilities for their children they feel that the numbers in the Coolnasmere national school will increase during the next few years which should justify keeping the school open.  The Minister should not enforce the closing of the school when all the parents ask is that it should remain open for two more years.  The Minister's approach should be one of co-operation rather than dictation, as he will get more satisfactory results that way.</P>
    <P>The present school bus system, while very welcome in itself, is being administered in a rather rigid fashion.  It is always unfortunate for a child to see the school bus passing by, half empty, while he has a mile to walk to school. I appreciate the difficulties involved but <Col N="1642" /> a more liberal system could very easily be introduced which would have beneficial results all round.</P>
    <P>In the field of vocational education a great deal has been done but a great deal still needs to be done.  I am a member of Waterford Regional College Management Committee.  Great challenges lie ahead for such committees. I hope the Minister will not impose too many apprenticeship courses on regional technical colleges.  Greater emphasis should be placed on post-leaving certificate courses leading to technical qualifications.  I hope regional technical colleges will not be used as an excuse for not expanding vocational schools.  By placing more emphasis on technical education we will be meeting many of the requirements of our education system especially in view of our proposed entry to the EEC.  I appeal to the Minister to refrain from imposing unnecessary courses on regional technical colleges.  I am very much in favour of the technical leaving certificate as being a realistic scheme.</P>
    <P>I wonder if it was proper to introduce posts of responsibility.  I hope this will not cause dissension among the staff as to who gets what.  It will be most unfortunate if this should happen.</P>
    <P>There should be a coming together of the three teaching bodies&mdash;national, secondary and vocational as it is very important to have harmony amongst them.  It might be a good thing if courses for national teachers were based on a university degree.  I realise this would involve a change in the system, and changes are always troublesome, but if these teachers had a university degree a certain amount of the snobbishness would be removed from the argument of the other teaching bodies and this might go some way to solving the problem.  I believe national school teachers are doing a very good job in their own field but I think a smoother system could be evolved.</P>
    <P>I should like to congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary on the interest he has shown in physical education. Greater emphasis should be placed on physical education within the school curriculum.  We are too academic in <Col N="1643" /> the courses we lay down for our children. I should like to see physical education taught in every school.</P>
    <P>The provision of schools for mentally-handicapped children, I suppose, is a problem jointly for the Department of Education and the Department of Health.  More resources should be made available for the provision of both residential and day schools for mentally-handicapped children.  These children have a better chance of leading some kind of normal life by being brought into a school where they will have the opportunity of being taught something however minimal and however elementary.  The parents would appreciate such schools.</P>
    <P>In the changing environment of education the Minister has a tough task ahead of him.  Providing he does not allow the vested interests of many to hinder or prevent the changes which must come in education, we shall have an efficient and high quality educational system in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to refer at the outset to certain remarks which were made by the last Fianna Fáil speaker.  I would not normally devote a great deal of time to that speaker's remarks but there were implications in some of the things he said which I feel have to be taken up.  I shall speak as moderately as I can on this.  I am addressing myself, through you Sir, to the Minister.  There is a thin House and Deputies may not have been following attentively what the Deputy was saying but his remarks contained slurs of a quite brutal kind on the physical appearance and colour of certain people who are guests in our country.  I refer to the African and Asian students at our universities.  I do not want to labour this point but I do want to say to the Minister&mdash;and I hope I can have his attention on the point&mdash;these students are not only guests here; they have done our educational system, which sometimes comes in for harsh criticism, the honour of thinking that they can learn something from it.  I have met, in other parts of the world, many Africans in particular and Asians too who have <Col N="1644" /> been students here and who have been grateful for their treatment here as students.  They carry through the world generally a good word about Ireland and it carries weight because they are not Irish and because their experience here has been a favourable one.  I believe that the utterance which we have had from this Deputy does not reflect the views of the party opposite and I am very willing to believe that it does not.  I hope the Minister will completely close this unpleasant episode by clearly repudiating such a remark and by ensuring that there is no repetition of that kind of thing. With that, I shall leave that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy in question also said&mdash;I am not here speaking in the same way about him, I am simply discussing his arguments&mdash;that education in many schools had not advanced much since the time of the druids and indeed he exemplified that to some extent.  We do not actually know much about druidical practice in the matter of education or otherwise.  Rather little is known about the druids but one of the few things that is known about them is that they believed in punishment&mdash; corporal punishment and capital punishment.  They were very strong on those things.  I am still referring to the remarks made by two speakers this evening, they are fresh in my mind, and a contradiction appeared in the statements from these two Fianna Fáil speakers, a contradiction which is revealing. Deputy J. Lenehan said there was no corporal punishment, at least in the schools in the west, except perhaps very, very occasionally in some isolated incidents.  He described accounts of corporal punishment, even accounts given by parents, as being cock-and-bull stories, figments of perverted imaginations invented by smart alec gentlemen, the sensational yellow press and so on.  That Deputy came in here, he delivered his speech and then he went away.  He did not hear anything that came before or anything that came after.  This is unfortunate because if he had been here before he would have heard the previous Fianna Fáil speaker on this same subject of corporal punishment.  That was Deputy Tunney who made a thoughtful speech, as he always does, from many parts <Col N="1645" /> of which I learned much.  Deputy Tunney is, of course, very experienced in the field of education and can tell us a great deal.  He did not tell us that there is no corporal punishment or only an occasional incident of corporal punishment.  He said there was corporal punishment and it was rather a good thing.  He defended it.  That is a very strange state of confusion. He defended it and he said that on the whole students liked it or many students liked apparently being beaten.  In many parts of the world, to like to be beaten is a kind of perversion but apparently in some of these schools it is not and since they like being beaten you beat them.</P>
    <P>This is a subject which attracts a good deal of emotion on both sides. I do not want to add to the emotion. I do want, however, to point out that there is something wrong when one Deputy, defending the policy, says there is no corporal punishment and another Deputy from the same Party, defending the policy, says there is corporal punishment and it is a good thing.  I hope that the Minister in replying on this point will reply specifically on it and will reply as coolly as he can.  One of the strange things I have noted in this area is that people who ordinarily, like the Minister, are calm and considerate in their replies become quite overheated as I saw the Minister do in relation to questions on this matter.  The mere suggestion that it happened or that it might not be good was enough to send up the emotional temperature greatly.</P>
    <P>This is a question which is discussed in quite different ways inside and outside this Chamber.  That, in itself, is an unhealthy condition and reflects something unhealthy in the state of our society and, in particular, in our educational condition.  If one talks with ordinary people outside, people whose children are at school, one never hears any doubt expressed that beating takes place at school.  Different people have had different experiences.  Some have had unpleasant experiences, others say there is nothing much to it but, of course, it happens.  But in this House this very strange agnosticism prevails on the subject, an agnosticism which <Col N="1646" /> does not exist anywhere outside this Chamber.  So there is definitely something wrong here.  I hope that the Minister will be able to answer rationally the questions which arise about this.  How often does beating take place in our schools?  Does he know how often and if he does not know, why does he not know?  For what does it take place?  With what effect?  Is anyone trying to measure these things? Is anyone looking at it or are they putting their heads in the sands, in the case of the two speakers we heard this evening different heads in different sands?</P>
    <P>I have spent most of the last ten years abroad in countries to which our emigrants go in varying degrees.  I was concerned with education throughout this time.  My work brought me into contact with those people who are referred to as educationalists throughout the United States and the British Commonwealth.</P>

      <P>Those who are called educationalists.  I was not contradicting him as to whether or not they exist.  I met people for whom it was claimed that they belonged to this class.  Naturally I also came into contact with many Irish people, and social workers and others who worked with Irish people.  I saw something of the reputation which we have now as a nation in education.  It may be true that we are still regarded throughout the world as a land of saints.  I hope we are; I do not know.  If we are, it is most certain that we are no longer regarded as a land of scholars.  To hear of a man that he is Irish, educated in Ireland, is for many people in the world, very regrettably, to draw the inference that he is likely to be badly, spottily educated at best, and that one had better check before one has much more to do with him.  Rather woundingly to an Irish person abroad, one hears remarks of this kind in various contexts.  Most of us who have been outside the country know that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>References were made during the <Col N="1647" /> debate to the view that our primary school leavers at least may be as much as 18 months behind school leavers from other countries.  There was a time in the past when a gap like that was not too bad in the sense that all emigrants were more or less in the same boat, most of them uneducated, and mostly going into unskilled labour from which they would emerge in the second generation.  Now the gap has widened.  Educational standards are improving in the world outside this country whereas here they are, to say the least of it, not increasing fast enough to catch up.  The gap is widening and, faced with that gap, a very high proportion of our people abroad &mdash;naturally I am not speaking of all our people abroad; many of them do very well in various ways abroad&mdash;go to pieces when confronted with something for which they are not prepared. That is to say that our educational system is framing considerable numbers of people for a life of real misery, unhappiness, alcoholism, breakdown and defeat: the kind of thing that Eugene O'Neill investigated in some of his plays.</P>
    <P>I have spoken of those who leave these shores because, unlike most Deputies, for the past ten years my experience has been mainly outside this country.  We will find if and when we go into the Common Market that that situation will weigh heavily on us. One of the reasons why the French influence is so strongly felt in the Common Market is, I believe, the excellence in many ways of their educational system the summit of which is the <i>inspecteur des finances</i>.  These highly trained people at various levels spread out and, of course, we will be at the opposite end of the scale.  While the French will be at the top we will be at the bottom.</P>
    <P>As many speakers have said, neither the present Government, nor any one party, is to be blamed for this situation. It has built up over the years.  The Minister, although he is not guilty of this situation, is the man who has at the moment the very onerous responsibility for it.  Listening to this debate&mdash; and I listened to or read it all&mdash;I <Col N="1648" /> learned a great deal from a number of the speeches made, indeed from almost all of them, beginning with Deputy Garret FitzGerald's long and most informative speech from which someone like me, a returned exile, can pick up a great deal and going through many other very useful and illuminating contributions including the statement made this evening by Deputy Thornley as the spokesman of our own Party to which I have not a great deal to add.</P>
    <P>I wish I could say that I have also learned a great deal from the Minister's opening speech, but it is not quite true to say that I did.  I found it opaque. I found that the Minister did not seem, at least in his opening remarks&mdash;he may answer this debate in such a way as to close my objection completely&mdash; to take the House sufficiently into his confidence as he obviously could have done.  In the whole tone of the debate there was nothing viciously polemical about anything.  No one has been &ldquo;out to get&rdquo; the Minister.  He is, I think, quite comfortably aware of that.  He could have taken us into his confidence. He could have said what the real problems and difficulties were, instead of which he made a speech which was lacking in admissions.  One would not infer from any part of the Minister's speech that anything was wrong on the scale on which it is wrong.  A sense of urgency was lacking.</P>
    <P>I would not go so far as to say it was a complacent speech.  That would be too hard.  It reminded me of those conducted tours which people are given in certain countries where you hear all the statistics that are good and are hurried past certain closed doors.  I have been here in the gallery for debates on education in the past.  One feels that it is a debate in which peculiarly there are a number of closed doors past which one goes in a hushed manner and treading on tiptoe.  That is much less so now than it was in the past.  It is much less so in this particular debate due mainly to the intervention of Deputy FitzGerald, Deputy Thornley, Deputy Desmond, Deputy O'Connell and others.</P>
    <P>There are still areas&mdash;I want to touch on some of them in a moment &mdash;in which one has this sense of: <Col N="1649" />&ldquo;Danger; keep out.&rdquo;  This is undesirable. We are living in a democracy which ought to be open.  The Minister is responsible to this House for the whole field of education and ought to be free to discuss with us all its aspects. His reply to this debate will be the test.  He has the opportunity to impress and edify the nation&mdash;I do not think that term is too strong&mdash;if he replies fully and frankly to this debate. I hope that will be the case.  I do not want to prejudge his reply.  He has been asked many questions and it will be very interesting to hear the answers to them all.</P>
    <P>I should like to touch on a few points in the Minister's speech.  Like others, I should like to welcome the work mentioned in his speech as reported at column 1312 of the Official Report, which is supported by the Van Leer Foundation.  He said:</P>
    <P>We hope to learn some valuable lessons from this project concerning the social and educational advancement of underprivileged areas.</P>
    <P>This is a matter of great concern to my party and to the constituency which I represent and in which I live.  I realise that it would be premature to expect anything in the nature of a formal report about what has been going on here.  It is in this kind of area, it seems to me, that the Minister could give us some tentative interim indication as to where he sees this work as pointing, what he thinks can be done, and what will be done in the near future for children who need special treatment and attention.  I will not say handicapped children because that is not quite the word.  In my constituency every week I meet mothers who talk to me about problems of this kind.  It is a very big problem.</P>
    <P>In city areas there are children who require special attention, to whose needs the ordinary school is not geared. I heard the other day of a little girl of nine years who used bad language in class: she used a word, familiar to all Deputies, but one the Ceann Comhairle would not allow me to use here and which I shall not offend him in using.  This word is not infrequently used in various parts of this city and this little girl probably heard it many <Col N="1650" /> times.  However, she lacked the low cunning not to adapt the vocabulary of the street to the classroom situation as smart little boys do.  She was put out of the school and she is not getting any education.  I do not say it was merely the fact of using a bad word; as well as that she may well have been a difficult little girl &mdash;of nine years.  I could supply the Minister with the names and details of that case if he gives me any encouragement to do so and if he feels anything could be done about the matter.  I see the Minister has nodded his head and I thank him for his sympathetic response.</P>
    <P>There are a number of children in this or in an analogous case.  I met a group of very nice, normal mothers all of whom were made miserable by this problem.  I am sure the Minister knows about this and that he is trying to do what he can to meet this need. However, we would like to be taken into his confidence and to hear what is being done.</P>
    <P>In regard to the matter of schools, at column 1313, volume 245, of the Official Report dated 15th April, 1970, the Minister stated:</P>
    <P>We still have unsuitable schools, but real progress is being made towards their replacement by modern buildings.  In 1969-70 we provided over 10,000 places in new schools and over 6,500 under major improvement or enlargement schemes, that is a total of over 16,500 places in new or improved accommodation. To meet normal replacements we would need only 6,000 places per year; accordingly, we cleared part of the backlog to the extent of 10,500 places.</P>
    <P>A statistician or arithmetician of Deputy FitzGerald's calibre may be able to work out from interior evidence in this what the remaining backlog is, but it does not seem to me that the data are there.  I should like to know from the Minister the extent of the existing backlog and when he expects to have it cleared.</P>
    <P>At column 1321, volume 245, the Minister further stated:</P>
    <P>In regard to our assessment of our <Col N="1651" /> future requirements in relation to higher education I should like to stress again what I said previously in this House.  Any review of the requirements must take full cognisance of the needs of the nation. We cannot go on producing more and more graduates in some form of vacuum.  Not only must the numbers be taken into consideration but the type of graduate produced; if we go on spending more and more money on higher education, we must ensure that we secure the maximum benefit for the nation from the expenditure involved.</P>
    <P>Possibly because of my own experience while I could accept, on a certain interpretation, the language used there, nonetheless it makes me uneasy.  I was responsible for a university in conditions in which a Government was asserting very vociferously the position that &ldquo;he who paid the piper called the tune&rdquo; and the tune was to be called quite precisely.  This links up with remarks made by Deputy Tunney that the university is not entitled to special consideration and limiting the idea of university autonomy.  I agree with Deputy Tunney, and with Deputy Thornley who went some way to agreement on this, that university autonomy can be an idol of the market-place, it can be a sacred cow, and can be something that acts as a cover for many abuses as many things which, though good in themselves, can do.</P>
    <P>However, the function of university autonomy is to protect that other much-abused concept&mdash;academic freedom. Deputy Tunney asked why a university should be treated in a different way from a secondary or primary school.  It is a reasonable question to ask and I think there is a reasonable answer to it.  One of the functions of a university is the function of research, to expand the boundaries of knowledge and to call into question what stands as knowledge in the eyes of the public generally.  One of its functions is, for example, to criticise historical concepts which are embedded as facts and taught as facts in schools.  A student who studies history in a university is going to be turned inside out: he will be told that most, or at least a great many, of the <Col N="1652" /> facts he learned at secondary school are not true, are half-truths or are misleading.</P>
    <P>I do not say it exists in the Government but it is possible that we could get the type of mentality that says that the facts taught in the school textbooks are the truth and that teachers at universities are not to monkey around with those facts or disturb the minds of the young.  It might be said if you do that kind of thing you are not producing the type of graduate that is required.  I do not wish to twist the Minister's words and I do not think he meant the type of graduate in that sense.  To apply a <i>reductio ad absurdum</i> to it, you could say the Minister is devoted to the principles of the Fianna Fáil Party and the type of graduate he would like to see produced is one who would be imbued with those principles.  I am sure the Minister is telling me that he does not want that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I do not see why we should not compare things in so far as the comparisons hold elements which resemble one another, and if they hold vast elements of difference the reverse will be the case. When the Minister said that it was not a <i>reductio ad absurdum</i> of his position to say he would like to see the universities turn out a type of graduate who would be imbued with Fianna Fáil principles he was saying something very similar to what Nkrumah said.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I used to hear about the high principles of Nkrumah, too, and pragmatically it did sound much the same.  What I think questionable about a statement of that kind is that it deals tersely and, therefore, I think inadequately with issues which are, in fact, very complicated and very delicate, involving everything the State can rightly ask from the universities and the kind of autonomy the universities can functionally claim.</P>
      <P>The late Harold Laski, who was disposed, like many Deputies here, to look critically at the potentials of universities, spoke of that state of resentful coma which the universities call research. It is quite true the taxpayer should not be asked to subsidise resentful coma, however picturesque it may sometimes be.  However, there is also the fact that if the State is supporting the university and the university is not left the kind of freedom it requires to do its proper job, then the people are also being cheated.  There is a delicate, difficult balance there and I do not think it should be dealt with by three or four rather staccato sentences, the philosophy of which has not been clarified, for me at any rate, by the Minister's rather cryptic interventions just now.</P>
      <P>While paying due tribute to what Deputy FitzGerald said and what we have all learned from it, I would venture to take issue mildly with some of the things he said.  He referred to the equality of opportunity, to which, as he rightly said, we on these benches attach very great importance, but he suggested that this was in some way in conflict with high standards.</P>

      <P>I see.  I did not get the &ldquo;potentially&rdquo;.  I thought the conflict was there.  In any case, it seems to me that the system of education, to which I have already paid tribute, the French system, is one which attaches, to the great benefit of the French nation, equal importance both to the concept of equality of opportunity and high standards.  They insist that the education to which all shall have equal opportunity to accede, according to their talents, shall be an education of high standards and no other education is worth having.  I do not think we are in any fundamental disagreement on that, but simply to set out the steps is not enough; to reconcile them in practice is often a very difficult matter.</P>

      <P>We are, of course, a very long way from equality of opportunity.  That has been stressed. I do not know that it has been sufficiently stressed.  We all welcome the <Col N="1655" /> concept of the extension of free schooling, but free schooling is not yet working. The full solution cannot, of course, be found within the framework of educational change only.  Children who are badly housed and who come from seriously overcrowded homes cannot compete on anything like an equal footing with children who come from comfortable homes.  The Minister may well say that his responsibilities are limited to a particular field.  That is true, but we should, I think, stress the existence of a link between this and the other important social questions with which the country has rather lamentably failed to cope.  Even within the rather narrow limits of the Vote for the Department of Education there are things the Minister can do and I hope he will devote at least some thought to them.</P>
      <P>Talking with teachers who are in contact with children who have these problems, I have heard of one girl with an exceptionally high IQ, a near genius, who is doing quite badly in class because she is one of 15 children living in three rooms.  That child cannot do her homework and the school is not open to her in the evening.  The need of a great number of school children in this regard could be met by opening the schools in the evenings for homework.  I am not suggesting the teachers, who are already over-burdened, should be asked to take this on and supervise.  That would be too much to ask, but there are youth club organisations and social workers who would be available for this kind of work.  I am thinking of the young people Deputy FitzGerald mentioned, who are helping children in need of special attention under the auspices of the Irish Transport and General Workers Union in Liberty Hall.  There is this reserve which wants to help and the desire of these voluntary workers to help is not being adequately met.  We complain about what we regard as undesirable manifestations of youth, but here we see a most desirable manifestation, the will to help others and the desire to devote time and energy to doing so.  We do not encourage that enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1656" /> Another point on which I think Deputy FitzGerald tended a little towards complacency was when he compared our position with that in the lamentable land of Britain, where class distinctions are symbolised by accents, and that could not happen here.  I am not quoting the Deputy verbatim.  On the whole, I think, it is happening here. It is complicated by other factors, but it is happening in the cities.  It may as yet be unknown outside the cities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>My point was that we do not have the clearcut differences in class related to different accents.  We will have gradations in systems until the new system is introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that as far as city life is concerned it does exist, but it did not strike me personally as being quite so large as the Deputy thought.  It seems to me to be narrowing due to factors in addition to the one he discerned.</P>
      <P>He then referred to the role of the Church in education.  This is also a matter which sometimes gives rise to emotion and a state of oratorical ellipsis in which we do not always directly say what we mean.  I think this is not very healthy.  The role of the Church in education is very obviously of tremendous importance.  In the past, of course, when no help was forth-coming from the State at all, the Church carried, in most difficult circumstances, the whole burden and a sense of respect growing up around and in this situation has led to extreme and unhealthy sensitivity to criticism.  Until very recently, and still, I think, to a great extent, if you were to criticise any aspect of the conduct by the clergy of educational affairs people were liable to become quite angry and impute to you anti-Christian motives, motives of anything rather than concern with how children are educated. This also affected the controversy about corporal punishment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Quite often in certain interventions made in this area both in regard to education and other aspects of life, such as adoption, one gets ministerial signals which constitute a sort of warning-off that you are approaching forbidden ground or references to stone walls and <Col N="1657" /> so on, none of which is very helpful. I stressed the concept of responsibility previously and responsibility, as I also stressed, is not the same as guilt. Responsibility means that you are the person who must answer for how things are.  If, for example, a number of national schools are in bad shape then the Minister must answer for that and say why they are not being put in better shape.  I do not mean this in respect only of bricks and mortar; I mean it also in respect of how they are conducted in regard to matters which are under the control of the school managers.</P>
    <P>If a school manager is not doing his job&mdash;and some school managers are not doing their job; this is a matter of common knowledge; it has been referred to in the debate with greater openness than ever before, I think&mdash; I hope the Minister can give a good answer on it.  I agree with other Deputies that in many cases school managers are doing their job very well and that the schools are making progress.  I know of one national school near my area, not in my constituency, Baldoyle NS, and from meeting a number of children attending it I know it is doing a first-rate job.  If other schools were up to this level we would have no cause for complaint but it is clear from the gap which exists that this is not always the case.  I know many schools that I shall not name that are suffering from serious conditions of neglect due to the age or preoccupation with other matters ultimately of the manager who has allowed a situation to develop which should not have developed and has allowed the educational opportunities of the children to be stifled.  I do not think the Minister in relation to that should be able to say or imply that it is not his responsibility, that if somebody else will not remove an incompetent manager he cannot do it.</P>
    <P>Either our system of education is fully amenable to the democratic process through this Dáil and the responsible Minister or it is not; and if it is not at present so amenable, it is our duty in this House to insist that it be so.  This debate has helped to throw open a window that I hope the Minister <Col N="1658" /> in his reply will open a little further. If the products of our schools are behind, as seems to be generally agreed, the Minister is the person now responsible for that and he is the person who must answer for it.  He has to say fully and frankly why they are behind.  He must answer the question: &ldquo;Does he expect to close the gap and, if so, when?&rdquo; These are the big questions not answered in the Minister's opening speech.  I trust they will be answered, along with all the other questions asked, in his reply and I hope he will take adequate time for his reply because those concerned with this matter are very anxious to hear him.</P>
    <P>I should also like to refer to what has been termed religious apartheid in the schools, the fact that our children are taught separately depending on what religion they belong to.  I am aware that this is not a problem that can be solved overnight.  In the past we have tried to look aside from the question of religious division in this country and to say that the division is entirely created and maintained by British Imperialism.  Any thoughtful and serious person concerned with modern development can hardly miss the fact that the division is a real one and one that runs along religious lines. We shall not make any serious attempt to heal it, to end the disunion of our people, until both north and south, Catholics and Protestants, are being taught together in the same schools.</P>
    <P>I realise that there are very serious obstacles at present, which are presumably beyond the Minister's power to overcome, in that connection.  I cannot believe those obstacles will always remain. It seems to me to be in full accord with what I understand to be ecumenical principles that children should be so taught and I hope the Minister will be able to give at least a glimmer of light towards the possibility of progress in that direction.  The merger was mentioned in this context and many of us would welcome the merger because, mainly, of the great idea that it did point in this direction. Now, the merger seems to be fading away like Lewis Carroll's boojum.  It is not being abolished like so many <Col N="1659" /> other things; it just fades further and further away.  I can understand that there are serious difficulties about the merger.  Like Deputy Thornley I personally regret&mdash;I admit I am not representative of university opinion on the matter&mdash;that this should be so.  I hope that even if the Government recedes from this particular idea it will at least retain as a goal the idea of breaking down apartheid in the schools and retain the objective that Irish children will attend school without being divided on class or sectarian lines but will all be treated as children of the same nation.</P>
    <P>Deputy FitzGerald raised some important questions about the effects of the teaching of Irish in the schools. I do not see that we can get away even from what is called compulsory Irish.  Our whole education in the past in all areas has been so based on the idea of compulsion that a subject which is not regarded as compulsory will not be taken seriously by either students or teachers.  Nonetheless, it is clear that the teaching of Irish in schools should have meant longer school hours, a longer school period, or it meant an encroachment on the teaching of other subjects.  The Minister should indicate where he intends going on this.  Does he feel that it requires a sacrifice and if so what sort of sacrifice is it to be?  Is it to be a sacrifice of standards in other subjects or the sacrifice implied by longer school days?  I do not fully agree with the points made by Deputy FitzGerald but the questions are ones that require serious answer.</P>
    <P>There are just two or three minor points I should like to make in conclusion. One concerns teacher training courses.  From meeting people who have been through these courses I found that many of them feel that having spent many years on academic training they are getting more academic training in their teacher training courses, a further academic-historical presentation paralleled with simply being let loose on classes, pushed in at the deep end without any training in how to handle a class.  This seems <Col N="1660" /> to differ from practice outside the country, certainly in America and England where they concentrate much more on the psychology of the classroom and the techniques which are effective there rather than on the academic perspective of the task.</P>
    <P>I feel I am reflecting the views of many Deputies when I say that I would like to pay tribute to the work of the National Gallery and to the use the director has made of the resources available to him, to the lectures being given there and also to the useful idea, practised in other countries, of setting up a good restaurant there. This means that people go through the gallery and use it even when they are having quite mundane trains of thought which may be checked by seeing a picture which in some respects is good.  The rather splendid appearance of the National Gallery which is a credit to our city contrasts with another important centre and one which like other Deputies I use a great deal.  The National Library to anyone who frequents it does appear to be very much of a Cinderella.  I do not by any means mean in respect of the director or staff of the library to whom I would also pay tribute. Not only do I know their worth and helpfulness to the reading public from direct experience but I have had contact with people in other countries who are extremely grateful for the help they have been given in the library.  It is an important centre of learning for which the Minister is responsible and at present it is being starved of funds.  I hope the Minister may be able to give us some hope in that area also.</P>

      <P>I should like to say, with all respect to the last speaker, that I was very near the Deputy who spoke before him, and to whom he referred, and I think he misunderstood him.  The Deputy, although he takes a certain liberty with the English language, spoke about the unwashed, the hairy and the dirty and such people but I do not think he made any reference to foreign students.

      <P>I hope the Deputy is correct but I did interrupt with the words &ldquo;shame, that is a racist remark&rdquo; and he did not react to disclaim it as a racist remark.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GusHealy" hpid="Mr. Healy Mr. Healy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
      <P>With respect, at that time he was carried away with what he was talking about and I think he did not understand exactly what the interruption was about.  I am referring to this matter because I realise how keenly Deputy O'Brien feels about this matter.  I have not a great deal to say on this Estimate but I think I can give the ordinary man's point of view on this Estimate.  I must refer to a subject which raises the hackles and increases blood pressure and on which I can speak very calmly, the question of corporal punishment.  One of the things which confuses people when they speak about corporal punishment is that there is a variety of meanings involved.  The previous speaker spoke about being beaten up and being beaten.  I cannot speak about girls' schools or any school except the one which I attended.  I am a product of those awful people, the Christian Brothers.  We were punished with a leather which we got on the palm of the hand but I never felt that it did any physical harm.  Many people today are perturbed that they find it impossible to control their children at home.  They feel that when they were young the teacher undertook many of the duties of the parents and chastised and disciplined the children when necessary.  Today there is a tendency towards the feeling that that should not happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not go all the way with those who feel that there should be no such thing as physical correction.  Adults have to be corrected.  Teachers are not only teachers of education but they are in the position of the parents.  The teachers are dealing with the children at a time when their characters are being formed.  Surely the end product of education is to bring to the community a strong, reliant upright character.  We cannot lose ourselves with the few who will become research workers and professional people all over the world; we must think of the people who will populate this country, the people who will take on the everyday <Col N="1662" /> tasks on the land and in business. What do we want?  Do we want the next generation to be a generation of hippies?  Have those nations which are supposed to have so much better educational systems than ours no problems with their youth?  Have they no drug addiction or alcoholism or any of the evils facing youth all over the world?  We are fortunate that our young people are as good as they are.  We should do everything possible to ensure that that standard is maintained.</P>
    <P>Sufficient stress has not been laid on physical education&mdash;a healthy mind in a healthy body.  I join with other Deputies in paying tribute to the Department for the money they are making available in this regard.  I am particularly interested in swimming which should be included on the school curriculum.  Many field games are not suited for all growing children but there are very few children in any state of health for whom swimming would not be useful and beneficial.  It has not been sufficiently stressed that this will also help them in their education. Any child who has to prepare for a swimming contest or any other athletic contest knows that he will not be successful unless he prepares strenuously, make sacrifices and practises self-denial, in other words does many of the things that will help to form character. That boy or girl facing examinations will have that mentality.  They will know they cannot expect to pass the examination unless they prepare thoroughly for it.  Any money spent in this direction is money well invested in the physical and mental education of the young person.</P>
    <P>Much too much has been made of corporal punishment in the sense that people are led to believe that it is a brutal beating-up.  I do not know how a teacher can face a class of high spirited boys between 10 and 14 years of age if he cannot, when the occasion demands it, put them in the line and administer a slap with the leather to those who are disobedient.  Should all teachers have a degree in psychology to enable them to decide the best approach to each individual pupil?</P>

      <P>Over 14 years.  Vocational students attending day classes are mostly over 14 years of age.  Up to recent times, the child who came to the vocational school was from the poorer family but such children were better disciplined, very often, than the children in the secondary schools.  I do not want to see children punished unnecessarily.  I do not believe our teachers would do such a thing.  I do not believe our teachers&mdash;lay or religious&mdash;go out particularly to punish any child.  Deputy Tunney may have a point when he said a child welcomes physical punishment rather than being treated with contempt by the teacher or being slighted or hurt by the teacher or being treated sarcastically by him for the rest of the week.  The teacher's life is not a happy one at present. Children are now using language to the teachers which would not be tolerated in my time.  I do not believe that will result in better men and women.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe there should be a system of inspection right through education including university level.  Inspectors visit primary and secondary schools not as spies for the Department but as friends of the teachers, to keep them in line with modern thinking and to see that their job is done successfully by giving them hints to make it as easy as possible for them.  To some extent, that could be done in university education also.  I come from a university city.  Although I am an outsider I hear complaints from students and parents that all is not as it should be in the teaching or in the taking of the courses at the university.  Some of the staff turn up irregularly.  I suppose that in many schools of long standing, some of the staff could take the same notes and use them over and over again with the minimum amount of effort to themselves.  I am not blaming anybody; it is a kind of weakness in human nature.  However, visits by inspectors or supervision of some kind is very salutary and I see no reason <Col N="1664" /> why it should not be done in universities as well as in secondary and primary schools.</P>
    <P>I want to compliment the Department on its work in recent years for the mentally handicapped.  We have had many problems in this country and it is only recently that we have been able to pay any kind of attention to the physically and mentally handicapped. However, a good deal has been achieved in this respect in recent years.</P>
    <P>Between 1960-61 and 1970-71 the Vote for the Department of Education has increased from £17,800,000 to £69 million.  There is a proportionate increase in the amount of money for school buildings.  It is essential that the money be spent to the best advantage. We are not a tremendously wealthy country and we must get the best possible value for any money we spend.</P>
    <P>I agree wholeheartedly with Deputy Cruise-O'Brien's remarks about voluntary workers or part-time workers to look after children after regular school hours&mdash;children who have no opportunity of doing homework and who have no place to stay.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister that, whatever economies may be suggested, playing fields and swimming pools are as essential as other aspects of education and to devote some of the money in the year ahead, as in the past year, for this important aspect of education.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>The Estimate for the Department of Education is one of the most important Estimates that come before this House.  Unfortunately, for a long number of years, sufficient emphasis was not placed on the importance of education.  There has always been an interest in it but unfortunately not always as much interest as is really necessary.  I am glad to note that greater emphasis is placed on this important aspect of the life of our people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The education of our children presents one of the greatest challenges of our times.  Very heavy obligations rest on the Department of Education. If we do not provide our youth with a suitable education, with the proper courses and proper interests, they will <Col N="1665" /> not be in a position to face the challenge and competition of the times that lie ahead of them.  Therefore, the right decisions must be taken in the Department so that we can channel all our efforts and all our resources in the right direction in the field of education.</P>
    <P>One problem faces the Department of Education&mdash;and it is a problem which is not rectifying itself.  Although it is quite dangerous for a politician to raise the subject, there are some things which must be said and therefore I propose to say them.  With regard to the various pay claims and disputes on pay which have arisen, I feel that too much time has been spent on these matters.  The three segments of teachers &mdash;national, secondary and vocational teachers&mdash;have allowed themselves to deviate from pooling their resources and getting together to work for the benefit of the children.  Mr. O'Dea, President of the Association of Secondary Teachers, commented in an interview on the fact that salary disputes had taken up the time of the association over the past two years to the detriment of the amount of time available for strictly educational matters. Mr. O'Dea, in saying this, was admitting that much time was spent discussing pay disputes by the secondary teachers.  I am sure this was also the case with regard to the national and vocational teachers.</P>
    <P>There is little that the Minister can do in this matter.  If the Minister makes one move, not alone may he cause one strike but two strikes may occur.  By settling one dispute the Minister may lead to another.  Various efforts have been made to reach a common settlement. So far no satisfactory settlement has been reached.  The Ryan Tribunal, when they reported, offered some hope. This report was not acceptable to the secondary teachers at the time.  In fairness to the secondary teachers I must say that it was not obligatory on them to accept the findings of the Ryan Tribunal.  The report contained items the secondary teachers could not agree to.</P>
    <P>This places the Minister in an almost impossible position.  The Minister asked the teachers to try to come to a satisfactory arrangement.  I agree with <Col N="1666" /> the Minister.  For the benefit of the children of this country and of the future generations, I hope the teachers will listen to the appeal made by the Minister.  I hope some satisfactory arrangement can be agreed upon.  The three groups of teachers should come together.  The Department should try to give a lead in some way in order to bring about a settlement.  Perhaps some person in the educational or industrial field could head a meeting of the representatives of the three groups in order to arrive at a satisfactory conclusion. Unless this happens we will all suffer.  The teachers themselves will also suffer.</P>
    <P>It is not too long since I left the university.  I remember that the teachers in the national school and the secondary school which I attended were people I greatly admired.  The pupils attending a school look to the teacher for inspiration and guidance. They look to him for tolerance and for qualities of leadership and fair-mindedness. A teacher is a person whom I hope every child would look up to.  A teacher is someone a child should admire.  If we continue having these disputes the pupils will not be able to recognise the qualities I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>I must be fair to the teachers as well.  Many of them are married with families.  They must maintain their station in life and their status.  If these disputes continue the pupils will lose much of their faith in the teachers. Many of the pupils will leave school shortly and enter various businesses, professions and jobs.  If, before an important examination, there was a strike and the pupils were faced with the situation where they had no teachers, they might take a very poor view of the situation.  The pupils may feel disappointed and let down.  When employed themselves, they in their turn may look for increases and may leave their employers in a very awkward situation.</P>
    <P>The teachers should remember that theirs is a very important station in life.  We must ensure that all the pupils attending our schools will continue to have respect for their teachers' qualities. I would request the teachers to <Col N="1667" /> get together and to try to arrive at a satisfactory conclusion in their discussions. It would be in the interests of the teaching profession, the pupils and the Department.</P>
    <P>I come now to that part of the Minister's speech which deals with regional technical colleges.  I welcome the introduction of these colleges.  In 1964 there was an OECD Report on the training of technicians.  There was a further publication dealing with investment in education.  That was produced in 1965.  These are both excellent reports.  The report on the training of technicians in Ireland was especially necessary.  These reports highlighted the great need for a greater concentration on technical education.</P>
    <P>In <i>Investment in Education</i> there is reference to the necessity to train technicians. At page 347, paragraph 12, it is stated:</P>
    <P>In the field of technical education, an immediate and pressing problem is the provision of suitable courses for very small and scattered numbers of apprentices in certain trades.  We understand that An Cheárd Chomhairle (The National Apprenticeship Board) are devising means of overcoming the problems involved, but similar difficulties exist in regard to technicians.  In these areas also there are problems of training and qualification. There would seem to be a need for the establishment of nationally recognised certificates and diplomas and the strengthening and further development on a continuing basis of co-operation with industry.</P>
    <P>I hope that this will lead to these technical colleges providing such training and certificates.  In the volume <i>Training of Technicians</i>, there is mention of the necessity for technicians in Irish industry. Paragraph 1 states:</P>
    <P>The establishment of a manufacturing industry involves the co-operation of experts in finance, marketing, management, engineering and the other applied sciences.  Many questions have to be posed and answered if the project is to succeed.  Of these none is more important than the question of adequate personnel at all levels.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1668" /> If industry is to be established at all it is essential that an adequate labour force be available.  There is at present in Ireland no dearth of <i>entrepreneurs;</i> neither is there a lack of advisers on economic, marketing and technical problems.  Perhaps a serious obstacle to industrial expansion is the lack of a reserve of personnel suitably educated and trained so that they can play their parts in the development, management and operation of different kinds of industry.</P>
    <P>I believe every Member of the House is in agreement with the establishment of the technical colleges which, I hope, will help to remedy a lot of the imbalance in our educational system.  Up to recently, successful governments since the foundation of the State have left the development of post-primary education to religious orders, with one exception which I will return to in a moment.  In general, it devolved on our religious orders to provide post-primary education.  They did an excellent job, a tremendous amount of wonderful work.  All of us are willing to express our thanks to them, to the various people in the various orders, Christian Brothers, Patrician Brothers, Presentation Brothers and Sisters, priests and others.</P>
    <P>However, the education they provided was more or less on classical lines, the sciences not being catered for as much as we would have hoped. Various subjects related to industry were not dealt with as they might have been at the time.  This, as I have said, led to an imbalance because only the academic side was developed.</P>
    <P>The exception was the passing of the Vocational Education Act in 1930.  It is on this system that our present vocational education is based.  Numerous pupils who attended courses in vocational schools in the past found there were not adequate job opportunities, that they were not able to obtain jobs in the spheres for which they were educated.  As well, courses in vocational schools were limited to a certain extent.  Nowadays, the vocational schools provide the classes which will give pupils intermediate and leaving certificates.  I am certain these schools will expand further.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1669" /> The Department have the idea of changing the leaving certificate in certain ways.  I think it is true to say that five separate group subjects are to be introduced.  This will give pupils attending vocational schools a much wider field of study.  There will be a leaving certificate on the lines of languages, of science, of applied science, of business studies and of social studies.  Following from this, the regional colleges are now providing pupils with courses something on the lines of a university.  Vocational schools have given the pupils who obtain any of these certificates, especially science and applied science, courses which will enable pupils to go on to the regional colleges.</P>
    <P>In our primary schools, our vocational schools, our secondary schools and our vocational colleges we have the bones of an excellent education system and I believe this system will be of tremendous benefit.  There is one point, however, I should like to mention at this stage.  It is the manner in which secondary and vocational schools operate.  I would hope that both of these arms of our post-primary education system would work together as fully as possible.  In the area in which I live I am pleased to say that vocational and secondary schools work hand in hand in a very good atmosphere. This is something I hope to see all over the country because unless and until our educational units function together the person who will suffer most will be the child.</P>
    <P>Nowadays, with so much emphasis in this country on industry, the arrival of the regional college is of special importance. One of the first things the Department will have to do, which industry will have to do, which every person connected with education will have to do, is to make parents aware of what technical education has to offer.  Unfortunately, many parents have a complex about their children following technical education.</P>
    <P>Attitudes such as this are difficult to change.  Because of the ideas of parents in regard to employment in industry the economic development of this country has suffered to some extent. However, the right help and example <Col N="1670" /> from the Departments will change these attitudes.  In particular, the Departments of Education, Labour and Industry and Commerce can help in this way.</P>
    <P>Our industrialists, too, must come to the forefront in this matter and help to make the people aware of the types of jobs that can be provided in industry. For far too long many of our people have endured poor working conditions in jobs which offered very few openings. They may have had the doubtful privilege of wearing a white collar but many of them would have been better off wearing a white coat in industry. This reluctance on the part of parents to allow their children to work in industry has led to square pegs filling round holes.  Such a situation, of course, also arises when boys and girls do not follow the courses for which they are best suited.  Perhaps the regional colleges will help in remedying this.</P>
    <P>In his speech, the Minister referred to adult education.  I am sorry that he did not deal as fully with this subject as I would have wished because this is a very important matter.  Children who leave school at an early age can benefit greatly from adult education courses. It is important, therefore, that this opportunity is afforded to people who may wish to develop themselves further and to advance in their position.  I hope the Minister will refer again to this subject when he is concluding the debate.</P>
    <P>I note that a sum of £100,000 has been voted for national youth and sporting organisations.  I am pleased that we now have two schools in the country where girls can be trained to become teachers of physical education. However, we must also provide such schools for boys who may wish to train. I understand that about 20 boys have gone from here to England to become teachers of physical education but there should be a school here in which they could be trained.  While we are on this subject, I should like to pay tribute to the many teachers, both vocational and secondary, who give so much of their time after school hours in helping to train boys and girls for various competitions and sporting events.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1671" /> There are a number of other matters which I wish to raise and on which I hope the Minister will comment when he is concluding.  One of these matters concerns Shinrone National School, which is in the parish I come from. This school was built in 1887 and it looks every day of its age.  Perhaps the Minister would let me know what is the position in regard to this particular school.  I attended the school myself and I left it about 15 years ago.  The reverend manager has made some improvements in the toilet accommodation and otherwise but it is still in bad condition.  The manager of the school collected the necessary funds a few years ago to build a new school but I do not know what has happened.  As far as I am aware the matter is with the Department and I understand they are making some investigation.  I hope there will be a new school in this area in the very near future.</P>
    <P>It is intended to build a vocational school in Kilcormac.  I understand this has been sanctioned by the Department, but I do not know what stage has been reached.  There are a large number of potential pupils in this area and there is need for a school.  I trust building will commence shortly.</P>
    <P>I raised a number of points with the Department in regard to school transport. I started writing to the Department in this connection on 29th September last.  A child was involved in an accident while walking home from school.  She lives over three and a half miles from the school.  One of this child's legs was injured in the accident and she also suffers from a weak chest. I wrote again to the Department on 20th October and got a reply dated 24th October.  I sent a further letter in February and got another reply from the Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Molloy, but I have heard nothing since.  I have seven or eight cases of this kind about which I was in communication with the Department before Christmas.  I realise the Department have a great deal of work in hands and such items as these are not given top priority; in fact it appears as if they are given very little priority.  However, this involves young children who have <Col N="1672" /> to walk to school and who for health reasons should have their cases treated urgently.  I do not know what is the best way to approach this.  I hope that if I write again I shall get a definite reply.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be only too happy to ask the parents to give the necessary certificate.  One further matter I wish to raise is the appointment of principal teachers in national schools of four or more teachers.  Apparently the position is that the Department apply to the manager for a list of suitable applicants before an appointment is made.  They then make a short list of the applicants and return it to the manager from which list the appointment is made.  While there is much justification at times for this method of appointment I am informed that if a teacher is not on the list the Department sends back to the manager he cannot be appointed.  In such circumstances a teacher might feel he was being victimised for various reasons. He might think it was political or he might feel that the decision of the Department was wrong.  Therefore, I would hope that if a teacher is not put on this list he would be given reasons why and that the Department would provide evidence as to why a teacher has been appointed in a particular case.  This may seem a small matter but it could lead to abuse.  I am not saying the Department would ever allow this to happen but in order to ensure that abuses would not follow I would hope reasons would be given as to why a teacher is not deemed suitable for appointment to a particular school.  This is something to which I hope the Minister will refer in his reply.</P>

Gó mór mhór, taithníonn sé liom go bhfuil níos mó airgid ar fáil i mbliana ná mar a bhí anuraidh le h-aghaidh oideachais.</P>
      <P>It is with great temerity I enter this highly controversial field of education to make this modest and brief contribution. Let me hasten to add that I am not an educationalist but for many years I have had association with a very important post-primary sector, namely, vocational and technical education. Therefore, I welcome the indications in the Minister's speech that the expansion of vocational and technical education will be continued.  It was a great consolation for the many who labour in this field to hear the Minister express his gratitude in this way:</P>
      <P>I am grateful to them&mdash;&mdash; that is the committees and their staffs</P>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;for the excellent work they have done and are doing.</P>
      <P>This praise comes at an opportune time because in recent months people who should know better have been severely and unfairly criticising vocational education committees.  I recently heard a lady boast on a television programme that she had played a major role in the dissolution of a very important Vocational Education Committee.  I find it very difficult to understand this type of mentality.  Do these people not realise the important and vital role that vocational education and technical instruction have played in the making and shaping of modern Ireland?  Do these people not realise that the Vocational Education Act, 1930, was a definite and undoubted success?  Do these people not realise that for many years after this Act had been placed on the Statute Book this new branch of post-primary education had to fight a long and weary battle against tremendous odds and in adverse circumstances, without buildings, equipment, teachers and that vital commodity &ldquo;goodwill&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The success of the 1930 Act was, in my opinion, primarily due to the committee system of local democracy, local involvement and local committedness. <Col N="1674" /> The committee system brought together a cross-section of the community who had experience in the fields of culture, industry, education and commerce.  These committees placed the welfare of the students above all things not merely during their school-going years but also during their training and apprenticeship period.  The vocational school in Limerick city is now a third level institute catering for post-leaving certificate students.</P>
    <P>There is a great imbalance between technical and academic education.  I understand the ratio is three academic students to one technical student whereas in Europe the ratio is one academic to three technical.  This imbalance is putting more academic misfits into an already overcrowded and saturated market on one hand and on the other hand tends to accelerate the rate of emigration of certain types of graduates.  The irony is that we are having to import technologists and higher technicians to manage our growing industrial arm.</P>
    <P>I should not like to be a prophet of doom and gloom but I feel free post-primary education will accelerate this imbalance and in two years time when the first results of free post-primary education are available there will be a student explosion with consequent widespread frustration.  I have no doubt this will correct itself in time but it will be done at a cost which the country can ill afford.  I realise the comprehensive concept has been introduced to correct this imbalance.</P>
    <P>I heard a Deputy the other day criticising the Government for the slow progress they have made in the erection of comprehensive schools.  Comprehensive schools are being built where post-primary education is not available in remote parts of the country and in the developing city suburbs.  It should be possible to provide comprehensive education for every post-primary student without undertaking the impossible task, at enormous expense, of erecting a comprehensive school in each area.  In every fair-sized town there is a post-primary complex: the secondary school on one side and the vocational school on the other. With proper pooling of resources, <Col N="1675" /> buildings, equipment and teachers it should be possible to provide comprehensive education for every post-primary student.  This will require a great deal of goodwill and mutual trust but I know that quietly and silently a revolution is already taking place.</P>
    <P>I spent four hours in my native village today at a meeting in connection with post-primary education.  It has been decided, with the Minister's permission, to integrate the vocational school and the convent secondary school into a comprehensive, co-educational school on the site of the convent school at a cost of £40,000.  I hope this sort of arrangement will be made in other parts of the country.  I welcome the entry of the Jesuit Order in Limerick into the field of comprehensive education. I feel sure that the Jesuits, who have a long and illustrious history in academic education, will make a success of comprehensive education, and I hope all religious orders will follow suit.</P>
    <P>When one speaks about comprehensive education and the correction of this imbalance, automatically the question of vocational guidance arises.  If I understand it correctly this must be a systematic, continuing process, starting almost from infant stages of the early school-going years of the child.  I commend the Department of Education for the record system at primary school level, going right into the post-primary school level, graduating to the cumulative record card, with the first decision point at intermediate certificate level, perhaps the second decision point at leaving certificate level, depending on the qualities of the child and, of course, more important still, the set-up in the home and whether the parents can or cannot afford further education.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the view of the experts on career guidance.  The reasons why a careers counsellor cannot be a teacher are obvious.  However, the experts fail to tell us how we will get over the magnitude of this problem&mdash;first, in servicing every post-primary school in the country, secondly, in the length of the training course, which will be a post-graduate training course and, thirdly, their subsequent economic <Col N="1676" /> deployment.  I appreciate the Department's viewpoint.  They are providing some form of vocational career guidance with the record card and, again, with the short course and the appointment of guidance teachers.  I can speak with fairly intimate knowledge of this problem.  We in Limerick are the only county vocational education committee to have the services of a full-time careers counsellor. I can appreciate this man's enormous difficulty in trying to service small schools over long distances.  The job is almost impossible.</P>
    <P>When one speaks of vocational school students and career guidance one automatically thinks of the regional technical colleges.  My friend Deputy Enright spoke on that subject.  Heretofore, the vocational system was an educational <i>cul-de-sac</i> where the students graduated to group certificate level.  For the vast majority there was nothing further. Higher technical education was non-existent outside the city of Dublin and, perhaps, to a lesser extent, Cork and Limerick.  These technical colleges are long overdue.  I pray and trust that they will be a success.  The availability of higher technical education was the greatest revolution in the field of education since the foundation of the State. I know that from these colleges will emerge students who will be highly skilled in the practical and highly qualified in the theoretical aspects, students who will make ideal trainee material to man and manage our growing industrial arm.</P>
    <P>In regard to the regional colleges I must make references to the rather peculiar attitude of the NUI in not recognising certain subjects in groups 3 and 4 of the leaving certificate for matriculation purposes.  These were the groups that were most suited to vocational school students.  To the ordinary man in the street, it does not add up that these should not be recognised.  I appreciate that universities must have academic autonomy but surely, in view of the massive annual subvention they get from the taxpayer, one would expect a more realistic attitude.</P>
    <P>In relation to higher education it gives me great pleasure to congratulate the Government and the Minister for <Col N="1677" /> Education on the appointment of the director of the new Limerick Institute. I refer to Dr. Eddie Walsh, an excellent young man, highly qualified.  It appears to me that he is tailor-made for the tough assignment that has been given to him.  I am convinced that he will give the Limerick region and the nation the type of institute it badly needs.  He will give it an institute centred in science and technology, an institute that will cater for a society that is more and more dominated by science and technology. He will give it an institute having a very definite awareness of its times, an institute that will reflect the ideals and aspirations of a young, emergent nation.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I should love to be able to continue in Irish on this very important Estimate. Unfortunately, like many other Deputies, I have forgotten much of the Irish I learned some years ago because I did not practise speaking it.  I must admit that I could do a little bit more, and perhaps we could all do a little more, not only in the matter of trying to speak Irish but also in fostering Irish music and dancing.  If we lose those things in this generation it will be a tragedy.  I hope that will never happen.  The parliamentary Secretary is better known to me than the Minister <Col N="1678" /> because he is a Connacht man.  He is now responsible for sports and I am proud of that choice since he was born and reared in Connacht and was steeped in Irish culture.  I hope he will use his influence to spread and foster our Gaelic culture throughout the length and breadth of the land.</P>
    <P>We all appreciate the importance of education for our people.  Whatever differences political parties may have had over the years, they were united when it came to a question of fostering the Irish language and trying to improve the educational facilities even with the limited resources available to successive Ministers, and much progress has been made.  When the late Deputy O'Malley was Minister he really shook the country to its foundations. That was the type he was.  When he did something he made quite a splash.  I think it was Michael O'Hehir who once said: &ldquo;They are still rocking.&rdquo; The late Minister made an announcement and tried to get things going but, even with the best will in the world, we could not be 100 per cent successful.  Deputy Lenihan as Minister for Education and the present holder of that office also tried to do their best but they met with many obstacles along the way.</P>
    <P>The people in my part of the country very much appreciate what has been done for them.  Speaking on behalf of myself, my wife and family, I want to say that I have been greatly facilitated by the transport system which has been devised.  The same thing goes for my neighbours.  I live four miles from the nearest town.  We feel indebted to the taxpayers as well as to the Minister, his officials and others, for providing us with these wonderful facilities in this day and age. Some years ago when my children were availing of secondary education they had to go four miles to school on their bicycles if I were not available to drive them.  Today there are mini buses and large buses which are centrally heated and in which the children arrive at school in dry clothes.  This has a beneficial effect on their health. The schools are centrally heated also and they have modern toilet facilities. The Sisters of Charity teach in a <Col N="1679" /> school in my area and I must also mention the sisters and brothers in the other towns in the county.  In practically every town in Mayo with a population of 500 or over, there is a convent school.</P>
    <P>We must admit that we have made great progress.  In passing I should like to pay tribute to the religious orders and the old time teachers.  They had not got these modern facilities but they did their best within their own resources.  They raised funds at bazaars and in any way they could.  They established schools and tried to equip and staff them.  This was no easy job.  How they achieved so much in view of the obstacles, will ever be a surprise and a wonder to me.  We will always be in their debt.  I was glad to hear Deputy O'Donovan paying tribute to an old school teacher who gave outstanding service, in Tipperary I think it was.  He may be dead and gone but his work will live on.  In the early days after <Col N="1680" /> the foundation of the State we had a sufficient number of people to run the Parliament and to man the Civil Service. I want to compliment them too in passing.  Many of them were inexperienced. We also had the personnel to staff our schools.  It is a great tribute to these teachers that they provided the country with so many soundly educated people with a good religious and academic training to man the various posts when the State was founded, and that work is being continued.</P>
    <P>I hope that the sum of money being sought in this Estimate will prove to be sufficient, but I doubt that it will.  We have to consider our priorities.  I hope that sum of money will be adequate to give as good a service as the taxpayers can afford.</P>
    <P>Progress reported; Committee to sit again.</P>
