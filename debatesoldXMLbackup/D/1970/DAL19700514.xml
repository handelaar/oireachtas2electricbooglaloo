      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>When the debate was adjourned last night I had made the point that, while we all welcome the moderate and relatively reassuring statements of the Taoiseach recently, we welcome and support the line of policy announced by him in relation to the north and to the crisis, but while we do all this we still cannot have confidence in his Government. We regret this.  We welcome the composition of that Government.  We would like to be able to have confidence in them as a Government who can give sound unswerving leadership at this time of crisis.  I spelled out the basic reason why we cannot have such confidence, that is, that there are some five to 17 Deputies on those benches on whom the Government depend for their survival and who cannot be counted on in time of a hot emergency. If the pressure becomes really <Col N="1517" /> strong as a result of events in the north these gentlemen cannot be counted on to support the policy announced by the Taoiseach.  That is a very serious state of affairs.  I was examining, therefore, what kind of policy these gentlemen have, what kind of policy they would be likely to advocate in terms of crisis.</P>
      <P>In that connection I was quoting, when the debate was adjourned, from a speech by Deputy Boland made here on the 8th May.  I will continue with my reading of that:</P>
      <P>While a policy ruling out force is appropriate and almost unanimously accepted as far as I know for this 26 County State-certainly it is unanimously accepted so far as the Fianna Fáil Party are concerned&mdash; there is no doubt that the people in the Six Counties are, in fact, in the same position as the people in the whole country were in before 1916, and they are entitled to make their own decisions. </P>
      <P>The Taoiseach is dependent for the survival of his Government, in times of crisis, on the people who applauded the man who said that.  Deputy Boland continued:</P>
      <P>While we here are both entitled and, I think, very well qualified to give advice on this matter, and the advice we would give would be that there should be no inclination to utilise force to solve the difficulties which exist there </P>
      <P>I do not know whether the Ministers listened to Deputy Boland when he was speaking.  Perhaps they listened to him so attentively they have no need to hear me recall his words, but other Deputies may be interested in them. He went on:</P>
      <P>and to try to secure the acceptance of our approach, it would be presumptuous for us to attempt from the smugness of this 26 County State to dictate to our fellow countrymen who are suffering under British imperialism, because that is what they are suffering under.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be unpardonable for us to take any action to frustrate the <Col N="1518" /> efforts of our people in the Six Counties to protect their lives and property. </P>
    <P>I do not know what Deputy Boland means by &ldquo;our people&rdquo; whether that includes Catholics and Protestants or whether it is just Catholics in this context. I suspect it is just Catholics.  He continued:</P>
    <P>The objection I see to the approach of many Deputies who have been speaking here in this matter is the concern for what is described as the freedom we have achieved, the attitude that the overriding concern must be to retain this State and this Parliament.  So far as I am concerned I want to go on record as saying that I reject that attitude, that I do not see a 26 County State as an achievement.  I see it as a retrogression.  I see it as a situation resulting from the 1922 betrayal.  While I recognise it as a situation which exists, and under which we must work, I also recognise that the national objective is to get rid of two States in this country not one. </P>
    <P>I interject there to say that if Deputy Boland's policy is followed we shall get rid not only of the States but also of large sections of their population. Deputy Boland in any case goes on to say:</P>
    <P>There is here in this part of our country an established situation of a democratically-elected Government operating under a democratically adopted Constitution and no such Government could tolerate the existence of an armed organisation not under the Government's control.  No such Government could permit the importation of arms into this country for such an organisation.  I am absolutely certain that no one who was a colleague of mine in the Government believes otherwise. </P>
    <P>I hope the Taoiseach will say something to us about those remarks of Deputy Boland.  It is very important for his credibility and for the credibility of his Government that he should. Deputy Boland goes on to say:</P>
    <P>However, while such an crganisation is clearly illegal here the position <Col N="1519" /> in the Six Counties is clearly different. The solution imposed on this country by the British, in addition to massive subsidisation by the British taxpayer and to the garrisoning by the British Army, requires the discrimination and oppression that is exercised by the ruling faction.  This ruling faction must remam....</P>
    <P>In so far as this question of the alleged attempt to import arms is concerned&mdash;and I repeat I have no reason to believe there has been any such importation&mdash;it is our obvious duty to ensure that any such importation to this part of the country is only carried out by official State agencies.  However, we have no function in regard to the Six Counties.  It is not our homes or our lives that are in danger.  Since we are not in a position to supply protection to these citizens of ours and since the United Nations, to which we subscribe, acts like Pontius Pilate in regard to the situation, we have no right to interfere in any efforts our people in the Six Counties may feel constrained to make to defend themselves from the effects of British imperialism in that part of our country....</P>
    <P>As far as I am concerned my position is clear.  Arms importation into this part of our country by any agency other than the State is illegal and should not be permitted, but arms importation into the part of the country in which the writ of this Government does not run is not illegal so far as I am concerned.  It is our duty to advise against it but it is not our business to interfere and any co-operation with the security forces of the country that continues to occupy six of our counties is, in my opinion, intolerable. </P>
    <P>That is a remarkable statement.  The Taoiseach does not appear to have understood this remarkable statement. I want to refer now to column 1342 of the Official Report of the 9th May when the Taoiseach commented on this.  He expressed in very mild terms his disagreement with a part of that speech by Deputy Boland.  He said:</P>
    <P>I want again to express my disagreement <Col N="1520" /> with my colleague, Deputy Boland, when he says that it is a matter for them to get their guns it they want to from some other source but not from here. </P>
    <P>That is not what Deputy Boland said. The Taoiseach went on to say:</P>
    <P>It certainly is something that we could and should achieve that they will not get them here but because of my abhorrence of this violence I would feel that guns to any unauthorised source from anywhere are a very serious danger. </P>
    <P>What Deputy Boland actually said is:</P>
    <P>Arms importation into the part of the country in which the writ of this Government does not run is not illegal so far as I am concerned. </P>
    <P>If it is not illegal from the point of view of a member of that Government, therefore, it can lawfully happen on the territory of this State.  What Deputy Boland is saying is that guns can and should legally be run from the 26 Counties into the Six where they get into the hands of organisations which, when they work within the Six Counties, Deputy Boland does not regard as illegal.</P>
    <P>Now, it is natural in any governing party that there should be differences of opinion, there should be a certain span of opinion, there should be certain differences of emphasis.  That is commonplace and we all experience it but that there should be such a span that a member of that party, who is applauded by his own party, should affirm this doctrine of the legality of arms importation into Northern Ireland and that the Taoiseach should differ from a proposition that Deputy Boland did not enunciate, and fail to refer to the policy which he did enunciate&mdash;then there is a very ominous crack in those benches over there, and even a tap let alone such a hard blow as it could possibly receive, would split that party, bring down that Government and do that at the very worst time&mdash;a time of national crisis.  That is what we are faced with and I hope the Taoiseach will reply explicity to that difficulty.  In seeking for our confidence, as the Taoiseach has <Col N="1521" /> done, a confidence we should like to extend to him in national emergency, I do not think we should find ourselves engaged in a squabble or passionate interchange at such a time.  I should like to see all parties being able to work together on this issue and I think we are very near that point.  We are very near but at the same time we are dangerously far away because the gentlemen on the extreme right of that party&mdash;the extreme right is where they are&mdash;differ fundamentally from the rest of the Dáil on that matter.  On their fundamental dissent, on that crazy foundation this Government now rests.</P>
    <P>All this means, this speech by Deputy Boland and I think Deputy Blaney, although he is not so explicit he is in agreement with him, is that the State forces here should turn a blind eye to the activities of the underground armed organisations in the north in maintaining supply lines across the Border from the 26 Counties.  That presumably is the policy at which those gentlemen were conniving when they were in office.  It is well known that a sympathiser of theirs occupied the post of Minister for Justice, and on the Minister for Defence, the other key Ministry in this matter, a shade of suspicion also falls as a result of the declarations of Captain Kelly, which have not been contradicted where they ought to be contradicted, in a court of law.</P>
    <P>This statement by Deputy Boland also means that an IRA rising, of some sort or other, whether it is called IRA or not or whether it is called provisional or whatever it is now, in the Six Counties, is as justifiable as was the 1916 Rising.  He says the situation in the north now is exactly the same as the situation in the whole country before 1916.  When he makes that somewhat crazed utterance I cannot see that we can draw any other inference from it than that a rising of the 1916 type now in one of the cities of Northern Ireland is justifiable in the opinion of a key supporter of the Government, without whose support the Government would fall.</P>
    <P>It is an unmistakable corollary of this, though unspoken by Deputy Boland, that our Government should go to the help of the brave men whom <Col N="1522" /> they would have encouraged by their collusion to start such a rising.  I think that it does follow.  There is nothing illogical about it but if there is, perhaps, the Deputies opposite may wish to explain to me where I am wrong in my interpretation of Deputy Boland, if they are in a position to do that.</P>
    <P>If that is not a corollary&mdash;the idea that we should go to the help of potential rebels in the North&mdash;then the policy is as contemptible as it is insane.  As we were called on to speak charitably the other day I shall make the charitable assumption that the policy announced by Deputy Boland is just insane.  I know there are Members opposite who agree with me.  I am sorry they are not in a position to say this clearly; the fact that they must be very delicate and gingerly in their handling of Deputy Boland's terrible utterance is the most ominous of the many ominous features in this debate.</P>
    <P>Deputy Boland's policy, which is inbuilt in the Fianna Fáil Party, is a recipe for civil war.  Let nobody deceive themselves that this will be just civil war in the north because it cannot be confined to that area in the present circumstances.  Civil war, including the actions of British troops, could spread to this whole island and the effect of Deputy Boland's utterances on the young men to whom it is obliquely directed is helping to set in motion a train of events which could bring civil war to us all.  It is a recipe for the deaths of many innocent Irish men, women and children&mdash;whether Catholic or Protestant is immaterial&mdash;and for the destruction of our State whose institutions and security have already been undermined by Deputy Boland and his friends.</P>
    <P>This does not matter very much to Deputy Boland because he does not think much of the State of which he has been a Minister and which his party have governed for so long.  He does not regard it as an achievement to have such a State and he would like both States to be swept out of existence.  He has a dashing attitude <Col N="1523" /> towards the situation here and he does not hesitate to play with lives.  If it were just Deputy Boland it would not matter too much but we have a Government that depends for survival in time of crisis on Deputy Boland and his friends.  However, it is not just a question that the withdrawal of those five, ten or 15 men who applauded the sentiments expressed by Deputy Boland, could bring the Government down.  There is also involved what I would call their latent authority.  To use a slang phrase these people are &ldquo;big wheels&rdquo; in their party although in the eyes of the country they may not be as powerful as the Taoiseach who is personally esteemed above any of these four gentlemen, both individually and collectively.  I do not think this is necessarily the case among Fianna Fáil Deputies in this House.</P>
    <P>I do not know much about that party and I have to infer their inward travails from what appears from the party's outward comportment.  Deputy Cosgrave spoke of the tip of the iceberg and this proved an apt metaphor. I was struck, as some other Deputies were, by a curious passage in the Taoiseach's concluding statement on 9th May.  At columns 1336 and 1337 of the Official Report dated 8/9th May, 1970, the Taoiseach stated in regard to his feelings when he carried out the purge of his Cabinet:</P>
    <P>Certainly, it was for me a sad day when our Ministerial paths had to part. </P>
    <P>I quite appreciate the personal feelings involved here and will not trespass on them.  However, that is not the point I am making.  The Taoiseach goes on to say:</P>
    <P>All three of them had long family traditions&mdash;as we have heard.  I think they are entitled to proclaim that service to the country and towards the fight for freedom. Through their families, they have given service and endured considerable suffering.  It made the task all the less easy that I realised that my family had not the same traditions of service or of membership of the Fianna Fáil Party and that I was <Col N="1524" /> asking these two men to resign and that Deputy Kevin Boland resigned because he objected to my handling of the affair, obviously. </P>
    <P>Psychologically, that is very curious and its psychology has important and dangerous political implications. Phrases such as &ldquo;my family has not the same traditions as yours&rdquo; are not frequently adopted or heard in this House.  Some Deputies have commented on this with some puzzlement and I was very puzzled myself.  As a student of international affairs and a former diplomat, I have been interested in what is called &ldquo;conflict resolution&rdquo; which means the techniques adopted by people when they wish to avoid a collision.  This is important in studies of peacemaking and so on.  People who study these &ldquo;conflict resolution&rdquo; methods of ending a quarrel without an actual fight have become increasingly interested in what might be called &ldquo;zoological analogies&rdquo;.  I may appear to be wandering far from the point but I am really close to something I believe to be important.</P>
    <P>In the animal kingdom there are devices for ending a quarrel.  There is a technique called &ldquo;presentation&rdquo;; this is analogous to the presenting of arms in the military code.  In the animal world if a pair of dogs or wolves are on the verge of a fight one will expose his jugular to the other animal. Then, the fight is over, one has submitted, a hierarchy is established between them and they proceed as a united pack.  Something similar holds good among cranes; in this case the back of the head is presented.  The same also applies to baboons who present another part of their anatomy but I shall not trouble the House about this at the present time.</P>
    <P>This device of &ldquo;presentation&rdquo; is effective in ending a quarrel, in instituting a new hierarchy and this happens in a wide variety of forms in diplomatic and political behaviour.  It is detailed in an excellent book of my own which Deputies will find in the library should they not wish to purchase it in a bookshop.  Therefore, I was interested in this matter because it seemed to me that what was happening <Col N="1525" /> here when the Taoiseach made this reference to his family not having had the same traditions of service as did the families of Deputies Boland, Haughey, Blaney and, perhaps, Ó Móráin that he was &ldquo;presenting,&rdquo; he was appeasing.  This is very odd because formally what he was doing was humiliating them, pushing them out.  They should have been presenting their jugular vein or the backs of their heads or any appropriate part of their anatomy.  But no, it was the other way round.  I hope Deputies will not think I have dealt with this facetiously, but I think these comparisons are valid. The real point is that he was acknowledging their continuing authority within the Fianna Fáil Party, and they do have such authority, and, considering the views they have, such authority is extremely dangerous.  The fact that they have that authority makes the Fianna Fáil Party in its present condition extremely dangerous, and there are Deputies over there on that front bench who know that as well as or perhaps much better than I do.  By their numbers these people exert pressure on the Government; by their Fianna Fáil hierarchical authority and command among local organisations, they exert more pressure.</P>
    <P>That is dangerous enough, but there is another danger involved here, that is, that pressure is being exerted on them.  They have played a part, I do not know with what sincerity; probably with a mixture of sincerity, bravado and calculation.  In any case they have played the part of the heroic, intransigent republican.  Others may betray the republic, let it down or joggle it now and then, but not they.  They will stand by the tradition.  They are, in fact, the keepers of the tradition in the eyes of their followers, and they have a personal following.</P>
    <P>How therefore will they behave in a crisis?  Will they not be disposed in a crisis to demonstrate to their followers, to display to their followers: &ldquo;Do not worry.  We are indeed the intransigent republicans&rdquo; in terms of Deputy Boland's speech?  What could that mean?  Will the Government not have <Col N="1526" /> to dissolve or do something to appease those people, and surely to do anything to appease the kind of policy which Deputy Boland announced in his speech would be madness?</P>
    <P>A government depending on such support is a national menace&mdash;I am not speaking idly or rhetorically, I hope&mdash;and the more confidence they command, the more reassurance they can raise, the more of a menace it is. At this moment it can be compared to an infernal machine ticking away inside the bland, familiar toby jug of the Taoiseach's public image.</P>
    <P>I have spoken, and I would wish that we would concentrate mainly, in relation to the strains that may be coming. In that well worn image, we should be getting the ship of State in condition to resist the storms that are blowing up and may blow very hard upon us, because it is probable that a general election in the United Kingdom is now imminent, and that fans further the flames that are beginning to burn there.  We are not dealing with some remote situation but with something that may come upon us at any moment and which may overtake us in a dangerous and unprepared condition if that Government, meritorious though its own membership is, is in command of our destinies at that time.</P>
    <P>Already much damage has been done in the north.  It might be described as a policy of frightening Protestants and fooling Catholics and speeding on sectarianism&mdash;fooling Catholics with the dreams of military rescue, with the old green rhetoric, with all that which in these circumstances can only be poison.  Damage has also been done to our institutions. Deputy Boland has told us, in effect, that a blind eye should be turned to arms smuggling to the north.  Deputy Boland's colleague, who was, he tells us, fired, though the Taoiseach tells us he resigned on health grounds, was Minister for Justice.  The portfolio of Justice was for all this time in the hands of the friend of Deputy Boland, a friend of a man who professes these ideas.  I am afraid all that must mean that the police were encouraged to turn a blind eye to any such activities going on here, and that surely must <Col N="1527" /> have grave consequences for any proper police force.</P>
    <P>Similarly, under the Minister for Defence, on whom this shadow still rests, the Army were involved in all these rather seedy operations about which we still know so little and feel so much disquiet.  A number of Army officers have been named as having been engaged in clandestine activities in the north.  We do not know whether the Taoiseach was aware of such activities.  We do not know whether they have been abandoned.  We have not been told anything very clear about that.  However, that work in those circumstances meant contact with an illegal organisation up there whose policies are not necessarily the same as that Government's, and it involved of course contacts with members of this Government of different shades.  We have found out that they were not then a united Government, as they still are not a united party, on this range of issues.  Therefore these Army officers, all, as far as I can understand, of the middle rank, were thrown into all this heady whirl of politics, politics enveloped in this green haze of rhetoric which surrounds everything these gentlemen do.</P>
    <P>It is very wrong that Army officers should be drawn into that situation. I speak here with great respect of the officers and men of our Army.  I have seen them in combat conditions in the Congo less than ten years ago.  I have great respect for their discipline, their loyalty and their spirit.  I do not like to see those virtues being drawn into and tarnished by this kind of dangerous operation.  When you draw the Army into this you draw all sorts of possible conflicts and strains into the situation. If officers are brought into this they are set on a course which they may see as a dashing, patriotic course.  Army officers will be inclined, of their nature, to think of the more dashing course as the more patriotic.  That is a part of military virtue and we should expect it, especially among younger officers.  If they are told by Deputy Blaney or Deputy Boland: &ldquo;Go and do this&rdquo; and then they are later told by the Taoiseach: &ldquo;Cool it.  Stop it. Lay off&rdquo;, may not some of them be <Col N="1528" /> inclined to think the patriotic Deputy Blaney or Deputy Boland was the man who had the rights of it?  That is the beginning of the way in which Army officers and the Army may be drawn into the politics of this State.  Surely that is the most dangerous course in relation to internal politics in the Twenty-six Counties that any government could enter into?  That is the full measure of the Government's irresponsibility on that matter.</P>
    <P>Others&mdash;one could continue the list almost <i>ad nauseam</i>&mdash;have been drawn into it, too.  For example, the information agencies have been drawn into it.</P>
    <P>I asked the Taoiseach a question yesterday about <i>Voice of the North:</i> I asked him had it received any Government subvention or encouragement. He said no&mdash;just a single word, &ldquo;no&rdquo;; <i>Voice of the North</i> had received no encouragement from that Government over there.  Then he said it had received no encouragement from Fianna Fáil as an organisation.  Then he dropped the qualifier: he said it had received no encouragement from Fianna Fáil&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The Taoiseach told us that neither the Government nor Fianna Fáil gave any encouragement to <i>Voice of the North.</i>  Now, I believe that statement of the Taoiseach: I believe it in exactly the same sense as I believe the statement which he made in reply to Deputy Cosgrave when he said he did not understand what Deputy Cosgrave was talking about when Deputy Cosgrave referred to possible resignations which the Taoiseach later told the House he had already asked for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not believe the statement in the ordinary sense in which we use words to convey thought.  I can accept that in some sense, of which part is hidden from us, it may be true and that the truth has now surfaced.  <i>Voice of the North</i> comes out today, or its most recent number is quoted in the <Col N="1529" /> daily press today.  It comes out with a strong defence of the dismissed Ministers and I think it reveals its connection because it proclaims them to be the pure patriots, it contrasts them <i>explicitly</i> with the left, with characters attributable to the left like Miss Devlin, and <i>implicitly</i> with the Taoiseach.  However, Deputies Boland and Haughey are the true patriots.  It becomes apparent now that that which was got going under encouragement from the Dublin Government was a Blaneyite organ now festering in the north.</P>
    <P>That is another dangerous achievement but it is not the most dangerous aspect of that.  The most dangerous aspect is that whatever mental reservations the Taoiseach may have about what he said about <i>Voice of the North</i>, nobody will believe what he says&mdash; neither Sinn Féin nor nationalist, neither unionist nor anyone else.  Nobody will believe him.  They believe this is in an organ which Fianna Fáil started and which has been taken over by Deputy Blaney and I think I must say they are right.</P>
    <P>However, <i>Voice of the North</i> is not all that important.  What is important is that the Taoiseach&mdash;whether in the north or in the south at any moment any section approves or does not approve of anything he does&mdash;should be a man whose utterances command credence, a man worthy of trust.  There are in the north the adverse stereotypes which each community tends to cherish. There are the stereotyped opinions which the bigoted Protestants have about Catholics&mdash;that they cannot entirely trust their words, that they cannot be quite taken on trust, that there may be mental reservations and so on.</P>
    <P>I do not need to go into all this.  It is unfortunate that these impressions exist, but the most unfortunate thing is what must be said in relation to the Taoiseach's reply to Deputy Cosgrave&mdash; that he has reinforced this image both of the majority in this island and of himself.  This means that he will not be able to assert the ordinary authority or command the trust that the leader of this Government should command at the present time.  I am very sorry to say <Col N="1530" /> that.  I am really sorry, and I am not using it as a political phrase.</P>
    <P>All this affects what I might call the vacuum of the rest of Fianna Fáil thought on this matter.  I refer to the fact that while the extreme right on this might have a position&mdash;it has a certain horrible attraction&mdash;the moderates do not have anything clear to say.  I shall refer to what Deputy Hillery, the Minister for External Affairs, said on the radio.  I do not have the transcript of what he said.  The Minister was asked to take part in a debate with a spokesman of this Party and a spokesman of Fine Gael.  He was not able to attend but he was able to comment afterwards on a recorded version of what we had said.  That is a rather easy way to have a discussion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I entirely accept that.  The interviewer questioned the Minister about the British and he replied: &ldquo;I think the British should be ashamed of themselves&rdquo;&mdash;this is from the <i>Irish Press</i> report of the interview &mdash;&ldquo;Britain was at fault at the beginning and it is Britain who must play a major part to get the people in the north to understand each other, to find a formula for living together&rdquo;.  The Minister said the British must help.  The poor British do not understand this situation themselves.  They do not understand the Protestants or the Catholics.  Both lots give them a headache and they are not in a position to explain one lot to the other lot.  The Minister should have been trying to explain things to them, to get over a clear message to the people there, but neither he nor the Government have ever tried to do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I put down a question on what the Government have been doing.  I asked if they have been doing anything which they can avow, which they can tell us. I do not think so.  They have been addressing messages <i>urbi et orbi</i> about the general situation in the north but they have not been talking to the people, and the ultimate abdication was that of the Minister for External Affairs. <Col N="1531" /> What he said to the British was: &ldquo;Please educate the Protestants in the north in Fianna Fáil principles&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>It is an interesting idea.</P>
      <P>I suppose we can envisage British Army education officers proceeding down the Shankill Road armed with speeches made by the Taoiseach and the Minister for External Affairs and releases from the Government Information Bureau and leaving them in the various letterboxes along there as long as they survive in the area.  The fact is that these people will not listen to the British any more than they will listen to us on such a matter.  They have their own ideas.  We should try to address them, and this is not an impossible thing to do.  People say as one Minister said here yesterday when this issue was raised, that &ldquo;We cannot go up there. We would only start trouble&rdquo;.  It was then pointed out that a spokesman from the Fine Gael Party and a spokesman from the Labour Party had gone up there and talked on television with Mr. Paisley.  I can appreciate the difficulties if members of the Government were to go up there and talk but there is nothing stopping them from talking to the north from down here.  The BBC in the north and Ulster Television would both welcome members of this Government speaking on television particularly in times of crises.  During the crisis of last summer a team from Ulster Television came down here but they could not get the Taoiseach or any member of the Government to talk to the people whom we are supposed to be trying to persuade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have renounced the use of force in dealing with these people and we welcome that but what else is left except persuasion?  So what does the Government do, does it persuade, no, it aims its remarks in a totally different direction.  It follows a totally different policy which by its hollowness, by the vacuum it creates, by the basic insincerity in its approach which it silently proclaims it invites the activity of the <Col N="1532" /> far right.  As these people are shown no policy which could compete with their own they go on their doomed way.  When the Taoiseach is replying, I should like him to tell us just what he is doing to reach the people of the north, to reach them not by these terrible, depressing, seedy underground channels that his Ministers have been working in but in the open language of free men not in incitement but in rational dialogue.  There are many things which can be done but what is the Taoiseach doing?</P>
    <P>I should like at this moment to say something about what might be called the violent cycle because just as the Government are not reaching the people of the north or attempting to reach them, either Protestant or Catholic or both together, so they are not really adequately or clearly answering the kind of questions put by the uneasy, tormented people of this part of the country, who are distressed in their consciences and traditions by what they see happening now and by what happened last August.  Their confusions are not being cleared up.  On the contrary, they are being increased by the two voices with which this Government speaks.  I have been astonished by the statements which have been made to me in recent days when going round my own constituency by ordinary people in the streets and in the shops.  The statements I am going to quote are sympathetic to the departed Ministers, but I should point out that not all the statements I have heard are sympathetic to the departed Ministers&mdash;most of the people of the country are not sympathetic to them, certainly in my own area they do not appear to be&mdash;but those who do sympathise with them said one or two things or quite often they said both of these things together.  The first statement is, &ldquo;We cannot stand aside and let the Catholics of the north be massacred&rdquo;.  The second statement is; &ldquo;This will be solved only by the gun&rdquo;. People are saying these things but the Government are not doing anything to reach these people.  It will be no good complaining later about the angry, wild things confused people do if the Government have not done <Col N="1533" /> something or done enough to dissipate their confusion.</P>
    <P>As regards the first statement the distinction has been made in the debate but the Government has not made clear the distinction between what the position was <i>before</i> and <i>after</i> British troops were deployed to protect one section against another, which they did with reasonable effectiveness under difficult conditions.  At a time last August it did look as if we might be about to assist at a massacre by a sectarian mob, which included the police, of a section of the people there, that section being closely allied to the people of this part of the country.  I can well understand the feelings of the people who at that time said: &ldquo;We cannot stand idly by&rdquo;.  If it had gone on I can even imagine that our Army might have had to go in for the protection of those people in that Border area.  I think that decision could only have been taken by any Government with the heaviest of hearts knowing that it would mean temporary protection, perhaps, for these people, then widespread destruction and death for many people in the ghetto area of Belfast city which is completely beyond the reach of any efforts our forces could make.  I can see that such an effort dictated by the anguish of all our hearts at that time might have been made and might be regarded in the perspective of history as legitimate. But after the British forces were deployed and after they did give protection to those lives then no such justification stood.</P>
    <P>I know Members opposite agree with me.  I know that to those sitting on the front bench I am stating the obvious but since their Party speaks with two voices and since even the utterances of their most moderate spokesmen are constrained by deference to their own extremists we must spell this out from here.  Any military intervention by us could only precipitate death on a great scale, death of our own armed forces facing the British, death of British soldiers who were sent there to protect lives.  I hope we want to see all lives there protected.  We would be placing in great jeopardy the lives of all the people we wanted to protect. <Col N="1534" /> There is no doubt about that, but if military intervention of our regular forces is completely to be repudiated so also, and even to a greater extent, must this traffic with illegal organisations there be repudiated.  They cannot protect; they can only provoke.  I do not even believe that they have been getting many arms from the quarter of the gentlemen who are posturing as their friends and patrons.  I think Deputy Blaney is more fertile in dark hints than he is in arms and ammunition&mdash; that at least is the report I have heard from up there.  To put guns in the hands of an illegal organisation in such conditions would be suicidal to the people concerned because to some of these people, whose policies change very rapidly, these guns could easily be used for attacks from out of the Catholic ghettoes upon British troops with all the cycle that that represents. To put guns into such irresponsible hands is not a policy of protecting the people concerned, it is a policy of insanity.  Again, I do not think that needs to be greatly emphasised but something must be said about it.  It would be a policy of destroying the Catholics of the north in the guise of protecting them.</P>
    <P>Then the gun idea&mdash;the gun idea which is so much in the background of Fianna Fáil philosophy although repudiated at other times; the idea which Deputy Boland hinted at, of a sacrificial 1916.  The situation, he and his friends tell us, is exactly the same as that in 1916 and, therefore, the same policy would be justified.  Of course, if there were such an attempt in the north now and the executions followed, and they would follow, they would not unite the people of the North of Ireland as the people of the Twenty-six Counties were united by 1916; they would only increase the divisions between them because the feelings would spread, and we must face the facts, to the Catholic population and not spread to the rest of the population.  We would be left only with an increased legacy of hate and only further increase the spread of a holy civil war.</P>
    <P>Before I say something about our own position in regard to this I find it <Col N="1535" /> necessary to say something about our position as it has been depicted by that party there.  This also is an issue relevant to the degree of no confidence that we must have in them.  We have been depicted as a party which would impose Cuban socialism, and so on, on this country.  We have been painted as a party of violent revolution, most dangerous to the people.  It is, therefore, necessary for me to say a word about this.  We are all of us, a party completely committed to the democratic principles.  We are committed to attaining socialism by democratic means and by democratic means only.  We proclaim this in our policy. We also proclaim it in all our actions and in our words.  A statement of mine that it might be preferable for us to have diplomatic relations with Cuba instead of Portugal was twisted by very able hands over there&mdash;I am not complaining about that, it is part of the game&mdash;into the doctrine that Cuban socialism should be imposed here.  This in turn was spread to suggest the idea that we were violent revolutionaries, potential gunmen and so on, masquerading only for the moment as democrats.</P>
    <P>Well, two Deputies opposite have appealed for charity.  It is rather strange that members of a governing political party should appeal for charity.  Charity is a most splendid thing and that it should inform all our debates both in this House and on the hustings would be most admirable and would set us apart from and above most other nations.  If these appeals represented a step on that path they would be very welcome. Unfortunately these appeals for charity are just directed at us, they do not represent charitable practice in deed. Deputy Burke, for example, appealed for charity.  What was he doing when his colleagues were calumniating us, when they were saying what they knew was not true, that we were communists and so on; when they were spreading their other rumours around the countryside last June, these very charitable gentlemen?  What was Deputy Burke doing?  He himself may not have said that we were communists but while this campaign of false witness was going on <Col N="1536" /> he at least did no more than go by on the other side, no doubt with dignity, not to say unction.</P>
    <P>We have been represented as alien, exotic and dangerous products.  We have been represented as that by the gentlemen opposite who proclaim themselves of the purest patriotic descent. Let me for one moment, speaking for myself, say one quick word about my family.  I can claim&mdash;I do not know whether in these days it should be a proud claim but it is a claim I can make with truth&mdash;that my own family played a notable and significant part in the intellectual and spiritual pre-history of Fianna Fáil.  My granduncle, Father Eugene Sheehy, of Bruree, who was in jail with Parnell in 1881, taught the rudiments of Irish patriotism to the boy Eamon de Valera, 70 or 80 years ago. When I told this story to a colleague on those benches he said that if my granduncle had taught patriotism to Eamon de Valera he had a lot to atone for.  I do not agree with that sentiment; I have the deepest personal respect for the President.  I mention this fact to show that, as I suppose I am regarded perhaps as the most exotic figure on these benches, we are not exotic at all.  We spring from the same stock even if these branches in our generation have so widely diverged.</P>
    <P>The principles which should be pursued in relation to this matter are fairly clear and widely shared but the important thing about these principles is that they should be practised and practised consistently and there should not be two forms of language used about them.  Of these principles I would say the first in order at present, as far as the north is concerned, is to leave law and order to the British and admit that that is what we are doing, admit it in plain language and be not afraid to tell the people what we are doing.  The problem here, of course, is that while Deputies opposite are saying that these are the forces which are needed to protect our people&mdash;that phrase again&mdash;they are at the same time &ldquo;inadmissible&rdquo; and &ldquo;aggressive&rdquo;.  This keeps the nation's mind in the state of teetering confusion which will take us to the abyss unless it can be cleared up.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1537" /> Of course with this attitude of leaving the question of law and order to the British is combined the duty of vigilance to see they discharge this. That involves&mdash;the second principle&mdash; remaining in touch openly and not clandestinely with the situation and with the British themselves, to keep in open and not clandestine contact with Catholics and Protestants in the north, not to frighten Protestants and not to fool Catholics or speak with two voices, to give no countenance to underground military activities, either here or there.  It is most dangerous folly to think you can play with underground military activities up there while keeping them suppressed down here.  I do not know how even these gentlemen could have got into such a state of confusion, bordering on insanity, as to think that.  Is it not quite apparent that these forces with their supply lines and so on, and under the defeats which they would certainly experience up there, would stagger back over that Border and into our politics and perhaps into the personal lives of people they might feel had betrayed them?  The third principle: with the British and with the people of the north, on both sides, to work patiently and candidly in the open for the preservation and extension of civil rights.  This means working with the British, really working with them in conditions of trust, not at the same time going around blackguarding them or nagging at them, however popular it may be to blackguard and nag them in this country.  It means talking the same language with them as we talk among ourselves.</P>
    <P>The British Government, the Government of Mr. Harold Wilson, did not create this situation and we should say nothing or do nothing for the purpose of imputing blame to that particular Government for its creation.  Like all of us, they inherited the situation.  The British Government has tried to handle the situation, not perfectly because that was not possible after the long years of neglect, a neglect shared by the Government of this country, but they have handled it in time of crisis better than any government in Britain ever handled it before.  Deputy Major de Valera nods <Col N="1538" /> in acknowledgment.  I am glad of that because what I say is true and I am pleased at his acknowledgment.</P>
    <P>The British Government have deployed their troops there, at some peril to their lives.  These boys from English towns know absolutely nothing about this country, though the Minister for External Affairs, Dr. Hillery, wants them to explain it to the population on both sides.  These boys are risking their lives there.  They are thoroughly confused. They get stones from the Catholics and bottles from the Protestants and they do not know why.  These boys should not be blackguarded.  We should all do our best to create conditions in which they may work at their task of protecting lives with reasonable hope of success.  But we are not doing that if we keep dragging in aggression and saying that this is British imperialism at work.  There are voices on the extreme left who are saying that most vociferously and I wish to record here that I do not agree with these voices.  I think we know some like them on the benches opposite.</P>
    <P>This situation was created by a British Queen and a British King away back in the 17th Century.  I think the British Government today would be very happy to be rid of the whole situation.  I think the British Government would be very happy to get rid of Northern Ireland.  There was a time when the Tories played internal politics with our lives, but that is not true of the British Government today.  I think, therefore, that we should approach them with candour, making sure that, when we gain their trust, we deserve it. We should disinfect our rhetoric, which is high explosive in these times; the traditional rhetoric, which normally does not mean anything very much, is now highly dangerous.</P>
    <P>At a meeting the other day when I was advocating basically the same policy as I am advocating now and accepting the basic fact that Catholics and Protestants in the north are not now united&mdash;they are divided&mdash;and that we must do something to bring them into a better relationship, a voice, thinking it was making a contribution, said: &ldquo;What about 1798?&rdquo; The legend, or <Col N="1539" /> the myth, of 1798 has gone into our school books.  The Minister for Education should have a look at all of this.  The legend would almost make 1798 a success.  It was nothing of the kind.  We must pay honour to the spirit, the character and the gallantry of the United Irishmen, but 1798 was not a success.  It was a national disaster.  In no respect was it more of a national disaster than in the heritage it left behind between Catholic and Protestant because of the events that took place in the confused course of that revolution.  I do not need to go into them now, but this is one of the myths that should be taken out, looked at, dusted off and explained.</P>
    <P>There is then, and this is perhaps the most important of all, the rather obvious but unanalysed thought that there is no possibility of progress towards unity without first obtaining better relations between Catholics and Protestants.  We should not be mealy mouthed about this.  This is about Catholics and Protestants.  We should work towards that goal consistently and steadily.  We should bear it in mind in our legislation, in our behaviour, in our speeches and in our social conduct.</P>
    <P>I have advocated&mdash;I think the Council of Labour will support the idea &mdash;an assembly of peace at this time, an assembly which would group together people from both communities, irrespective of their political and constitutional assumptions, provided they agree on two things: No. 1, no use of force and, No. 2, no spread of sectarian hate.  If the people on this island who agree on that could come together, they could have some very useful dialogue.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Education in his speech here yesterday&mdash;I thought rather a good speech&mdash;put forward the idea of an assembly of unity so that we could see what progress could be made towards unity among the various sections of our people.  We must face the fact that no progress towards unity can be made in current conditions.  In current conditions the great majority in Northern Ireland do not desire unity and, therefore, do not desire any progress <Col N="1540" /> towards unity.  An assembly dedicated to unity will fail.  The members would not even bother to turn up.  They would say they did not want unity, which is what they are saying today. With all due respect to the Minister for Education, such an assembly would be doomed to futility, to say the least of it.  On the other hand, an assembly of peace, as I have advocated, would provide common ground.  I trust those on the opposite benches will consider this even though it comes from a quarter with which they do not always agree. It is only on the ground of pursuing peace, not evoking hatred, that there is common ground between large sections of Catholics and Protestants at this moment and it is towards that common ground we should aim.  We can talk about unity afterwards.  There is no possibility of moving towards unity unless we preserve peace now and, unless we are very careful, we are not going to preserve peace.  I feel great danger of our not doing it, danger in the explosive elements in those who make up the Government.</P>
    <P>Most of what I have said is, I think, common ground on the Opposition benches.  It is, perhaps, common ground with a great many of the Fianna Fáil Party too.  I am not sure that the Fine Gael Party, or some members of it at least, would agree with everything I have said, especially when I advise that we should bear in mind in all our legislation, our behaviour, our speeches and our social conduct the impact this may have on Protestants in the north.  There may be certain divergences there, but that is the long term.  The short term is the question of encouragement to the Government.  On that vital matter there is agreement on these benches.  There is no agreement on the Government benches, no agreement extending to all in unambiguous terms.</P>
    <P>The policy I offer has nothing new or extraordinary in it, but we offer it with, behind it, the will and the possibility to pursue it consistently and steadily, even when it becomes unpopular and even when, under the heat of the hour, people may shriek &ldquo;Traitor&rdquo; at a man who says &ldquo;Hold back from civil war&rdquo;.  We can maintain that policy in that hour.  I do not think those on <Col N="1541" /> the Fianna Fáil benches can because I think a concealed veto rests in the wings for them.  I think they are running towards split and disaster when the heat comes on.</P>

      <P>I do not propose to follow Deputy O'Brien because I think the Taoiseach will answer some of the main criticisms he has uttered during his speech. I agree with a great deal of what he said about the need for a policy which will eventually bring about the unity of our country and with virtually everything he said in relation to the use of arms in the north at the present juncture.  I want to speak this morning about something which I hope will not be repetitive because so many speeches are inevitably of repetitive character that it is rather difficult to know what to say that is new.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach was criticised yesterday for making what was regarded by some of the press and Opposition Deputies as a totally irrelevant speech in that he went back and gave a history of the Fianna Fáil Party since its inception.  In my view his speech was totally relevant because the Fianna Fáil Government is one of the three oldest administrations in the world of stable sovereign democracies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Sovereign democracies. The unity in the Fianna Fáil Party has not been built up in the last five or ten years.  Even though parties' policies change, even though world events inevitably mean change of policy, change of emphasis, a party's strength, so far as I know the parties of Europe, is based partly on history and a great deal on tradition and on being able to prevent the infernal machines referred to by Deputy Cruise-O'Brien from ever affecting the final decisions of the party.  That, to me seems very important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps it is that I am one of the oldest Members of this House and I have studied history like Deputy O'Brien and you cannot judge what the Fianna Fáil Party is going to do <Col N="1542" /> in the next three months simply by present events.  They must be judged by their past history and competence in dealing with difficult situations and the situation with which we have had to deal for many years is the fact that we are a republican party that established a republican Constitution with the object, among many objects, of making it possible for all Irish people to subscribe to their Government and follow it regardless of the part they took in the Civil War and because we have an uncompleted objective, the restoration of unity, quite inevitably, there must have been strains and stresses affecting the Fianna Fáil Party during that long period of government. Everybody who examines our history will immediately follow what I mean.</P>
    <P>During the whole of that period we showed a supreme capacity to stand up to violent movements, to violent socialist movements and we prevailed, survived and triumphed on every single occasion.  The spirit of unity in Fianna Fáil remains with us yet partly because of our success in the past.  We were able to deal successfully with illegal armed organisations in the 1934-37 period, organisations on both sides.  We were able to deal successfully with illegal armed organisations in our country during the Second World War and again we were able to deal with illegal armed organisations during the period from 1957 to 1961. If we could not entirely suppress them we at least ensured that they would be ineffective.</P>
    <P>That is part of our tradition and quite evidently the whole of what has taken place in the last three weeks is naturally a shock to everybody in the country and everybody admits this.  It is a fact that so stable has been our Government during a period of 32 years that there have been very few changes made in it and perhaps it would have been better if we had become more accustomed to internal changes in the Fianna Fáil Government. Having said that, I want to make it quite clear to Deputy Cruise-O'Brien and the House that everything that he has said that should be required of the Fianna Fáil Party will be required <Col N="1543" /> of them in the next six months in regard to their political obligations, as already stated by the Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>Nobody in Fianna Fáil who wishes to remain a member of the party can directly or indirectly, officially as a Fianna Fáil person, or privately in his own personal capacity, encourage the importation of arms into the north have any contact with illegal organisations in the north, go into the north and inspire armed activity or the use of arms by small individual groups there.  That has been made absolutely clear by the Taoiseach already and I want to repeat it here today that anybody in Fianna Fáil who does that is no longer a member of our party.  We have made that clear beyond all doubt. Nobody can remain a member of Fianna Fáil who is not aware of the reality of the situation in the north as outlined by the Taoiseach.  Whether we like it or not the British Army is in control of public order in the north and any military intervention, official or unofficial by armed illegal groups, or by anybody, that does not take account of the official position of the British Army there would be to invite a worse position should rioting break out and would be completely insane, in fact, both from a political and a military point of view or even from the point of view of saving human life.</P>
    <P>Those are the realities we face in our party and any person who is a member of the Fianna Fáil Party is bound to accept those realities and understand that military intervention of this kind might bring far worse disaster to the minority in the north than they could possible conceive.  I hope Deputy O'Brien understands that.</P>

I think <Col N="1544" /> Deputy O'Brien is going to be grievously disappointed.</P>

      <P>Suggestions have been made in this debate that there could be an alternative Government, that somehow there could be an alternative Government, that somehow there could be a Coalition Government that would be able to handle the situation if they happened to be elected at this time of stress and strain.  We do not believe that.  I am perfectly prepared to accept what Deputy O'Brien has said.  I have not seen any speech by a member of his party which openly advocates the abandonment of democracy but I am equally aware that members of his party speak with different voices on the subject of the degree of socialism in which they believe, the rate at which it should progress and indeed the very character of their policy.</P>
      <P>For example, I absolutely refuse to believe that Deputy M.P. Murphy believes in one-quarter of what is written in the Labour Outline of Policy.  I have never heard him speak or advocate a policy that came within miles of the policy expressed in that document. Equally, I have read the speeches of Deputy Keating and since the general election it would seem to me that Deputy Keating has gone furthest with Deputy Dr. Browne towards following the policy in that document.  The other Deputies have been far from clear in their declaration as to exactly what their policy was.</P>

      <P>Deputy Cruise-O'Brien, in the course of his speech at <Col N="1545" /> the Mansion House, seemed to suggest some kind of coalition movement. When I think of Deputy Dr. Browne's radio broadcast, in which he gave his conditions for a coalition with Fine Gael, I realise again the impossibility of such a coalition being determined and, if it were determined, lasting for more than a few months.</P>
      <P>The Labour Party are quite entitled to have their differences of opinion on the subject of socialism but, when I hear Deputy Dr. Browne saying that we should join the world of socialist countries&mdash;that was one expression he used&mdash;I wonder what he meant by that, because there are no socialist countries except those where socialism is 100 per cent&mdash;not really 100 per cent any longer but shall we say far advanced&mdash;and where there is also no democracy.  I do not believe Deputy Dr. Browne wants to have any kind of socialist administration in which there is no democracy and, if he looks at the rest of the civilised world of democracies, he will find first of all that there are very few socialist parties in office and, where they are, they are exactly the same&mdash;&mdash;</P>

There are no socialist democratic parties heading governments in the civilised world of democracies.

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that the Fine Gael party would &ldquo;go it alone&rdquo;, or as evinced by Deputy Dr. FitzGerald who made it quite clear that he was looking for some kind of coalition arrangement with the Labour Party. It is perfectly clear that there is, as yet, no agreement.  Indeed, one can look back to the recent Labour Party Conference where, behind closed doors, this matter was discussed and some sort of resolution was published at the end of the conference suggesting that, before there could be any coalition, there must be an all-Ireland convention in which there should be some unanimous declaration in favour of a coalition and that, quite evidently, many concessions would have to be made by Fine Gael.  We would hope, in any event, that if the country faced such a proposition, the policies and the shadow Ministers of both sides would be known in advance.  That is far from likely.  As I have said, in the face of this, I cannot see that it would be advisable for this country to be governed by a coalition at this time with all the difficulties that are faced in the north and, as has already been stated by the Taoiseach, with the prospect of our negotiating to join the European Economic Community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are some people in the Labour Party who talk responsibly about the European Economic Community but there are others&mdash;and one can hear their speeches down in the country&mdash; who fail to understand the realities of our having to join the EEC, not only to secure a larger market for our produce, <Col N="1547" /> but also because this is the beginning, the very slow beginning, of internationalisation, of a federation of Europe.  Even if it may take a century to bring it about, it is an inevitable change that must take place.  As I have said, there are many members of the Labour Party whom we could not possibly trust to participate in a coalition government when we have to engage in negotiations for the purpose of entering the Community.</P>
    <P>Then, I would not trust a coalition government at the present time if we found that we had to deal more severely with inflationary influences.  I do not believe a coalition government composed of people with far left socialist tendencies and people with far right tendencies, would be able to deal with inflation if we had to meet it and deal with it firmly.  Neither do I believe that it would be so easy to implement the NIEC policy on incomes and prices with a coalition government in office.</P>
    <P>As I have said, the coming months will show the strength of Fianna Fáil. I agree with a great many things that have been said by my colleagues in Fianna Fáil and by others about the wrong phrases that have been used in this connection.  I hear people talk about &ldquo;our people in the north&rdquo; as describing the minority.  That is entirely wrong.</P>

      <P>We have to live with these people and anybody who knows the north knows perfectly well that, whether people are Unionists or Nationalists, Whatever else they are they are not English in manner, in temperament, or thought or ways of thinking. We have to get away from this kind of thinking and this kind of attitude which I have heard expressed by people of all parties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1548" /> I quite agree with Deputy O'Brien when he says that all three political parties failed in the past to consider a long-term policy of getting to know the Unionists in the north, getting to know the moderate Unionists, getting to understand their point of view and getting them to understand our point of view.  The co-operation that started in 1957 had a limited success only. We made an effort to co-operate with the Government in the north.  We succeeded in the field of tourism and in the field of electricity generation, and we reduced the tariffs on certain products manufactured exclusively in the north.  That was just a beginning of what should be further co-operation.</P>
    <P>I also agree with Deputy O'Brien when he says that the point at which one would begin such a policy would have to be determined by current events.  What we want to ensure now is that the voices of the moderate people in the north prevail, those who are so desperately silent at the present time and who comprise the vast majority of both Unionists and Nationalists in the north.  Anyone on any side of this House, in my party or in any other party, who discourages the movement towards moderation, wherever it can be seen, is simply trying to cause a bloodbath to no good purpose.  I know this because I represent a constituency which is close to the Border.  Whenever I have been to Monaghan, more often than not I have met someone from the neighbouring counties and they all tell me of this great silent expression of opinion.</P>
    <P>I wish these people would speak more openly.  They are speaking openly in some cases through their clergy, in some cases through local leaders, and in some cases through community organisations.  I wish they would speak more openly.  One of the ways that will encourage them to speak more openly is if we all agree in this House that armed intervention on our part can only result in these voices becoming more silent, more afraid, more suspicious.  If we want to encourage the more moderate voices in the north and people who, even if they disagree politically, wish to live together in a Christian way as neighbours, we must ensure that every single <Col N="1549" /> person in this House, regardless of his party, subscribes to the doctrine and the policy so clearly enunciated by the Taoiseach during the past few days.</P>
    <P>I should like to repeat again that people in the Fianna Fáil Party are pledged to this policy.  Deputy Dr. Cruise-O'Brien must know perfectly well that in the stresses and strains which occur at times like these it is no use taking out of context a single sentence of any Member of this House and trying to hang something on it.</P>

We have been able to accomplish this in the past.  We were able to accomplish it in the period between 1957 and 1961.  I have full confidence that the Fianna Fáil Party will remain united and that, in the overwhelming sense of numbers, Deputy Dr. Cruise-O'Brien will not see his prophesy realised.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> It is necessary at this point to remind the House and ourselves that we are discussing a motion in the name of the Taoiseach asking Dáil Éireann to re-affirm its confidence in the Government. This is, in effect, a vote of confidence in the Government which the Taoiseach is asking us to pass.  A motion of this sort is only put down at a time of national crisis when something has happened which might shake the confidence of the House and of the nation in the Government.  I venture to pose the question of what a foreigner, sitting in the distinguished gallery or in the public gallery, might think this was all about.  I suggest that having listened to the speeches from the Government benches, to the speech of the Taoiseach who introduced the motion, and to the speech of the Tánaiste to which we have just listened in support of it, such a foreigner would be bound to come to the conclusion <Col N="1550" /> that we were discussing some economic problem here or that we were discussing some external policy. Such a man most likely would conclude that we were discussing such matters.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach is asking us to re-affirm our confidence in the Government. The integrity of the Cabinet is at stake and on trial.  The integrity of the Fianna Fáil Party is also on trial.  That is what this debate is all about.  Why is the intergrity of the Cabinet and of the Fianna Fáil Party at stake and on trial?  It is at stake and on trial because within the last few months, contrary to the principle of collective responsibility enshrined in the Constitution, two, three or four Cabinet Ministers have been guilty of treachery within the Cabinet, and have departed from the Cabinet and their party on major national issues and, while remaining members of the Cabinet, have gone their separate ways unknown to the Taoiseach on this grave national issue of the reunification of our country and whether arms should be employed to that end.  That is what is at stake here.  The sooner we stop wandering all over the economic field and the external affairs field the better.  We must deal closely and concisely with the fitness of this Government to remain in office and with the fitness of the Fianna Fáil Party to form a Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have been told here from time to time since this debate began that the Fianna Fáil Party were given an overwhelming vote of confidence by the people on the 18th June last.  That may well be.  That is a fact.  It is also a fact that since then the image of the Fianna Fáil Party has changed drastically. From a party that went to the country united with united policy, and with experienced Ministers of several years standing, it is now before the country as a divided party with a divided Cabinet, and with four of its senior Ministers either sacked or having left the cabinet.  The Fianna Fáil Party have a new look Cabinet in the place of the previous one.  I am not saying anything against any of the new Ministers as individuals.  Instead of experienced men, such as we <Col N="1551" /> had on the 18th June last and on the 4th July last when the Dáil met, we now have a Cabinet of young men, some of whom are only in this House for a couple of years and have no experience.  Is it unreasonable to suggest that the Taoiseach should ask the people of Ireland to reaffirm their confidence in the Government and in the Fianna Fáil Party instead of asking this House to reaffirm its confidence in them?</P>
    <P>Let us consider the sort of Parliamentary exercise that we are engaged in here at the moment.  The Taoiseach is asking this House to reaffirm its confidence in the Government.  The Taoiseach is, in fact, asking his 75 Deputies for a vote of confidence in the Fianna Fáil Party after the events of last week.  The result of this vote is a foregone conclusion.  It is a sheer waste of time.  It could only be justified if, in the course of this debate, the Members of this House and the people of the country were given the full facts about this scandal which has burst on this country in the past week.  We want all the facts about the division in the Cabinet, and on the actions of a number of Cabinet Ministers in going their own way in grave national matters.  If this debate does not do something to clarify the public mind on the events of last week, then I repeat it is a waste of time.</P>
    <P>Over the short weekend we had in our constituencies, we tried to sound public opinion and to find out what the people were thinking and how they were reacting to the sacking of two Ministers and the resignations of two or three more Ministers.  What one found every place was that this question was being asked: &ldquo;What is it all about?  What has happened.&rdquo;  They could not believe their ears.  They were absolutely bewildered.  All we get from the Taoiseach to clarify the position and to put at ease the public mind is a vote of confidence introduced by himself and supported by an introductory speech by himself.  One would have expected that speech to deal with the problem, to deal with the question of collective responsibility within the Cabinet.  What do we find?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1552" /> We found the Taoiseach here, in his concluding speech on Saturday night, complaining that some Members of this party read their speeches.  But we found the Taoiseach here yesterday reading a history of the Fianna Fáil Party from 1926.  In view of his honest admission of a week or a fortnight ago that his roots in Fianna Fáil are not as deep as are those of some other people, perhaps it was reasonable that, when he went back to 1926, to the foundation of Fianna Fáil, it was necessary for him to read on.  However, he made a speech of more than a dozen typescript pages as transcribed by the official reporters.  Of all this speech, he devoted about one page, in a most evasive, ambiguous manner, dealing with the real subject matter of this vote of confidence&mdash;and we were as wise when he sat down, as before he stood up.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach did not face the issue. He talked about the 1920s, the 1930s, 1940s and about the years to come. This debate concerns the performance of this Government since it was elected on 18th June, 1969, to the date when a number of its Ministers were suspected of treachery by the Taoiseach. That is what this debate is about.  That is the period that should relevantly be covered by this debate.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste, Deputy Childers, also took part in this debate; he has just concluded his speech.  He is noted or known as a man who pays great attention to his subject and who deals with his subject very fully.  I expected, when he stood up here to speak this morning, that he would put up a case for the Government and for the Fianna Fáil Party.  I do not think I am being unfair to him if I say he dealt with the subject matter of this debate, with the division within the Cabinet, with the treachery within the cabinet, in about two minutes&mdash;repeating what he said on television the other night, repeating his statement that every member of the Fianna Fáil Party, if he was to remain in Fianna Fáil, would have to toe the party line and would have to accept party policy.  I was going to ask him a question but I decided not to do so because I would be accused of interrupting.</P>
    <P>Did the Tánaiste read the speeches <Col N="1553" /> which were made in Letterkenny on Sunday night last?  Did the Tánaiste consider the performance that was put on from Monaghan to Letterkenny?  In particular, did the Tánaiste, Deputy Childers, read the speech of the ex-Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, Deputy Blaney?  Having heard or read that speech, does the Tánaiste believe, even at this point of time, that the ex-Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries is toeing the party line, is accepting in full party policy?  I do not believe he is. I believe the ex-Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries made inflammatory speeches which indicate that, even at this time, he believes the people of Northern Ireland want the sort of assistance he thinks they should get.</P>
    <P>The only other Government speaker who took part, I think, in this debate was the Minister for Education, Deputy Faulkner.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBarry" hpid="Mr. R. Barry Mr. R. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Barry</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I had not the pleasure of hearing Deputy Dowling.  The Minister for Education, Deputy Faulkner, does not believe that there is a crisis at all. The Tánaiste, Deputy Childers, seems to accept that there is a crisis.  The Minister for Education dealt with the crisis or with the incidents of last week by describing it as a crisis fabricated by the wishful thinking.  That is what the Minister for Education thinks of treachery within the Cabinet.  That is what the Minister for Education believes failure of Government Ministers to accept Government policy amounts to.</P>
      <P>I believe we are dealing here with a very serious situation that needs serious attention.  I purpose to deal&mdash; briefly, I hope&mdash;with this Vote of Confidence. I do not believe the Taoiseach is entitled to a vote of confidence. As I said, the integrity of his party is on trial here; the integrity of his Government is on trial here.  Indeed, it follows that the integrity and suitability of the Taoiseach is on trial here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not believe the Taoiseach is entitled to a vote of confidence because, over the past number of years, he has proved himself to be a man of <Col N="1554" /> bad judgment, a man whose judgment is not sound, a man whose judgment cannot be relied upon in serious matters.  In particular, he is a bad judge of people.  He recommended to this House, less than 12 months ago, Deputy Blaney for the position of Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries and Deputy Haughey for the position of Minister for Finance.  Within 12 months, he has had to sack both of these men as unsuitable.  He also recommended Deputy Boland as Minister for Local Government and Deputy Moran as Minister for Justice.  He is now rid of these two men&mdash;having being forced to admit that he sacked Deputy Moran and that Deputy Boland left.  Surely a man who was so far out in assessing the worth and the suitability of one-third of his Cabinet is not a suitable Taoiseach, is not a man deserving of a vote of confidence of the members of this House and of the people of the country?</P>
    <P>I want to repeat and to put on record&mdash;because every time the Taoiseach asks for a vote of confidence it is our business to put on the record of this House in that particular debate why we consider he is not entitled to a vote of confidence&mdash;that the Taoiseach is not entitled to a vote of confidence because, twice within the past week, he has been untruthful to this House; he was neither candid nor frank when replying to Deputy Cosgrave before this scandal broke in the House. Deputy Cosgrave asked the Taoiseach if there would be any more resignations. The Taoiseach said he did not know what Deputy Cosgrave was talking about.</P>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">

Immediately after that Deputy Cosgrave asked if we might expect any further resignations, to which the Taoiseach replied that he did not know what the Deputy was talking <Col N="1555" /> about.

Of course, that does not excuse the Taoiseach.  He had already said he did not know what Deputy Cosgrave was speaking about but we all know now that, not alone did he expect further resignations at that point in time but, if we are to believe him, he had already asked for them.

        <i>(Cavan):</i> I am not naive.  I charge the Taoiseach with having been dishonest in the House in announcing the resignation of the Minister for Justice.  He stated, both in his communiqué of the morning and to the House, that the Minister had resigned on health grounds.  During the debate he emphasised his wish to make it clear that there was no question of Deputy Moran having been involved in anything.  However, we know that when Deputy Boland came out in the open <Col N="1556" /> he said he did not accept that the Minister had resigned but that he was of the opinion he had been pushed out.  It was only at the end of a very long debate of 36 hours that the Taoiseach conceded that he had visited the Minister in hospital in the morning and asked for his resignation.  He said the resignation was tendered in the afternoon. Is there anything more lying than a half-truth?</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach has failed completely to tell the House what his Minister for Finance and his Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries were up to.

      <P>The Taoiseach has told us that the matter has been referred to the Attorney General and that, on that account, he is precluded from elaborating on the details.  We must bear in mind that the Taoiseach has told us he did not consider the evidence he had to stand up to presentation in court, or words to that effect, but this loyal Taoiseach has referred the matters to the Attorney General for his consideration.

        <i>(Cavan):</i> I wish to say also that the Taoiseach is a weak Taoiseach.  He has no strength of character.  He has been tolerating all sorts of playacting within his Cabinet for the past couple of years.  If he had been in the driver's seat this sort of thing would never have occurred.  In a long debate like this there is a tendency for the real issues to become clouded.  At the moment the Taoiseach is saying that two of his ex-Ministers are not fit to be Ministers, that he has <i>prima facie</i> evidence against them to the effect that they were involved in activities detrimental to the State.  At the same time, the two ex-Ministers concerned are denying point blank their involvement in any such activity and saying that they were not guilty of any conduct justifying their dismissal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One would have expected, in any circumstances, that these ex-Ministers would have come in here and demanded that their names be cleared, that the Taoiseach withdraw the charges and that, if he did not do so, he would give them an opportunity of clearing their good names in public. This is what one would expect from normal people under normal circumstances. Instead, these Ministers are protesting their innocence and, not only that, but they are alleging the injustice of the charges made against them by the Taoiseach.  However, instead of demanding that their names be cleared, we find that they come in here and give the Taoiseach a vote of confidence. They are supporting the man who has <Col N="1558" /> treated them in that way.  Is it any wonder that the people are bewildered?</P>
    <P>We are being asked in this House to express our confidence in the Taoiseach and in the Government.  We are only assessing and judging this from outside but there are people who are in a far better position to know whether the Government are entitled to a vote of confidence or, in particular, whether the Taoiseach is entitled to a vote of confidence.  These are people who know the facts from within.  We are only looking at them from outside. In my opinion one of the people in the best position to judge is the honorary secretary of the Fianna Fáil Party&mdash; the former Minister for Local Government, Deputy Kevin Boland&mdash;a man who has been sitting at the Cabinet table since the first day he entered Dáil Éireann because he never went to the back benches until he left the other day.  Does Deputy Kevin Boland think the Government and the Taoiseach are entitled to a vote of confidence?  No, he does not.  He expressed his absolute lack of confidence in the Taoiseach and in the Government in the most tangible way anybody could&mdash;he forfeited his salary of £3,500 a year, he forfeited the use of a State car and two State drivers, rather than participate in the Government, rather than sit at a table presided over by the Taoiseach and surrounded by his colleagues because he said he did not think that he could conscientiously do so.  He said there were things going on in that Government that would not be tolerated in any other democratic country in the world.  He said the Taoiseach was a Hitler.  He did not use the word but&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I am about to tell the Minister.  He said the Taoiseach was engaged in Gestapo methods and the man who invented Gestapo methods was Hitler. How the Taoiseach can ask us for a vote of confidence in the light of that is beyond me.  Is it any wonder the people are bewildered?  We have reached a state of affairs where ex-Cabinet Ministers know the people do not believe what they are saying about <Col N="1559" /> simple things and simple facts.  The former Minister for Finance, the man who was regarded as the brains of the Government, fell off a horse, had an accident, was brought to hospital.  In the ordinary course one would expect that, if the ex-Minister for Finance stated that he fell off a horse, that would be the end of it and the people would accept it.  But the ex-Minister found it necessary to call a Press conference at his home, to get his solicitor there, to bring in members of his staff and get them to tell the world that he did, in fact, fall off a horse and that what he said was the truth.  Did anybody ever hear of such lack of confidence? How could any Government expect to have the confidence of the people when it is composed of men like that?</P>
      <P>This Government is split wide open. The Fianna Fáil Party is split wide open.  There are five members&mdash;four Ministers and a junior Minister&mdash;who have left or been sacked from the Government and they are supported by 14 or 15 members of the Fianna Fáil Party, if the reaction of those 14 or 15 Members within this House is any indication of where their loyalty lies. That is the position.  Yet, when this debate concludes all the Fianna Fáil Party&mdash;including those 15 members who applauded Deputy Kevin Boland and applauded Deputy Blaney&mdash;will walk into the &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; lobby and give the Taoiseach a vote of confidence. Such hypocrisy!  How could the people of the country have any respect for such a Government or such a party? How could they have respect for the laws enacted by such a Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are dealing here with the conduct of Government members on an emotional matter&mdash;the reunification of our country&mdash;but we cannot leave it at that.  We must ask ourselves how will men who have behaved as they have behaved on this grave national matter behave in other spheres of government.  The Government are responsible for the liberties of the people, for the laws and regulations which can make or break people in the field of town planning, in the field of grants, in the field of import and <Col N="1560" /> export licences.  How can the people of the country respect the administration of these matters by the present Government?</P>
    <P>We have complained in this House during the past number of years about an organisation known as Taca, an organisation composed of men who were supporting the Government by large subscriptions.  Political parties need funds.  Political parties must get subscriptions.  I do not see anything wrong with that.  However, it has been noticeable that some of the Ministers who have been involved in this scandal were driven in and out of this House and the precincts of this House, noticeably the Minister for Finance, by well-known Tacateers and that well-known Tacateers come in and out of this House and seem to be literally policing Ministers.  I have no objection to wealthy men having politics and to wealthy men subscribing to political parties&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">

        <i>(Cavan):</i>&mdash;&mdash;but I have the greatest objection to the type of wealthy character who wants power, who wants to control political power, who is not prepared to submit himself to the electorate for election but at the same time wants by his cheque book to wield influence over the Government and over Government Ministers.  I believe that is going on in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not believe that this Government can be entrusted with many of the problems that face this country in the future.  One problem which strikes me immediately is one which may arise in the months to come or in the years to come because of the situation in the Six Counties.  Does anybody here believe that in the situation now existing within the Fianna Fáil Party that the Fianna Fáil Party would be in a position to deal with any serious situation in Northern Ireland?  Is it not a fact that the quins about whom we have been speaking for the last number of days&mdash;the four Ministers and the junior Minister&mdash;would pull the carpet from under the Government <Col N="1561" /> in such a crisis, to use a favourite Fianna Fáil expression.</P>
    <P>I do not believe this Government can be trusted in the economic situation facing the country.  Government speakers have sought to turn this debate into an economic one.  The Taoiseach and other speakers have asked us for a vote of confidence arising out of the resignation and dismissals last week.  They have tried to get that vote of confidence on their performance in Government over the years.  Here are some facts, which will only take a couple of minutes to put on the record regarding the economic achievements of this Government in recent years. In 1967 our balance of payments surplus was £15 million.  The following year, 1968, that surplus was turned into a deficit of £22 million.</P>
    <P>In 1969 that deficit had increased to £60 million and this year, if we are to take the Budget Statement, it can be anything up to £90 million.  With regard to inflation, the price index rose an average of six per cent over the last three years, a rate exceeded only by three other OECD countries, Iceland, Yugoslavia and Portugal.  Is that any performance for the Government? I am quoting from the Budget Statement.  In fact, instead of the price index having increased by six per cent in the last year it has increased by about 15 per cent.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Education spoke in this debate about schools.  I would like to tell the House what the position about primary schools is.  The position with regard to grant funds for primary school buildings in the financial year ending 31st March, 1971, is such that many of the projects which have been approved in principle must be deferred so that priority may be given to projects of the most absolute urgency, that is, the provision of schools in areas of housing development where there are at present no primary education facilities and the replacement of existing school buildings which are in such structural condition as to be a danger to the health and safety of pupils and teachers.  That is the position regarding funds for primary school buildings; that is the position regarding the balance of payments; <Col N="1562" /> that is the position regarding inflation.</P>
    <P>What has the Budget done about this?  Indeed, a man down the country said to me over the weekend: &ldquo;You are talking up there about guns and toy guns.  You would be better engaged in employing some firm of international consultants to go into the Budget, vet the Budget and advise the country on it in view of the fact that it was drawn up by a Minister for Finance who has been proved to be completely unreliable.&rdquo;</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> The Taoiseach gives us no information. I want to say that the former Minister for Finance was sacked by the Taoiseach because the Taoiseach, who knows him far better than I do, considers him unsuitable to be a member of the Cabinet.  That is the reason that my constituent down the country, who is not a politician, suggested this Budget should be vetted closely because it was drawn up and presented to the Cabinet by a man who, in the considered view of the Taoiseach before it was introduced, was totally unsuitable to be a member of the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to detain the House much longer but there is one thing I must deal with.  According to the Tánaiste the Cabinet has been purged. I wonder has it been purged of all unsuitable Ministers?  We were told that any Minister who came under the slightest suspicion could not remain a member of the Government and that was why some members were shifted. I want to deal with the ex-Minister for Defence, the present Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, Deputy Gibbons.  There is a conflict here.  A young officer from my constituency, Captain James Kelly, was accused by the former Minister for Defence as being a man who was unsuitable for his position.  The Minister went on to state that because he considered him unsuitable he asked for his resignation and got rid of him.  Captain James Kelly, following that, called a Press conference&mdash;like the former Minister for Finance&mdash;and stated anything he did was under the instructions of his Minister for Defence and anything he did was in the course of his duty as an Army officer.  He said the statement of the former Minister for Defence under the privilege of this <Col N="1564" /> House was a tissue of lies.  He said the former Minister for Defence was an unmitigated scoundrel, thereby expressing his indignation at the accusations made against him by Deputy Gibbons.</P>
    <P>I want to say that Deputy Gibbons used the privilege of this House as a platform to attack this young Army officer.  This man denied the charges made against him, accused the Minister of telling lies and alleged the Minister was an unmitigated scoundrel.  I do not believe the House or the country could have confidence in a Government, one of whose members, Deputy Gibbons, has this cloud hanging over him.  This is not a cloud of Fine Gael making; it is not a cloud that has been created by the Opposition parties in this House.  This is a serious cloud hanging over the former Minister for Defence and I believe it is going a bit far to ask this House to express confidence in the Government so long as this man is a Minister of it, or at least until this matter has been clarified.</P>
    <P>This request by the Taoiseach for a vote of confidence is a worthless exercise. Unless we have another bombshell, the 75 members of Fianna Fáil will tramp into the &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; Lobby in support of the Taoiseach just as they expressed, without debate, their confidence in him in their party room last week.  When Fianna Fáil Deputies go into the &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; Lobby they will be tramping on the Constitution, and on what little reputation now remains with Fianna Fáil.  If the Taoiseach is serious about re-establishing his own and his party's reputation there is only one way in which he can do this.  It is not by asking 75 members of his own party, whose salaries are depending on their vote tonight, to vote for him; the only honest way is to ask the people if they think the same about Fianna Fáil as they did on 18th June last.</P>
    <P>The whole situation has changed since then and there is no use in Fianna Fáil pretending that their image is the same.  It does not matter whether this election is held in a month's time or if it is delayed for two or three years; the people will remember what has happened.  So long as this Government <Col N="1565" /> continue without a by-election, respect for the Government and for the decisions of Government Ministers will suffer.  The country will also suffer because any advice given by the Taoiseach or any of his Ministers will not be accepted or treated seriously by the people.  For that reason there should be a general election because this vote of confidence being sought here will not solve anything.  It was reasonable for the members of Fine Gael or Labour in the light of events last week, to put down a Motion of No Confidence in the Government but for the Taoiseach to propose a Vote of Confidence, inviting his own party-tied members to vote for him, is simply shadow-boxing.</P>

      <P>It is audacious of the Taoiseach to ask us to vote confidence in him having regard to the dreadful revelations of recent days.  In the eyes of the people of the country the Government are totally discredited and incompetent. We have noted with shock and dismay the spectacle of men who are more concerned with gun running <Col N="1566" /> than with conducting properly the affairs of our country, of men in responsible Cabinet positions who clearly were embarking on the mad escapade of war.  Instead of grappling effectively with the terrible social evils with which our people are afflicted, those men squandered the precious time of this House and their high offices and embarked in a Quisling-like escapade of destroying the peace and harmony which we have enjoyed for some considerable time in this part of Ireland. By their nefarious actions they have dragged our country and our institutions into disrepute throughout the world.</P>
      <P>Like many other people, I believe we are at last witnessing the disintegration of the once invincible Fianna Fáil Party.  Discredited as they are, they have lost the confidence of all right-thinking people and even their own supporters are aghast at the happenings of recent weeks.  They are stunned that long-standing Ministers of repute, like Deputies Haughey, Blaney, Boland and others should have in such flaggrant fashion betrayed the trust reposed in them in the mandate they received from the Irish people last June.  We now have the situation where the most able and experienced Ministers were found wanting in the first essentials of integrity, loyalty and responsibility.</P>
      <P>The new Ministers, whose appointment we were asked to approve, are immature; in many respects they are mediocre and it is the belief of many that they are inadequate to do the job required for the betterment of our country.  The Government are now being led from behind.  The Taoiseach's position is seriously threatened and the most experienced Ministers on whom he called in the past are now sitting on the back benches, breathing down his neck and constituting a threat to his leadership.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is evident from the terrible revelations of last week that things will never be the same again for Fianna Fáil. This shabby pretence of unity being displayed here will not fool anyone, least of all their own supporters.  It is the unity of frightened men who have been caught in surreptitious <Col N="1567" /> activities and convicted before the bar of public opinion in this country and in these islands, of men who have proved unworthy of the trust and confidence reposed in them by the Irish people and by their own Taoiseach. It is therefore the unity of rogues who, out of fear of facing the Irish people in a general election at this time, prefer to hang together rather than hang separately.</P>
    <P>It is a particularly nauseating spectacle to see these ex-Ministers and the other dissidents in the Government Party who support Deputy Blaney's attitude&mdash;rejected and dejected dissidents as they are, who have clearly revolted against their Leader and against his policies, who have opposed the Taoiseach publicly and repudiated him publicly in this House, who have refused to stand up and applaud him in this House&mdash;go sheepishly into the lobbies here to vote for him.  This is the most disgraceful spectacle which has ever been seen in this House, a spectacle of insincerity, duplicity and utter hypocrisy.  We would much prefer that these men, if they disagree, as they so obviously do, with the policy of their Leader on this vital issue of war or peace, whether we should have the gun back in Irish politics or not, would have the courage of their convictions and resign, or, alternatively, that the Taoiseach would take appropriate action against them and not merely remove them from his Cabinet but remove them from the party as well.</P>
    <P>It is clear that there is not a vestige of unity there, that there is now eating at the vitals of the Fianna Fáil Party a cancer which must be cut out or it will go on to destroy that party. The only question is whether that cancer is of a rapid or a slow growth; better that it be rapid than that the agony would be piled on.  That is why we believe that an election should be held at this time.</P>
    <P>Our people want peace, not war, our people want work, not guns.  Our people want a decent standard of living.  They do not want to be involved in fratricidal strife or another civil war.  Indeed in the kind of mad escapade in which <Col N="1568" /> these men were involved, it is frightening to think of the holocaust which could arise from their actions.  It is obvious that Deputy Blaney and his colleagues were trying to create something akin to General Custer's last stand, annihilation.</P>
    <P>Sufficient has been said in the marathon all-night debate of last week on the crisis situation.  It is pertinent to suggest that this unfortunate crisis should not be allowed to divert our people from the sorry mess which the Government have made of our economy.  The antics of Deputies Blaney, Haughey and Boland do seem to have diverted the attention of our people from the real issues involved in the welfare of our people.  Therefore I avail of this opportunity in supporting my party's motion of no confidence in the Government to advert to our economic situation: to the yawning gap in our balance of payments, to the ever-increasing imports of foreign goods of all kinds, to the fact that there is little protection now for native industry with foreign goods being displayed more and more on the shelves of shops and supermarkets, to the extent to which imports have brought about the dislocation of native industry and are creating unemployment.  It was a retrograde step on the part of this Government to remove in large measure the protection which native industry enjoyed and to engage in free trade with Britain at a time when we did not and could not enjoy the benefits of the larger market in Europe.</P>
    <P>We are particularly concerned about the dereliction of duty on the part of the ex-Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Government generally in respect of the cost of living.  No serious attempt whatsoever was made to curb increases in prices.  Prices of all commodities have been reaching dizzying heights, bringing with them terrible hardship and privation for the average family, and indeed the Budget introduced this year did nothing to remedy that worsening situation.</P>
    <P>Instead of making a serious attempt to deflate the economy, the increase of 2½ per cent in turnover tax had, and the then Minister for Finance well knew it, not merely an inflationary <Col N="1569" /> tendency to aggravate an already dangerous situation but it had an incendiary tendency.  We all know that the 2½ per cent increase in turnover tax will work out at nearer to 10 per cent on average by the time the profiteers, usurers, exploiters and gom-been men have finished adding 1d here and 2d there along the line.  It is a pity that Deputy Haughey, as Minister for Finance, did not concentrate on bringing in an honest Budget which would ensure that the weaker sections would be protected against rising prices and inroads into their living standards rather than engaging in gun running activities.</P>
    <P>The few commodities exempt from turnover tax are milk, bread and medicines, but the prices of even these commodities have not remained static. The prices of bread and milk have been increased.  On Friday, 1st May, the price of the 2 1b loaf was increased from 2s 1d to 2s 3d, the third time in the past 12 months in which bread, the staff of life of the people of this country, has had its price increased.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil members are wont to denigrate on every possible occasion the actions of the last inter-Party Government, but be it said to the eternal credit of that Government that they made it a matter of fundamental policy that there should not be increased prices in respect of the essentials of life, that the prices of bread, butter and such things would be subsidised rather than that the poor should have their standard of living torn down.  Now there is unbridled liberty in the matter of prices for any cartel or group or clique who wish to fix prices.  Those people can charge what they like without restraint of any kind and this situation is the product of dereliction of duty on the part of the Government.</P>
    <P>As I said, the 2 lb loaf of bread was increased by 2d and this, I submit, is not an increase of 2½ per cent but of 8 per cent.  We know the 2½ per cent increase in turnover tax has been and will be turned into a 10 per cent increase on average in respect of all items on grocers' shelves.  Another essential on the table of the average working class family is the potato.  We <Col N="1570" /> observe that the acreage under potatoes has been falling constantly.  The area under potatoes, 182,000 acres in 1964, had fallen to 136,000 acres in 1968.  In the interval, the price of potatoes to the Irish housewife increased per half cwt bag by 166 per cent from April, 1968, to April of this year.</P>
    <P>It is worth placing on the records of the House a reference to cost of living increase in the <i>Irish Times</i> of 5th May in an article by Mary Maher. In it there is reference to many of the essentials of life.  It will be seen that in regard to some of them, by sheer irresponsibility, by the grasping of the Minister for Finance for revenue, there is complete abandonment of price control. This has swept the essentials of life from the tables of the poor, particularly butter and meat.  Meat is now such a rare commodity that to my personal knowledge many working class families can afford to purchase a joint only for Sunday.  I will quote some of the figures given in the report I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>The T-bone steak was approximately 7s 6d a lb in April, 1968, and in April of this year it was 9s 6d, an increase of 27 per cent; round steak was approximately 5s per lb in April, 1968 and it was 6s in April of this year, an increase of exactly 20 per cent; various types of chops which were 3s 10d a 1b in April, 1968, were 4s 8d in April of this year, an increase of 27 per cent; mutton chops, 3s 10d a lb in April, 1968, were 5s in April, 1970, an increase of 14 per cent; pork cutlets and the like, 3s 10d a 1b in 1968 were 4s 9d a lb in April of this year, an increase of 24 per cent; bacon rashers were 3s 1d a 1b in April, 1968; they were 3s 8d a lb in April of this year, an increase of 19 per cent; collar bacon, which was 3s 6d a lb in April, 1968, was 4s 1d a lb in April this year, an increase of 16.6 per cent.</P>
    <P>There have been increases in prices of other commodities such as margarine. Indeed, the margarine producers will have little difficulty in selling their product <i>vis-à-vis</i> butter because butter, every lb of which exported by Bord Bainne is wrapped in a 2s postal order, is selling at approximately 5s a lb here, and more and more unfortunate <Col N="1571" /> families, especially large families, have been obliged to substitute margarine. It is sad to relate that in a country reputed to be flowing with milk and honey a pound of the butter for which the Irish housewife has to pay approximately 5s is available to her emigrant son or daughter in Britain at approximately 3s 6d.  The price of lard, milk, cream, butter, potatoes, onions, carrots, tomatoes, cabbages and all these things has increased by very considerable percentages.  Between April, 1968, and April of this year onions increased in price by 86 per cent, cabbages by 50 per cent and the good old spud, without which no dinner is worth while, by 166 per cent.</P>
    <P>The same sad tale relates to clothing, furniture, household goods and rents.  In a situation where prices are spiralling Government Ministers pass audacious comments whenever workers seek to improve their lot by calling for increased wages.  He is a very foolish man indeed who thinks, in an irresponsible situation of this kind where our people have been literally thrown to the wolves in respect of price control, or lack of price control, that the working classes or their trade unions will acquiesce rather than fight, militantly if need be, in order to maintain decent living standards for all our people.</P>
    <P>It is in the matter of price control that the Government stand most severely indicted.  Deputy Haughey has turned shopkeepers into tax collectors, and no attempt is made to cushion the impact of the cost of living.  It makes me sick in the stomach to hear Fianna Fáil Deputies taunting us on the Labour benches about not voting for increases for the needy in our society, namely, the old age pensioner, the widow, the orphan or the unemployed.  We have a situation where the small increase of 5s a week in the pension will be eroded when the pensioner goes to the grocery shop to buy the essentials of life.</P>

      <P>The Government would have done far more for the people by maintaining rigid price control than by doling out annually sops of this kind. We are not concerned about the 5s or 10s increase; we are concerned about the value of that increase and with maintaining a decent standard of living.  It is of no consequence what increase is given to the old age pensioner, the widow, the orphan or the unemployed, if that increase is dissipated by other Government action such as the additional 2½ per cent turnover tax which will end up by being 10 per cent or more in most circumstances.  The Government are two-timing the less well-off in our society.  It is tantamount to making a mockery of their sufferings to give an increase of this kind without providing for stability of prices as far as possible.  Those who were given increased benefits in the Budget, many of whom will have to wait until August to receive the increases, realise full well that the increases are of no value at all because immediately the additional 2½ per cent turnover tax was mentioned there were price increases all along the line.  Prices will continue to increase and there is no one in the Government to say: &ldquo;Stop.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These price increases are having a ruinous effect on our economy particularly with regard to our tourist trade. Reference has been made here to the damage done to our tourist trade as a result of the recent happenings in this House.  I do not want to elaborate on that, but I think the high prices charged for meals and accommodation constitute a serious threat to our tourist industry.  Perhaps some increases are justified but I am sure others are not.  This is a free-for-all society.  This is essentially a capitalist's paradise <Col N="1573" /> where one section of the people are clearly given liberty to exploit the other as much as they can.  The people most exploited are my class, the working class of this country, the people who pay all and pay through the nose.</P>
    <P>The housewife is distraught trying to make ends meet on an average wage of £12, £14 or £15 a week. On every occasion on which she goes into her grocery shop she finds that prices are going up all the time.  By dint of great endeavour, by sacrifice and by long strikes, her husband may get an increase in wages; but such an increase is quickly eroded by an increase in his differential rent and increased prices generally.  Not only are people unable to maintain their living standards or improve on them but these standards are falling.  This is what the Government have done by their abject dereliction of duty in this important matter of price control.</P>
    <P>I listened to the Taoiseach for some time and I must say I was not impressed by his contribution.  He talked about advances in health, education, welfare and housing.  It would be easy for me to counteract these erroneous statements but it would take me a long time.  In regard to housing, the Taoiseach cannot sound his own trumpet because we have a colossal problem in that regard.  In addition, we have a burning issue in respect of rents, an issue which has angered thousands of people in this city and in many other cities and towns.</P>
    <P>We have a system of graded or differential rents which is supposed to ensure that all who need a house will receive a house irrespective of their ability to pay.  It has now transpired that because of the manner in which the differential rent system is being administered by public officials the system has become a great scourge on tenants of council or corporation houses.</P>
    <P>Despite the best endeavours to bring harmony into this tenant action which is going on, housing authorities are powerless to amend these differential rent systems in any significant way.  We had the big stick being used by the ex-Minister for Local Government, Deputy Boland, and his predecessor, Deputy Blaney, to the effect <Col N="1574" /> that if local authorities did not adopt differential rent schemes they would be denied essential grants for house building.  This is a sort of blackmail which is greatly to be deplored.  I would ask that housing authorities be given back their autonomy, the power and the control over the costing of houses and the rent systems.</P>
    <P>It is true that commendable progress has been made in regard to education but I do not think we can say we have free education in the real sense until such time as we have free schoolbooks as well.  It is to be deplored that children must undergo a humiliating and degrading investigation before they receive free books.  In the main it is only those children whose parents have medical cards who are provided with free books.  This odious means test, which is carried out annually in almost every school, is a source of great embarrassment and humiliation to parents and particularly to the children.  It is not nice to be shown up in school as being one who must be subsidised and given charity. That is an unfortunate position for any child to be in and, of necessity, it must have a very bad psychological effect on the child.  I am availing of this opportunity to ask that the educational system be improved to the extent of providing free books and educational appliances of all kinds and that this regrettable means test be abolished at once.</P>
    <P>While on this question of a means test I want to advert briefly to the Department of Health and the improvements envisaged in our health services.  For a long number of years we have been advocating improvements in these services and some worthwhile improvements, we are assured, will have taken place by this time 12 months.  The improvements to which we look forward most of all are the liberalisation of the means test for medical cards, the choice of doctor and the abolition of the archaic dispensary system.  While awaiting these much-needed improvements it is disconcerting in the extreme to find that county managers and health authority administrators generally, even in the light of the forthcoming legislation, have done <Col N="1575" /> nothing to ease the situation for people who are in need of medical cards, drugs, medicines and medical appliances of various kinds.  The same odious means test applies and instead of a liberalisation in respect of these matters there has been, to my knowledge, a cutback in respect of certain services.  This is to be greatly deplored. From time to time we have asked that, pending the implementation of the new Act, managers would be advised to liberalise the means test for medical cards and make them available to a great number of people who are now in such great need of this service and generally to apply the spirit and intention of the legislation we passed here and which I hope will be implemented within 12 months.</P>
    <P>I referred briefly already to our balance of payments, to the rising incidence of imports of foreign goods of all kinds, the dislocation of major industries and rising unemployment and to the fact that there is evidence that our distributive trade is being taken over very largely, if not completely, by foreigners.  This is a very worrying situation.  There is also the fact that nothing definite is being done at present to assist industry which is finding itself in difficulty due to trading or other reasons.</P>
    <P>I know of many industries which have found themselves in difficulty and sought Government aid.  While we have had all kinds of assurances that the matter was being investigated and that everything possible would be done to assist the industry in difficulty, nothing tangible has accrued and, to my personal knowledge, I have seen in my own constituency the strongest possible representations made repeatedly by Deputies, by local public representatives, by the workers themselves and by management to the Minister for Industry and Commerce and to the various agencies under his Department, crying out for an urgent injection of capital, a rescue operation for a particular industry, and those representations have been met with nothing but the usual assurances. Nothing definite was done and one major industry in my own home town has closed as a result of nothing being <Col N="1576" /> done.  We have had nothing but pious platitudes from the Minister for Industry and Commerce and from the various State agencies.  That factory has closed; 200 workers have lost their jobs; some £70,000 was paid out in redundancy money, in lump sums and weekly payments, and had that £70,000 or £80,000 been given to the industry when overtures were first made and we alerted the Minister to the risks it is quite conceivable that the industry could have been saved.  But that industry was let go by default.</P>
    <P>We have more industries in the same position in my constituency, industries which are in jeopardy.  I do not wish to name names but I have permission to mention one particular industry.  It is an industry employing 100 people in the Ballingarry tourist district, Carroll System Buildings, which was unfortunately burned down a relatively short time ago, throwing 100 highly skilled men out of employment.  That industry produced a timber product which was highly valued and deeply appreciated by many Departments of State, including the Department of Education; the industry provided timber buildings by way of additional accommodation of one kind or another.  The product was excellent.</P>
    <P>The industry derived its raw materials from native resources, our own woods and forests, and it employed local people in an area in which there is no alternative employment.  It was an industry which would and could survive in Common Market circumstances. It was an industry which would prosper and grow despite the existence of a Free Trade Area Agreement.</P>
    <P>The strongest representations were made to the Minister for Industry and Commerce and to the Industrial Development Authority, and various other agencies, and up to today nothing definite has transpired by way of State aid through the medium of grants to resurrect this wonderful industry, like the Phoenix, from the ashes in which it lies today.  As one public representative sitting in this House since 1955, I personally have seen very little evidence of positive help when an industry is in difficulty.  I pinpoint this industry here now and I earnestly appeal to <Col N="1577" /> the Taoiseach and to his new Minister for Industry and Commerce to come to the rescue of this promising industry, help us to revive it and thereby maintain the jobs of some hundred highly skilled workers.  Time is running out because these skilled craftsmen cannot remain on in an area in which there is no employment for them. They will have to find employment elsewhere thereby stultifying any possibility of reviving this splendid native industry.  A month is too long to wait for a Government agency to act when it is a matter of a rescue operation, of an immediate injection of capital or the provision of maximum grants. This is an instance in which the Minister for Industry and Commerce, the Industrial Development Authority, the Industrial Credit Corporation and all the other agencies under the Minister's control, have been dilatory and hesitant&mdash;even, indeed, suspicious&mdash;in not facing up to the issue and resurrecting the company quickly.  To delay is to endanger the future of the company and to throw the workers on the unemployment scrapheap either in Ballingarry or Callan labour exchanges.</P>
    <P>There are other industries in difficulty, about one of which I shall be talking to the Minister for Industry and Commerce later today.  It employs 200 people.  Immediate assistance is required. If there is the same dilatory approach, with investigation and inquiry, and one thing and another, it is quite clear, to me at any rate, that yet another wonderful enterprise, employing 200 people, the economic life of the area concerned, will go to the wall. Mark you, I have a feeling that this is something the Minister for External Affairs and his colleagues in Government have come to accept as something inevitable.  With their faces turned towards Europe and with their minds fixed on their own free trade area agreement they have come to accept as inevitable this particular pattern of evolution: a great many of our industries must go to the wall.  That is one of the reasons why they have been so hesitant in coming to the rescue of industry in difficulty.</P>
    <P>It will be a very great tragedy, indeed, if industries of the kind to which I refer are treated in this disdainful <Col N="1578" /> fashion by responsible Ministers of State and their various agencies merely because the industries have got into difficulty through no fault of their own. But this seems to be the attitude: the big combine will survive and the small industry must go to the wall.  This is also true of the small farm.  This is the direction in which the minds of these men are gravitating, towards things big, B-I-G, with no respect for either the small or the weak.  If this continues we will have industrial graveyards in many of our towns and cities. We will have countless thousands of dead men on the economic battlefield. This is something the Fianna Fáil Government regard as inevitable.  In their mad desire for association with Britain under a free trade area agreement, in which all the advantages lie with Britain&mdash;that is something we proved conclusively&mdash;and little advantage on our side.  That is one of the reasons why we have a yawning gap in our balance of payments and an ever-increasing and alarming growth in the shops of foreign goods instead of home manufactured goods.</P>
    <P>I was pleased that some endeavour was made in the Budget to give concessions to income tax payers for the first time since PAYE was introduced. The improvements provided, however, are too small and inadequate to be of any real benefit to the mass of workers caught in the net of PAYE.  PAYE, which many of us supported, is no longer the painless extraction of money from the pockets of workers.  It hurts deeply.  It hurts to the extent that it has become a disincentive which is affecting production.  To my personal knowledge many excellent schemes of productivity have been frustrated because workers realise that what they were about to secure by extra effort would, in the main, go in income tax. There has been disregard for the hardships people are suffering under this system and the trifling improvement made on this occasion leaves much to be desired.</P>
    <P>One of the anomalies in the income tax code is that so many people are excluded from paying, or are able to evade income tax and that the only <Col N="1579" /> people caught in the net are the workers.  Another blatant anomaly is that agricultural workers are obliged to pay full income tax on every pound they earn over approximately £6 10s a week.  Agricultural workers are very rare at present; thousands of them have fled the land and it is an absurd situation that the farmer is exempt from income tax while workers are not. It is high time to give social justice to the agricultural worker and give him some incentive to maintain himself and his family on the land and so help to create greater productivity.  If farmers are entitled to exemption I submit the workers are even more entitled to it. This is something we had hoped the Minister would deal with in his Budget.</P>

I shall not develop that argument much further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I sincerely hope the day is not far off when we shall have a change of Government.  I have held certain convictions through the years in respect of my personal approach and that of my party to the formation of government. The events of recent weeks have very largely changed my attitude to this matter.  I realise now that we have had irresponsible and dangerous government for too long.  We have had government which could conceivably embroil us in a war.  In these circumstances I look forward to working and fighting for an alternative government at the earliest opportunity, a government which will provide good administration by men of integrity, responsibility and honour.  It is high time a breath of clean, fresh air penetrated our State agencies and all the corridors of power to sweep out the cobwebs of conservatism and indifference and, I may say, intrigue.  I believe that when <Col N="1580" /> the opportune time comes the Irish people will give us an alternative government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Minister for External Affairs (Dr. Hillery) Patrick J. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Minister for External Affairs (Dr. Hillery)</NameTxt>
      <P>The motion is one of confidence in the Government and while I appreciate that the total range of Government policies, achievements and activities comes into the picture, I think that at this time the immediate reason for the motion is the question of confidence in our policy in regard to the North of Ireland.  This is the occasion for the debate.  The Opposition seem to offer themselves as an alternative and this is the real issue: which would be the better Government at this time.  The Opposition are offering themselves as a credible alternative on the basis of a policy in relation to the north which would exclude altogether the use of armed force.  This is the policy of Fianna Fáil as declared by the Taoiseach on behalf of our party.  So, as far as confidence in our policy and its probable success is concerned and the exclusion of any other policies that could bring any disastrous effects, we are at one.</P>
      <P>Perhaps in this area of policy the Opposition are leaning on the question of whether we can implement this policy having regard to recent events. I think recent events have proved that we are willing and have the authority to deal with any situation which would cast doubt on our capacity to implement this policy in regard to Northern Ireland.  The action taken by the Taoiseach makes it clear that this party can implement the policy enunciated by the Taoiseach, his two predecessors and by several other spokesmen.  The faith of the Opposition in their ability to implement such a policy seems to be founded on the hope that only the recent events in Fianna Fáil history will be noted and that their own credibility will not be questioned. Nobody on the other side of the House has any right to assume that what has happened on this side could not happen with them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only thing that any man on the opposite side of the House could offer would be that, if he were Taoiseach and this happened, he would deal with <Col N="1581" /> it as the Taoiseach would have dealt with it.  As I say, speaking for themselves, men on the opposite benches, committed to the policy on which we all agree, would say that they would guarantee that they would follow every path which this policy would lead to; but only a man who was Taoiseach would guarantee that he would so behave in relation to other members as the Taoiseach has now behaved, only that man could guarantee a Government from that side capable of implementing that policy.</P>
    <P>I did not intend to get right into the question of the North of Ireland.  While the Opposition parties are agreed&mdash;and I am glad they are&mdash;among themselves and agreed with us on the policy of this State in relation to the North of Ireland they are hardly agreed on the policy in relation to something which is almost as vital and perhaps when history is written it will be regarded as equally important as our behaviour in relation to the North of Ireland at this time, that is, our negotiations to become part of Europe.  I do not think the Opposition are united on this.</P>

      <P>The two sections who came together last Sunday and roused me from the little bit of leisure I got at the end of a rather strenuous week to deal with some points they made in sweet harmony, almost to music.</P>
      <P>To get back to the EEC.  I do not think they are agreed on this.  If I can interpret, the Fine Gael Party are exactly as we are in relation to the European Community.  The Labour Party seem to have the attitude that we must join but they are reluctant, without courage and without faith. They keep trying to undermine any confidence we have in the future of Europe or Ireland's future within Europe.  While the two parties may be basically agreed then that membership of Europe is in the future for us, Fine Gael are much more positive in their attitude to the development of Europe than Labour.  Labour would drag along, in the hope I think, that it would never happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I mentioned the EEC because there <Col N="1582" /> are large areas of policy on which the two Opposition parties would not agree.  In some weeks' time we will be involved with the member states in determining the terms of entry of this country.  The negotiations, with the problems and complexities involved, may be drawn out and difficult; but it is no exaggeration to say that on the outcome of these negotiations will to a large extent depend the fate and the shape of Europe in the decades to come.  I hope we shall go into these negotiations in a determined and positive spirit and, of course, as we have indicated already, conscious of the need to ensure our own economic and social interests.</P>
    <P>It is clear to me anyway at this time, and I think it is clear to the spokesmen of Fine Gael to whom I have listened, that there is much more involved in this than the simple admission of four more countries into an economic bloc.  At their meeting at The Hague last December, from which the positive developments of the Communities have flown in recent months, the heads of states or Governments of the member states emphasised again their belief in their political objectives. I want to get this on the records of the House.  The political objectives which they set at the time gave the Community&mdash;and I quote their own words&mdash;&ldquo;its meaning and purport&rdquo;. They stated their determination to carry the undertaking through to the end and their agreement at the time to start negotiations with applicant countries referred not just to the acceptance by these applicant countries of the Treaties of Rome and Paris but also their aceptance&mdash;and I quote&mdash;&ldquo;of the political finality&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>What the talks and negotiations which will be opening in a few weeks time, probably on 30th June, will be concerned with in essence is the political shaping of Europe in the long term. We will be going into these negotiations with a clear realisation of that fact that we are dealing with the political shaping of Europe.  The economic arguments for Ireland to seek entry to the EEC have been spelled out on many occasions and in the White Paper which we published recently on the implications of membership.  I cannot <Col N="1583" /> see how anyone could attempt to refute the validity of these economic arguments.</P>
    <P>Apart from the economic aspect our application for membership is based also and ultimately on the conviction of Ireland's inevitable role in joining with other Europeans in shaping a unified Europe which will be a potent force for peace not only on our continent but in the world.  The Fianna Fáil Government are convinced of the role which Ireland has to play in shaping Europe and we are equally convinced&mdash;and over the next weeks and months and years we will have to spell it out for our constituents and for everyone in the country&mdash;that remaining remote from this historic process Ireland would be doomed not only to economic stagnation but to international isolation and ineffectiveness. I want to say that we want better than that for our country.  As an independent country we should be joining with other independent democratic states in Europe in erecting a structure of a politically unified Europe, participation in which will ensure for Ireland her own survival and the maintenance of her own identity.  We are fully aware that full participation in this unified Europe which will be created will involve obligation for all countries taking part, including our country.  The validity of this concept of a unified Europe will be determined by the willingness of those participating to act in close concert in political as well as economic affairs.  It will involve inevitably a willingness to take part, to participate in common action if the need arose in the defence of the new Europe.  It would be as ridiculous for Ireland in the context of being an integral component of this new Europe not to join, if called upon and if needed in its defence, as it would be for us at this present time to forsake our present commitment to the defence of our own territory.</P>
    <P>The past ten years have witnessed grave disappointments and setbacks in the forward movement towards European unity.  This historic process of the unification of Europe has its own inevitability. The opening of negotiations at the end of June will create significant <Col N="1584" /> momentum.  The member States are already engaged in deliberations on the form which the politically unified Europe of the future may take.  Ireland herself, as a member State, will have her own significant contribution to make to these deliberations.  As I said, this is one of the most vital periods in our history.  This is one of the most important policies ever enunciated in this Parliament.  It is totally necessary that we should be quite clear on what we are joining, on what we hope to see achieved in Europe, and on what our obligations will be.</P>
    <P>The confidence of the House in the Opposition parties to make a contribution which would be more positive, more realistic and more clearheaded than ours is very much to be doubted. Until the Labour Party are much more clear, or get rid of their reluctance, or stop niggling at the heels of people who are positively taking a part, or else take a completely opposite view, then they cannot say that the two parties opposite can unite about this major policy.  They have agreed on the policy in the North of Ireland among themselves and agreed with us in what that policy should be.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1585" /> I will get back now to the question of the policy on Northern Ireland. While Deputy Dr. Cruise-O'Brien was speaking I was thinking &ldquo;What would a person do who came on this scene now and who wanted to set about finding a solution?&rdquo;  I was thinking that there are several different types of personality who would have several different objectives in mind.  We have to be aware that there are people who see a solution in the North of Ireland as a victory of one tradition over another. We have people who look upon the events in the North of Ireland on a purely sectarian basis.  If the solution in the North of Ireland means anything to me and to this party it is a solution which will permit Irishmen of different traditions, different religions and different classes&mdash;although I prefer to think of different types of work rather than &ldquo;classes&rdquo; such as the professional men, the workmen and the businessmen&mdash;to live together in peace and harmony.  I know there are people who do not accept that as the objective but without that objective we cannot implement policies which have any chance of success.</P>
    <P>In saying this I would like to say that I am conscious that many people in both parts of our country will have to examine their attitudes of the question of the re-unification of the country. They will have to examine their own motives.  We will have to establish our right to find solutions in our own generation at our own time.  We are all influenced by history and we cannot disregard it.  At this time I would like to establish the right of every generation to start their own tradition if necessary, and their total freedom to seek a solution in honesty with themselves.</P>
    <P>I would like to assure this House that what has happened in the past week does not change the attitude of the Government on policy in the north as stated by the Taoiseach last September in Tralee.  What happened last week does not change the facts on which the Taoiseach based his remarks in his speech to the Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis on 17th January last.  The first step towards any sort of a peaceful future for the North of Ireland is to eliminate by legislative and any other <Col N="1586" /> administrative means necessary the discriminations imposed on the northern minority by deliberate government policy there for the past 50 years.  We have assurances that this will be done. These assurances are not simply private promises of goodwill.  They are contained in formal documents issued by the British Government and confirmed in formal assurances issued by the Stormont Government.  They were stated by the permanent representative of Great Britain at the United Nations for the information of representatives of all the member countries here.  Lord Caradon assured the Security Council that the determination to achieve equality will be pursued relentlessly.  In all my subsequent discussions in London I have missed no opportunity of stating the need to press on with reform.</P>
    <P>While progress is being made in the direction of reform, however painfully slow the process may seem at times, it would appear to me reasonable to assume that the British Government will continue to insist on reform as they have promised.  The times demand greater speed and not the slightest faltering. In this matter Deputy Dr. Cruise-O'Brien asked me what I meant by saying the British can contribute.  The Deputy pointed out, as I already knew, the difficulty that the people in Britain have of understanding the personality of the North of Ireland or of any Irishman.  What the British can do is suggest to the people in the North of Ireland who trust them that they should turn their faces south and that we will not bite them.  It may be that many people in the North of Ireland do not trust us now.  I think the British Government can play a part there by helping the people in the north to seek a solution and not to be afraid.  They have no reason to be afraid of us.</P>

      <P>Neither have we, but we all have our ideas.  Would the Taoiseach agree that only a week before this crisis broke in the country he did not consider the time appropriate for a debate on Northern Ireland, despite our request that it was necessary to have one?  Would he agree, in the light of the obvious necessity at that time of having a debate on Northern Ireland, that at this stage he should reconsider his ground of appropriateness of action in seeing the British Minister?  It is quite clear from the attitude of his party now that the British Government had a vital role to play and you admit they have a vital role to play in preserving peace in the north.</P>

The Taoiseach then gave the very same reply to cheers and applause from these benches.  There are no cheers today.  Is the Taoiseach still standing over the idea that free rein will be given to the various theories in his party at present on how unification will be achieved?  There will be these voices continuing&mdash;Deputy Blaney, Deputy Boland and others, all subscribing to this fictitious policy of yours on unity.</P>

As I explained in reply to a question by the Deputy on 29th April, 1970, the Government reviewed special service charges in mid-1968 and arranged for substantial reductions in the higher charges.  These reductions, which amounted to 50 per cent and more in some cases, are the maximum which can be arranged at present.</P>

      <P>The claims for unemployment benefit of a number of employees of the firm in question were disallowed by decision of a statutory deciding officer on the ground that they had lost employment by reason of a stoppage of work which was due to a trade dispute at their place of employment.  The disallowance of benefit was made under the provisions of section 17 (2), as amended, of the Social Welfare Act, 1952, which precludes payment of unemployment benefit to a person who has lost employment for this reason, except in certain defined circumstances which <Col N="1610" /> were held by the deciding officer not to apply in the cases in question.

Does the Minister not know that a number of people who have been employed casually on this site by firms with no connection whatever with Cement Limited, except that they are employed as contractors by that firm, have been refused benefit with the result that a lot of people have had a very hungry four or five weeks? They were working while Cement Limited was closed for a month or six weeks.  Never mind the appeals. Will the Minister look into this matter?

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Indeed, I should like to say, in reply to the Deputy's supplementary question, that all those people who have been insinuating I am not concerned about the cement strike must know that this is completely wrong.  I am very much concerned, but I am also concerned that the adequate institutions provided for settling this or any other strike are used to the fullest extent.  By intervening at an inappropriate time I would only weaken those institutions, which we all agreed should be set up.  I do not see what my intervention would accomplish, because we must view this strike in the context of the general economic situation.  This is not the only strike we are likely to have.  How we handle it and how the institutions available for settling the strike are used will establish a precedent for future negotiations.  I am gravely concerned about how this matter is handled.  Certain weaknesses have been revealed which, I am glad to say, may be remedied. I am not prepared to jump in at the deep end at the wrong time. However, anyone who suggests that we are not concerned is very much in error.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>We appreciate that the Minister does not want to jump in at the deep end while negotiations are <Col N="1613" /> at a delicate stage.  However, would the Minister not agree that, after 15 weeks in which building throughout the country has been held up, he might take a leaf out of the book of a previous Minister who was dealing with a matter of this kind and attempt to do something about it.  In the past a Minister who was a member of the Labour Party sat up all night and settled a strike which was not as important as this one.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is referring to a time when everybody was trying to settle strikes.  Since then we have set up machinery for the purpose of dealing with strikes.  That machinery has the support of all Deputies and is representative of both management and unions.  I am concerned that that machinery will be seen to work.  There is no use in talking about gimmicks and stunts at a time when they are not likely to be effective&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I do not mind sitting up ten nights if it would bring results.  However, I shall not in any way undermine the authority of the institutions we have established.  I should prefer to try to strengthen them because they are adequate and there is no purpose achieved in downgrading them by the Minister's intervention. Undoubtedly, he would then be asked to intervene in every other dispute.</P>

      <P>We appreciate the reluctance of the Minister not to jump in at the deep end of any industrial dispute and his anxiety to preserve the existing industrial relations machinery and its authority.  Would the Minister not consider, after 15 weeks' strike and the likelihood that it will last for another month at least, that acting under the auspices of the Labour Court he might consult with trade unions and employers and use his good offices to expedite a settlement?  We appreciate that it is not the Minister's function to settle the dispute&mdash;that it is the function of the parties concerned.

However, I wish to repeat again that we have been in close contact with the situation all this time.  To my mind, there exists suitable machinery for dealing with these strikes and it should be used to the utmost.  Perhaps it is being used now.

      <P>In the confident expectation, based on the best information available at the time, that the bills of quantities would be completed by <Col N="1624" /> the first week in April, I said in the course of my reply to the Adjournment Debate on the 12th February last that tenders for the new station would be invited some time in April.  To my disappointment and regret it has not been possible to do this.  Due to the resignation of the architect in the Office of Public Works who had prepared the plans for the building, certain details could not be furnished to the quantity surveyor to enable him to complete the bills on schedule.  The need to have the outstanding details assembled by another architect, who had not originally been concerned in the preparation of the plans, has had a retarding effect on the work, and in the event, it now seems probable that it will not be possible to have the tenders invited until about the end of next month.  Everything possible is being and will be done to have this timetable improved upon.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Minister for External Affairs (Dr. Hillery) Patrick J. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Minister for External Affairs (Dr. Hillery)</NameTxt>
      <P>Before Question Time I had begun to speak about our policy in relation to the North of Ireland and I ask your permission, Sir, to make a short resumé of what I said because I should like that what I have said will hang with what I am about to say.  I said the people living in the country now, particularly the young people, are entitled to make their own examination of all the considerations involved in the formulation of a policy and in its acceptance.  They are entitled to set the objectives which they would require of any policy to find solutions, and I suggest that the objectives should be the acceptance of all our traditions&mdash;not the dominance of one tradition over another but the acceptance of all our traditions <Col N="1625" /> working for the different people in our community, different religions, different classes, the different types of professions, workmen, businessmen and so on, having them live together in harmony and peace.</P>
      <P>I said earlier that the events of the last week do not change in any way the attitude of the Government on policy in relation to the north as stated by the Taoiseach in Tralee last September; nor do the events of the last week change the facts on which the Taoiseach based his remarks in relation to this in his speech at the Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis in January.</P>
      <P>The first step I would suggest towards a peaceful solution in the north is the complete elimination of the discrimination which had been imposed by deliberate government policy in that part of the country during many years. We have assurances on this, and I think it is reasonable to assume that the British Government will continue to insist on reform, as they have promised in formal documents in the UN and in formal assurances from the Stormont Government.  I said that the times demand greater speed and not the slightest faltering.  At this time, I think it is reasonable to assume that they will pursue their policy of reform.</P>
      <P>At this time it seems to me that that is as far as I can deal with the first step of getting rid of discrimination. The second step, which can only follow the implementation of reforms, is reconciliation among Irish people. From today, all of us should set about defining what Irish people are and whom we mean when we speak about &ldquo;our people&rdquo; in the North.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>We have from time to time to tease out a clear image of Irishmen&mdash;Protestants, Presbyterians, Catholics&mdash;lapsed and practising&mdash; workers, journalists, doctors&mdash;all Irishmen. It is a complex subject, this reconciliation among Irish people.  It is steeped in history, replete with mistakes, errors, and I think that politicians on all sides of this House and in <Col N="1626" /> all parts of this country should remind themselves that mistakes can be made on all sides.  It is not possible and, as I said earlier, not desirable, that one sole tradition in Irish history should make an attempt to dominate another. We have seen how such an attempt failed utterly in the north.</P>
      <P>Shall we, for our part here, now attempt to translate that failure to the whole of the country, or shall we take the alternative of trying to understand that the only solution to the Irish question is that which recognises the value of all our Irish traditions?  Starting from such a recognition we could work to bring them together peacefully. Personally, I have no doubt that the process of reconciliation, following on the creation of conditions conducive to mutual respect of people living in the north will result in the wearing away of irrational fears and will make it possible in due time to bring the people of our country together.</P>
      <P>We ourselves have a great deal to do to make our own society acceptable to all our people, and again I think we should reflect on what &ldquo;all our people&rdquo; means whenever we mention the term. I said in the UN that it was a grave injustice&mdash;I think it was one of the greatest acts of political folly&mdash;to divide Ireland 50 years ago.  I should like to say now that it would be criminal neglect if we ourselves do not make every effort, take every step, to make our country a fit home for &ldquo;all our people&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Fears have been expressed to me&mdash; I have already informed the House of this and I have said it elsewhere&mdash;by groups who came to me from the North of Ireland and by people living here who have relatives there and who have contacts there, that some kind of renewal of oppression is in store for the minority in the north.  We have to take these fears into account.  We must consider whether these fears are justified, and if they are justified what shall we do.  On this subject, responsible men must use every resource of intelligence and information to discover the truth because this type of situation is very easily ignited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My own conclusion, which, as I have told the House, follows lengthy examination, <Col N="1627" /> is that these fears of the minority and for the minority are understandable but exaggerated.  Even if they are exaggerated, I have brought to the notice of Ministers in the British Government the fact that people are living in fear in the North of Ireland.  I have brought to their notice all the fears that have been related to me by people in the north. I think this is what I was expected to do when visited by groups from the north.</P>
    <P>What should we do?  Our policy must in the first instance be a preventive one: we should do what we can to see that there shall not be any renewal of terror, any renewal of oppression.  It is consistent with this policy that arms should not be made available to elements of the minority in the north. If, however, serious violence should be attempted against the minority by elements of the majority, there are means available now to prevent it from succeeding.  Those who would try it will bear a heavy responsibility and pay heavy consequences.  These means which I am mentioning, but not describing, are more reliable than anything which can be achieved by yielding to demands for guns.  I said we have a preventative and protective role in such contingencies and we shall continue to assert them.  I would condemn other methods as subversive to our declared and accepted policy.  I would condemn them as dangerous to the life and peace of all our country. I would condemn them as damaging to our position internationally.  We are peacemakers; we do not rant and rave against any part of our own country. We do not rant and rave against any group or section of our people.  We do not demand anyone's surrender.</P>
    <P>It is difficult for us in this part of the country to control our emotions and the strength of our feelings but I am certain that the policy of re-unification with other Irishmen cannot be achieved by attacking those other Irishmen.  Thinking men in the British Government must recognise our right to be involved in seeking a solution to what they call the Irish problem even while they claim it to be an internal <Col N="1628" /> matter for them.  I am convinced that the nations of the world are on the side of justice for individuals and for small nations and for a peaceful means of settling problems.  I am convinced that the nations of the world will express themselves in such a manner that our determination to pursue a peaceful policy will not result in Britain allowing the restoration and continuation of the kind of existence suffered by the minority in the north for 50 years: lack of civil rights, deprivation of cultural rights, deprivation of human dignity.  If I am wrong, if we here cannot see the community in the North of Ireland finding a formula to live at peace with itself and then to live in peace with us&mdash;I think they will, I think they can and I think they must&mdash;then every generation of Irishmen will produce men who behave impatiently, generously, heroically, but also ineffectively.</P>
    <P>At this critical stage in our history we must use other means and keep on using them.  Nobody, no matter what position he holds, has a right to act as if these other means will fail. We must be calm and prudent and we must not allow our hearts to rule our heads.  We must never overlook the reality that, if the unity of our country is to be restored, it must be based on a meeting of minds, a meeting of hearts of all classes and creeds of people in this country.  Any resort to force, hoping for a short-term result would not only be short-term but short-sighted.  Further bloodshed among fellow Irishmen would create new and deeper scars in our people. It can only postpone the day when all our people will live together and work together in peace and harmony with each other.</P>
    <P>This is our policy and the vote of confidence is not just in the policy, because the policy is largely agreed on in this House, but it is on whether we can implement it or not.  I said at the beginning that Deputy Dr. Cruise-O'Brien sought to give the impression that a combined Opposition could guarantee unity of purpose.  This is not the time to undermine anybody and I shall not do it, but Deputy Dr. Cruise-O'Brien can guarantee what he will do for himself; I can talk for <Col N="1629" /> myself; but the only guarantee that anyone else can give for a person other than himself is that if he is Taoiseach he will do what Deputy Jack Lynch did as Taoiseach when he found people were said to be acting in a manner which brought suspicion on whether they were supporting that policy or not.  It is not possible for anyone to guarantee the actions of other men but we do guarantee that this is our policy.  I accept it, the Taoiseach accepts it and, as Taoiseach, he has shown that, if any member of the Government does not accept that policy, he will be removed from office.  This is the most that anyone can guarantee.</P>
    <P>I had said we will implement it; it is our intention, it is our decision to implement it.  We are clear now and I hope the public are clear about what is involved because in recent times we have had to consider the alternative policies available to the Irish people. We have sufficient authority from the people, we have sufficient authority in this House, in votes, to implement our policy.  We are aware of the hard decisions which will have to be made and what hard personal breaks will have to be made with friends, but we are going to implement this policy whatever is involved.  Our country is at stake and it must come first.</P>
    <P>We have reached the time when politicians will have to explain themselves and sometimes when explaining themselves they give the impression that they are not willing to carry the burden of decision.  Anything I have said here to explain myself and the Government is for the purpose of giving the young people a clear chance of knowing where we are going and what they are supporting us for.  I am not in any way asking the public to take on this burden of decision and the burden of taking all the actions necessary to make this policy survive. This is the Government's burden.</P>
    <P>I think we can ask this House for a vote of confidence.  I am not doing it on the basis that the Opposition could not form a Government; I am doing it on the basis that the policy we offer is the policy we have enunciated, the present Taoiseach has stated the policy; <Col N="1630" /> his predecessor Deputy Seán Lemass stated it and his predecessor Deputy Eamon de Valera stated it.  I can offer that policy and each member of the Government can offer it.  If they offer a disciplined Government, willing to take the necessary unpalatable decisions, then I think we have shown evidence that we can do that too.</P>

      <P>It is not my intention to delay the House.  Indeed, when I first came into this House more years ago than I care to remember I decided that brevity was the soul of wit&mdash;a decision to which I have kept&mdash;and indeed in this case it should be the soul of discretion. In regard to the present position there are two crises.  I will refer first to the economic one.  Anyone who met his constituents during the last four or five days knows that since they got over, to some extent, the shock of the events of a week ago, they have been addressing themselves to the state of the economy.  We, on this side of the House, cannot re-affirm our confidence in the Government and vote accordingly because the ordinary plain people have lost confidence in the Government on two main issues.  When we speak here we are expected to express the views of the ordinary plain people. That is what I propose to do.</P>
      <P>In regard to the economic situation is it not true that a Budget was introduced a few weeks ago which, to say the least of it, shocked a number of people?  It shocked them because all the indications and all the pointers, as well as the views expressed by economists and others qualified to speak, for months before were to the effect that something should be done in the Budget to check the inflationary tendencies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1632" /> What was done?  Nothing was done in that Budget to check inflation. Indeed, what was done in it aggravated an already serious financial situation. Even before this day week people were asking questions about the credibility or the seriousness of the Government. When we talk about the ordinary people we should remember that they are much more sophisticated and educated than they were ten to 20 years ago.  They have a habit, thank God, of thinking for themselves.  Some of them think very deeply and most of them think very intelligently.  All those ordinary people, the ordinary working people as well as professional and business people, were suspicious of the Government when nothing was done in the Budget to check those inflationary tendencies.  To put it mildly, most thinking people were aghast at the Budget introduced by the Taoiseach for the injured Minister for Finance.  That suspicion had been building up for some time and when Government Ministers and the Government party were being charged, both here and outside by Opposition spokesmen, with arrogance, intolerance and a lack of interest, and indeed what appeared to be their lack of knowledge, of the situation as it obtained, we were told by Fianna Fáil Ministers that we did not know what we were talking about, that we were only trying to create a crisis and start rumours of a crisis which did not exist.</P>
    <P>The ordinary people have completely lost confidence in the Government. A cement strike has gone on for months and a bank strike has gone on for weeks and is likely to go on for months and there has been no intervention from the Minister for Labour in either of these two important disputes, disputes which directly affect the economy.  The people are wondering what is happening in Government circles.  Could you blame them?  Is it not right to charge the Minister for Labour with inactivity in all this sorry scene?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBarry" hpid="Mr. R. Barry Mr. R. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not?  Well, we have had no evidence of any serious <Col N="1633" /> attempts being made by him to intervene in the cement strike which has gone on for 13 or 14 weeks.  Would the Minister not agree with me that if that is correct it is not the right way to approach this vitally important industry?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I would not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBarry" hpid="Mr. R. Barry Mr. R. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is entitled to his opinion; I will express mine and I believe I am expressing the opinion of a great number of people.  Especially am I expressing the opinion of the wives of the people who are out of work in the cement factories as well as of their little children when I say that an attempt should have been made if it was not. We have a Minister for Labour who was elected to do just this kind of thing.</P>
      <P>Referring to strikes, is it not true to say that down the country at the moment there is a kind of despondency generally with regard to what is happening in the country. It may well be that Ministers do not realise it or recognise it.  It may well be that they are completely out of touch with their constituents.  I believe this is the kernel of the whole situation.  They just do not know or, if they do know, they do not appear to care about what is happening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A deficit of £90 million is likely to arise in this financial year on our balance of payments.  That is our economic situation.  Is it hard to blame the people for having lost confidence in the Government, not just today but ten days ago, when they see no attempt being made to deal with that very dangerous situation in the Budget introduced here within the past month?  The trouble is now that, whether it be the financial situation or the political situation, the economic crisis or the political crisis, we find ourselves at this point of time with hotels complaining of cancellations of bookings and of the conducted tours, which were such a feature at this time of the year, nonexistent or disappearing.  So much damage has been done to the economy that it will take a great deal of <Col N="1634" /> patience and a great deal of what the Minister for External Affairs asked for, a great deal of joint effort&mdash;he meant, I think, joint effort by all parties in this House&mdash;to put the economy back on some kind of even keel.  The principal reason for the present economic crisis is the unwillingness and the inability of the Government to formulate a long-term policy which would have regard to the wellbeing of all sections of our people.</P>
    <P>I have dealt briefly with the economic situation.  I want to mention now the departure of two Ministers from this Government, both of whom were in their own time Ministers for Agriculture and Fisheries and both of whom during their term of office as Ministers for Agriculture and Fisheries did not see eye to eye with the farmers whom they were elected and selected to serve.  Is it any wonder that the farmers now at this point of time can recall the impossible Ministers with whom they were dealing?  Is it any wonder that the President of the National Farmers' Association, by far the biggest association representing the farmers, can say to his members that he was right in his attitude towards those two Ministers?  The farmers will never forget being left to sit in Merrior Street in frost and snow because the then Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries would not meet them.  His successor in that office refused to mee them for some years.  Both Ministers have now left office, leaving the far mers in the sorry and pitiable position in which they find themselves.</P>
    <P>I want now to refer briefly to the political crisis.  The only word that typifies the reaction of ordinary people towards the events of last week is &ldquo;shock&rdquo;.  I met quite a number over the weekend in my constituency, particularly in the towns of Fermoy and Mitchelstown, some of them supporters of the Government, all asking very simple, straightforward questions. It is not easy for an ordinary Deputy to answer these questions and, before I finish, I am going to put the questions on record and ask the Taoiseach to answer them when he comes to reply on this debate.</P>
    <P>In the last 50 years Ministers of <Col N="1635" /> State have acted in the main responsibly and the events of the last week have certainly put the country back 50 years.  We had four senior Ministers in a Cabinet of 13 or 14 leaving or being pushed out of office.  If this happened in some other faraway country we would read about it with interest and, possibly, a little dismay.  The action of these men who served, or did not serve, on this Cabinet has brought this nation internationally into disrepute and disgrace.  As one Corkman to another, I want to say to the Taoiseach, Deputy John Lynch, that he has himself to blame to a great extent for the dilemma with which he now finds himself faced.  Everyone knows that over the past six months one of his ex-Ministers had been parading around the country, making inflammatory speeches about the position in the north.  Is it not unfortunately true that we have now had not only one Letterkenny speech but two, the second far more dangerous and inflammatory than the first?  I say that the Taoiseach can blame himself to some extent for his dilemma; even the ordinary national school educated people down the country were asking some months ago what he proposed to do with senior members of his Cabinet who were both speaking and acting contrary to national policy. The most serious aspect of all this is the spectacle of the ex-Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, Deputy Blaney, parading with his cavalcade through his own constituency last Sunday night, photographed with all these young men around his car, speaking in such inflammatory terms to them. I believe in the light of all this that we have not yet heard the end of last week's unfortunate political history and I think it would be fair for me to suggest that Deputy Neil Blaney started his campaign in Letterkenny on Sunday night last, and that if he is allowed in the coming months he will be in Sligo, Galway, Tipperary, Waterford, Wexford, Kilkenny and Monaghan and will eventually find his way down to Cork.  He will in fact travel all those counties in his own good time.  He will be in all of them except in the Six Counties.</P>

      <P>They were there with him.  What I am suggesting is that we should, if possible, on all sides of the House try to advise Deputy Blaney before it is too late to calm down and take things easy.  I think it was Deputy Dr. Cruise-O'Brien who said this morning that the time to talk sense is just now, not perhaps in a month or two months time when this thing blows up.  If my appeal is worth anything to the ex-Minister for Agriculture I appeal to him now from this Parliament to think deeply before he starts his new campaign.</P>
      <P>In regard to this political crisis I said it was noticeable that the Taoiseach took no action in the case of Deputy Blaney.  The ordinary people throughout the country noted that just as we Deputies did.  The people are asking questions and on their behalf I want to ask them of the Taoiseach in this House.  I am sure these questions will be given to him before he replies here this evening.  The first question is: For how long does the Taoiseach know that his Ministers were acting so treacherously and traitorously?  The people do not accept that the Taoiseach was informed of it only in the recent past.</P>
      <P>The second question is: Is it true that the Taoiseach would not have taken the action he took last week but for the call made on him by the leader of the Opposition, Deputy Cosgrave?  The third question is: Are there other Ministers and Fianna Fáil Deputies involved in this sad story? Some people in the country seem to know much more about what is happening in inner circles than do some Deputies, even on the Fianna Fáil side.  The fourth question is: What number of Army personnel were involved and to what extent and for how long?  This is a question that should be answered not later than tonight by the Taoiseach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1637" /> The fifth question is: Was there really any serious attempt to apprehend those involved in the different bank raids throughout the country and, in particular, was there any real attempt made to apprehend the murderer or murderers of the late Garda Fallon? These are serious questions deserving a reply from a serious-minded Taoiseach. The last question is this: will the Attorney General to whom the Taoiseach has referred the information he has got, go fully, impartially and justly into all aspects of this most serious case?  I can only say that on the Taoiseach's own admission at Question Time this afternoon the Attorney General was a strong supporter of the Fianna Fáil Party.  Can the people then have confidence in the investigation or examination he decides to carry out?</P>
    <P>Just over 200 years ago, in 1770, a great Irishman speaking before what was then the best known forum in the world, the British House of Commons, a man who has been lauded by several Ministers here in recent months, Edmund Burke, spoke some highly significant words in connection with the true meaning of a political party.  His view, which has been quoted at various times by a Fianna Fáil Taoiseach in our day was:</P>
    <P>No men could act with effect who did not act in concert: no men could act in concert who did not act with confidence: no men could act with confidence who were not bound together by common opinion, common affection and common interests. </P>
    <P>It is noticeable that what he said was &ldquo;common opinion, common affection and common interests.&rdquo;  Leave out the &ldquo;common affection&rdquo; and we ask, as we are entitled to ask of the present Fianna Fáil Party who still all vote together, what have they in the line of common interest?  I wish someone in the House had the oratory and intelligence of Edmund Burke and he might then be able to explain to me and the Irish people how this Government can stand the test of time on the criterion of what he knew and thought to be a political party.</P>
    <P>In the same speech Edmund Burke <Col N="1638" /> said, also referring to a political party, that a party with a body of men united for promoting by their joint endeavours &mdash;joint endeavours, mark you&mdash;the national interest.  Where do the Government and the Fianna Fáil Party fit into that distinguished gentleman's interpretation of a Government and a party?</P>
    <P>I promised I would not delay the House.  We on this side of the House cannot vote to reaffirm our confidence in the Government.  The people of the country generally have no confidence whatever in the Government.  While not saying anything personal against the new Ministers, I believe, and the people believe, that many of them have not the political experience that is needed in this grave time to deal with a political or economic situation.  In the opinion of most people the Government are inefficient, ineffectual, incompetent and irresponsible.  The political events of the past week have been described here as sad, sordid and sorry.  That alliteration, that description, is perfect.  I should like to continue the alliteration and add to sad, sordid and sorry, shabby, sour, saucy, shameless, selfish, secret, sickening, sulky, smelly, sneaky, serpent-like seedy, surreptitious, senseless, scathing, spurious and shocking.</P>

      <P>There are many more adjectives that could be added to that list but those were the first that came to my mind.  The events of the past week have, in my opinion, given the ultra-Unionists in the north grounds for their eternal suspicions. We on this side of the House realise that, while we are entitled to criticise the Government in make-up and form, we also have a responsibility to the people.  It is our considered opinion that we should accept the plea made by the Minister for External Affairs with regard to the many problems he presented before us today.  Whether this Government last a month, three <Col N="1639" /> months, six months or 12 months, which I think must be the extreme limit, we in the Fine Gael Party will, as we have always done, help to repair the damage which has been done to this State of ours.  This will be a matter of pride for us apart from being our duty.  Our predecessors in this party built up the State into the position it was in until about two weeks ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>What are we discussing here today?  What were we discussing here yesterday?  The motion suggests that Dáil Éireann hereby reaffirms its confidence in the Government. What is the need for the motion? Why did the Taoiseach put it down? We had a lengthy debate here last week and we have this motion before us again today.  My intervention centres around my query as to the Taoiseach's reason for putting it down.  Fianna Fáil Deputies tell us there is no crisis within their party but it is evident that this crisis is responsible for the motion.  The only possible reason the Taoiseach could have for putting down this motion is that he is in doubt about some of his own party.</P>
      <P>The composition of this House at the moment is 74 Fianna Fáil Deputies, 51 Fine Gael Deputies, 17 Labour Deputies, one Independent Deputy and the Ceann Comhairle.  Due to the unfortunate illness of two Members of the House who happen to be members of the Government party, the voting strength is reduced to 72, 68 and Deputy Sheridan.  Does the Taoiseach doubt that all of his party will vote for him?  It is quite evident from the discussions here extending over three days or more last week that no member of the Opposition will vote for this motion.  No member of the Labour Party will vote for it and no member of the Fine Gael Party will vote for it. Therefore there are 68 votes against the motion and the only people who can defeat this motion are the dissident members of the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach may have some information that is not at our disposal and he may feel justified in taking up the time of this House for two days with this motion to find out whether <Col N="1640" /> they will vote for him as they did on Saturday.  We may be asked why the Labour Party put down a Motion of No Confidence in the Government.  It is obvious why we did so.  We were satisfied that, having regard to the eruption within the Government party, and having regard to the statements made by former members of the Government, it was opportune for us to put down a Motion of No Confidence in the Government which would give those people who made such strong complaints against the Government&mdash; particularly former members who complained about phone-tapping, an organisation known as the minister watching organisation, and Gestapo-like surveillance imposed on them by the head of the Government&mdash;an opportunity, if they so desired, to indicate by their votes in the House that they had no confidence in the Government, as they had already suggested in their statements.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach puts this motion on the Order Paper asking his own party to reaffirm their confidence in the Government.  The only question at issue is whether or not his own party will reaffirm their confidence in the Government.</P>
    <P>The position in Northern Ireland has been mentioned often in this debate.  Mention has also been made of the disastrous industrial policy being pursued at present.  This policy has resulted in many strikes.  There has been much talk about uneasiness at the present inflationary trend in our economy.  These issues are all important, but they have nothing whatever to do with the motion before the House.  The Minister for External Affairs told us what is happening in the North of Ireland and what should or should not happen there.  This is of no use to us.  This motion is about a completely internal matter.  It has nothing to do with the North of Ireland. It has nothing to do with other questions which have been raised here by Government spokesmen.</P>
    <P>This vote of confidence is before us because of the earthquake which shook the Irish people when the Taoiseach made his pronouncements last week.  This matter, as has been stated <Col N="1641" /> so frequently here, did not arise from any allegations made by Opposition Members; it did not arise from any statement made by outside organisations. This matter is entirely confined to the Fianna Fáil Party.  It has resulted in three Ministers being asked to relinquish their portfolios and one Minister and a Parliamentary Secretary resigning out of sympathy with them.</P>
    <P>I am trying to recall the description given to this situation by the Minister for Education last night.  The Minister for Education, Deputy Faulkner, described it as &ldquo;a minor incident&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be better to have the definition of the Minister for Education of what constitutes a major incident.  Irrespective of what interpretation the Minister for Finance puts on this statement, I assume the Official Report will bear out my statement that the Minister for Education referred to this matter as being one of a minor nature.  On Friday morning last I said that in any other democratic country, if four members of the Government had to leave office on one stroke of the Prime Minister's pen, it would definitely lead to the resignation of the entire Government or, at least, in accordance with the procedures laid down by the Constitution, lead to the Prime Minister dissolving Parliament <Col N="1642" /> and getting a vote of confidence from the country at large.</P>
      <P>I am one of the Deputies who has held the view that, once a Government are elected democratically, they should be entitled to the full period of office. I am not a believer in a Government relinquishing office because of upheavals which could be contained and rectified at a later stage.  I do not believe a Government should abandon office or that, without great justification, the Taoiseach should go to the Park, and ask for the dissolution of the Dáil.  The present Dáil is not yet one year old.  Like other Deputies I personally would not like an election. I do not know whether I would survive it or not.  Other Deputies would agree with me.  An election requires a great deal of energy.  There is great expense attached to an election.  I am a Member who does not get any funds from any source.  The only funds at my disposal for an election are the funds collected at an annual church gate collection.  I have not any organisation behind me to provide funds such as those which I understand other people have, particularly on the Government side of the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume the Minister is well looked after by the Taca people we saw in here around the House last week.  I wish to make my personal position clear.  I would not welcome an election.  I would not like the prospect of moving around a constituency which is more than 100 miles in length and getting a renewal of confidence from the people.  But the inconvenience to me or to any other Deputy is only a small side issue.  It is something which should be brushed aside.  I believe the Irish people would brush aside the inconvenience of individual Deputies at election time.  I find that the people want an election. They feel that this upheaval, with its statements and counterstatements, should be referred to themselves for a decision and not to this House where <Col N="1643" /> the party pattern is clearcut&mdash;unless perhaps at 10.30 tonight there is some further unheaval.</P>
      <P>Why should anyone stand up here and say to a Government which are not one year in office that they should dissolve the Dáil and seek a fresh mandate? My personal view is that what happened last week is something that never happened since the establishment of the State.  It is something that no one of us could have visualised a week ago.  It is something unprecedented. I shudder to think what would have happened if there was an inter-Party Government composed of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael.  What would the Fianna Fáil Members do?</P>
      <P>I feel that, as well as having a vote of no confidence, we would possibly forcibly be ejected from our seats and sent to the country.  Smaller matters gave rise here, during the time of the inter-Party Government, to contributions to debates lasting more than five hours; vexatious contributions; filibusterings, because the then Opposition opposed some piece of legislation being put through by the then Government. I am trying to visualise what would happen if an inter-Party Taoiseach were seated where Deputy Colley, Minister for Finance, is now sitting.  Suppose this kind of position arose, what would an inter-Party Taoiseach do?</P>

      <P>After making an explanation to the House, I would expect that an inter-Party Taoiseach would go to the country.  If I were a supporter of his, or a Member of the House supporting him, I should expect <Col N="1644" /> him to run away.  I should expect him to make a statement informing the House of the way in which he had been deceived by members of his Cabinet, giving much more information and the nature and extent of the deceit than was given to us here by the Taoiseach in the two or three contributions he has made here in relation to this crisis.  Surely he would run away if one of these four Ministers were to get on his feet and say &ldquo;You are a liar&rdquo;?  Is that not a fair summary &mdash;I put it now to the Minister for Finance&mdash;of what one of the former Ministers said to the Taoiseach?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. J. Lenehan Mr. J. Lenehan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the ex-Ministers said there was no truth in or foundation for the allegations made. What is the position if that former Minister's statement is correct?  Consider the Minister who, due to his unfortunate illness, is not able to be with us in the House and had to issue a statement from his hospital bed denying these charges.  If he is correct then, heavens above, the Taoiseach has a great deal to answer for.</P>
      <P>Now, in this fight amongst members of the Government, we, as representatives of the people, have not got sufficient information to enable us to draw valid conclusions.  We have got information sufficient to enable us to draw certain conclusions.  We have got information sufficient to indicate that there is a burst-up&mdash;may be that is not such an appropriate term&mdash; within the Cabinet; that they do not trust each other; that one of them thinks the other fellow is spying on him; that another thinks his telephone is being tapped; that another thinks the Taoiseach is, if I can recollect that term again, subjecting his colleagues to Gestapo-like surveillance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Surely, if an inter-Party Taoiseach were sitting on the Government benches and that kind of position confronted him, I will agree with the content of the interjection by Deputy J. Lenehan as to what that Taoiseach would do. I am sure that, subsequent to making a statement&mdash;possibly in the House or to the Press&mdash;he would run, as run he should, to give the people an opportunity <Col N="1645" /> of determining the question. I do not want to repeat what has been said here by previous speakers but this is a very vital question.  Those of us who have the honour to be elected to this House cannot shelve our responsibility.  We must address ourselves to this question.  We must offer a contribution to this debate.  The people whom we represent expect us to do so.</P>
    <P>Has the Taoiseach given us the information he should have given us?  I am making that statement in the belief that the Taoiseach is entitled to withhold certain information from the Members of this House.  I am assuming he knows far more than he has told this House.  I am also making the case that he should give us more information than he actually gave us.  I think he stopped too soon in the three statements he made to this House.  He did not give us enough information about what was happening, for how long it was happening, and so on.</P>
    <P>In his reply here on Saturday night last, the Taoiseach did not make quite clear what answers he had to his former colleagues according to whom, if they are to be believed, it is evident, beyond a shadow of doubt, that the Taoiseach knew about what was happening within his Cabinet long before Monday, 20th April, 1970.  I fear the Taoiseach did not give us sufficient information.  I am sure many Government supporters throughout the country are of that same opinion, namely, that they have not been given sufficient information as to the nature and extent of the revolt against the Taoiseach by his Cabinet.</P>
    <P>Collective responsibility is accepted in this country.  There is no need to cover ground which already has well been covered by previous speakers&mdash; that the Taoiseach, by virtue of his exalted position as head of the Government, has the right, subject to the approval of Dáil Eireann, of nominating Ministers and that, with that right, goes a great deal of responsibility.  He must be sure of his ground.  If he has been let down&mdash;particularly by a number of his Ministers&mdash;he must take some of the blame.  He must also, whether he likes it or not, move out of his <Col N="1646" /> Government seat and go to the President to seek a dissolution of this Parliament.</P>
    <P>I mentioned earlier in my statement here that the speech by the Minister for External Affairs would be admirable if it were made within a relevant discussion.  Such statements have no bearing on the motion before the House.  The Taoiseach came here yesterday afternoon and glossed over the reasons for this debate.  In fact, he did not mention them at all.  There is no use giving the House the history of events relating to the Fianna Fáil Party during the past 50 years.  What is relevant at this time is the history of events which led up to the crisis in the Government last week.  To my mind, that is the only relevant question.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Taoiseach's entitlement to dismiss members of the Government whom he believes to be unsuitable for office, I recollect stating here on Friday that I am a firm believer in that principle&mdash;a principle that has been adhered to since the establishment of the State.  It is the Taoiseach's privilege to remove from office any member of the Government but it would be taking the matter a little too far to say that they can be removed or dismissed without some public statement being made.  Perhaps, if only one Minister was involved, the position would be different.  Statements have been made by Government speakers to the effect that as soon as the Taoiseach had reason for suspicion in relation to any of his Ministers, the Constitution more or less lays down that he dismiss them or, at any rate, gives him the right to remove them from office.</P>
    <P>It would appear that in order to do this it is not necessary for the Taoiseach to have the type of evidence that could be substantiated in court.  Apparently, the Taoiseach was satisfied or, at least, his suspicion was sufficiently strong to warrant his action in relation to his Ministers but what is perturbing the people at this time is the special position of the newly-appointed Minister for Agriculture. I am not saying Deputy Gibbons is guilty but I am saying that there is suspicion about his activities.  I say <Col N="1647" /> this because of the statement made by Captain Kelly to the effect that the Minister was guilty of telling lies. Either the Minister or Captain Kelly is telling lies.  The accusation was left unanswered.  If Deputy Gibbons had nothing to do with the conspiracy the implication is that Captain Kelly is an untruthful person.  I do not know if he is but his statement in relation to the Minister was not made within the confines of this House.  It was made and publicised not only in Ireland but in England.</P>
    <P>If the Minister for Agriculture is of the opinion that Captain Kelly's statement is not true surely he has the necessary machinery to deal with the allegation.  He can go to the courts and have his name cleared.</P>

I am sure the Minister will not object if I read the statement which is reported at column 970 of the Official Report of the 8th/ 9th May, 1970 and I quote:</P>
      <P>This man is an unmitigated scoundrel and I say this not under the privilege of Dáil Éireann.  I met him at his office in Leinster House on April 29th and I gave him a full account of my work.  We parted on amiable terms.

      <P>Until recently Captain Kelly had an important post as an Army officer in our intelligence service. Are we to assume that since the 20th April this man has changed from being a responsible person who was trusted by the Minister for Defence and by the Taoiseach, to one who is unreliable, untruthful and who is a despicable character?  This man who called on the Taoiseach&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It was said that the Taoiseach called him in the course of his investigations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>If we consider the views of the Government it would appear that they were most unfair as far as this man is concerned.  Supposing&mdash;and I am not saying this except as an illustration&mdash;he is an unreliable person and that his actions were questionable and that he was misleading his superiors in the past.  Then, in my opinion, the Minister for Defence is an unsuitable man to retain in the Government, if his intelligence agent, who had his personal ear, was as unreliable as he is now made out to be. I wonder if I am taking up too much time on this question.  I must try to sum it up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach told us&mdash;I will not go searching in volumes to get the exact quotations because I dislike that kind of work, but I will give a fair summary of what I recollect he told us&mdash;he had the utmost confidence in Deputy Gibbons.  If Deputy Gibbons deserves that confidence, he is entitled to it.  Not only was Deputy Gibbons not requested to relinquish his office, but he has been promoted to the office of Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, which in this State is indeed <Col N="1649" /> an important office.  We must get more information from the Taoiseach tonight. He must put his cards on the table and tell us that this man, Mr. Kelly, is what he is, in a straightforward way.  There is no use hedging behind vague sentences or vague statements.  He must tell us some more about Mr. Kelly.</P>
    <P>We have privilege in this House and it would indeed be unfair for any one of us to abuse that privilege.  I say this as a Deputy coming from the most southerly end of this country.  Captain Kelly had a career.  He claims he discharged the duties of that office honourably and efficiently, that he acted completely on the instructions of his superiors, mainly the Minister for Defence.  He is a married man with young children and I believe this House owes him some obligation.  I never heard of him until a week ago when this question was raised, but I have no hesitation in saying that it is most unfair to abuse and slander this man unless that slander and abuse are justified.</P>
    <P>My personal view, having listened to this discussion for hours, and it is only a personal view, is that the abuse and slanderous statements made about Mr. Kelly are not justified.  He may have been engaged in work that was not within or should not be within his prescribed duties, but I understand his case to be that he was engaged on that work at the behest of the Minister and that there was full agreement between him and his Minister.  We know the Minister's word is law and it was quite easy for him.  One would assume that Mr. Kelly felt that this was Government policy but by virtue of the special position he held as intelligence officer he had no alternative but to carry out his work and not disclose it to any others.</P>
    <P>How did all this come to be disclosed? Seemingly because a consignment of arms from an unknown destination was interrupted before it got into the hands of those to whom it was consigned.  I think that is what happened. I mentioned here on Friday that it was of vital importance to Irish people to ascertain the country of <Col N="1650" /> origin.  I suggested Czechoslovakia as the country.  I made it quite clear that I based that on accounts and statements by Press correspondents and by continental correspondents who were interviewed on our television network. The Taoiseach here on Saturday night said the arms did not come from Czechoslovakia but that he thought they came from Frankfurt.  He is not sure; he only thinks it.  Let us examine the geographical layout.</P>
    <P>If you, Sir, have a consignment of arms in Frankfurt to transport to Dublin through London Airport, surely you do not move the consignment to Vienna and then from Vienna to London or Dublin Airport?  Surely, to say the least of it, that would be a roundabout way?  It is evident from the information made public since this discussion started that arms are not for sale in Vienna, nor in any place in close proximity to it.  I listened to one expert who addressed himself to this question on BBC television.  He said that the two countries likely to sell arms were two Communist states&mdash; Czechoslovakia and Bulgaria.  Then Vienna comes into the picture as a clearance base.</P>
    <P>It may be said that this is all conjecture, but I am not the Taoiseach and I have not got the information that he should have.  Surely he made inquiries as to where the arms originated? It is not good enough to tell the House at 10 o'clock on Saturday night last that he thought they came from Frankfurt.  I do not accept that.  I am quite sure the Taoiseach has much more information about this consignment of arms than he has given to the House.  It may be asked then why I or any other Member should be so perturbed about the place of origin, as to whether the arms came from Hamburg, from Prague or from Sofia.  The place of origin is very important; and I stressed this as forcibly as I possibly could on Friday last, because if the statements that the arms were transported from a State under Russian domination are true, this is a far bigger question than it would otherwise seem to be.</P>
    <P>We know that countries like Czechoslovakia and Bulgaria are only mere <Col N="1651" /> puppets of the Soviet Union.  I said last Friday, and I repeat it now, that the Taoiseach should give us some information about this matter.  Bad and all as the situation is I would be delighted to hear that the arms came from Germany or Austria or at least some country this side of the Iron Curtain.</P>
    <P>As I stated earlier, events in Northern Ireland, the economic situation, the industrial strife which exists at the present time have nothing to do with the motion before the House.  It is not as a result of industrial strife, the inflationary trends of the present day or any other incompetent activity of the Government that the Taoiseach has to introduce this motion and superimpose it on the Labour Party motion of no confidence and ask the Dáil to reaffirm their confidence in the Government.  I do not accept that statements such as that made by the Minister for External Affairs are entirely relevant to this discussion.  We must get from this discussion an account of the difficulties within the Government Party.</P>
    <P>A Government are naturally the highest organisation in the land.  It is they who lead us in the development of our economy.  They formulate policies and promote legislation that we must abide by.  All our activities centre around the Government of the day.  They have power to direct us. They say what is good for us.  They say what taxes we have to pay and what laws we have to abide by.  That is only right.  In a democratic State when a Government are elected democratically they are entitled to do this. They are to a great extent entitled to order our lives and say what is good or is not good for us but we in turn have the right to get from a Government, which bursts open, as this one did last week, some information as to why this corruption came about.</P>
    <P>I do not want to repeat statements to substantiate my case but we have not got this information from the leader of the Government.  I know we must allow for the fact that he is not obliged to tell us all but at least he must tell us enough to satisfy us that <Col N="1652" /> his actions were justifiable, that no harm has been done in the past and that no other activities which were not in conformity with their office were engaged in by the sacked Ministers. The Taoiseach has also to give us that information in order to satisfy the Irish people that his charges are soundly based.</P>
    <P>The defence is a plea of not guilty. Up to this time from the evidence available and the statements made here by the Taoiseach or any other Government speaker a jury would not find those sacked Ministers guilty.  Surely the Taoiseach did not create this major upheaval without some grounds for it. That is what the ordinary man in the street thinks.  The Taoiseach must have some hidden information or some good reason for doing what he did. Mind you, the poor former Ministers are condemned by public opinion.  They are condemned through the idea which exists in the country that the Taoiseach would not have acted as he did unless he had sound information at his disposal.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to delay the House much longer.  I said here last Friday, and I can repeat it today with all sincerity, that I dislike having to contribute to a discussion such as this. We are all Irishmen and possibly it can be said that all of us have the ideals of Ireland at heart.  We try to improve the standards of our people and try to advance our country in every way possible.  We are a relatively small country.  I feel sure that the most distasteful job for those of us who get elected to this House is to have, in accordance with our obligations to our constituents, to take part in a discussion such as this and reflect on the activities of the man who is honoured as head of our Government.  I would have avoided joining in this discussion if I thought it were possible for me to do so but I believe this crisis which is still with us is so grave that we must contribute.  This is evidenced by the fact that such a great number of Deputies spoke last week.</P>
    <P>We must ask for a change of leadership and consultation with the people. I made my position clear about this earlier in the discussion.  Within a fortnight <Col N="1653" /> we find that four Ministers, Deputies Blaney, Boland, Haughey and Moran have gone.  You could question some of these men but others of them were as arrogant as one would find within the shores of this country.  Some of them resented being asked questions in this House.  They knew too much. They were so full of power and authority that they treated Opposition members with great contempt.  Now the position has changed and it has so changed that instead of asking the Dáil to reaffirm its confidence in the Government the motion should request that the Irish people reaffirm their confidence in the Government.  The answer to such a request is so obvious that I need not spell it out.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Colley) George Colley">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Colley)</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I should like to deal with a point arising from Deputy Murphy's speech. He referred to Captain Kelly and said he was concerned that an injustice would not be done to this man and I certainly agree with him.  I dislike very much a situation in which somebody who is not in a position to defend himself in this House should be referred to here.  Although this has become inevitable in the course of the debate, I would remind the House that this man's name was not introduced from the Government side.  The incident illustrates clearly the danger of mentioning people who are not in a position to defend themselves here.</P>
      <P>Deputy Murphy referred to a question asked by Deputy Corish at the conclusion of the debate last week and he repeated it himself.  Summed up it could be, who is telling the truth?  Is it Captain Kelly or is it Deputy Gibbons?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister might tell us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I want Deputies in the Labour Party to pay particular attention to what I am about to say.  The assumption underlying what was said by Deputy Corish was that Captain Kelly had admitted publicly in a statement that he had engaged in illegal activities.  To my knowledge Captain Kelly said no such thing.  What he said was that all his activities were <Col N="1654" /> known to the Minister for Defence. There is a great difference between those two things and a grave injustice is being done to Captain Kelly by those who have been making that point. Where people outside this House are concerned, a great deal more attention should be given to precision if one is purporting to suggest what they have said.  A good deal more latitude is, by custom, allowed in this House because we each have an opportunity of coming back here to put the record right where we consider it worthwhile.</P>
      <P>It is difficult to deal with this motion without reference to the marathon debate in which this House indulged last week.  Clearly, there is a close connection and I think it is reasonable for me to comment on what happened in that debate and on my own reaction and that of a large section of the public.  There were from Opposition benches in that debate some responsible, careful and statesmanlike speeches.  However there were many others&mdash;and they far outnumbered the ones to which I have referred&mdash;which I could only consider irresponsible.  It is not the speeches of individual Deputies to which I refer because this is not the issue before us today.  What I wish to refer to are the tactics adopted by the Opposition parties in that debate and, in particular, by Fine Gael.  When one saw a deliberate filibuster, when one saw Deputies who seldom spoke in this House handing on from one to another the dog-eared scripts, one could be forgiven for doubting the genuine character of the claim of Fine Gael to be concerned only with the public interest.  It seems to me perfectly legitimate political tactics for any party in a situation as we have had to make political capital out of that situation.  I do not, and could not, object to it but what I object to and wish to expose in this regard is the hypocrisy of claiming to be activated only by the public interest when, in fact, one is engaging in a sordid filibuster, endeavouring to stir up an air of crisis in the country solely for party political advantage.</P>

      <P>My point is this: the tactics adopted in last week's debate are a relevant factor to this debate now to the extent that we are asking this House to consider whether the House has confidence in the Government. If the House has not got confidence in the Government it is reasonable to assume that it is saying the people should choose another Government and that other Government can only come from the opposite side.  In case anybody has any hopes, I might add the Government will not come from that side of the House.</P>

      <P>For the purpose of discussion it is relevant to consider the alleged alternative Government available and the tactics adopted last week by elements in that possible alternative Government are very relevant. I want to assure Deputies on the other side of the House that while the people had made it clear to them not so long ago that they were not prepared to consider them as an alternative Government, <Col N="1656" /> the tactics adopted last week made absolutely certain that the people will not in any circumstances accept a party that can act so irresponsibly.</P>

      <P>We have heard cries in this House during the past week for a general election and we have even heard them here now.  All of us in the confines of the House know how the hearts of many Deputies opposite would stop if the Taoiseach said there would be an election.  It is a legitimate political tactic but, since it has been put forward by some people with an apparent air of sincerity, perhaps one should deal with it.  In the present circumstances&mdash;and I am referring to the problems that have been, and are, facing this country irrespective of the happenings of last week&mdash;there are very serious and difficult problems facing us, including the commencement of negotiations for entry into the EEC and the spectre of inflation which is hanging over the economy. Less than 12 months ago people were asked what they wanted and they gave a very clear decision.  However one interprets that decision nobody can deny that it was a decision for political stability&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>This is what the public voted for and it is what they will get. If it is suggested that they could get political stability by having another election what is going to happen is that the Government will be re-elected with an overall majority.  That being so, why have an election when we already have that situation?  If that is not the case then we will not have political stability, because if anybody wants to try to convince the country that we could have political stability in any form of alliance between Fine Gael and the Labour Party, he can forget it.  They have not yet convinced the <Col N="1657" /> people of that, they have tried many times and have failed.  If they need to have their memories jogged might I just remind Deputies very briefly of the statements that have been made with increasing frequency by Deputy Noel Browne laying down his conditions for co-operation between his party and the Fine Gael Party, conditions which even the Fine Gael Party could not accept, and I shall give that credit to the Fine Gael Party.  If one is thinking of a united Government with a united party behind it, may I remind the Labour Party of Deputy Stephen Coughlan and of a few little incidents which I could go into but do not intend to&mdash;it is not my object&mdash;merely to emphasise the point that if one believes that what the people want and need at this moment is political stability there is only one place they can get it and that is from Fianna Fáil.</P>

      <P>Reference has been made to the Minister for Agriculture. I do not want to go into this in detail, but I want to say I was listening to Deputy Garret FitzGerald winding up for the Fine Gael Party in the debate on Saturday last and I paid particular attention to what he was saying in this regard.  It seems to me, although he had not got concrete information on which to work, he was showing very accurate insight into what in fact was happening.  He withdrew this subsequently&mdash;when I say &ldquo;subsequently&rdquo; I mean over the weekend&mdash;on what I think was a misinterpretation by him <Col N="1659" /> of something the Taoiseach said.  As I understood him he said: &ldquo;I have taken one view of that situation but am now forced to change it because the Taoiseach has said he has had to investigate these allegations.

He went on to say that subsequent to the commencement of the marathon debate further allegations had been made and that he had investigated them and was absolutely satisfied that there was no basis for these allegations.

      <P>I am telling the Deputy he did.  I was listening to him.  It is quite clear the Opposition tactics arising out of this are: first, to attack the credibility of the Taoiseach; secondly, that they thought they saw some weakness in relation to Deputy Gibbons so they attacked there, and <i>ad nauseam</i> speakers from the Fine Gael Party in that marathon debate, in an effort to attack the credibility of the Taoiseach, kept referring to the exchange which took place in this House at Question Time when Deputy Cosgrave asked if there would be any more resignations.  One after the other the Fine Gael speakers tried to make out that this was evidence that the Taoiseach had not told the truth. Putting that point at its very best, I suggest it was a poor debating point, but if one examines the whole exchange what comes through is this, that the Taoiseach was saying to Deputy Cosgrave: &ldquo;I do not know what you have in mind but if you will tell me what you have in mind then I shall answer your question.&rdquo;  But Deputy Cosgrave did not say what he had in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If people would like to speculate about that exchange there is an interesting point they might examine: has it occurred to Deputies opposite that the situation at that time appears to have been this, that Deputy Cosgrave had received an anonymous document making certain allegations and that he did not know whether they were true or not, and that though the Taoiseach invited him to say what he had in mind, he refused to do it, instead of <Col N="1661" /> which some hours afterwards he went to the Taoiseach and showed him the document and the Taoiseach confirmed to him that there was some substance in some of the allegations?</P>
    <P>Supposing for a moment that the Taoiseach had not known about this, what would Deputy Cosgrave have done then?  I guarantee he would not have come back into the House and exploded the whole situation.  What he was doing was taking a very prudent precaution against making a complete fool of himself in public by trying to verify if the information were true.</P>

      <P>I will turn from that aspect, which was preliminary to what I wanted to say&mdash;not quite marginal, but preliminary.  I want to turn to what in some people's eyes might be the kernel of this debate.  The suggestions which are being made in the debate and the suggestions which are being made outside and which have been made for a long time past, not directly connected with the incidents with which we are concerned, seem to me to be such that they require examination, particularly by people who claim to be republican.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe republicanism came to the Irish people largely through Wolfe Tone, and it went through from generation to generation and flowered in 1916.  What stands out in that republicanism is that it was concerned to unite all sections of our people.  Tone lived among people of differing religions who were on many occasions demonstrating bigotry and intolerance. The men of Easter Week saw around them many instances of sectarianism, bigotry and intolerance, but, despite that, they put forward as one of their basic tenets a different principle.  Tone said that his hope was to unite Catholic, Protestant and Dissenter in the common name of Irishmen.  The same idea was put in somewhat different words by Pearse in reading the Proclamation outside the GPO when <Col N="1663" /> he spoke about cherishing all the children of the nation equally.</P>
    <P>They were noble principles of noble men who died for their beliefs, and it is against that yardstick that we must measure all policies and all actions claiming to be inspired by republicanism. Do such policies and such actions tend to unite Catholic, Protestant and Dissenter in the common name of Irishmen?  If they do not, then they are not republicanism, whatever else they are.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Many claim the cloak of republicanism today, but the test is very simple.  In my view, it is intolerable that men should try to cover with the cloak of republicanism their base aims, which in many cases amount to little more than sectarianism and the imposition of an arid and unpleasant workers' socialist republic.  I, for one, would not belong to a party who did not have republicanism at their core, and precisely because Fianna Fáil had republicanism at their core I joined it, and precisely because Fianna Fáil still have republicanism at their core I intend to remain in Fianna Fáil.</P>
      <P>The traditional policy of Fianna Fáil has been based on the republicanism handed down from generation to generation since Wolfe Tone.  That policy has been spelled out by every leader of Fianna Fáil, and never more clearly or more fully than by the present Taoiseach at the last Fianna Fáil Ard Fheis.</P>
      <P>That policy, let no one misunderstand it, is based on the republican principles on which Fianna Fáil were founded, enunciated by Éamon de Valera, Seán Lemass and Jack Lynch, and that policy has the overwhelming support of the Fianna Fáil Party and the Fianna Fáil organisation.  This is, in my view, the first test of republicanism, but there are other aspects of it, too.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tone was concerned with the men of no property, the small men, and implied in all he did and all he said and all he wrote was the necessity for a social conscience, for a concern for the small man; and as that policy was <Col N="1664" /> developed over the generations and spelled out for us in 1916, it became clear that republicanism also included a real concern with our own language and our own culture.</P>
    <P>These are further tests which may be applied.  I would remind some of the people who are today claiming to be republican that when Tone talked about the men of no property he was not trying to take away the property from those who had it, he was trying to give property to the men of no property. This has always been the concern of Fianna Fáil and this is another test of its republicanism.  It can be argued that the further aim of Tone and of all who succeeded him was, to use Tone's own words, &ldquo;To break the connection with England&rdquo;.  The policies which claim to be republican must also be measured against this yardstick.  I am not aware that any of the bodies using the name republicanism today even claim that their policies would break the connection with England.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil recognises that there are two basic problems if we are to reunite this country.  The first problem concerns the reunification of the Irish people, and I do not have to dwell on that because it has been spelled out time after time that that can only be solved by peaceful methods&mdash;by definition it cannot be solved by violence&mdash;and the second problem, which is a separate problem and must be recognised as such, consists, to use Tone's words, of breaking the connection with England.</P>
    <P>We have not and we will not accept the right of Westminster to legislate for any part of this country but this kind of situation has existed and still exists in many parts of the world and in order to make life liveable at all it is necessary to bow to a superior force and live with the situation.  The fact that one has to live with the situation does not mean that one concedes the right of that situation.  Our Constitution makes it clear that we do not accept the right of Westminster to legislate for any corner of this country but the situation which exists in this country in relation to partition is one which was created by Britain and is one which will never be remedied, even assuming the best <Col N="1665" /> will in the world both north and south, without a political decision in Westminster. I want to stress that the relationship between the various segments of the people living in this country on the one hand and the situation of Ireland <i>vis-à-vis</i> Britain on the other hand are two distinct and different problems.</P>
    <P>We have ruled out the use of force as a solution to the problem of our country.  Perhaps I should qualify that by saying we have ruled out physical force but there are other kinds of force, at least that word could be used for it, there are different forms of persuasion and pressure.  It is legitimate for us to exercise any form of persuasion or pressure on the British Government in order to get them to face up to their responsibilities.  It is not enough for the British Government to say that they are introducing reforms.  These reforms are welcome, I do not want to be misunderstood about that, but that is not going to solve the problem which exists. It is time it was recognised that the expedience of partition, for whatever reason it was adopted has not worked. There are some who say that the expedience of partition was adopted on the principle of divide and rule; there are others, more charitable, who would say that it was adopted simply as an <i>ad hoc</i> measure to meet the problem that then existed.  For whatever reason it was adopted, it has not worked and the sooner this is accepted and recognised and the sooner there is a chance of finding a solution that will work, the better.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that the events of the last week or so have been damaging to our interests in the North of Ireland.  I understand this argument but I do not think it is true because the thing that emerges most clearly from all of this is that the commitment of the Taoiseach, the Government and the Fianna Fáil Party to a policy of the non-use of force is so strong that it has risked an enormous amount; it has placed the national importance of that policy before party considerations and it was prepared, if necessary, to dissolve itself rather than give way on that principle.</P>
    <P>This is the message which is coming <Col N="1666" /> through loud and clear and as far as our Protestant fellow-countrymen in the north are concerned when they reflect on the situation&mdash;their initial reaction of course must be one of distress and concern&mdash;this is going to be a great reassurance to them.  I appeal to the people in the north of our country, and particularly to the moderate and younger Unionists, to consider the situation and remember that the ideological basis on which partition was established was the simple but terrifying myth that Catholics and Protestants could not live and prosper together in one island.  This has been demonstrated to be wrong not only in other countries but in the North of Ireland itself.  Apart from the fact that republicanism was founded in the north, apart from the fact that Catholic and Dissenter fought side by side in 1798, subsequent to that, when all the rigours and consequences of '98 had set in, there was still the most marked co-operation and tolerance in Belfast between Catholic and Dissenter at a time when this kind of tolerance was not all that common in Europe.</P>
    <P>Indeed, the fact that the first Roman Catholic church in Belfast was largely built on the subscriptions of Protestants is a significant historical fact that should not be forgotten.  As far as these people about whom I am talking are concerned they must look at the situation as they find it now and as it is likely to be in the future and when they do they will see for themselves that the Six Counties are not viable economically, politically, culturally or socially.  It just has not worked out.</P>
    <P>If I were a young man about to get married, or with a young family, I would have the gravest concern for the future and for my family.  I would not want my children to grow up in a community which has been so poisoned with hatred and sectarianism.  I would feel it was my duty to do anything I could to change that picture and it can be changed.  The log dam has moved and it only requires people of goodwill and guts&mdash;and that is very important&mdash; to stand up and be counted.  If they do I am certain they will find a very good ready response from many of those whom they have regarded as their <Col N="1667" /> enemies.  They will certainly find a very ready response from the Government in Dublin.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has made it clear that we have no doctrinaire approach or solution to this whole problem.  Our aims are clear.  We have never made any secret of what our aims are.  We are prepared to discuss and consider almost any approach to this problem. We are not making pre-conditions. What we are saying is that the present situation is intolerable for the people living in the Six Countries.  It is in their interests that it should be changed but they must know by now that no permanent or worthwhile change can ever take place unless it is one agreed to and supported by this Government, by whatever Government it may be in Dublin.  It is in the interests of all of us and it is in the interests of the British that this should be achieved.  I believe that most people in the north, most Unionists, who have given any thought to this matter know now&mdash; whether they are prepared to admit it or not&mdash;that in 1970 or 1969 they cut a very sorry figure in the eyes of the British, and that provided the British Government, any British Government, whichever might be in office, could find an honourable way out of the morass they would take it.</P>
    <P>That being so, I would urge that they will think about it and realise that they have roots in this country, that any roots they thought they had in Britain are being cut.  This is their homeland; they are our people and as I said, we are prepared to consider virtually any approach to a solution of this problem.  The responsibilities in this matter lie very heavily on those who think in terms of trying to improve the situation rather than trying to cash in on the situation.  Those who think in terms of trying to improve the situation are, I am quite certain, the vast majority of the people north and south and the vast majority in Britain. Given this vast majority why can we not do something about it? I suggest to you that the reason we cannot is that small groups of very vociferous people stand in the way and that what is required is the moral courage to stand up to these people, <Col N="1668" /> wherever they exist.  If those who have this desire to achieve, or to go a step on the road to achieving a solution, will have that moral courage we will be a step on that road in a matter of months, but it does require moral courage and a recognition that failure to show that moral courage now may well result in a fierce and terrible catastrophe for the people of this country.</P>
    <P>I have spoken in this debate partly to mention some of the points that are troubling all of us in relation to the situation in the north but also to re-affirm the traditional republican Fianna Fáil policy.  This is the one for which I joined Fianna Fáil; it is the one that keeps me in Fianna Fáil; it is the one enunciated by every Fianna Fáil leader and it is the one to which all of us subscribe.  It is the one that this Government are going to enforce.  It involves, as I have indicated, a great deal more than merely our approach to the political problem in the North of Ireland&mdash;it involves our whole social concept, the whole way we approach the poorer and weaker sections of our community.  I want to tell this House and the country that this Government which, as the Taoiseach said, are rejuvenated, are going to be seen to be the most dynamic Government this country has ever had.</P>

      <P>While not entirely endorsing the concluding remarks of the Minister, as you can imagine, there was much in his speech which was worth listening to&mdash;all in fact except the beginning and the end.  I thought that some of his opening remarks were unworthy of him.  I do not think speakers on the other side of the House should at this moment of time introduce into the debate the word &ldquo;sordid&rdquo; and try to apply it to the Opposition.  They should be sensitive <Col N="1670" /> enough to avoid this and leave it out of their vocabulary for a few weeks to come in any event.</P>
      <P>I do not think his references to the actions of the leader of this party in this affair were in any way worthy of the Minister, a man for whom we have normally a very great respect.  If, in fact, Deputy Cosgrave had adopted the tactic which the Minister suggested as an alternative, had come into this House, attacked the Taoiseach and thrown down the gauntlet on that occasion, can we imagine the strictures that Deputy Colley, the Minister for Finance, would have cast upon a man so lacking in patriotism that, in a matter affecting the security of this country, he would come in and try to trap the Taoiseach in this way regardless of the consequences for the country? We could easily imagine what Deputy Colley, Minister for Finance, would have said and, indeed, if such a thing had happened&mdash;it would be unthinkable that a leader of this party would do such a thing&mdash;but if that had happened we would have had to agree with Deputy Colley.</P>
      <P>The fact is Deputy Cosgrave acted in a responsible manner and it ill becomes a Minister of a Government which benefited from that act, which had the opportunity of dealing with it before throwing it across the floor of this House, to criticise in any way Deputy Cosgrave's action.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>In matters affecting the security of the State it would be totally improper for the leader of the Opposition to publicise matters of that kind without having first spoken to the leader of the Government, who might put before him various considerations he might wish to take into account as regards how he would handle the matter. We do not know, we still do not know, enough about this affair to know what its implications are, but it could well have been the case that, when Deputy Cosgrave went to see the Taoiseach, <Col N="1671" /> the Taoiseach might have said to him: &ldquo;I am acting in this way for these reasons: if you explode the matter at this moment we may fail to catch people whom otherwise we would catch and I ask you therefore to hold your hand for the time being.  I will tell you what I am doing and why.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In those circumstances Deputy Cosgrave would, of course, have held his hand.  For him to have done otherwise than to give the Taoiseach an opportunity to say if there was any such consideration that properly could prevent this matter being brought to light at that time would have been totally improper and the Minister for Finance knows that as well as I do.</P>
      <P>In other parts of his speech there was much one could agree with, much that was interesting and valuable.  It is, indeed, a measure of the situation that faces us, and has faced us since last summer, that in a number of debates in this House we have had from both sides of the House contributions of a very high standard, a very high order, when people have been brought by the gravity of the situation really to speak their minds, to set on one side at least for part of their speeches in any event, considerations of party politics and to give us something of their own philosophy. We have heard today within a few short hours from the benches opposite two statements of philosophy, somewhat divergent, as I could point out, in character, but both worthy of consideration in themselves, both coming from people for whom we have respect on this side of the House.  I refer to the Minister for External Affairs and the Minister for Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In listening to the Minister for Finance and his statement of the republicanism which attracted him to Fianna Fáil I was reflecting on what he was saying.  I made a note of the points he made.  I found them of great interest because his definition of republicanism is really widely divergent from that of his recent colleague, Deputy Blaney.  His definition of republicanism comes down to two things.  He stated it, first of all, in terms of the doctrine of Tone and this he summarised under two headings: Tone and Fianna Fáil <Col N="1672" /> republicanism, as they express it, stand for the small man, first of all; secondly, that all Irishmen be treated equally. These are the two doctrines of republicanism to which he attaches importance.</P>
    <P>Is there anyone in this House who does not endorse these doctrines? What is there so specific to the party opposite that nationally proclaims it the repository of republicanism, which belongs only to Fianna Fáil, so that a man entering politics who believes these things has no alternative but to join that party?  Is there any party in this House or any person in this House who does not adhere to these views?  None.  But the interesting thing is that at that point Deputy Colley, Minister for Finance, went further: he said that something, and I can give the exact words, was added subsequently to the doctrines of Tone and he spoke of the belief in our own language and our culture as something additional to the doctrines of Tone.</P>
    <P>Here, of course, is the difficulty for the Fianna Fáil Party because they are ambivalent on this.  There is a deep ambivalence.  It demonstrated itself not only in the two speeches of the Ministers, on the one hand, and Deputy Blaney and Deputy Boland on the other, where the contrast is not over this vital issue, which divides us, or a few of us, from the rest of us now, but it showed itself in quite a fascinating way as between the speeches of the Minister for External Affairs and the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>Clearly, the Minister for Finance did not hear the Minister for External Affairs.  He had not the privilege the rest of us had.  There is between them a divergence of view, which is fundamental, and it is on this very issue, because the Minister for Finance not only cherishes our culture and our language, as indeed we all do&mdash;in that neither he nor Fianna Fáil are unique &mdash;but he cherishes them in a particular way and elevates them to a particular role which is, in fact, divisive, though he would not accept that it is divisive. He rejects from his particular form of republicanism&mdash;this is why he uses the word republicanism and the Minister for External Affairs does not lay <Col N="1673" /> the same stress on it&mdash;certain things and he adds to his form of republicanism the doctrines of Tone, which are all-embracing, which treat everybody equally, Protestant and Catholic and Dissenter alike, whatever language they speak or religion they practise, whatever part of the country they live in, all are treated equally.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance differs because he added something.  He is a revisionist in terms of modern Marxism.  He added an extra dimension to Tone's doctrines; you must be dedicated to a particular culture and a particular language.  This is, in fact, the traditional doctrine of Fianna Fáil and it is the expression of that doctrine throughout 50 years which has, more than anything else, helped to continue the division of this country because there will never be peace and unity in this country until the viewpoint put forward by the Minister for External Affairs, so ably and so nobly, in his concluding remarks is accepted, as it is by this party, as it is by the Labour Party, by the Fianna Fáil Party as their policy.</P>
    <P>There is in the Fianna Fáil Party today not merely a division between the Blaneyites and the Bolandites and the rest; there is a more fundamental division between people who adhere to these old doctrines of Fianna Fáil, this peculiarly narrow form of neo-Tonite republicanism, in which you have to dedicate yourself to one language and one tradition and elevate these over the others, and everybody else is a second-class citizen, a doctrine which is, of course, totally rejected not alone by the million or so of the majority in Northern Ireland but, indeed, by many other hundreds of thousands of people in the north and in this part of the country also.  So long as that view is put forward, so long as that particular brand of republicanism is put forward by the benches opposite, even by men of the quality and calibre and thoughtfulness and sincerity of the Minister for Finance, so long will this country remain divided.</P>
    <P>I was deeply impressed today to hear from the Minister for External Affairs a statement of a broader view, a viewpoint <Col N="1674" /> which has been expressed here from these benches for a long time past, a view point which found its greatest expression through our party in the Presidential campaign of 1966 in which Deputy Tom O'Higgins campaigned on the idea of a pluralist society, a society in which all traditions would be given an equal share, an equal part, would be treated equally&mdash;in fact the true, full doctrine of Tone as enunciated almost two centuries ago which has become lost in the mists and quagmires of the latter day doctrine of Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>The fact that the Minister for External Affairs propounded those views from those benches gives us hope.  I have always known that in Fianna Fáil there exist people of broad view who are pluralist in outlook, who do not accept this narrow doctrine enunciated in the early days of the party and carried forward to today.  I had the experience once, as I said in the House before, before entering politics of addressing a Fianna Fáil gathering on the subject of the language and Northern Ireland.  The last remark I addressed to that gathering, looking across to Jim Ryan who was sitting in front of me there, before I left, was that I was not disappointed with the reaction.  One-third of those present had in one way or another shown that they shared the pluralist vision that I had and did not accept the narrow, old-fashioned so-called republican outlook of Fianna Fáil.  I remarked as I left, and my last sentence to them was: &ldquo;I am not too disappointed; I had not expected to convert Fianna Fáil to true anti-partitionism in less than 20 years.&rdquo; I joined Fine Gael shortly afterwards.</P>
    <P>There are, therefore, on the other benches different views, ably expressed by men of sincerity.  It is not surprising that this should be so but is it not interesting that the place where these divergencies find expression is not within the divided ranks of the so-called coalition parties but in the ranks of Fianna Fáil?  In these parties we have a clear view.  There are, as I said the other day, no dissenting voices in these parties on this issue of introducing more violence in the situation in the north.  On these benches there are not, <Col N="1675" /> I think, dissenting voices on this issue of the vision of a pluralist society as outlined by Tone.  We are agreed on these essential principles.  There are, as has been said from the opposite benches, many things on which we disagree but they are not the fundamentals; on these we agree.  On the opposite benches one can see not two, but three schools of thought.  There is the small group of bitter men at last fortunately expelled from that Government. Even if it now lacks in experience and perhaps in ability and brilliance according to the Taoiseach something of what it had previously, and has been, in the words of the Tánaiste &ldquo;purged&rdquo;, it will no doubt benefit from that.  We see this small group of men with their violent views, a particularly vicious form of republicanism, although to use that word about their activities is to demean it.</P>
    <P>There are then in the rest of the Fianna Fáil benches among the men of goodwill who want a peaceful solution these two views which divide them deeply, these two policies in regard to partition one of which says: &ldquo;We stand firmly in our Gaelic republic and these people must be made to join us somehow&mdash;peacefully, of course; let us do it by constraining the British to push them out or let us just hope that it will happen some day that they will all wake up Irish speakers in the morning.&rdquo; That viewpoint was ably expressed by the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>The other viewpoint is that we must be prepared to create a real society of Tone, a society in which there will be genuinely equal treatment for everybody, where no group and no tradition, no language and no religion will feel in any respect diminished or at a disadvantage or in any respect second-class citizens, where no man will be denied the right to serve in the public service of his country because he lacks facility in one of its official languages, where everyone will be treated equally, the vision expressed in our Presidential campaign four years ago and expressed from the opposite benches today by the Minister for External Affairs.</P>
    <P>But which is the real coalition?  Is it to be found over here where we agree <Col N="1676" /> on all these essentials or over there where you have this deep division between one group of men who are out to destroy this country and amongst the rest a very deep division in their philosophy and vision as republicans? The real uneasy coalition is on the far side of the House.  Perhaps it is obscured from many of themselves by the extraordinary character of the Fianna Fáil Party which has been written about by political scientists as being closely akin, in its organisation and structure and in its devotion to the idea of the party, to the communist party, not, for a moment, I emphasise in its doctrines which are indeed conservative but in the extraordinary dedication to the party which takes precedence over the State.</P>
    <P>This devotion to the unity of the party which came out so strikingly even in the most critical moments of this difficult occasion, expressed by the Tánaiste among others on radio at 11 p.m. after the conclusion of the marathon debate and also by the Minister for Transport and Power.  This pride in the unity of the party which will overcome any crisis as the most important thing, I think obscures their vision.  I think many people opposite are genuinely unaware of the fact that they are in a party which is deeply divided on the most essential question of all, the basic philosophy of life, what kind of society we would like to see here and how we should tackle the unification of our country.  They are the divided ones, not we.  When they talk about coalition, if they would think of the reality rather than the form they would realise where the real coalition lies.</P>

      <P>I am not denying that this view has found some expression in the Fianna Fáil Party but no one except Mr. de Valera, with due respect to him, has throughout this entire period done more to elevate this concept of a Gaelic, republican State as something that must be accepted or rejected and cannot be a matter of compromise. I am afraid that his vision is <Col N="1677" /> different from mine and I could never share his.  Whatever lip service may have been paid to the idea of a pluralist society it has been within the context of this Gaelic idea expressed in terms which are not acceptable to many of our people in the north.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to interrupt the Deputy but Mr. de Valera made perfectly clear compromises on the question of the language by saying that the Northern Ireland Government with all its Ministries that were not related to all-Ireland affairs could be left indefinitely so long as they wished provided there was no longer any discrimination. That, of course, would include education and health and agriculture. He said that in 1936 and he knew there would have to be compromises once he admitted the possibility of that federal form of government with an all-Ireland parliament to manage defence, to manage tariffs and common affairs.  The Deputy is really exaggerating.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the intervention which is very interesting but let us analyse what is said.  It told us that in a unique gesture of tolerance Mr. de Valera was willing to agree that the people of Northern Ireland could keep a local parliament in which they could have their own way of running things. To get a job in Stormont it would not be necessary to speak Irish&mdash;a great concession&mdash;but what about the federal civil service?  What about the federal government, the federal parliament? Were they also to be changed and transmitted into a pluralist system?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>These details have not been worked out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>After 34 years no details have been worked out.  It is about time we sat down to work them <Col N="1678" /> out.  That is not a concession&mdash;that they could keep their own provincial parliament but that they be second-class citizens in the federal government of this State is something we will not accept and they will not accept. That is the issue that must be faced and it is on that issue that there is a divergence of view in this House which found its expression and has found it in the last three hours in this House in the speeches of two able Ministers both expressing with great sincerity their own viewpoints.</P>
      <P>May I say with regret that their speeches compared very favourably with that of the Taoiseach?  I do not mean that I regret their speeches were better but I regret that his speech was such a poor introduction to the debate. Some people think this was calculated on his part but could he really have believed that by producing a pathetic piece of potted history, the pot having been smashed and the plant visibly wilting, he was going to attract this House into a ridiculous debate about the merits of the Coalition Government in 1951 or what Mr. de Valera said in 1922 or something like that?  I cannot believe the Taoiseach seriously thought that kind of introduction would prove to be successful as a red herring that would divert us from the trail, that we would fail to do our duty in this debate by probing further this affair which has yet to be explained in many of its aspects.  It was a poor speech on his part and a poor introduction to the debate.  I shall say no more about it because the Taoiseach has certainly gone through a very difficult time.  He must be tired and if he showed his tiredness there we should not, perhaps, press the matter any further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But we must probe this whole matter further not just because it is a political matter or because it is our job to damage the Government in some way because, indeed, in all we have to do here and all we have been doing we have had to think seriously about the implications of our action for the country.  We have had to act responsibly. I say that there are many things we could have said in this debate which we have not said&mdash;certainly there are many things I could have <Col N="1679" /> said and have not said, although they would have damaged Fianna Fáil, because I feel they would have damaged the country too.  I have tried to confine myself to saying things which need to be said and which can be said without damage to the security of this country, or damage to the position of our compatriots, Protestant and Catholic, in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>In tackling this whole business we have to probe further.  This is evidently the wish of the people.  Every person we meet asks us: &ldquo;Can you get at the truth?  Is it going to be dropped now? Are you going to find out what it was all about?  What really is the position? Are you going to press for more information? Are you going to be left in ignorance?&rdquo;  The heading to the leading article in the <i>Irish Times</i> last Saturday was: &ldquo;Come Clean&rdquo;.  In the text of its leading article on Monday it said:</P>
    <P>Mr. Lynch, in fact, told the nation practically nothing in his speech in the Dáil on Saturday night.  It will be to the eternal shame of the Opposition, of the newspapers, and of public opinion in general if every detail of this whole affair is not smoked out, whether it be by Tribunal or by Select Committee. And if we spend over £100,000 on an inquiry into a television programme and allow the Fianna Fáil Government to slide out of this sub-Eric Ambler thriller, we deserve the sort of Government we may next get. </P>
    <P>Indeed, similar views were expressed by other papers.  The <i>Irish Independent</i> on the same day remarked:</P>
    <P>In any event, history will surely ask for more than Mr. Lynch's personal statement when the full facts of the country's greatest crisis since 1922 are being sought. </P>
    <P>I do not think we should wait for history to be written because we are faced with a Government with a personnel and with people in respect of whom questions still have to be asked. The Government will run this country for some short time to come and it is our job to make sure that that Government do not contain people against <Col N="1680" /> whom any shadow of suspicion can be cast, to use the Taoiseach's own words.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has stated in explanation on not having the matter pressed further at this point that there may be security reasons for not giving more information, or that there may be legal reasons because legal proceedings may ensue.  There is, of course, some truth in this but most of the questions I have to ask are ones in respect of which neither of these reasons exists as reasons for not giving answers. There are gaps to be filled that can be filled without prejudice either to security or to any legal proceedings that may have to be taken.</P>
    <P>Looking at the Taoiseach's speeches on this matter, and he has made three now, each one telling us a little more than the last, there is one thing they have in common.  None of them goes back further than the 17th April.  One starts at 20th April, one does not start very clearly on any date, but it certainly speaks of nothing before that date.  The last one starts on the 17th April.  All we have secured so far in this debate is to push him back three days.  I wish to push him back at least six months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>This information has come to him in various ways.  It has come to him from Opposition speeches in this House on several occasions. Deputy L'Estrange has contributed on this matter and should have been listened to long ago.  Deputy L'Estrange has a very acute eye for matters of this kind.  It was Deputy L'Estrange may I say, who drew to my attention&mdash;and I paid no attention to him; I ignored him &mdash;that significant phrase of Deputy Blaney's on the day when he had, as we <Col N="1681" /> now know, been summoned before the Taoiseach and told he would have to resign: the earthquake phrase.  Deputy L'Estrange showed it to me upstairs in one of the rooms and I said: &ldquo;Gerry, you are just imagining things.&rdquo;  I was wrong.  I will listen to him more carefully in future.  It is right to give credit where credit is due and I am quite prepared to admit that I completely missed its significance.</P>
      <P>We also have the <i>United Irishman,</i> not the most reliable source of information be it said on many matters, but, nevertheless, if I were the head of a government and it was brought to my attention&mdash;and I presume matters of this kind are drawn to the attention of the Taoiseach; that he is not so far above them that he must never be told about them&mdash;that a newspaper of any kind was making the assertion:</P>
      <P>Messrs.  Blaney, Haughey and Boland are seeking to buy their way into control of Civil Rights policy in the North.....</P>
      <P>Spearhead of the Blaney-Haughey-Boland conspiracy to subvert the Civil Rights movement is the Aidan Corrigan group in Dungannon and Seamus Brady, a journalist up to recently attached to the Dublin Government's propaganda corps.</P>
      <P>The finance for the take-over job involves large injections of Fianna Fáil money channelled from Messrs. Blaney, Haughey and Boland through Brady, former P.R.O. of TACA, who has been given a huge sum of money per week by his masters to induce Civil Rights people and others to follow the Fianna Fáil Government's line and go along with it....... </P>
      <P>If I as Taoiseach read or heard of things of this kind being said I would inquire into them.  I would not let that matter pass without making some inquiries if I did not know about it already.  Indeed, on that point the article went on&mdash;and this was the November issue of the <i>United Irishman:</i></P>
      <P>It is hard to believe that Mr. Jack Lynch is unaware of this cynical double-dealing by his Ministers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1682" /> These Fianna Fáil politicians are doing their best to disrupt Civil Rights and anti-Unionist forces in the North whose successes have been politically highly embarrassing to them.</P>
    <P>Other questions arise.  Is this plan an official Government or an official Fianna Fáil plan?  How much of this work has been financed directly by Government money?  How many people do Fianna Fáil want to elect on the Executive of the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association at next January's annual meeting. </P>
    <P>There are many other interesting bits too, including the photographs of the Ministers.  Boland: &ldquo;He knows.&rdquo; Haughey: &ldquo;He knows.&rdquo;  Blaney: &ldquo;He knows&rdquo;.  Lynch: &ldquo;Can he not know?&rdquo;</P>

Taca and All That&rdquo; and <Col N="1683" /> another for &ldquo;Hugh Kennedy&rdquo; described as &ldquo;Hugh Kennedy, the Fianna Fáil plant in the Belfast Citizens Defence Committee.&rdquo;  It is stated:</P>
      <P>Hugh Kennedy forgot that not everybody in the North was party to the Fianna Fáil plot to infiltrate the Civil Rights movement.  On Saturday, November 1, he visited Mr. Dennis Cassin, a Republican Club member and a prominent Civil Rights activist at his house at 3 Druid Villas, Armagh.</P>
      <P>In answer to questions from Mr. Cassin, Mr. Kennedy admitted that Fianna Fáil money was backing the &ldquo;Voice of the North&rdquo; and agreed that Mr. Seamus Brady had been the drive behind the &ldquo;Voice&rdquo;.  When pressed further as to whether the paper was financially viable or not he admitted that the paper was &ldquo;still being tanked up&rdquo; by Fianna Fáil. Mr. Kennedy has failed to deny this conversation to date. </P>
      <P>I could go on much longer but I will not.  Quite apart from that and assuming that the Taoiseach does not read it and that nobody ever reported to him of it, we now have a very interesting story in <i>This Week.</i>  Of course, I do not know how much of the story was furnished by the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries as he now is, whether he confined his intervention to furnishing the bits about himself and how he had tipped the Taoiseach off, or whether we can rely for other information in this upon his authority.

      <P>Anything is possible with Fianna Fáil at present.  The article in <i>This Week</i> reads:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It now seems that the Taoiseach was told some time in August/September last year that Mr. Blaney was in close contact with the Northern Command of the IRA.  As a Donegal man, who had known these convinced Republicans since childhood and who numbered many of <Col N="1684" /> them among his close friends, it was not unnatural that he should be in touch with them at such a critical juncture....</P>
    <P>Behind the scenes, significant moves were developing, however. The next Intelligence report that reached Mr. Lynch was more alarming. It indicated that men who were known to be members of the IRA Army Council in Dublin had been in consultation with both Neil Blaney and Charles Haughey in the city&mdash; not once, but several times and that they had met the two Ministers separately and together.</P>
    <P>Jack Lynch's reaction was prompt and decisive. </P>
    <P>One would know the origins of this paper and the sympathies of the editor. It went on:</P>
    <P>He called both Ministers to his office, put the facts as he knew them to the pair, and asked for an explanation.</P>
    <P>They laughed the allegations off, refusing to take them seriously.  But Lynch's attitude was anything but light: he remained quite concerned and, apparently, warned Blaney and Haughey that if they had any form of dialogue with the IRA Army Council they should break off such contacts immediately and permanently. </P>

      <P>This paper goes on to tell us: &ldquo;The next development coming up to the end of last year&rdquo;&mdash; and this happened in 1969 when all this information was given to the Taoiseach; I have not reached 1970 yet&mdash;&ldquo;must have been a bombshell to the Taoiseach.  He was consulted privately by James Gibbons, the quiet, unflappable, Kilkenny-born Minister for Defence&rdquo;.  The Deputies know where that quotation came from.  It reminds <Col N="1685" /> me of a conference I was at last year where handouts were given by various speakers and they were sent in drafts to the typing pool to have them typed. The one which caused the greatest entertainment was from a man who sent in one saying: &ldquo;Young, handsome, charming Mr. So-and-So said&rdquo;.  One can imagine the comments of the stenographers.</P>
      <P>We must come back now to the &ldquo;quiet, unflappable, Kilkenny-born Minister for Defence&rdquo; who had some disturbing information.  &ldquo;Gibbons had reports from Army sources that the connection between the IRA Army Council and the two Cabinet Ministers was still being continued&rdquo;&mdash;and he passed this information on to the Taoiseach. We are in a bit of difficulty because there is a conflict of evidence between Deputy Gibbons's hasty statement issued this week to get himself off the hook and the Taoiseach's statement. The Taoiseach has unfortunately told us he got no such report.  I think one can reconcile these inconsistencies.</P>
      <P>My experience is that, if one looks long enough and hard enough at the statement of any Member on the other side of the House and compares the statement carefully, word for word, with the skill of a detective and the knowledge of a lawyer&mdash;we have lawyers, and we are doing our best as amateur detectives&mdash;if one tackles it like that one can eventually reconcile these little contradictions.  All politicians have a distinct disinclination to lie, even those on the other side of the House.  Therefore, they evade.  If one looks at the statements very carefully when they evade, and if one can look at the text very carefully, one can find the nature of the evasion.</P>
      <P>I was looking at what the Taoiseach said on this subject.  It appears to be difficult to reconcile his statement with Deputy Gibbons's statement.  At column 1339 he said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Gibbons came to me occasionally, sometimes of his own volition, sometimes at my request, and we discussed largely the operation of the military units along the Border.  We also discussed his information in so far as activities <Col N="1686" /> within the Six Counties were concerned. He came to me on occasions for advice about different matters but on no occasion did he ask my advice or make any report to me about any other Minister. </P>
    <P>It is not easy to reconcile these two statements.  I do not believe people on the opposite side lie.  They try to make statements which are true if you read them every carefully.  There are difficulties in reconciling this statement. One suggestion put to me for reconciliation is that Deputy Gibbons did not perhaps inform the Taoiseach at one of these meetings to which the Taoiseach refers.  I am sure the Taoiseach is not saying anything which is untrue, even if we just pass over what was happening in the House last week.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gibbons would scarcely have said this week that he had let the Taoiseach know about this unless there was some truth in it.  That certainly would have damned him with the Taoiseach if he had not only attempted to exonerate himself but had done so by lying and saying he had tipped off the Taoiseach.  What may have happened is that Deputy Gibbons may have communicated with the Taoiseach through an intermediary on this particular point, and may have covered himself by letting the Taoiseach know, through an intermediary, about the activities of these Ministers but not actually have spoken to the Taoiseach direct.  The two statements can be reconciled on that presumption.  There may be some other reconciliation.  I am not prepared to accept that either person is not telling the truth.  There must be come reconciliation.  This is a possible reconciliation.  People with more fertile imaginations than mine could perhaps find another solution to the problem.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach must come clean on this whole point.  We have been told by the Taoiseach at Question Time that he was going to give more information tonight.  This is our third debate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder why the Taoiseach did not tell us earlier what apparently he is going to tell us tonight. He assured us at Question Time that various questions being put would be answered tonight.  It is not very satisfactory that the Taoiseach should retain some key pieces of information until his closing speech in the third debate about which he cannot be questioned, hoping there will not be a fourth debate&mdash;and he may be optimistic on that.  If the Taoiseach received only one indirect warning, or none, from Deputy Gibbons as Minister for Defence, then quite evidently in view of the statements made and the information available to us suspicion must attach to the new Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries.</P>
      <P>Despite the attempt by the Minister for Finance to obscure the issue, Captain Kelly has made it clear that everything he did was known to the Minister for Defence and he has stated that he was only slightly involved in the gunrunning plot but that he was involved to some degree.  If everything he did was known to the Minister for Defence and if, in fact, the Taoiseach says that at no stage did the Minister for Defence report to him then, unless one makes the charitable assumption that the Minister for Defence did report to him indirectly, Deputy Gibbons is on the spot.  The only claim the former Minister for Defence made on his own behalf in this article was that he tipped off the Taoiseach last year on this subject, warned him there was some queer business going on and that Deputies Haughey and Blaney were still involved with the IRA.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even Deputy Gibbons does not claim he tipped off the Taoiseach about the arms plot.  There was no such claim. The Taoiseach says Deputy Gibbons never reported at any stage on any Minister.  It is difficult to reconcile all these statements and to take them, so far as one can, at their face value in trying to ensure we are not interpreting them wrongly.  Captain Kelly's truthfulness has not been impugned by the Taoiseach.  Deputy Colley went some distance to try to say Captain Kelly was truthful and that his statements and those of the former Minister for <Col N="1688" /> Defence could be reconciled.  Clearly, Deputy Colley believes in the truthfulness of Captain Kelly, as do most people who have seen him on television on this subject.  If Captain Kelly is telling the truth, then Deputy Gibbons would know of everything he was doing.  He was involved slightly in the arms plot.  Therefore, Deputy Gibbons knew about that.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach told us Deputy Gibbons never reported to him on any other Minister and Deputy Gibbons has not attempted to suggest he reported to the Taoiseach on the arms plot.  That is more than just a shadow of suspicion.  That is something which has to be explained.  The onus of proof has clearly been shifted by these disclosures and by the statements made by the people concerned, on to the shoulders of Deputy Gibbons and, through him, on to the shoulders of the Taoiseach.  This House will not accept that in these circumstances, when more than a shadow of suspicion rests on the shoulders of Deputy Gibbons&mdash;perhaps unfairly&mdash;and when the onus of proof now rests on him to explain away these peculiar circumstances, he should remain a Minister, remain in one of the most senior posts in the Government, without further full and adequate explanation.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of Deputy Gibbons's involvement which requires explanation.  It is now well established that Deputy Blaney had for some time past been interfering in Army affairs. He had been providing the Army gratuitously&mdash;and they did not like it &mdash;with evidence coming from his own so-called intelligence service in Northern Ireland, urging on them the acceptance of these intelligence reports and saying that they should act on them.  This direct intervention in the affairs of the Army by a Minister of another Department is unprecedented. It is something which was either known to the Minister for Defence or was not know to him.  If it was not known to him the state of this country is far worse than we had suspected.  I do not believe it was not known to him.  I am not prepared to believe that such well-established activities, which are such common <Col N="1689" /> knowledge in the Army, as those engaged in by Deputy Blaney in providing this kind of information and being in contact with the Army over its affairs, could have been carried on without the knowledge of the Minister for Defence.  Did the then Minister for Defence inform the Taoiseach about this?  Did the Taoiseach know about this?  Was the Taoiseach aware that the former Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries was intervening in Army affairs?  If he was so aware, when did he find out?  If he was not aware, did Deputy Gibbons not tell him?  I think there are questions here to be answered.</P>
    <P>We are not talking of simply one isolated act by Deputy Blaney.  We are not talking just of peripheral involvement in any one particular transaction. We are talking of Deputy Blaney, over a prolonged period of time, engaged in contacts with the IRA&mdash;as is evidenced by this information, much of which appears to have come from Deputy James Gibbons himself.  We see him here in his role in contact with the Army, involved directly in its intelligence services, intervening there and then, as the tip of the iceberg comes out on top, involved in this arms plot.  Over this period, either the Taoiseach knew what was going on, and did not act, or he did not know&mdash; in which case, quite clearly, the Minister for Defence, Deputy James Gibbons, was not telling him.  I think all of this needs fully to be exposed.</P>
    <P>We have also the statements of not one but two witnesses from one of the civil defence committees in Belfast in respect of the replies given by Deputy James Gibbons, then Minister for Defence, to this group when they came to visit him.  In a statement by one of these two men of the same name&mdash; Mr. Kelly&mdash;Deputy James Gibbons's final reassurance was that, if the worst came to the worst, there was no need to fear.  There was reference also to a statement that Deputy James Gibbons had talked about the call-up of the FCA in an emergency for this purpose.</P>
    <P>We have another statement of a similar character from the other Mr. Kelly who said that the Minister for <Col N="1690" /> Defence agreed that the Irish Army was not in a position to act last year when violence broke out in August because it was not prepared.  Deputy James Gibbons regretted this lack of preparation and told him that, if the situation in the north deteriorated, help would readily be available.  Indeed, that second Mr. Kelly also refers to a discussion with Deputy Haughey, the ex-Minister for Finance, and makes a point&mdash;to which I shall return&mdash;with regard to Deputy Haughey's statement that he was not involved in the illegal importation of arms.  I think the word &ldquo;illegal&rdquo; is important&mdash;a point to which I shall return later.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am just giving the House some evidence.  We have evidence from a wide range of sources. Perhaps it is all a plot against poor Deputy Blaney, an innocent man, against whom everybody turns and against whom&mdash;independently, all over the country&mdash;people suddenly start plotting and producing statements on things he never did.  Perhaps.  I doubt it.  It does not sound in character with Deputy Blaney, apart from anything else.</P>
      <P>The crucial questions in all this are: How much did the Taoiseach know? How much did the Taoiseach condone? How long did he know it?  The line being sold by Deputy Blaney outside this House, as Deputies will be very well aware, is that the Taoiseach was also involved to some degree and that, unless proceedings are dropped, he might tell all.  I do not think the Taoiseach can tolerate this kind of blackmail. He must clear his position by a firm, circumstantial, unequivocal denial.  All we have had so far are equivocal denials.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Not one denial by any of the people concerned has failed to be equivocal. In every sentence, I see parsed and analysed language.  Every adjective has to be looked at and compared with other adjectives to see if there is a difference in nuance.  The time has gone for that.  The Government cannot stand as a credible Government on a series <Col N="1691" /> of evasions over adjectives.  If the Taoiseach does not, when concluding this debate tonight, circumstantially, unequivocably, firmly and totally deny the insinuations against him, then Deputy Blaney, in the weeks ahead, will damn him with innuendo.</P>
    <P>One curious feature of this case which has not been explained so far is Captain Kelly's refusal to talk to the Taoiseach when they found themselves alone together.  I have thought a lot about this.  I have tried to think myself into the position of Captain Kelly, on suddenly finding himself in the Bridewell, being interviewed by Special Branch, when he thought he had been carrying out work as intelligence officer for the Irish Government.  It was a curious position for him to find himself in.  He asked, quite properly&mdash;it is what they always do in detective stories &mdash;to see his Minister before talking to Special Branch: it would not be proper for him to tell Special Branch what Army Intelligence were doing and that he had his Minister's approval for doing it.</P>
    <P>His Minister arrives and makes some rather curious statements.  He says he is a decent man, and so forth.  The Minister does not tell Special Branch that everything done by Captain Kelly was done under his authority.  Captain Kelly begins to feel the ground shaking under him a little.  He very properly decides to ask to see the Taoiseach. He begins to wonder&mdash;at that stage, I should begin to wonder&mdash;if, in fact, his activities, under the authority of the Minister for Defence, were actually authorised at all.  Was it, perhaps, the case either that they were authorised but that everybody&mdash;the Taoiseach, the Minister and all others&mdash;ditched him or, alternatively, that they were not authorised or known to the Taoiseach?  Therefore, he asked to see the Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach asked the superintendent to leave but asked if he could bring in the Secretary of the Department. Captain Kelly said &ldquo;No&rdquo;; he would talk to the Taoiseach on his own &mdash;knowing that, if he is to get the thing straightened out, it had better be on a <Col N="1692" /> man to man basis, with nobody else present.  The Taoiseach says in effect: &ldquo;Right, let us discuss it&rdquo;.  There is a pause and the Taoiseach says nothing. He does not hold out his hand and say: &ldquo;Congratulations, Captain Kelly.  You have done a good job for us.  Of course, nobody can ever know the work you have done.  It has to be just between us.  There are certain difficulties now that have to be straightened out.  I know we can rely on you&mdash;the Official Secrets Act and so on&mdash;to keep silence.  Eventually you will get a posthumous medal or something.&rdquo;  No such words were spoken.  The Taoiseach just sits there looking at him and waiting for him to start.</P>
    <P>Captain Kelly suddenly realises that one or other of his two suspicions is correct.  Either the Taoiseach and the Minister knew&mdash;and they were going to ditch him&mdash;or, alternatively, the Taoiseach did not know and he was now being asked by the Taoiseach, without realising what this involves him in, to tell the truth about the Minister for Defence, which the Taoiseach might not know.  What I would do in these circumstances would be to remain silent and to go and see my solicitor.  I do not know whether Captain Kelly did the latter but certainly&mdash;and properly and rightly&mdash;he did the former.  What else could he do in this situation?</P>
    <P>Unfortunately for the Minister for Defence, he overdid it.  Feeding the story to <i>This Week</i> was one thing. Attempting to exonerate himself might have been acceptable.  He made the disastrous blunder of attacking in this House Captain Kelly's credibility.  He did not mean to do so.  If he had said nothing about that, nobody would have questioned&mdash;nobody showed any sign of doing so&mdash;what he thought of Captain Kelly.  If he had said nothing about it, I doubt if anybody would have pressed him as regards what he thought of Captain Kelly but he had to overdo the exoneration business and he ditched Captain Kelly with a few well-chosen words.  Captain Kelly reacted as any human being would react at that stage, particularly in view of the impact it had on his family. That, I think, was the undoing of <Col N="1693" /> Deputy James Gibbons, then Minister for Defence, and will prove, before this affair is finished, the undoing of the Government.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach must see, at this stage, what an appalling situation he has created by his failure to act earlier. He could have got rid of these Ministers on other grounds.  Deputy Blaney went to enormous trouble to give him grounds for getting rid of him by making speeches regularly, any one of which would justify dismissal.  The Taoiseach did not act although the Taoiseach must have known a good deal about Deputy Blaney.  We cannot say how much he knew because the Taoiseach's story starts on 17th April.</P>
    <P>Until the Taoiseach comes into this House, as I hope he will do tonight, and tells us the story from last August, and tells us what information he got from his Ministers, we shall not know the full story and we shall not be in a position to judge it.  All we can say is that he had ample grounds for dismissal even on the public record of Deputy Blaney's speeches; even on the public record of Deputy Moran's performance: his failure to attend his office; his unwillingness to do his job; his involvement in unsavoury incidents such as that letter which was produced in this House; his continuation in his practice&mdash;all of these gave ample grounds to get rid of him.  But the Taoiseach did nothing about it.  He could have got rid of these Ministers and indeed others also.  He did not do so.  He stands indicated for that now.</P>
    <P>It is no good trying to put across the story of decisive government.  We see the heading in <i>This Week</i>, &ldquo;Prompt and Decisive Action&rdquo;: that is when he called them in and gave them a talking to&mdash;and let them go away again to plot.  The Taoiseach will not succeed in presenting himself to the Irish people as prompt and decisive.  There has not been in the history of this State any Prime Minister, Taoiseach or President of the Executive Council&mdash;of any party&mdash; who has acted with so little promptitude, so little decisiveness, or who has got his Government and his country into such a mess as I am afraid this Taoiseach has done.  I appeal to him <Col N="1694" /> now not to make the same mistake again.  He acted unwisely in not disposing of these Ministers at an early stage.  Had he done so, all this would have been avoided.  He should now establish clearly and firmly, not just in his own mind but to this House and to the country, whether the new Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, Deputy James Gibbons, is truly beyond suspicion.  This can be shown only by a full account which reconciles all these discrepancies.  The Taoiseach should not continue to maintain that Minister in the Government under far more than a shadow of suspicion unless he is prepared to clear him in this House.</P>
    <P>Of course, judging from what was said at Question Time today, the Minister is probably under investigation. The Taoiseach has told us that every aspect of the matter is being investigated.  He was asked by whom and he replied the Attorney General. When he was pressed again he said it was not the Attorney General.  On being pressed further he said it was the Attorney General and, finally, he said it was by the police.  One takes it that the fourth answer was the correct one. Obviously, the Taoiseach is very unsure of his ground.</P>
    <P>I was anxious to ask a supplementary but, a Cheann Comhairle, you were becoming impatient at that stage with supplementaries and I was not allowed to put a further question. However, I am now asking the Taoiseach whether this investigation will cover everybody involved or is it the case that the police have been told by the Taoiseach that he is satisfied with this man, that he has thrown his mantle of protection around him and that he is outside this investigation? Is that the case or is it the case that the newly-appointed Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries is under investigation? This is one of the questions to which I want a reply.  One way or the other, I fear the answer will be extremely embarrassing.  Are the activities of the former Minister for Defence not being investigated despite what has been said?  This we cannot accept.  If so, is it the position that a prominent member of the Government is being <Col N="1695" /> investigated by the police?  There seems to be a dilemma out of which the Taoiseach cannot easily get.  Either case is true and either would leave the Government in a discreditable position.</P>

      <P>Even after the shadow of suspicion had descended on the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, Deputy Gibbons, the Taoiseach made the mistake of saying to Mr. Tom McCaughran of RTE that there will be no more resignations&mdash;a foolish statement to make in an affair of this kind and, perhaps, a foolish statement to make at any time.  The Taoiseach said the same thing in slightly different words to Deputy Cosgrave in the House last week.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a reply for which we could press and I intend doing so.  The previous speaker for the Labour Party raised the question of Deputy Gibbons taking libel action. That question evoked a most interesting remark from a non-practising solicitor. Of course, as soon as he became a member of the Government the Minister for Finance, Deputy Colley, unlike other Government members, had the integrity to terminate his legal practice. In fact, he sold it.  However, the Minister for Finance said that the statements made by Captain Kelly were possibly not actionable.  On hearing that, I consulted with a colleague in the lobby, Senator Alexis FitzGerald, who had just come in but who had not heard the remark.  He, too, is a solicitor and his face fell when I related the Minister's remark to him.  He looked shaken because he could not conceive how a solicitor could make such a statement. Admittedly, the statement was made by Deputy Colley as a Minister and not a solicitor but he was not displaying much professional knowledge when he made that statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It does not require much knowledge of the law to know that to describe what a person says as &ldquo;a tissue of lies&rdquo; and to call that person an &ldquo;unmitigated <Col N="1696" /> scoundrel&rdquo; is libellous if, of course, it is untrue.  I would be interested to hear of any court anywhere that has ever given a verdict on contrary lines when such phraseology has been used.  The Minister for Finance knows that perfectly well but he is doing a cover-up job.  He knows the position is that the failure of the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries to take an action is damnable.  He cannot take such action because the risk is too great.  He knows what the outcome would be.  He knows, too, who would be called to the witness box and they would include the Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>This Government have got themselves into a mess which is insoluble unless they come clean, unless there is a full investigation, unless the documents are laid before the public and unless the Taoiseach tonight can give a convincing explanation of the Gibbons affair.  Of course, it would require some ingenuity to produce a convincing explanation to this affair that is not damaging to the Government.</P>
    <P>There are some other inconsistencies and gaps because evasion and inconsistency are not confined to the Gibbons affair.  The Taoiseach chooses his words with great care but there are always four or five words at the end of his sentence which qualify the sentence out of existence.  I quote from column 1329 of the Official Report for the 8th/9th May:</P>
    <P>There was no question of delay or no complaints about delays from Garda Headquarters in respect of this query. </P>
    <P>That is the initial query about the arms shipment.  He did not say that the Garda did not have to complain about delay in action being taken later on other aspects.  He did not say if they did not have to complain about not being allowed to take action in regard to ministerial involvement.  I do not know how one can reconcile the image of &ldquo;honest Jack&rdquo; when every one of the Taoiseach's sentences ends in words which take away the meaning of the sentence.  It may be said that evasion is legitimate in relation to politics.  Perhaps it is, but is it all right for one <Col N="1697" /> to get oneself into the position in which one's entire existence consists of evasion in order to mislead the public? That is scarcely an activity which warrants the placing of the word &ldquo;honest&rdquo; before the name of the person concerned. I am not saying that it is necessarily wrong but I cannot reconcile the use of the word in relation to the unfortunate Taoiseach who finds himself, through the machinations of his Ministers, in the position of having to attempt to get out of this with the minimum damage to the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
    <P>We are entitled to know when ministerial involvement was first suspected. We are entitled to know what length of time elapsed between the first suspicion and the Taoiseach being informed. Was the Taoiseach informed of the suspicion on the Monday or was it only on the Tuesday, as his statement now seems to imply?  Did these reports refer to the then Minister for Defence? There is reason to believe that he was included in the suspicions of the Garda.  How much earlier had the Taoiseach been told of the Ministers' involvement with the IRA?</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of this matter into which we must inquire.  We have been told that there is an official in the Department of Finance who authorised the delivery of arms. Apparently, this whole plot would have been brought off were it not for the fact that the plotters overlooked a technicality which lays down that authorisation is required for the carrying of arms in the case of certain types of planes.  The Taoiseach seems to be suggesting that this plot would have succeeded but for the plotters using the wrong type of plane.  I find it difficult to accept that.  However, an official in the Department of Finance authorised the entry of arms.  Is that official still in his post?  Has he been questioned or, like Captain Kelly, has he been arrested?  Is he the other man? I think not.  If he has not been arrested or questioned, why not?  Did he act on the written or verbal authority of his Minister?  If he had not such authority the Minister would not have been dealt with in the way he has been. <Col N="1698" /> There are questions that have not been raised before but I hope we will have the answers to them tonight.</P>
    <P>With regard to the first ministerial interviews the Taoiseach did not answer me last time when I queried the use of the word &ldquo;instigate&rdquo;.  I do not think anybody has accused the two ex-Ministers of instigating the importation of arms.  They became involved in the plot because the IRA, these mysterious people, had difficulty in getting arms shipments into the country and they thought that if they could get authorisation from the Ministers everything would be all right.  I asked the Taoiseach if, when he queried the Ministers&mdash;I presume he was referring to the former Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries since he said the ex-Minister for Finance was not able to talk of details of this kind &mdash;and when they denied that they instigated the plot if he asked them if they had been involved in it?  What was the purpose of the word &ldquo;instigated&rdquo; being used here?  In fact in his last speech he uses different phraseology.  He says that the former Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries denied any part in the transaction. This is a slightly different statement. In regard to the former Minister for Finance he merely refers to his denial, without going into the details of it.  So there is a conflict here as to what exactly happened at this interview. Also in the first speech he said:</P>
    <P>They asked me for time to consider their positions. </P>
    <P>In his last speech he said that the former Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries asked for some time to consider his position.  In regard to the former Minister for Finance he simply said that he could not pursue the inquiries with him.  I am afraid his first account of these interviews was a very loose one and I do not think he gave us the full picture.  Certainly the references to the former Minister for Finance denying that he instigated it and asking for time to consider his position were not the picture of a man who was virtually incapable of speech, who was in such a bad condition the Taoiseach had to leave after four <Col N="1699" /> minutes.  The Taoiseach should not have, in his first statement, given a completely false impression of the position with regard to the former Minister for Finance as he did&mdash;perhaps inadvertently but I think unfortunately.</P>
    <P>Why did the former Ministers or Minister ask for time on this occasion? When a man is faced with an accusation he either says: &ldquo;I am innocent.  It is a lie&rdquo; or he admits guilt, even if by silence.  For a man to ask for time is a very curious reaction.  It certainly is not a statement of innocence.  If one is innocent one is innocent and that is that.  One does not ask for time.  Asking for time suggests a desire to find some way to get out of it lightly, a desire to undermine the authority of the person who is accusing one, a desire to fake the evidence.  There are various possible explanations but certainly they are not signs of innocence on the part of the people concerned.</P>
    <P>Let us come on to the &ldquo;Gestapo&rdquo; allegation of Deputy Boland.  Again let us watch the wording of the Taoiseach's denial&mdash;very carefully chosen words. He said that he did not at any time have Ministers' homes watched.  He did not say that they were not watched; he said that he did not have their homes watched.  He then said there was no warrant issued for telephone tapping of Ministers and Dáil Members.  He did not, however, say that the Ministers' homes were not watched; he did not say that their offices and movements were not watched; he did not say that he did not have their offices and movements watched and, as regards to the tapping of telephones, he said that no warrant was issued.  He implied in that statement that because no warrant was issued the phones were not tapped. Later on, however, at column 1332 he said:</P>
    <P>...there was no attempt whatever&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>he assured his friend, Deputy Kevin Boland, sitting over there</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;at imposing Gestapo methods on any member of the Government. </P>
    <P>A good statement except that &ldquo;Gestapo methods&rdquo; is a bit vague as this could reasonably mean that no member <Col N="1700" /> of the Government was tortured, which nobody had suspected.  A very carefully chosen phrase&mdash;&ldquo;Gestapo methods&rdquo;&mdash;it did not commit him to anything, but even that statement is qualified.  They might have been tortured apparently but &ldquo;certainly none that I directed&rdquo;.  They might have been tortured but he did not direct that they should be tortured.  Then beyond that: &ldquo;and none so far as I could ascertain&rdquo;. I was watching Deputy Boland and he did not seem to be terribly satisfied with an assurance that there was no attempt at imposing Gestapo methods, none that the Taoiseach directed and none as far as he could ascertain.  If I were Deputy Boland I would, in those circumstances, have done what he did, shaken my head, which is precisely what he did faced with that assertion.</P>
    <P>Another curious thing about the report of the debate is that we all recall the Taoiseach&mdash;because we were all here when the Taoiseach spoke&mdash; trying to remember the name of the Act under which Captain Kelly and somebody else were arrested and detained for 24 hours and then another 24 hours.  He could not remember the actual Act.  Indeed he went on to say that in fact he was sorry, he really ought to have looked it up before he came in.</P>

      <P>That is all very well but let me read the Official Report, as perhaps corrected by the Taoiseach's secretary, because it reads most curiously&mdash;the correction was rather incomplete.  I do not think that one should fiddle around with the Official Report unless one is going to do it very thoroughly&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the day following that consultation and directly as a result of it Captain Kelly who has been mentioned in the course of this case&mdash; and there is another individual whose name has not been mentioned and, because of the sources from which I have my information I feel I cannot disclose it at this stage, and because of other action that may follow&mdash; was arrested under section 30 of the <Col N="1701" /> Offences Against the State Act&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>That is what is here.  I am reading the debate.</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;which could require his detention for a limited period of 24 hours, I think, renewable if necessary without specifically bringing a charge.  Its purpose is to give a man a chance of explaining himself if he has an explanation and to let him out within a limited time. </P>
    <P>Wait until you hear this one:</P>
    <P>I should, perhaps, have made myself familiar with the particular section but I do not think it was necessary for the purpose of my statement. </P>
    <P>If you are going to fake a statement by putting in the name of the Act you should at least delete the bit where he says he did not remember the section. I do not think the Official Report should be treated in that way, even by the Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach says he is satisfied that no Secret Service money was used because it is spread around so much&mdash; column 1336.  Again it is a very unconvincing denial when one reads the exact words.  I quote:</P>
    <P>I had the usual sources from which one might expect these things could be paid for, checked. </P>
    <P>It is nice to know that we have usual sources from which it is usual to finance illegal arms imports.</P>
    <P>The Secret Service Funds amounted to £11,500 and had to be spread over the Departments which draw on these funds.  Therefore, there was no question of the Secret Service funds being used. </P>
    <P>He does not say that he checked to see had they been used for it but he looked at the figure of £11,500 and he said: &ldquo;Four Departments getting £11,500. You would never get £30,000 out of that.  There is no need to look any further&rdquo;.  In fact, of course, the allegation which I have heard is not that the Ministers financed £30,000 or £80,000, the allegation I have heard is that they financed it to the tune of <Col N="1702" /> £2,500, a sum which could easily be found out of this £11,500 spread around, if the Taoiseach had looked.  I suggest he looks again.  I do not know whether they did get such money from that source.  I do not even know if the allegation is true but I will not accept an assurance that simply because the sum is only £11,500 none of it was pinched.  No auditor could accept that kind of approach to checking up on a fraud.  He then says that no money was missing from the Department of Defence.  Did he check the most obvious place&mdash;the Department of Finance? That is where one of the Ministers concerned is involved.  It seems improbable, if the Minister for Defence is as innocent as we are told, that the money would come from the Department of Defence.  The likely place is the Department of Finance and he does not tell us whether he has checked there. There is no denial in respect of there, no indication that he checked it.</P>
    <P>In trying to reconcile the Taoiseach's speeches one is up against one difficulty&mdash;that in his second speech he managed to stop on the 2nd of May. He changed the subject.  It was done so neatly that I did not even notice it. It was only when I re-read the debate I realised that he had not, in fact, gone over the ground the second time more fully from the 2nd of May onwards. There are questions which have been asked and which have not been answered.  He has been asked when did he see the former Ministers a second time.  There is a curious unwillingness to disclose this.  In the first statement which contained all kinds of dates that date was omitted.  In the second statement when he came up to the point where that date was relevant, and he had been asked to give it, he changed the subject and talked about something else.  He never went over that ground again.  It is time for him to tell us.  It is a matter of some interest to know when he asked them a second time to resign forthwith.  He used the word &ldquo;forthwith&rdquo;.  They asked for time, time until Wednesday morning. When did they ask for that time? How much extra time were they looking for the second time and for what purpose?  Again I would like to know what reasons they gave.  We are entitled <Col N="1703" /> to know how much additional been in contact with an illegal organi-time they were looking for on that occasion.  That, we have not been told because the date of that meeting has been withheld from us.  What he said in the first speech was&mdash;and we have nothing in the second speech to check with&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>I decided to approach the two Ministers again and to repeat my request that they tender to me their resignations as members of the Government....Having told the Ministers that I wished to have their resignations forthwith, each of them told me he would not give me his resignation until this morning. </P>
    <P>I remarked in the previous debate that it is very curious they both said the same thing.  They both looked for time to the same date.  What for?  What were they planning?</P>

      <P>This was part of it. In this House last Wednesday Deputy Blaney was telling his friends and, indeed, the newspapers not to worry, that he had been asked to resign several times, that it had been announced in the papers but it would not necessarily happen, that he might not have to hand over the seals of office.  Why not?  One explanation is they thought they would overturn the Government on that day and that he would be Taoiseach.  This is a public statement in the newspapers by Deputy Blaney but it is not the only possible explanation because there are some indications he was saying something more than this.  He was saying that when he went to the President the President might not enforce the resignation. He seemed to be confident, <Col N="1704" /> like Deputy Haughey also, that, in fact, not alone might they overturn the Taoiseach within the Fianna Fáil Party constitutionally but that they might even secure the consent of the President to an unconstitutional act, a <i>coup d'état</i>, effectively that the President would refuse to operate the Constitution. All I can say is that shows a remarkable lack of confidence in the willingness of the President of this country to carry out his duties, a lack of confidence which I am perfectly certain is not justified.  It is a particularly disreputable element in the situation that they should have apparently thought in those terms and spoke in those terms to their friends.</P>
      <P>Now let us come to the Ministers' denials.  If the Taoiseach uses words with care, if there are evasions and half-truths in the Taoiseach's remarks, imagine what we will find in Deputy Blaney's and Deputy Haughey's remarks. Deputy Blaney in the House said: &ldquo;I have run no guns.  I have procured no guns, I have paid for no guns, I have provided no money to buy guns.&rdquo;  Great stuff coming from over there.  It sounded very well.  Let us pause and analyse it.  First, he said something else: &ldquo;I want also to deal with the much more sinister, far more subtle and blackguardly rumour that I have or had anything to do with subversive organisations in so far as this country is concerned.&rdquo;  He went on to deny hotly a link with Saor Éire, a link which nobody mentioned in this connection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us look at this very carefully. He did not even say in respect of himself that he denied being involved in subversive organisations in this country. He went on to make that denial about his brothers: &ldquo;I know of no connection of theirs with any illegal organisation in this country&rdquo;.  Now we can put the story together.  His brother&mdash; there is only one brother suggested being connected with it&mdash;is apparently involved in an illegal organisation in Northern Ireland.  This is what one must assume from this.  I take it that Deputy Blaney is adhering to the truth about the customary evasions and half truths.  His brother is involved in an illegal organisation in Northern <Col N="1705" /> Ireland.  Deputy Blaney has, in fact, sation in this country but in respect of its activities in Northern Ireland. That is the statement he made.</P>
    <P>I should like to invert all those statements. Whatever is not denied is what, in fact, happened.  This one can be sure about.  This is the mechanism in which all these people operate, the Taoiseach and everybody else.  All those statements are carefully phrased and one can easily find out what happened by seeing what they did not deny.  If a man was not involved at all he would state he was not involved at all.  If, as is true apparently of his brother, he was never involved in an illegal organisation in this country he would say that but that is not what he said.  He said he was not involved in subversive organisations in so far as this country is concerned.  I do not know what organisations they are&mdash;Saor Éire is, in fact, the one he refers to&mdash;which are involved in direct attacks on institutions in this country.  He went to to deny specifically involvement in Saor Éire.  I will accept that unequivocally.</P>
    <P>It is clear then what Deputy Blaney is saying is that he is not involved with Saor Éire but he was involved in this country with an illegal organisation in respect of their activities outside this country.  There is no other denial, and no denial from Deputy Blaney of facilitating the importation of guns or of involvement with illegal organisations in so far as Northern Ireland is concerned.</P>
    <P>Let us look at Deputy Haughey's statement.  It is a curious one in many ways.  I find one part particularly strange, the part which said: &ldquo;So far as I have been able to gather the Taoiseach received information of a nature which in his opinion cast some suspicion on me.  I have not had the opportunity to examine or test such information or the quality of its source or sources.&rdquo; That is a curious statement for an accused man to make.  There is a statement of innocence of a qualified character later.  He does not start off with the statement: &ldquo;I am innocent.&rdquo; He says: &ldquo;I have not seen the evidence so I do not know how much can be proved against it.&rdquo;  I do not think the solicitor who drafted that was doing anything very wise.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1706" /> He then goes on to make the usual customary denial we get from those people, but read the words carefully. He said: &ldquo;In the meantime I now categorically state that at no time have I taken part in any illegal importation or attempted importation of arms into this country.&rdquo;  It is a moot point as to what is illegal and what is not.  Deputy O'Higgins, in concluding the debate for this party, will have something to say about this.  There may be a legitimate divergence of views.  The Minister for Finance may well have thought that once he gave his fiat for arms to be imported hey presto it became legal.  I do not think he is right for reasons Deputy O'Higgins will go into.  He may well have thought that when he made the statement.  He did not deny he was involved in the importation of arms to send to the north; he did not deny he was involved in this importation of arms.  He denied the activity was illegal. That is an interesting legal point but I do not think it is what we are concerned about here.  We are concerned about the facts, not the legality at this point of time.</P>
    <P>I note Mr. John Kelly of the Citizens' Defence Committee in Belfast made the same point&mdash;I quoted this earlier in my speech&mdash;about the word &ldquo;illegal&rdquo; being important.  We are dealing here with tricky people.  When even Honest Jack permits evasions, imagine what the others are capable of.  That is why we have to parse every word and line. Incidentally, the Minister for Finance also stressed the use of the word &ldquo;illegal&rdquo; in his speech.  That is very significant.</P>
    <P>Let us very briefly sum up the main points that emerged from those non-denials. The Taoiseach has not denied being informed about Deputies Haughey and Blaney before the 17th April.  He avoided talking to them before the 17th April.  Deputy Blaney has not denied involvement with subversive organisations in so far as the north is concerned or with the facilitation of arms shipments.  Deputy Haughey has not denied being involved in arms shipments that have in his view been legalised by his intervention. There is one other denial we have not had.  Perhaps, I have missed it because <Col N="1707" /> one cannot be in the House all the time.  In one of those journals, perhaps in <i>This Week</i>, it is said that the Minister for Transport and Power was approached by the plotters at some stage but said he would not get involved. That is very good and very wise of him.  Who did he tell?  If a man is asked to take part in a plot of this kind against the security of the State his duty is to go immediately to the security authorities, or in the case of a Minister, to his Taoiseach, to tell him about it.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Taoiseach in reply to say if he inquired as to whether Deputy Lenihan was, in fact, approached and if the Minister for Transport and Power was approached did he tell anybody or did he say to his pals: &ldquo;I will not get involved in a thing like that but I will not tell on you&rdquo;?  What kind of standards are we getting from our Ministers?  We want an answer to that question from the Minister for Transport and Power or on his behalf, if he is not able to speak, from the Taoiseach.  We must be told the whole truth.  I make the point here that on this we want an assurance from the Taoiseach tonight that either those people must be prosecuted or if they are not prosecuted this House and the country are entitled to publication of the full evidence, such as it is, for the country to make their own judgment. The evidence should be published in a White Paper subject only to the suppression of the sources of data or to any particular reference in a document which might disclose its source. Such exclusions should be certified by the security authorities as necessary.</P>
    <P>That is what we require and that is what the country requires.  If we are going to be told when the debate is over and the Government feel it safe to do so that there is not enough evidence to justify a prosecution and it will all be swept under the carpet this neither we nor the country will accept.  The Government's credit can never be re-established if that is done.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Taoiseach about other arms attempts.  In one of his denials, again the careful choice of words&mdash;I have not got the exact text <Col N="1708" /> in front of me&mdash;he said this was the only attempted arms shipment of which information had come to him and in which Ministers were accused of being involved or were involved in.  This is a very interesting denial because he did not deny there were other armed shipments but that there were not other ones he knew about of Ministers being involved in, which is a very limited denial.  Apparently, there have been other arms shipments.  I seemed to hear it said today that there had been no other seizures.  What is the evidence in this regard?  There are very many reports and rumours.  Many of them I am sure are true because this situation breeds rumours.  We have had reports of a ship at the docks, including one report which reached me this morning of a more circumstantial character, which named all the people concerned and the destination of the arms.  I got in touch with the appropriate authorities immediately and handed this information to them.</P>
    <P>One dismisses the usual anonymous letters which contain vague accusations that Deputy Collins was doing this and Deputy Lenihan was doing that, which means nothing whatever.  But when you get a letter that makes specific accusations about a particular person you must pass this on and in this case I did so immediately.  There was also a rumour that a B737 was chartered for 14th April and this was cancelled. Is there any truth in this allegation? I have been told by a man who was in this House on Friday night that subsequently, during the course of our debate, he was present at a place on the coast and saw a cargo being landed which he identified as an arms cargo that was carried across the Border.  I was told this in good faith and I reported the matter to the security authorities.  It was a most circumstantial account and I cannot say whether it was true, but it is a matter now for the security authorities to investigate.</P>
    <P>There are many rumours currently being voiced; some of them, as in the two cases brought to my notice, are extremely circumstantial, but we need some assurance from the Taoiseach about how effective a check is being <Col N="1709" /> kept.  Having driven across the Border with Deputy Cruise-O'Brien we did not get the feeling that had we wished to import arms anybody on either side would do much about it&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly hope that we are showing more concern than would appear at first sight.  We must ask for whom are these arms being imported? There have been many denials about this matter but there is a statement in today's papers from the official IRA&mdash;who are almost respectable in this affair&mdash;that the Provisionals have been responsible for provocations in the north and that the arms were for them. Not being on the IRA mailing list I have not got the full text of their statement, but from what I read in this morning's <i>Irish Times</i>, if the official IRA are correct in their statement as reported, it is difficult to conceive of a more irresponsible action than that of Deputies Blaney and Haughey.  Apart from giving guns to Saor Éire to murder our policemen, I cannot see what worse action those Deputies could have taken than providing arms for those people.</P>
      <P>To give arms to any group, no matter how responsible, is dangerous.  We know that the people who appear to be in charge of an organisation are not, in fact, in many cases really in charge.  If we think back to 1916, people who thought they were in charge of the Volunteers, I refer to Eoin MacNeill in particular, were unaware of who was really in charge and what they were planning.  Nobody can give arms to an organisation and think he knows what will be done with them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another mysterious matter on which we require some further enlightenment is the question of Mr. Seamus Brady and the <i>Voice of the North.</i>  We have had denials about this but Mr. Brady claims to have been on the staff of the Government Information Bureau or on the staff of some Government body for some time.  This claim is supported by <Col N="1710" /> the <i>United Irishman</i>, which perhaps is not the best authority, but in view of the fact that they and Mr. Brady are not on the best of terms they might be telling the truth on this occasion.  Has Mr. Brady ever been paid out of State funds and, if so, for what services? We have not had a straight answer to this question.</P>
    <P>Those are the questions that must be answered.  It has been worthwhile going through the so-called denials from the people concerned and the so-called explanation from the Taoiseach which was so carefully worded as to mislead on virtually every point.  It is time we got a full, frank statement from him and until we get this statement there cannot be much confidence in this Government.</P>
    <P>The other side of the House have tried to get out of the situation by counterattack.  They have hit out wildly in various directions.  We have had the Minister for Finance attacking Deputy Cosgrave, which was disreputable and did not get very far; we have had the line about the Labour Party not being keen on the EEC, and there was some rather weak talk about coalitions, but it lacked the fire and enthusiasm that formerly was displayed in these exchanges.  Now that the Government are such a divided coalition themselves they do not use the term &ldquo;coalition&rdquo; with such zest as formerly.</P>
    <P>The Minister for External Affairs, in trying to suggest that the Opposition might be divided, did so by a most curious argument, which appeared to me to be self-defeating.  He said that nobody in this matter can speak for anybody else.  The implication was that if the Opposition parties said &ldquo;We are not divided on this issue; there are no dissenting voices in the Opposition&rdquo; this did not mean anything.  This argument can be operated on both sides of the House.  I notice, incidentally, that the Minister for External Affairs did extend his confidence and his knowledge of human nature in one respect: he said &ldquo;We on this side of the House &mdash;myself, the Taoiseach and others&mdash; are agreed on our policy&rdquo;.  Apparently the Minister knows what goes on in the Taoiseach's mind but we on this side of the House do not know anything <Col N="1711" /> about the thoughts of our colleagues. The Minister confined his remarks to himself and the Taoiseach; I thought he might have had the generosity to include the Tánaiste, although perhaps he would be wise to go no further than that at this stage.</P>
    <P>The choice before the country at the moment is betwen a divided and discredited coalition of opposites on one side and, on the other side, an Opposition united on Northern Ireland policy which is the only matter of supreme importance at the present time.  There are other points on which we disagree and also ones on which we agree. From Labour and Fine Gael benches in the last few years there have been a number of statements on the issue of patronage which were unanimous and united and in marked contrast to the attitude of the other side of the House on the subject, but I shall not develop this any further.  While we are united on the crucial issue of peace and war the other side are deeply divided on that issue and even on their basic philosophy as to what kind of country they want to create, whether a Gaelic Republic or a pluralist State; the Government's talk about division on this side of the House rings singularly hollow.  The days when that kind of insult can be thrown across the House with any kind of conviction have gone forever.</P>
    <P>On the other side of the House there are two kinds of people: hawks and doves.  I shall tell the House something about those two birds.  The encyclopedia defines hawks as &ldquo;birds of prey &mdash;either eagles or vultures.  They build nests of sticks for themselves well up in the trees&rdquo;&mdash;a phrase we have heard once or twice from a Deputy who is absent from the House.  &ldquo;They pursue their prey by swiftly following its efforts to escape.  The departing hawks foul their nests&rdquo;&mdash;in this case only the people can disinfect them.</P>
    <P>Doves are defined as &ldquo;gentle, plump birds with feathers that are easily pulled out.  They strut about with a characteristic bobbing of their heads.&rdquo; Oddly enough, in this House the head-bobber is a hawk; it is Deputy Boland who nods from time to time when <Col N="1712" /> things are said that do not suit the Taoiseach.  The encyclopedia tells us that the surviving dove accepts a new mate slowly and they continually look for figs and berries.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Deputy a hawk or a dove?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>This hawk/dove syndrome operates only on the other side of the House.  It does not arise here as we are all birds of a feather.  The Government should not continue in office with such hawks in the trees. There are members of Fianna Fáil who will not applaud the Taoiseach but who will applaud his enemies.  One of the gentlemen concerned defended his action in the restaurant and said that at least he was honest.  I suppose at this stage it is something for a Fianna Fáil Deputy to be honest.</P>
      <P>There are some bright points to which I should like to refer, as I always like to conclude a speech on an optimistic note.  This is not the debate on economic policy.  We have that on the Budget.  However, I think it is worth saying it is very fortunate that the Minister for Finance has been changed. I do not say this particularly as a reflection on Deputy Haughey, although I believe his recent policies have been pretty well disastrous for the country, but because, as well as that, had he remained he would have felt the obligation to justify them.  The trouble about pursuing the kind of policy he has pursued of inflating the economy, letting things rip and not taking any action to deal with it is that he constantly has to justify it.  When we come to this autumn or indeed well before that now, if action is required to deal with our economic difficulties he would have felt obliged to stand over his Budget by not taking action until it was too late.  We have a new Minister for Finance who may be more free of these inhibitions and I have more confidence that our economic difficulties will be tackled when we have a Minister who will be free from the burden of past policies and indeed who might even, shall we say, take a certain malicious pleasure in reversing them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the Deputy's correction and I withdraw the remark.  As regards the economy, things have not been made easier. There are two ways in which trouble may come more rapidly than it might have come.  One is the effect on the tourist industry, which is unpredictable at this stage.  The other is perhaps more important, the inflow and the outflow of capital.  The preservation of our external reserves depends more than ever on capital flow.  Last year the inflow of capital brought us in £66 million, that is, 40 per cent more than any previous year in our history.  But for that our reserves would have fallen sharply. Now already this year there is reason to believe that this inflow will diminish. For one thing, the Central Bank has determined that the inflow of capital to the non-associated banks should be cut by something like 60 per cent; and there were signs that already money was flowing out of the country.</P>
      <P>In those circumstances to create a situation in which lack of confidence in the Government and lack of confidence in the preservation of peace could follow from the events of last week is to aggravate this danger.  One must remember that this year the Government are committed to borrow abroad on a more extensive scale than any Irish Government have ever borrowed. The Government are committed to finding £75 million from three sources: the Budget&mdash;none; in fact there will be a deficit, and even on the Minister's statement there is no surplus; borrowing from the banks&mdash; the Central Bank is limited to £50 million; and foreign borrowing.  On their own statement the Government must borrow £25 million this year.  If, as I suspect, there is a deficit of £5 million to £10 million, they may have to borrow £30 million to £35 million abroad, in addition to what Aer Lingus has borrowed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That would be difficult enough in any circumstances.  In a country faced with a raging inflation and where the <Col N="1714" /> confidence in the Government has been shaken by these events, and where there are no doubts as to whether peace will be maintained, it will be even more difficult to borrow that money. It could well be that the combination of outflow of capital, of difficulty in borrowing the money the Government are scheduled to borrow, and of the effect on our tourist receipts, will aggravate the economic situation and make it necessary for the Government to act sooner than would have been the case.  This will be Deputy Colley's problem.  However, we have a Minister who is not committed to the policy of the previous Minister and who might therefore be prepared to change policy more readily.  This could be very important to this country in the months ahead.</P>
    <P>There are also several other good things.  We have a firm assurance from the Taoiseach that only this House can commit the country to an act of war and that for our Army to cross the Border would be an act of war.  This is a most important assurance.  When I queried the Taoiseach on this today he suggested that it was not necessary; it is in the Constitution.  I am glad to hear it.  I was not convinced it was as clear as that until the Taoiseach said it. I should like to have it consolidated, to have it quite clear and binding that there will be no question of our Army crossing the Border into what is claimed by some, and indeed by our Constitution, as part of the national territory without the authority of this House.</P>
    <P>We have also got from the Minister for External Affairs, despite what has been said by one Deputy over there, the first clear-cut statement of the acceptance of a pluralist society.  This provides common ground for the Members of this House.  We have an Opposition united in defence of the Constitution and united for peace, and the country knows that if the Government is overthrown or if the Government resigns or if there is an election or if anything happens to get rid of this Government, the people need not worry; there is another Government there, a Government that will maintain peace in this country and that the people can rely on to maintain peace <Col N="1715" /> more than they can rely on this ramshackle coalition on the other side of the House.</P>
    <P>To get away from criticism of the Government, I should like to get all parties to come together on this point. I think it is clear from the debate that there is a great measure of agreement in this House.  It is a measure of agreement which we have yet failed to communicate to Northern Ireland and even to Britain.  Although this has been asserted frequently enough, I do not think that we have yet got this across. It is a great pity that the Taoiseach last summer or last autumn refused to have an all-party committee on Northern Ireland affairs.  I can see now why he could not do so.  On such a committee the hawks in the Government would have demanded representation. He may now be in an easier position to arrange for such a committee. I appeal to him to do anything in his power to work for a tripartite policy on the question of the north, a policy which will be seen to be a united national policy.</P>
    <P>When I queried the Taoiseach today at Question Time on the possibility of publishing a joint statement of policies, he dismissed this by saying: &ldquo;You have your policy.  Labour have theirs.  The people know what they are.&rdquo;  This is nonsense.  The people of Northern Ireland, the ordinary Protestant living in Sandy Row or out in the countryside does not know what the policies of the parties are here.  They may not even know the names of the parties here.  If there was a document we could produce and circulate widely in which it was clearly stated that the policies of these three parties are the same, that we were determined that violence would not be used to end Partition, that the Border would not be crossed by our Army, and that Partition should only end with the consent of the majority of the people of Northern Ireland, if this could be asserted in one document, whether it be a publication with three separate sections saying the same thing or one section in which we jointly say it, this could profoundly affect the position.</P>
    <P>This reassurance is needed.  It can <Col N="1716" /> be given.  Let no party division or concern for party advantage hold us back from this at this stage.  All parties in the House could join together in this exercise.  The Minister for External Affairs has spoken in these terms of doing what he can to help the situation, of men of good will coming together.  In this we can come together without prejudice to our differences, without prejudice to the criticisms we make of the Government or the criticisms that the Government make of us. Let us do this for the sake of the country.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;those of us who believe in the principle that brevity is the soul of wit have been prevented from offering.  I must be very brief. The one thing I am surprised at is that by some peculiar double thinking, Fianna Fáil are trying to allege that the crisis&mdash;there is no doubt it is a crisis&mdash;has been caused by the Labour and Fine Gael Parties.  Let me spell it out for them: the crisis has been caused because the Taoiseach has alleged that two of his Ministers have been guilty of treason.  You cannot get away from that&mdash;that he has alleged that.  Now, if the evidence which he claimed to have had and as a result of which he asked for the resignations of three Ministers&mdash;one first and two afterwards&mdash;is so flimsy that the Minister for External Affairs saw fit to come in here today and say &ldquo;Maybe, if, but&rdquo;, then the Taoiseach is guilty of a very serious charge which can be thrown at him by any Member of this House, and the Taoiseach should resign and allow his party to elect a new leader.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But if, as he claims, there is additional evidence which was not very important but which he said was additional, he had proof enough to ask Deputy Blaney and Deputy Haughey to resign, but they did not resign.  If that is so, I cannot see why anybody in Fianna Fáil can say that we and Fine Gael are responsible for what has happened. The responsibility lies with the Taoiseach because, first of all, he did not watch his job of seeing to it that this sort of thing was not carried on.  I was under the impression&mdash;I still have a soft spot for Jack Lynch, though we <Col N="1718" /> must forget about the individual here &mdash;a man in the Taoiseach's position who allows things like this to happen could not be left in control of a country.  It is as simple as that.</P>
    <P>Secondly, the suggestion has been made that Deputies Blaney, Boland, Haughey and Moran can now be trusted to carry on the affairs of the nation, to support the Government in office, knowing, as somebody said here today, that at the first opportunity, if it suits them, if it is true they are disloyal as Ministers, they will pull the rug from under the Government and take over.</P>
    <P>Is that the type of Government we want or that the country is entitled to have?  I wish to say a few words about Deputy Gibbons.  I should like to spend a few minutes discussing the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries.  The other evening I posed the question if it was true that arms had been landed in Dublin port and had been taken by an Army lorry to some place in the country.  Deputy Gibbons said it was the most preposterous thing that was ever heard.  Does the Taoiseach think it is preposterous that arms were landed at Dublin port?  Is it not true that they were landed?  I am glad the Minister for Education is sitting there.  Is he aware that arms were landed at Drogheda, that during a week-end rifles, admittedly without bolts, were in the hold of a ship in Drogheda without any protection whatever?  If that is so, is it not true that arms have been landed without any control by anybody?</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach today was annoyed when I asked him if he had got back the £80,000, subsequently reduced to £30,000, given to somebody unknown to have arms brought into this country. If the money was taken out and the arms were not delivered, surely he must know where the money came from, who took it out of the country, and he should be able to get the money back. If he does not, he knows nothing.  Rip Van Winkle and that is the only name I can think of.</P>
    <P>The matter about Captain Kelly is a great mystery.  I happen to come from an area where Captain Kelly's family have been for years and I am saddened <Col N="1719" /> that he and his family should have been put in the position in which they now are.  He was an intelligence officer in the Army.  He knew that if he got into trouble outside the country it was his responsibility and that he could not go to the Government.  But what nobody knew was that the people who had put him in his trouble had not the guts to say to the detectives: &ldquo;He is on national service; release him, he has done nothing wrong.&rdquo;  What kind of release did he get?  He had to resign. Was it because they knew that too much would come out in the open or is it the policy of this country to send officers of its Army into the Six Counties to spy?  Is it to spy on the IRA or the Ulster Volunteers, or whom?</P>
    <P>I suggest the Taoiseach has an awful lot of questions to answer tonight.  I hope he is prepared to do so.  The last night he was an awfully tired man&mdash;we were all tired.  Tonight he has no such excuse.  He should be prepared to say what is right and what is wrong.  As far as Deputy Gibbons and Captain Kelly are concerned, it was unpardonable that Deputy Gibbons should have come in here and said he had suspicions about the way Captain Kelly was carrying out his duties.  He should have said either here or somewhere else publicly that Captain Kelly was on special duty and that because of that no further information could be given.  But he allowed the impression to go out that there was a criminal charge somewhere in the background. Captain Kelly had not the protection of this House but he made a statement publicly which can be challenged by Deputy Gibbons.  It was to the effect that what Deputy Gibbons had said was a tissue of lies.  If that is so, Deputy Gibbons should be man enough to give the full story.  We do not want him to give away any secrets, but in fairness to everybody concerned, particularly to Captain Kelly and his family, Captain Kelly's name should be cleared before this goes any further.</P>
    <P>I am afraid my time has run out.  I would have liked another quarter of an hour to deal with other matters.  I am sure, however, that Deputy O'Leary will do so.  The idea of Fianna Fáil <Col N="1720" /> speakers has been that they can start back at Wolfe Tone, come right down to a couple of days before this row started and then stop.  They are the type of patriots who are gracing this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>This crisis arose because of the Government's failure to realise some months ago that certain powerful Ministers disagreed with the Government's northern policy.  The myth that such a disagreement did not exist exploded when the Taoiseach announced his intention to seek the resignation of Deputy Haughey and Deputy Blaney.  The Taoiseach said he was satisfied that they did not subscribe fully to Government policy in relation to the present situation in the Six Counties as stated by him in January last.  Deputy Boland resigned from the Cabinet in sympathy with the other two Ministers and he shattered the unity myth, if it needed shattering, when he said:</P>
      <P>I fully agree with the policy in regard to the Six Counties as announced by the Taoiseach at the Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis, but I see a difference between the manner in which this matter has been handled and the policy announcement at the Ard-Fheis. </P>
      <P>It was unique for Fianna Fáil to accept that there was disagreement in the party on policy matters.  It has been a matter of pride to the Fianna Fáil Party since its foundation that, although it had disagreement on other matters, never had they disagreement on policy matters.  In fact, one of the worst accusations made about the Labour Party in recent years is about the disagreement which undoubtedly exists within our party on policy matters.  Long may our disagreement on policy matters exist; long may our honesty to admit that we are a party where disagreement is welcomed, and long may our agreement and our wholehearted enthusiasm for such political debate continue.  That is, after all, what politics should be about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One might ask at this stage what Fianna Fáil policy on the north is.  In <Col N="1721" /> January, 1969, at the Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis, when the party was preparing for the forthcoming election in the 26 Counties, the Taoiseach had a script of some 33 pages of which he devoted one page to the Government's northern policy.  He spoke of his desire to see Ireland living in peace.  In his opening remarks the Taoiseach said:</P>
    <P>What we must beware of is the type of change now sought to be enforced upon us, change that is based on ideologies which are anathema to the Irish people, that are incompatible with our Christian heritage and inconsistent with the dignity and freedom of the individual for which Irish men and women fought so hard a mere 50 years ago. </P>
    <P>The Taoiseach devoted just one page to the Government's policy on the north, a policy which has subsequently resulted in his losing several Cabinet Ministers and which has kept this House in constant, serious session for the last two weeks.</P>
    <P>After the events in Derry the Taoiseach went on television and said, &ldquo;We will not stand idly by&rdquo;.  The Labour Party considered his statement was in need of considerable amplification and we asked for a Dáil debate at that particular period.  That request was refused.  We did not stand idly by at this time.  We went north and discussed the events with the people there.  Subsequently, we went to London to try to ensure that the British Government, which had its forces in the area, would take responsibility for stemming the troubles which undoubtedly existed there.</P>
    <P>I think the institutional root of the present troubles in the Cabinet can be traced to the setting up of the news service after the events last August when the Minister for External Affairs, Deputy Dr. Hillery, was dispatched to the United Nations.  The Taoiseach stated that this news service was composed of persons seconded or on loan from State or semi-State bodies, but if that is the case I fail to understand how Mr. Seamus Brady became involved in that particular outfit since he belonged to neither body.  The <Col N="1722" /> Taoiseach, however, subsequently corrected the discrepancies made in that first statement.  From now on, however, every statement made by the Taoiseach on this matter must be treated with the utmost care.</P>
    <P>Then followed the Tralee speech and the Taoiseach felt the need to put forward his particular line of peace and persuasion.  He referred to the possibility of a solution to the question which would have the north still tied financially to Britain but which would allow us to have some form of federal arrangement in such an economic union.  I think the Ministers who have since been sacked formed a junta after the Taoiseach's Tralee speech.</P>
    <P>Deputy Blaney's Letterkenny speech came next and he said that in certain unspecified circumstances the use of force could not be ruled out.  On the 9th December, 1969, the Government Information Bureau published the Taoiseach's views on Deputy Blaney's remarks.  The Taoiseach said:</P>
    <P>This policy has been endorsed again and again by the Fianna Fáil Party.  While Mr. Blaney's feelings on the Partition issue are very deeply felt and he occasionally finds it difficult not to give public expression to them, he knows and endorses Government policy on this issue as he did in his speech at Letterkenny last night.  This policy is the only realistic policy to pursue for the peace and progress of the country and its ultimate reunification. </P>
    <P>The question we must ask is: what, in fact, has been going on in this Cabinet since about August 1969?  We had the Taoiseach openly committed to the ways of peace and we had several members of the Cabinet openly expressing contrary views.  When called upon to explain this contradiction in Government policy the Taoiseach said that the contradiction did not exist. That has been the pattern of events up to the blow-up of last week, up to the complete exposure that this, in fact, was what was going on.  The Taoiseach rests his case on the point that the whole infernal machinery was only set in motion on April the 20th and up to that point he had not been aware of the <Col N="1723" /> complicity of any Ministers of his Cabinet.  Up to that point he pleaded his total innocence of the chain of events which had been apparent to some of us in this House for some time, just going on the basis of the disagreement of several of his colleagues.  I recall the 16th of December in this House when Deputy Corish tabled questions in relation to Deputy Blaney's Letterkenny speech.  At column 1404 of the Official Report for the 16th December, 1969, Deputy Corish said:</P>
    <P>I accept what the Taoiseach, Deputy Jack Lynch, said, but he is there as leader of the Government, talking for the Government and it appears to me and the members of my party, because we are so concerned about this, that there is real conflict within the Cabinet and, for the sake of the people in the six Counties and the people in the 26 Counties, this should be cleared up.</P>
    <P>Mr. M. O'Leary: It must be resolved.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach: May I say, to help Deputy Corish&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>to help us, mark you</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;there is no conflict in the Cabinet with the situation and with the policy, as I have announced. </P>
    <P>He went on to deal with further charges that there was conflict within the Cabinet and said:</P>
    <P>I can assure you that you people are not going to divide the Government anyway. </P>
    <P>The Taoiseach was cheered by all the people on the back row there, by Deputy Blaney and all the rest of the members of this united party.  I asked the Taoiseach whether any member of the Government was specially designated with responsibility for dealing with Northern Ireland affairs and he replied:</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach normally deals with matters relating to Northern Ireland. </P>
    <P>I then asked:</P>
    <P>Would the Taoiseach agree in the <Col N="1724" /> wake of recent events...that it will be he alone who will speak on the national question? </P>
    <P>And the Minister for Local Government, Deputy Boland, made a very significant remark:</P>
    <P>Do not talk nonsense.</P>
    <P>Then the Taoiseach asked me:</P>
    <P>Is the Deputy serious?</P>
    <P>In other words, was I serious in saying that only the Taoiseach who was talking about the necessity for reconciliation and peace should speak authoritatively on this issue and that all others who appeared to me, in my simplicity, to be at variance with such a view should be silent.  Then I went on to say:</P>
    <P>There undoubtedly exists, as far as we can see, conflict in the Cabinet on this question.  The Taoiseach has one view, Deputies Blaney and Boland have another.  The question is which view is to prevail?</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach: My view is the Government's view and that is the view which will prevail. </P>
    <P>That was the situation we saw within the Cabinet.  This was the situation which was strenuously denied by members of the Government.  They said the Opposition were attempting to create this situation.  We already have, without any further comment from the Opposition, the statement of the Taoiseach that he dismissed members of his Cabinet because they disagreed with his policies and we had, in a subsequent statement, Deputy Boland saying that he did not agree with the Government's handling of the northern question.  Although he agreed with the Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis statement on policy he did not agree with their handling of the situation since the Ard-Fheis.</P>
    <P>I do not subscribe to the theory that the Taoiseach has clean hands.  I say that quite deliberately.  I find it incredible for many reasons.  We know that the security forces&mdash;the Secret Service, or whatever you like to call them, and I know the Taoiseach has his own super section of the Secret Service, his own people reporting to him direct&mdash;at <Col N="1725" /> the disposal of the State maintain liaison with the British Secret Service. We know that a full seven months ago the British Secret Service were aware of arms importation to this country. We can conclude, therefore, that our Secret Service were aware of such importation of arms.  We are further aware that the Sinn Féin paper <i>The United Irishman</i> published a pretty accurate account of the involvement of certain Ministers before Christmas last and we know that that paper and the activities of its followers are not unknown to members of our security forces.  In fact we understand that that seems to be the main occupation of the Special Branch, the pursuing, harrying and questioning of members of the Sinn Féin movement.  We can take it, therefore, that the security forces here would have read that issue of the paper.  The Taoiseach said that he was not aware of the contents of that issue.</P>

      <P>It seems incredible that our own Secret Service would not also know about the arms importation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1726" /> We know from an answer to a question today that our own security forces are answerable to two Ministers, according to the Taoiseach&mdash;the Minister for Justice and the Minister for Defence. The former Minister for Justice no longer holds Ministrial rank; the former Minister for Defence still holds it and so we can say that they were aware of arms being imported for some considerable time before 20th April of this year.  Certainly the Minister for Defence was aware of it and so was the Minister for Justice since both were in touch with our Secret Service.  According to the <i>Guardian</i> disclosures in Britain related to at least seven months back.  One of the ex-Ministers, Deputy Blaney, said: &ldquo;I have done whatever little I could do&rdquo;.  They denied that they instigated any importation of arms, but it is a fair conclusion that their participation was not just a once only operation, despite what the Taoiseach says.  Judging by their statements their activities take on a certain pattern stretching back much further than 20th April and we can, therefore, I think, say that these Ministers have been involved in a consistent policy at variance with the policy of the Taoiseach and the beginning of that change of policy lies in the murky affairs of the northern news service set up in the wake of the events of last August.  It would be very interesting to discover exactly to whom that news service was finally answerable.  The Taoiseach says that Deputy Colley's involvement was purely at his request.  If I recall a later statement correctly, that news service came temporarily under the control of the Ministers who have now gone.  Is that correct?</P>

      <P>I asked the Taoiseach a question and the Taoiseach has answered it.  I am making the point that the intervention of this Government directly in northern affairs dates <Col N="1727" /> from the setting up of the news service last August in the wake of the events during August.  It is fair to say, I think, that Captain Kelly was not on his own in his work in Northern Ireland; others have said that other Army officers were involved.  Now the Minister for Defence at that time could not have been unaware of these activities.  We have no guarantee that their participation in this arms importation was unique.  We have no evidence to suggest that there may not have been successful importations prior to this.  We just do not know.  Because arms importations have been going on for some time the Minister for Defence, Deputy Gibbons, must have been so aware, and because of their security contacts the Ministers for Justice and Defence, these two members of the Cabinet, were aware of the implication of certain of their colleagues in the Cabinet in these arms importations.  The Taoiseach, throughout all this flurry, surrounded by distrust and suspicion he would have us believe, went blissfully on his innocent way.  He knew nothing.  It is very interesting to recall that the editor of the <i>Irish Press</i> a month ago, certainly before the events related by the Taoiseach and the rumour of the participation of certain of his Cabinet Ministers in these affairs, sent a book, a very interesting book, to various people in the country for review.  I will read just one quotation.  The book was issued long before the Taoiseach tumbled to the true facts of the subversive activities in his Cabinet:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government also appealed to the United Nations, where Irish Foreign Minister Dr. Patrick Hillery did surprisingly well in his effort to get support for the Irish position. Privately, however, some of his colleagues in the Cabinet apparently began taking more unconventional initiatives.  At least some of the arms which now began to find their way to the North did so as a result of a cabinet member's action and negotiations were set in train through the brother of one Minister which at one stage led to rumours of £50,000 being paid to the I.R.A. But this referred to the total cost of an <Col N="1728" /> arms shipment on the international market and, I am told, only approximately £2,300 was paid to the I.R.A. for arms purchased to assist the Northern Catholics.  Catholics could also receive training in the Donegal area and at some of the military centres set up in the South for refugees.  Reports that six Irish army officers were sent across the Border to co-ordinate Citizens' Defence Committees, again with Republican co-operation, circulated in Dublin and a columnist writing in <i>Hibernia</i> said bluntly that the ultimate boss of Northern Command was a member of the Fianna Fáil cabinet. </P>

      <P>May 15th.  It is, I think, pretty incredible from that that in this small capital city of ours the one man, the Taoiseach would have us believe, who went about innocent of the train of events and innocent of the complicity of certain members of his own Cabinet in the progress of those events, was the Taoiseach himself, the head of the Government.  He knew nothing about these things.  Suddenly, on 20th April, he gets a message from Deputy Cosgrave and his suspicions, which have been growing for some time, finally force him to tell these members of his Cabinet that they must leave it.  I find that frankly incredible. I do not blame Deputy Gibbons, now Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, in this.  He may have been acting as a good Minister for Defence for, throughout all this, we have had civil servants puzzled about the attitude of their superiors.  We have civil servants in the Department of Justice unaware of what exactly the Minister for Justice thought of this particular matter.  We have a similar puzzlement on the part of certain civil servants in the Department of Finance.  I think Deputy Gibbons may be pardoned a certain puzzlement about what exactly was the policy of the Taoiseach in this whole plot.  We have the Taoiseach's own word that the Minister for Defence, Deputy Gibbons, reported to the Taoiseach quite frequently.  What he was doing had the approval of the Taoiseach and he must have been <Col N="1729" /> aware of the activities of his own army in the north.  He must have been aware, through his own Secret Service, of the trend of events and the complicity of colleagues.  The Taoiseach says that he at all times satisfactorily reported to him.  It is incredible that the Taoiseach did not know anything until 20th April.  I think the Taoiseach is either not telling the truth or he is incompetent.  We can only come to either of these two conclusions.  I cannot accept&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>In this whole period in which the Taoiseach announced this policy which dissident members of his Cabinet had no difficulty in accepting while they pursued their own warlike aims, this party asked the Taoiseach repeatedly when he intended to meet Mr. Wilson. One would have thought that a man with a policy of peace, such as the Taoiseach professed to have, would be anxious to meet the man who controlled the armed forces in that part of our country and press the necessity to have ample security forces available and, for example, urge that such an important reform as the introduction of a central housing authority should be pressed through with all speed but, in all this period, there has been a strange reluctance on the part of the Taoiseach to meet Mr. Wilson.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Do these late events explain that strange reluctance on the part of the Taoiseach to meet Mr. Wilson?  It was a meeting one would think was necessary in the circumstances of the gathering crisis and <Col N="1730" /> the troubles in the north and the many matters it was necessary to raise with Mr. Wilson if the Taoiseach was concerned about defending the minority in the north.  Surely we should have gone to the British Prime Minister to see that proper security was available and, if our policy was one of peace, surely it was in our interests to see that proper safeguards in regard to security were brought into effect by the British Premier.  Yet, throughout that period, day after day in answering Questions by members of this party, the Taoiseach said he did not think the time opportune.  He did not think the time opportune after August or throughout this period when members of his Cabinet were involved in this arms plot. Naturally, he did not think so; naturally, he was reluctant to meet Mr. Wilson.</P>
      <P>I do not know if there will now be a change in the Taoiseach's attitude or whether these dismissals will bring about a situation where he will be free of guilt in meeting Mr. Wilson and can do so as a man sincerely dedicated, with all members of his Cabinet, to the pursuit of peace in the settlement of this question.  Admittedly, the British Premier may request elucidation of the views of the Taoiseach's party on their peculiar concept of party unity.  He may have his own opinion on that.  Think how remarkable it is that this northern situation about which the Fianna Fáil Party are so concerned has gone on from October the 5th, to Burntollet and to the August events without any meeting between the Taoiseach and Mr. Wilson.  It is extraordinary that any Taoiseach with any serious regard for that problem could get away with weekly excuses to avoid meeting the British Premier.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over that period, modest though our size may be, with the influence at our disposal, we have done out utmost to persuade the British Labour Government to take the necessary actions in defence of the minority in that area and in pursuit of the ideal of peaceful settlement of the unity question.  Last August, when the Taoiseach did not think it opportune to meet Mr. Wilson, we met Lord Chalfont and our delegation laid before him at that time <Col N="1731" /> what we regarded as the important measures required to be taken in the crisis in the north.  We suffered the jeers of Members opposite that we had gone north on a cheap publicity mission.  We went north on a meaningful and signicant mission as far back as 1966 when we set up the Council of Labour.  That was an enterprise that, we think, in the evolution of a united country will have more significance than any of the sabre-rattling or antique drum beating of Deputy Blaney or his like.  We attempted to provide a platform that could appeal across traditional boundaries to Catholic and Protestant working people and we believe that in the long run therein lies the only path of sanity.</P>
    <P>Although the Cabinet may be discredited and we may doubt what is meant by the unity of Fianna Fáil, it is now more than ever urgent that the Taoiseach should meet the British Prime Minister.  No longer should he take refuge in evasive answers.  He should see the necessity of meeting Mr. Wilson to discuss the security of the minority in the north, security made more precarious by the utterances of former Ministers who were on his own benches up to last week. That security is further threatened by their irresponsible speeches.  He now owes it to the country to go to Mr. Wilson and see what further security can be provided.  Remember, if we reject the idea of force being used in that part of the country, it has never been the intention of this party that the minority in the north should be left defenceless.  We believe British forces must be deployed adequately to protect their lives and liberty.  We believe that is the duty of the British Prime Minister; it is our job to see that he carries it out.</P>
    <P>Also, the Taoiseach must expose those in his party who are prepared to arm Catholic against Protestant.  He must depart from the attitude that has been his up to now of pretending that this sectarian attitude of members of his party does not exist, this belief of theirs which would deem it to be in the national interest to arm Catholics against Protestants.</P>
    <P>I commend to the Taoiseach's attention <Col N="1732" /> the statement of the Tánaiste here today because I see another difference in the so-called united front of Fianna Fáil.  The Tánaiste has unambiguously stated: &ldquo;There is no place in Fianna Fáil for those who would seek a solution to this problem by force.&rdquo;  I should like to see the Taoiseach coming out emphatically in defence of what the Tánaiste said.  Throughout this long debate I have not yet heard this said unambiguously by the Taoiseach.  He has much to live down in the matter of evasion on the question of his party's attitude to the north.  To question after question he has denied the possibility of split or division in his party and throughout he has said that all are united on his policy.  That alibi of his is now in ruins; it no longer holds and since there is no longer need of subterfuge I ask him tonight to come out clearly and say to his party, this great party representing so many Irish people: &ldquo;There is no room in this party for people who wish to gain unity by force, no room for those who would like to set alight, for party purposes in the south, the whole northern conflict.</P>
    <P>Today we asked him to issue a White Paper setting forth all the ideas of all parties in the House in regard to this situation.  We have a duty here as elected Members to lead the Irish people in the Republic to a true realisation of what is needed to achive reconciliation. We have much to live down.  All of us are to some extent responsible for some of the misconceptions people have in the part of the country under our jurisdiction.  Late though it be we must lead public opinion here to a true realisation of how best we can bring about unity and how best we can make this part of the country a platform for the united Ireland of the future.</P>
    <P>There is no point in thinking that the previous behaviour of the Taoiseach can continue or that Fianna Fáil can continue to speak with the two voices to which we have constantly referred in this debate, the secret voice promising hope of arms and a solution to the unity question by force and the public voice saying: Peace at all costs.  There must be an end to this double talk in Fianna Fáil.  They cannot say one thing at cumann level and another at <Col N="1733" /> Ard-Fheis level through the Taoiseach We cannot tolerate those who say they subscribe to the Taoiseach's policy and applaud speakers who have done otherwise, or tolerate Members who say that they are not ashamed of what they have done when proud and unashamed they have set in train a course of events which may end in tragedy later this summer.</P>
    <P>This may mean a very great about-turn for Fianna Fáil.  They have been in the habit of confusing party interests with those of the country but this confusion is too dangerous for the future of the country to be allowed to continue. In the long term I would not think it is even in the interest of the Fianna Fáil Party itself.  Meeting Mr. Wilson, therefore, is an essential task for the Taoiseach in the days that lie ahead.  Earlier this year when we asked him to meet Mr. Wilson he said he knew the mind of the British Government. I imagine the British Government are in considerable puzzlement about the mind of this Cabinet at this time.</P>

      <P>I would suggest that a meeting is called for without delay.  I do not think the Taoiseach has any more embarrassment within his Cabinet about what he may say to Mr. Wilson.  He may have a certain embarrassment about certain people who remain in his party.  In the last few days, officially anyway, he has given evidence, by sending them packing, that he no longer intends his actions to be coloured or circumscribed by the opinions of these people.</P>
      <P>The Tánaiste this morning issued unambiguous marching orders to anybody in Fianna Fáil who by word or by deed supported the action of these men.  There is no place, he said, in the Fianna Fáil Party for these people.</P>

      <P>Many questions remain unanswered at the end of this debate.  How could it be otherwise?  It is my conviction that the Taoiseach <Col N="1734" /> has not answered all questions.  I do not believe that his knowledge of these events commenced on April 20th.  I find that incredible.  I do not believe it.  It may be important for the Taoiseach's own future that he should stick to this particular version of the events.  He may believe this is in the best interests of his party, but I do not believe it is.  I believe the time has come for the Taoiseach, who has a certain reputation for honesty, to come clean, whatever the cost to his party.</P>
      <P>I believe that questions centre around the Minister for Defence.  It is a peculiar situation that the Taoiseach's suspicions result in sacking for certain Ministers and promotion for others.  If I were a member of the party opposite I would be seeking an answer to that question.  Seemingly it is a boast of the members of that party that they never ask questions, that they always obey orders.  That sometimes carries penalties, too.  In my party we have too many people asking questions and too few taking orders but I think in the long run that is a safer party to be in.</P>

      <P>It also marks the end of a hectic week in the history of Dáil Eireann.  I suppose we can easily say: &ldquo;That was the week that was&rdquo;.  The object of the long debates here was to elicit information, to ascertain where the Government were going and what the true position was.  We are now ending the debate on this motion tabled by the Taoiseach.  It is not unfair to say that, in moving the motion yesterday, the Taoiseach tried in a ponderous and heavy-handed manner to shift public attention from the events of this past week and from the questions which every person outside the House is anxious to ask.  It was an exercise in sleight-of-hand which deceived no one and, in fact, it merely resulted in the Taoiseach bringing himself into contempt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At this stage people are not interested in the history of the Fianna Fáil Party nor are they concerned with the Taoiseach's obvious attempts to rehabilitate himself with his disillusioned rank and file.  What the people are concerned <Col N="1736" /> with is a Government in total disarray, lacking confidence in themselves and in their future, and hoping desperately to cling on to office if the people do not think and talk of the things that really matter at this stage in our affairs.</P>
    <P>In summing up this debate on behalf of my party I intend to pose again the questions which I believe are on the lips of most people throughout the country.  I intend to ask them again and I hope that at the end of this debate some answers will be provided by the Taoiseach and that we will not have this absurd effort to wrap security around him.  The Taoiseach told us the other day that it all started with a telephone call from the Aer Lingus Cargo Terminal to an unnamed official in the Department of Transport and Power.</P>
    <P>A consignment of arms was coming from Vienna.  The problem was the International Air Transport Association rules which required clearance from the Department of Transport and Power in respect of the type of plane used.  This was the one snag.  Everything else was in order but this had to be cleared.  In other words, whoever had bought and was importing this consignment of arms had overlooked just one thing.  He was not aware of IATA and he was not aware that clearance had to be obtained from the Department of Transport and Power.  Let us have a look at what that means.  The only snag was clearance for the type of aircraft being used.  The law of this land in relation to the importation of firearms is laid down in the Firearms Act, 1925.  Section 17 of that Act provides:</P>
    <P>No person shall import into Saorstát Éireann any firearm, ammunition, or prohibited weapon unless such import is authorised by a continuing licence granted under this section and in force at the time, or by an occasional licence granted under this section and relating to the specific firearm, ammunition or prohibited weapon so imported. </P>
    <P>That is a clear prohibition.  Any attempt or contravention of that prohibition is a criminal offence which can be prosecuted either summarily or on indictment. What else does the section provide? <Col N="1737" /> It provides that an occasional licence for the importation of firearms or prohibited weapons may be granted by the Minister for Defence.  It provides that a continuing licence to import may be granted by the Minister for Justice. In subsection (8) there is provision that this section shall not apply to the importation into the State of any firearms, ammunition or prohibited weapon which is so imported under the direct authority of the Minister for Defence for use by the defence forces or on the authority of the Minister for Justice for use by the police forces of the State.</P>
    <P>That seems to me that on the day of this phone call&mdash;Friday, 17th April&mdash; there was a consignment of arms coming into this country which must have been coming in under a licence or direct authority from the Minister for Defence or the Minister for Justice. The only thing not in order was the IATA clearance.  This was an attempt to commit a criminal offence.  There was no question of State security involved in disclosing exactly what all the facts were.  There is a grave risk of endangering the security of this State now if the Taoiseach does not supply the answers and give the information. Who was the consignee?  Who was the person who had bought and was importing this consignment of arms? Under what certificate was the consignment coming in?  Was it under a certificate of the Minister for Defence or was this illegal importation of arms coming in here under the direct authority of the Minister for Defence? What role did the Minister for Defence play in this?  The documentation must have been there.  It must have been cleared.  Somebody signed his name. Somebody's name was put to a document in order to fulfil the requirements of section 17 of the Firearms Act.  I suggest the Taoiseach knows this well. I suggest the Taoiseach has a responsibility tonight to tell this House and the waiting nation outside who exactly was involved on this particular day in this particular effort.</P>
    <P>What happened next?  The unnamed official in the Department of Transport and Power telephoned another unnamed official in the Department of <Col N="1738" /> Justice.  A very strange thing happened then.  This was an ordinary routine inquiry.  It was an inquiry from the Department of Transport and Power to the Department of Justice.  The Department of Transport and Power were checking, but the question had an extraordinary effect.  If the Taoiseach's word is to be accepted, the officer concerned went to see initially either his Minister or his secretary. Why should he not see them?  He could not see them because they were in conference.  Is that a complete obstacle, a stone wall?  The Minister was in conference with the secretary.  This officer did not wait.  He did not telephone. He did something which I suggest he never did before in his life and never will again.  He immediately got in touch with the gardaí.  Why?  He got in touch with the Garda because he was aware on the information given to him and after asking a question or two that a very ugly plot had been discovered.  So clear was the plot to him that he did not wait for the Minister's discussion with the secretary to end nor even attempt to interrupt it. He got straight away in touch with the Garda.  I suggest he did so because he knew the matter was criminal.  He knew it was urgent and he knew if he went to his Minister that nothing would happen because the Minister would not take action or was clearly involved.  I suggest there can be no other explanation for the action of that officer.  Let us praise him.  Let us be thankful we had such an officer in our Civil Service.  He broke all Civil Servise rules by acting on his own and by making his own decision.  He went straight to the Garda although up above him his own Minister was in conference.  I wonder will the Taoiseach tell us why that official took that particular action.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach goes on to say that following this the Minister and the secretary, having consulted perhaps together, decided to let the consignment in.  We can imagine that after the Department of Justice official gets in touch with the gardaí they get in touch with the Department of Justice and the Minister and the secretary perhaps consulted together and they <Col N="1739" /> decided to let the consignment in.  I ask is this true?  I ask is this what happened?  This was on Friday, 17th April.  There is a Government meeting that day to approve of the Budget. Was any attempt made to get in touch with the Taoiseach?  One would expect that attempt to be made.  Why was it not made?  Were people certain where the Taoiseach stood?  Why was the Taoiseach not brought into this immediately?  Perhaps the Minister for Justice and the Secretary of the Department of Justice consulted together to let the consignment in.  The Taoiseach says it did not come in.  The Taoiseach says he knew nothing on Friday, or on Saturday, or on Sunday.  The Taoiseach says &ldquo;I came into the picture on Monday&rdquo;.  Who brought him into the picture?  Who put him in the picture?  It certainly was not the Minister for Justice who was not back in town on Monday.  He was in the west of Ireland.  Can anyone imagine a Minister for Justice who discovers on Friday, either before or after a Government meeting, a plot to bring a consignment of arms into this State, assuming for the moment he was not involved, and yet he goes back to Castlebar to have a quiet weekend?  He did not even come up on Monday.  I suggest that clearly the Minister for Justice was up to his neck in it the same as others.</P>
    <P>That is the only possible explanation. He knew it well.  That is why there is no report to the Taoiseach on Friday.  That is why he disappeared for the week-end.  That is why he was not back on Monday&mdash;because he was involved either by action or default, one or the other.</P>
    <P>Let us follow the Minister for Justice, Deputy Moran, a little bit more.  He certainly came back to town. We know he was at a dinner in the Gresham Hotel on Budget night.  When was he consulted by the Taoiseach? When was he interviewed by the Taoiseach? Did the Taoiseach see him at all?  If the Taoiseach saw him, can the Taoiseach explain what reason he gave for deserting his post at a moment of crisis if he were innocent&mdash;disappearing and not to be found?  The Taoiseach <Col N="1740" /> has been very anxious to get the country and this Dáil to believe that this Minister's resignation was attributable solely to health.  The Taoiseach was very anxious, by the manner in which the Government Information Bureau announcement was framed and phrased on Monday, 4th May, 1970, to make it appear that the Minister for Justice had resigned voluntarily on grounds of health.  It was only when Deputy Boland subsequently blew the gaff and said that Deputy Moran had been sacked that the Taoiseach reluctantly admitted in this House that he had been asked to resign.</P>
    <P>I ask the Taoiseach now to come clean.  There is no doubt that Deputy Moran was asked to resign as Minister for Justice.  I suggest that he was asked to resign because it was apparent to the officers in his own Department and to those in close contact at the time that he was involved in this whole performance.  But, of course, this, I have no doubt, was going to be swept under the carpet.  The face-saving, crack-repairing operation started on 4th May, 1970, with an announcement that the Minister for Justice, Deputy Moran, had voluntarily retired on grounds of health.  Therefore, the position, by Tuesday, 5th May, 1970, when the Dáil met, was that one Minister had gone.  But there were two others. It is interesting to recall that the other two Ministers were named as a result of statements obtained by the Garda when they went to interview Aer Lingus officials and officials of Customs and Excise on 20th April, 1970.  The Taoiseach told us he studied the statements obtained by the Garda after this interview and, as they involved these two Ministers, he decided to see them. But, on Tuesday, 5th May, 1970, none of us knew of these events.  None of us knew what had taken place.  Only the Taoiseach&mdash;if he has disclosed the full facts to us&mdash;knew and only Deputy Blaney and Deputy Haughey.</P>
    <P>We have to try to recall what this Dáil was like on that Tuesday afternoon. The facts are that one Minister had been sacked and that two other Ministers had been seen by the Taoiseach and their resignations had been <Col N="1741" /> demanded.  They had been told clearly, if the Taoiseach is telling us the truth, on 29th April, 1970, that they were going out.  So there were to be three disappearances from the Cabinet.  If the Taoiseach is being accurate and is telling the full facts to this House, the position is that one Minister had gone and two others were under sentence of dismissal.  In those circumstances, how much more curious was the Taoiseach's reply to Deputy Cosgrave&mdash;Is this just the tip of the iceberg?&mdash;What does the Deputy mean?;  Any more resignations?  What is the Deputy suggesting?  This was the Taoiseach who, if he was telling us the truth, had demanded four or five days earlier the resignation of two of his senior Ministers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall make my own speech.  We can see evidence in many ways here.  On 29th April, 1970, Deputy Blaney was sacked by the Taoiseach according to what the Taoiseach told us.  Deputy Blaney happened to speak in the Dáil on 29th April, 1970, on the Budget.  Here are a few pearls he dropped.  Here is what Deputy Blaney said in this House on the Budget on 29th April, 1970, the day his resignation was demanded, if the Taoiseach is telling the truth:</P>
      <P>I suggest that Fine Gael should get wise to themselves and should stop seeking spies that do not exist under the bed.  They should stop seeking plots that are not there and they should become fully involved in their own Parliament and as an Opposition assume some sense of responsibility </P>
      <P>That is what Deputy Blaney had to say on the day he was sacked, as reported at column 249 of the Official Report of Dáil Éireann of 29th April, 1970.  At column 257, Deputy Blaney continued:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have had this hoary old chestnut from Deputy Donegan, which he has mentioned before, that the Taoiseach should reprimand his Ministers.  Fine Gael have this story one day and the next day they say <Col N="1742" /> the people in Fianna Fáil have no minds of their own, that they are all yes-men.  When it appears that we in Fianna Fáil have minds of our own, the cry goes up from this self-righteous party that the Taoiseach is not doing his job because he is not reprimanding his Ministers, is not silencing them and putting them into the wilderness.  Fine Gael want us on some days to be other than yes-men and then if somebody in Fianna Fáil says something with a slightly different intonation&mdash;and I repeat &ldquo;intonation&rdquo;&mdash;Fine Gael promptly say he is speaking out of turn, the Taoiseach must do something about this. </P>
    <P>Deputy Blaney continues and is reported at column 280, when concluding his speech, as saying:</P>
    <P>We should also keep in mind that this Government will be here bar some strange and extraordinary happening&mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash;and, he adds reflectively&mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash;and there could be one that comes to mind&mdash;but bar that&mdash;</P>
    <P>Mr. O'Leary: An earthquake.</P>
    <P>Mr. Blaney: No, but the next thing to it. </P>
    <P>That was Deputy Blaney, then Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, speaking in this House on the day, the Taoiseach tells us, he had demanded his resignation.</P>
    <P>I just want to consider one other situation.  The Taoiseach said that, coming into the picture on 20th April, 1970, the Garda go to query the Aer Lingus and the Customs and Excise staffs and bring back the statements which he examined and, seeing that they implicate two Ministers, gets some further information, ponders on it on Tuesday and, on Wednesday, 22nd, decides to take action.  He goes to the Fianna Fáil Party meeting.  Deputy Haughey, the Minister for Finance, is not there.  He is told he is late coming in.  Later, he is told that the Minister for Finance had a slight accident.  Just on 1 o'clock, the Taoiseach is told that Deputy Haughey's accident was more serious than he had at first thought.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1743" /> Assume that Deputy Haughey, the then Minister for Finance, had had no accident.  Assume that he had come in. The Taoiseach had then precisely the same information, and no more, according to what he told us here, as he had on 29th April.  Was the Taoiseach going to sack the Minister for Finance, Deputy Haughey, on Budget day or was he going to let the Minister for Finance deliver his Budget speech and then sack him on Budget night? Does anyone for a moment think that that would have happened?  We know it would not.  We know that, at 3 o'clock on Budget day, this House was informed that the Minister for Finance, Deputy haughey, was unable to present his Budget because of his accident.  But if the Taoiseach's story is to be believed, that Minister would have been sacked that morning because the information implicating him was precisely the same information as was available a week later on the 29th.</P>
    <P>I suggest that in relation to the then Minister for Justice resigning voluntarily, in relation to the then Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, who could not have taken very seriously whatever was said to him on the 29th, and in relation to the then Minister for Finance, who would have delivered his Budget Statement were it not for his accident, there would have been no sacking or any intention to sack but that there was an intention to cover up and hush up.</P>

      <P>It is a shame for the Minister.  I wish now to go on to another question and it is this: what now is the position of Deputy J. <Col N="1744" /> Gibbons, the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries?  Is there any finger of suspicion pointing at him?  We have not been told who accused Deputy Blaney or Deputy Haughey.  We have not been allowed see these statements but we know that the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries has been accused on television and in the open light of day by Captain James Kelly of the Irish Army, accused and called an unmitigated scoundrel.  Yet this man is retained by the Taoiseach in his Government&mdash;this Deputy who, if the <i>Irish Press</i> is to be believed, passed this story to <i>This Week</i>, this story which implicates the Taoiseach up to his neck, because it was stated clearly in that statement that from the end of last year, Deputy Gibbons as Minister for Defence, consulted the Taoiseach and informed him of the growing evidence of the implication of two members of the Government in an IRA gun running plot.  However, the Taoiseach told us during this debate that the first involvement of the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries in this affair was on the 29th April which resulted in the arrest of Captain Kelly on 1st May.  The Taoiseach said specifically that he never received any report from Deputy J. Gibbons at any earlier stage involving any ministers or members of the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If that is so, what then is the explanation of the story in <i>This Week?</i>  Is it a tissue of lies?  The <i>Irish Press</i> says it &ldquo;was passed to this newspaper by a Member of the Government&rdquo;.  The story is certainly diametrically opposed to the account given by the Taoiseach to the Dáil and to the nation.  It shows that back in August and throughout November and the early months of this year the leader of the Government was constantly being informed of meetings between the members of the IRA army council and Deputies Blaney and Haughey, either collectively or individually. It shows that the leader of the Government was receiving reports continuously from his Minister for Defence who was obviously keeping him informed of the latest developments. It shows, if it is true, that the leader of the Government went to the Ard-Fheis of his own party conscious that there were members in his own <Col N="1745" /> Government who talked peace with war in their hearts.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasFOHiggins" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>It shows the leader of the Government who realises now that he was leading a coalition of hawks and doves.  That must be explained here either at the end of this debate or, eventually, to the people.</P>
      <P>This whole affair cries out for investigation. Despite two long speeches, the Taoiseach might well have been the subject of Honor Tracy's book <i>Mind You, I've Said Nothing</i> because he has said nothing but there is no fair reason now why the full story should not be told.  Who sought to import these arms and to whom were they consigned? Under what apparent legal authorisation were they coming in and who issued such authorisation?  What was the result of the inquiries of Aer Lingus and the Department of Transport and Power?  Is it true that for the past five or six months, members of the Goverment have been in constant touch with the IRA?  Is it true that there has been this kind of plotting going on all the time?  The time has come to spell it out.  Is it all ended?</P>
      <P>I see that one of the newly appointed Parliamentary Secretaries is here. Deputy Cunningham.  He comes from Donegal.  Is he the man to replace Deputy Blaney?  He has views but whose views are these?  This is from Deputy Cunningham and I quote from volume 126 of the Official Report, column 1987:</P>
      <P>It was stated that all parties are now agreed that it is not advisable to use force.  That may be so.  That may be a proper attitude at the moment, but if in the next 20, 30 or 50 years it is found that these new methods&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>Peaceful methods</P>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;have failed what, then, are we to do?  If all these methods fail, will we not then be justified in adopting the same methods as we used to free the part of Ireland that is free? </P>
      <P>That was Deputy Cunningham speaking on the subject of the North of Ireland.</P>

      <P>Are there still men who seek peace with war in their hearts?  These are answers that we have not got.  The Minister for External Affairs today in a good and worthwhile speech talked of ours being a pluralist society.  He talked of the different traditions among the people who occupy this island of ours, people of different historical origins.  In the Presidential election of some years ago that was the keynote of my campaign.  Those were the type of speeches I made everywhere. It was for that reason that I was criticised by many members of Fianna Fáil.  It was for that reason, too, that I was subjected to criticism.</P>
      <P>I am glad to hear it said again and said by a member of the Government. I would hope that it indicates a rational sensible attitude to our fellow Irishmen living in all parts of Ireland. I hope it can now be regarded as accepted national policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We do not underestimate or make little of the terrible duty of leading a Government at any time but particularly leading a Government at a time of pogrom in the north, nor would we underestimate the terrible decisions that may have to be made nor the strong and legitimate emotions which may easily push a Government into disaster.  It is not from any lack of feeling for the people under attack in the north that we criticise Deputy Blaney and Deputy Haughey and the Government and the Taoiseach that harboured them and that would, if they had been let, have covered them up.  We have no confidence in this Government because this is an issue, a difference of view between the leader and others in the party, a difference of view too deadly, too explosive, to be allowed to continue at the very heart of the Government. In the days of trouble, if they come, we want and are entitled to have a Government <Col N="1747" /> with one voice&mdash;be it right or wrong&mdash;with one view, one policy on the north.  We cannot have a Government led by a man who is bound to become progressively weaker rather than stronger in his own party as the violence in the north continues.</P>

      <P>That is too dangerous. It is no reflection on the personality of the Taoiseach.  It is a fact of the situation.  If another progrom breaks out in the north, if violence pushes peace out of the way, if people are endangered and lives are endangered, then as that continues so does the Taoiseach's position, as leader of the Government, become endangered.  This makes for national weakness and we certainly could have no confidence, nor could the people, in a continuation of that kind of position.</P>
      <P>This is a motion of confidence tabled, in effect, by the Fianna Fáil Party in the Fianna Fáil Party.  In that party now we can clearly see the rifts and the dissensions.  Two members of the party have come out in the open. I despise their motives.  Deputy Blaney is a verbal hero, nothing else.  He was not going to get involved in anything that would hurt the smallest portion of his body.  As a member of the Fianna Fáil Government for 13 years he did precious little about the North of Ireland&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The one name that everyone outside this House heard with a gasp of astonishment was the name of Deputy Charles Haughey as involved in a matter of this kind.  He was never known to express the slightest concern for the North of Ireland or for our separated brethren.  He was never known to be anything but a very sound and sane and wise man pursuing carefully <Col N="1748" /> Government policy.  Why was he involved in this bizarre scandal?  I suggest his motives were not patriotic but were motives of the most sordid kind.  It was again a concern to use the position of the north, the troubles and the difficulties and the tribulations of our people up there, in a cynical exercise to unseat Deputy Lynch as leader of Fianna Fáil.</P>

      <P>These are not patriots; these are dangerous men. These are men who have nearly led this country into serious disaster.  As long as they remain in Fianna Fáil their potential for danger is great and the time has come surely when the people of this country should be given an opportunity of passing judgment and electing a new government.  Are we going to carry on as if nothing had happened?  The extraordinary thing is that all the members of the Government throughout last week were saying: &ldquo;There is no crisis.&rdquo;  Even on the morning that two members of the Government had been sacked and one had resigned the Minister for Lands, leading the chorus said: &ldquo;There is no crisis.&rdquo;  I shudder to think what could be called a crisis by Fianna Fáil.  If the fact that at least two, if not more, members of the Government were involved in a serious gun smuggling conspiracy and had to be dismissed from the Government is not a crisis, what is?</P>
      <P>They have decided to stick it out. That is bad for Ireland, bad for our future, bad for democracy.  I do not know whether they will survive.  I believe the position of this Government will get worse instead of getting better. This is a time, domestically and externally, when this country needs a Government that can speak fully on behalf of the people.  It is fortunate at this juncture in our affairs, with this serious situation coming out into the open, that the traditions of the two parties on your right, a Cheann Comhairle&mdash;the Labour Party and the Fine Gael Party&mdash;have always been consistent in upholding this State and the rule of law and decent traditions in this country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset of this debate and of the one last week and in may concluding speech last week I told the House clearly that I had certain difficulties, certain limitations, with regard to the information that I had at my disposal.  Deputy O'Higgins tonight asked me specific questions and so did Deputy Garret FitzGerald. I had a note taken of them earlier on. I want to say that, first of all, I took action on the basis of information given to me which was got through the agency of our Garda authorities.  That action, on the face of it, involved, as Deputy O'Higgins has pointed out, a breach of the Firearms Act and, therefore, involved the possibility of criminal action being taken against somebody.  When I started to make my inquiries, as I indicated to the House on 20th April, I was in possession of reports and statements made available to me from the Garda authorities.  My immediate concern then was the fact that two members of the Government were mentioned in one way or another in these reports.  My clear duty as head of the Government was to inquire whether there was any evidence available to me that would require me to cause or ask for their resignation from the Government.</P>
      <P>That was my immediate and specific purpose.  I think Deputy O'Higgins will agree that, if I disclosed information made available to me in advance of other proceedings, I could well prejudice the case, prejudice the prosecution and frustrate charges being met.  Deputy Garret FitzGerald has not the legal training&mdash;he has other academic training&mdash;of Deputy O'Higgins.  I am sure Deputy O'Higgins will not disagree with me in that proposition.  It is for that reason, when I came to the House last Saturday night, I told the House I had given all the information it was possible for me to give.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to repeat again, in relation <Col N="1750" /> to the events of the past week, that my purpose was to satisfy myself whether I should take the action I did in relation to those two Ministers, that any other action that was required was a matter for legal authority, for the Attorney General.  I gave the Attorney General the papers, as I have said.  I used the words that the Attorney General was investigating the matter since I gave him the papers and some comment was made on that day.  I did not intend anything to hinge on the words &ldquo;investigating&rdquo; or &ldquo;investigation&rdquo;.  I understand Deputy Garret FitzGerald referred to that today.</P>
    <P>The Attorney General has been vigorously pursuing his side of the matter. He has been vigorously pursuing his responsibility in this whole business. He has called for further statements and further statements have been and are being made available to him. On the evidence that has been put before him, and on the evidence that is being put before him, the Attorney General will then make up his mind as to what action should be taken and in respect of what individual.</P>
    <P>I want to say I asked two Ministers to resign.  In the course of the debate this week and last week two other Ministers were mentioned as being implicated.  Deputy Kevin Boland's name was mentioned.  Deputy Kevin Boland resigned on his own volition without any implication or involvement whatever in this matter.  I want to make that quite clear.  I want to make it clear also that I had decided to act before Deputy Cosgrave came to me.  I will indicate why I took that decision and why I knew it to be inevitable. In the first place, I told the House already that many names were reported to me as being involved one way or another in this transaction. When I say involved I do not mean to imply any criminal or other type of subversive involvement.  Statements were taken from Aer Lingus personnel and from Customs and Excise personnel. There were telephone contacts between Dublin and Vienna Airports. There were phone calls, as I have indicated, between the Cargo Terminal of Aer Lingus and the Department of Transport and Power, between an official of the Department of Transport <Col N="1751" /> and Power and the Department of Justice, between that official in the Department of Justice and the headquarters of the Garda Síochána.  Does anybody think in these circumstances I could be so naive as to think with so many people involved, with so many people having some knowledge, no matter how slight, of this transaction, that I hoped it would be possible, as has been alleged, to sweep the whole thing under the carpet?  I am not so naive.  I had no intention and no desire whatever to sweep anything under the carpet.</P>
    <P>Let me come back again to the sequence of events.  I said to the House the first evidence I had of illegal or unauthorised importation of arms was on Monday, 20th April.  It was from that date that I decided there were three courses of action which were open to me.  First of all, to get all the information I could on the attempted importation of arms; secondly, to ensure if arms were imported they would be seized and not permitted to be used for any unlawful or unauthorised purpose; and, thirdly, since the names of two Ministers were involved, to investigate as far as I could, to satisfy myself as well as I could, what action I should take against those Ministers.  Ultimately the further action I took which I think was the proper one for me to take, was to hand the papers to the proper officer, the law officer of the Government, the Government's law adviser, in whose name prosecutions are taken and who advises in general whether or not prosecutions are taken but in particular in the case of serious matters.  I regarded this as a serious matter and it was for that reason, therefore, I gave it to the Attorney General.</P>
    <P>I was in no way or at no time a prosecutor in the legal sense.  I was not a private investigator.  My immediate function, as I want to repeat again, was to satisfy myself about what action I would propose to take in connection with the two Ministers mentioned.  I got this information on 20th April.  I asked for more information and that was presented to me on 21st April.  I told the House already on Wednesday morning, 22nd April, that I asked for the Minister <Col N="1752" /> for Finance.  I gave the House the reasons why I did not see him.  If there is any doubt about that I am sure the secretary, or whoever answered the phone in the Minister's office, can verify I rang that official up early on that Wednesday morning.</P>
    <P>I want, having already mentioned Deputy Kevin Boland, to come to the point about Deputy Michael Ó Móráin. During the investigation I made I had no reason to suspect any involvement by Deputy Ó Moráin and I was satisfied he was not involved.  As I have indicated to the House, from my own observations I knew he was not in good health for some time before the date of the Budget.  Naturally, when I subsequently learned he had gone to hospital as anyone would in the case of a colleague, no matter in what sphere of activity, I made inquiries as to his condition. I made particular inquiries of his doctor and I was told, as I indicated to the House, that the immediate treatment would require some two or three weeks and further treatment would be extended possibly over some months.  I knew from the information already at my disposal it would require a Minister for Justice with his full capacity and full faculties to do the job which lay before him.</P>
    <P>It was from that point of view I went to the Minister for Justice and also from the point of view that I knew I was about to take certain other action. I discussed, as I said, on that Monday morning, the 4th May, his future in politics.  I later went to him and got his resignation in his own handwriting over his own signature.  I did that on that day because I wanted to disassociate Deputy Ó Moráin from the action I was subsequently going to take.</P>
    <P>At the same time I want to remind the House of the physical condition of Deputy Haughey who had had a serious accident, whose doctor I consulted about the possibility of going to see him, as I already indicated to the House, an eminent doctor and a doctor whose word any person in this country would be only too glad to accept as to the the cause of an accident and as to the condition of one of his patients.  I told the House he advised me that Deputy Haughey had suffered a fractured skull <Col N="1753" /> and that it would not be possible to interview him immediately in hospital and not until I got permission from the doctor did I go to the hospital.  I also told the House that the doctor said if it was a matter of serious moment I should only discuss it for a very short time with Deputy Haughey.  I informed the doctor that the matter I wished to discuss was of serious moment.</P>
    <P>Again, I would remind the House that I did interview Deputy Haughey in hospital on 29th April.  In any circumstances it would have been a painful exercise for me but it was much more painful to interview him in the condition in which I found him.  I thought then he was not capable of standing up to any kind of examination or questioning by me and I left Deputy Haughey rather more quickly than otherwise I might have done.  Nevertheless, as a result of further investigations and inquiries I had already come to the conclusion to take the action I did take.  That was irrespective of the visit of Deputy Cosgrave.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave presented to me a piece of paper.  I did not indicate to the House what kind of paper; I said that was a matter for Deputy Cosgrave as there had been some conjecture about whether it had been on headed notepaper.  I took action then because if what Deputy Cosgrave had told me was true I thought that exaggerated accounts of what had happened might appear in the newspapers and elsewhere. Subsequently, I came to the House and gave what information I could give.  That is the sequence of events up to the time I made the announcement.</P>
    <P>In the course of the debate Deputy J. Gibbons was mentioned as being a person who should also come under suspicion.  I said that had I any suspicions of him I would not have nominated him last week to be Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries. Allegations were made in the course of the debate which I had investigated in detail and that did not change my mind.</P>
    <P>In regard to a comment made on Deputy Blaney's return home last weekend, I should like to say that I regard the reception he got as being by no means extraordinary.  Deputy <Col N="1754" /> Blaney is a man whose family had given great service to the country and he himself has given almost a quarter of a century service to his people in Donegal and to his country.  After the events of last week it was not unnatural that on his return home his own faithful and warm-hearted people in Donegal should have accorded him a reception.  However, that does not in any way diminish what I have done or the reason for my decision.</P>
    <P>During the course of the debate questions were asked about many things to which I would find it impossible to reply as I do not know the answers.  There were allegations and rumours of all kinds; wild stories from magazines that did not indicate the source of their information and quotations from such journals as the <i>United Irishman.</i>  Everybody knows that at the outbreak of violence last August quick decisions had to be made by the Government.  I was challenged as to what I meant about &ldquo;not standing idly by&rdquo; and I think I can justify the claim that we did not stand idly by.  We made certain services available and I gave the reasons last week why we thought that necessary.  We made representations to the British Government about the security of the area. We suggested that either they should call in the United Nations to ensure peace or agree to an Anglo-Irish force. We failed in our approach to the United Nations in regard to a peacekeeping force.  We had not any great confidence that this could be done as we knew under the United Nations Charter the country to which the UN force would be assigned would have to seek such a force.  We also knew that the United Nations would very likely regard, as they were entitled to do, the territory of Northern Ireland as part of the United Kingdom.</P>
    <P>Even though it was not very acceptable to any of us, we ensured as far as we could that the British forces would maintain peace and protect all people in the north, particularly the minority. We have continued to insist on that protection, realising our own special difficulties.</P>
    <P>Members of the Labour Party have asked me several times why I did not go to see Mr. Wilson.  When a meeting <Col N="1755" /> takes place between two people both parties usually have to consent to such a meeting.  Before these troubles started and before our own general election, I did ask for a meeting but I think I indicated to the Labour Party that there were certain problems in Britain, mainly of an industrial nature, which preoccupied Mr. Wilson.  Ultimately, when he felt free to see me it was at the time of our own general election.</P>
    <P>Soon after that the troubles started in the Bogside and in Belfast.  I thought that a meeting with the British Prime Minister would not have been conducive to maintaining peace in Northern Ireland.  As I said today, it could then, as now, perhaps have given rise to expectations in one quarter that might not be immediately realised or fears in another quarter that would have been unfounded.  I was concerned that those expectations or fears might have given rise to another outbreak of violence. In this delicate situation I had to act with the utmost discretion.</P>
    <P>At the outset I stated we were entitled to be consulted about the situation, and especially in regard to any change that might occur in Northern Ireland.  I am now using the term &ldquo;Northern Ireland&rdquo; to avoid causing any confusion; it is the name by which that part of the country is known. From the beginning I insisted that we were entitled to consultation and I am going to ensure as far as I can that we will be consulted.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Brien spoke today about the participation of Army officers in the Six Counties since the events of August.  Our Army, like any other, has its intelligence unit and nobody can deny but that Army officers did operate in the Six Counties area during that period.  But I do not think I can be expected, since it is an intelligence matter, to recount here to the House all the activities, any more than I can be expected to recount the methods used by the Garda authorities in carrying out their investigations.</P>

      <P>Deputy Desmond talks about trust.  I am not in any way in breach of my trust.  On the contrary, I would be in breach of my trust to the Irish people if I disclosed what concerned the security of this country.  I do not want to conceal the facts of this transaction but I want to repeat that I can only disclose these according as I am certain they will not prejudice subsequent action by the Attorney General.  I do not know what action the Attorney General will take. I feel he is likely to take some action, but I want to assure the House that if he takes no action that will not be the end of the matter.  I am not afraid in any way to give to the country all the information I have about this whole transaction, but this is not the time.  I want to assure the Deputies opposite that I am not concerned about my political future either, no matter what the outcome of this is.  I am concerned about the security of our country and about the reunification of this country, and, indeed, so are all the other Ministers and every Member sitting here behind me.</P>
      <P>I want to talk about the peaceful solution to this problem.  I am one of the oldest men in this party; anyway the great majority are younger than I.  I came into Fianna Fáil on the basis of Fianna Fáil policy which has never changed since its foundation in relation to the unification of the country, that is, that we would seek it by peaceful means.  I assume that every other person who came into the party on that basis as a founder member or who came into the party subsequently, subscribes fully to that policy.  I believe this is fundamental policy, and I share the views of the Tánaiste that the course to take is quite clear to anyone who does not believe in that policy.  Let there be no equivocation about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was asked some specific question <Col N="1757" /> today at Question Time and I stated I would bring in the answer about the disposal of Secret Service funds.  I said today that, to my knowledge, Secret Service funds were disposed of between three Departments mainly, the Department of Justice, the Department of Defence and the Department of External Affairs.  I was asked whether any other Department had access to these funds.  I was not absolutely certain but I made inquiries. I went back six years.  I thought that was long enough.  The fact is that only these three Departments did have access to those funds with one exception, that is, the year 1965-66 when the Department of Industry and Commerce asked for and received a very small allocation out of these funds, for what purpose I cannot say. As I indicated to the House, the Minister for Finance certifies, on the assurance of the Minister seeking these funds, that they may be paid, and they are disposed of by the appropriate officers either in the Garda, the Army or the Department of External Affairs.</P>
    <P>I do not think the House could expect nor could I give any more information about the disposal of Secret Service funds.  However, I want to add that I made specific inquiries as to whether any moneys could have been voted or could have been paid out of Exchequer funds or out of any public funds in respect of a consignment of arms of the size we have been dealing with and I am assured that there was not nor could not have been.</P>
    <P>Another question I was asked was why, in speaking to an RTE Reporter who met me outside my office&mdash;I think it was the afternoon after the leaving of the Government of the two Ministers concerned&mdash;I said in answer to a question as to whether I expected more resignations I did not think so.  I had not then nor do I have now any reason to expect more resignations from the Government.</P>
    <P>The problem is that everybody reads into everything said by me or anybody else at this juncture something ominous, something that bears no relation to the true position.  It is possible to do that in any circumstances, but certainly <Col N="1758" /> as far as I am concerned I have been telling the truth.  I have been telling what I know and what I am free to say in the circumstances about this whole situation.</P>
    <P>All this is about the re-unification of our country, the desire we all have for a united Ireland, the desire we all have for all Irishmen to live in peace and harmony together.  I am satisfied that only, as I said, by peaceful means can this be brought about.  As long as I am Taoiseach or as long as I have any influence in or out of Parliament, I want to say I would not tolerate any other form of activity.  The fact that I took this action recently is, I think, indicative of my earnestness in this respect.</P>
    <P>If there are people on either side of the Border who feel that force of arms would be a solution, I would ask them to think again as to what the consequences would be.  If there are people on either side of the fence in the Six Counties, Unionists or Nationalists, who because of the concentration of their numbers in a particular part of that territory had the strength to attack their neighbours, I would ask them to think long about the consequences for their own families even if they have no care for their own personal safety, to think of the young and the old and of the exposure of these people to gas, to fire or to bullets.</P>
    <P>I want to ask them to think too of the inflammatory effects of their actions in relation to other people of their own affiliations, of their own convictions in other parts of that territory, people who live in small minorities and who are in almost complete isolation. I ask them to think of the consequences their inflammatory acts might be responsible for in relation to people of their own kind in these isolated communities.</P>
    <P>The time has come for all moderate opinion to speak out&mdash;this great silent majority of which we hear so much. The time has come when they should no longer remain silent but let their influence be used to bring home to militants, no matter on whose side they are, the terrible consequences of their <Col N="1759" /> provocative actions.  Those people of goodwill should give the lead everywhere. They should show example and offer the hand of friendship to all their neighbours, irrespective of class or creed.</P>
    <P>There are genuine fears on all sides. There are also genuine motivations for actions, but no matter how much we agree with them we must realise that there are people who have neither genuine fears nor motivations, people who are only too ready to exploit the fears and the difficulties of others.  I believe that whatever kind of State these militantly minded people want, whatever kind of country the representative groups in the north want, they certainly do not want a land torn by strife.  We in this part of the country have had experience of this: we have had experience of the Civil War, and in this part of the country feelings do not run as deeply or as severely as in the north.  We know how bitter the aftermath of civil war can be and how it can touch successive generations.</P>
    <P>It may be said that it is easy for me to preach tolerance and moderation from the comparative security and comfort of my position here in Dublin, that it is easy for me to preach tolerance so long as I do not feel insecure myself.  To some people, particularly in the north, what I am saying may appear to be a policy of lip-service, of lip service without any realisation of the situation that exists in the North of Ireland or any real desire to help. I said on the last occasion in answering an accusation made by a northern nationalist that we were abandoning them&mdash;since then I have heard some people say that I have thrown them to the wolves&mdash;how I felt about the unlawful use of firearms.  I said that to make firearms available in the circumstances that exist in the Six Counties at present, and having regard to the feelings that now prevail up there, would be throwing the minority to the wolves. If we in any way facilitate the importation of arms to that part of the territory&mdash;and I want to say to Deputy O'Brien that I do not condone the importation of arms from any part of the world&mdash;we are throwing the <Col N="1760" /> minority to the wolves.  Deputy O'Brien quoted Deputy Boland today but he did not go far enough.  From the same column of the Official Report, column 752 of the report for 8th and 9th May, I should like to refer to Deputy Boland's reference to the illegal importation of arms into this country. He said that as far as he was concerned it was not illegal to import arms into the Six Counties but he went on:</P>
    <P>It is our duty to advise against it but it is not our business to interfere. </P>
    <P>The words I want to emphasise are &ldquo;It is our duty to advise against it.&rdquo;  I think that indicates clearly&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am concerned for the well being and security of all the people in the north and I am concerned <Col N="1761" /> that the well being of the people in the south as well might not be preserved unless we avoid serious outbreaks of violence in the north during the coming summer.  I want to ensure that that well being, that security will be preserved, but that can be done only if all our efforts are directed to creating a climate of understanding of the fears, of the suspicions which have been engendered in the Six Counties.</P>
      <P>That understanding can only be promoted by being tolerant even in the face of intolerance and fear itself and in the realisation that all people, no matter what their affiliations, are capable of having the same fears and trusts, the same hatred and love, the same hurt and happiness.  Nobody is immune from these feelings, nobody is entitled to exacerbate them for evil and nobody is entitled to play on emotions if the purpose is to gain short-term advantage for a particular cause if it is going to give rise to strife and suffering.</P>

      <P>The incessant atmosphere of hate and suspicion which has been bolstered up by militant action and provocative speeches, no matter how sincerely motivated&mdash;and I can accept that such actions and such speeches can be sincerely motivated&mdash; can only result in misery, destruction and bloodshed which will affect those who perpetrate these actions as well as innocent people.  I appeal to those who are in any way militantly minded to pull back from this precipice and instead of pursuing this suicidal course, which can only mean mutual destruction in the end, try to listen to the voices of moderation and tolerance so that mutual trust and understanding will lead them to take the first, even though halting, steps away from that precipice into a future which can bring lasting peace, prosperity and happiness to all parts of this beloved island of ours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Anything I have said in this respect, and I have been consistent in expounding Fianna Fáil policy, in no way diminishes our desire for the re-unification of this country.  We <Col N="1762" /> shall pursue our policy of seeking re-unification by peaceful means.  We do not believe the unnatural partition of our country can last for ever.  Even those responsible for partitioning our country initially did not see it as a long-term solution to what they across the Irish Sea call, &ldquo;the Irish problem&rdquo;. We want to see all our people united. I want to assure the House no matter how the present difficulties might be sought to be exploited by the parties opposite&mdash;it is legitimate politics, I suppose&mdash;that every member of this party is committed whole heartedly to pursuing this policy of re-unification by peaceful means.</P>
