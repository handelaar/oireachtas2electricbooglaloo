    <Speaker pid="BillyFox" hpid="Mr. Fox Mr. Fox">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fox</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach how the present rates of incomes in this country in respect of industrial workers compare with the rates obtaining in EEC countries in terms of relative money values.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>A valid comparison <Col N="2" /> of relative money values between different countries would require a very detailed investigation based on consumption patterns and relative prices for principal consumption items in the different countries.  In the absence of such a detailed study only crude comparisons can be made using official exchange rates and published data on average earnings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With your permission, Sir, I propose to circulate in the Official Report a statement showing the latest available data on rates of earnings and hours worked by industrial workers in manufacturing industry in this country and the latest corresponding figures for EEC countries in so far as it is possible to derive them from available material published by the Statistical Office of the European communities. It should be borne in mind that the validity of comparisons of figures of this kind may be impaired by divergences in the content of the data.  The <Col N="3" /> overall average figures reflect the structure of manufacturing industry which <Col N="4" /> differs substantially between the different countries.</P>
    <P>Following is the statement:</P>
    <P Just="Center">AVERAGE earnings per hour and average weekly hours worked by industrial workers in manufacturing industry in Ireland and in the EEC countries.</P>

      <P>Speech therapists are in short supply not only in this, but in other countries. For this reason, the Dublin College of Speech Therapy was set up in October, 1969, to train speech therapists for employment in the health services throughout the country.  It is expected that the first group of trainees at the college will qualify in mid 1972 and will then be available to take up duty. Meanwhile efforts to recruit speech therapists already qualified elsewhere are continuing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid it is more complicated than that.  There are differences of opinion among people, of opinion not of the permissive category, as to the method of giving talks in schools and even as to the advisability of giving them at all.  Very leading authorities have expressed differences of opinion.  I shall be very interested to receive the report of the working party.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>

      <P>As indicated in my reply to the Deputy's question on 18th February last, this matter has been under examination and my Department hopes very shortly to discuss with growers' representatives what measures it may be possible to take in relation to this year's crop.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFoley" hpid="Mr. Foley Mr. Foley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foley</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the longer this matter is delayed by the Department the less likely it is to benefit the tomato growing industry? On a previous occasion the reply <Col N="6" /> to this question was practically the same.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The previous reply was on 18th February last which is not so long ago as to have brought about a change in the matter to any great degree.  The Deputy should be aware and the House should be aware that legislation is required for this type of control.  What I should hope will be done this year is in relation to export tomatoes only and that can be done, if it is capable of being done&mdash;I am not sure if it is&mdash;by way of regulation under powers I already have.  A discussion with the growers is in prospect in the immediate future and arising from that I will be shortly in a position to say exactly what we shall be doing this year.  However, legislation will be required to control the entire grading system.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister say why it has taken so long to arrive at a decision about this matter?  The Minister must be aware of the need and demand for this for some considerable time.  Is it a question of getting staff?  What is the reason for the delay?  Why should it take practically two years to get a decision on this matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>One could say it has taken all the time since tomatoes were first grown to get around to it.  It is just as difficult to answer why it was not introduced when we started growing, as it is to answer why it took two years.  I am not sure it has taken two years, nor that it has only taken two years, to get to this stage.  The House can be sure that steps are being taken, after due consideration and discussions which have been mentioned, and we will be in a position to do something about export quantities for next year.  Legislation will be before the House.  We will have an opportunity of imposing any control which is felt desirable for the future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is difficult to be exact about this.  As the Deputy is aware the Minister for Health, under certain of his powers, is contemplating certain regulations.  We do not yet clearly see how they can tie in or how far they may be able to go in order to attain the end the Deputy is asking about here.  We are not sure whether the Minister for Health would have sufficient powers or whether we will ultimately need to amend or produce new legislation on the agricultural side to cover the matter adequately and satisfactorily.  This depends on what can be done and how effective measures under the health legislation are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister would not be in a position to give me information until after the Minister for Health has dealt with this matter?</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say that, but certainly it will not be dealt with until the considerations of the Minister for Health are finalised.  It would be unwise to duplicate regulations in this direction.  We are in close touch with <Col N="8" /> the Department of Health on this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>A great deal of publicity has been given to the regulations about warbles and I think that at this stage all farmers are familiar with them.  The purpose of dressing cattle is to eradicate the pest.  If farmers dress only the few they want to sell instead of dressing all that show evidence of warbles we shall make no further progress towards final eradication. I am keeping this whole situation under review.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of what further measures may be necessary to complete the eradication of the warble fly will be considered in the light of the level of infestation this season.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not consider it in view of the fact that between 1967 and 1969 the level of warble infestation has gone up fourfold? This is indicated by figures released by the leather trade.  Surely there is a strong case for very drastic action if we are to avoid going back to the precise situation we were in before we initiated this campaign?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very trite sort of argument.  I have considered this matter over the past 18 months.  There are over five million cattle to be treated if all are dressed.  Even though we did that for a number of seasons there were, by various devices, some of those millions which were not dressed obviously and the result is that little pockets here and there have re-emerged.  We did not think that having got to below one per cent of incidence of infestation the situation warranted the imposition of a nation-wide scheme.  For that reason we stopped at that point and introduced a system whereby any person having cattle showing signs of infestation is entitled to have them treated free of charge.  We also brought in regulations dictating that nobody may expose for sale cattle that were obviously affected.  If infected cattle were found the treatment would no longer be free but compulsory and must then be paid for.  That situation has obtained during the past 12 months.  During the past two seasons we have had two runs of dressings on that basis.  There has been considerable use of the free scheme.  The results which will emerge during the warble fly season now coming up will show what we should do.  We will then be in a position to determine whether it may be necessary to go back to dressing all cattle compulsorily, or whether pockets may emerge which can be encompassed by localised schemes, or whether what we are doing at the moment will be sufficient.  The whole question is under review.  We will be reaching the point of decision as the season progresses.  Until then I <Col N="11" /> cannot tell the House what will emerge.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that the fact that the level of infestation has gone up fourfold under this scheme between 1967 and 1969 is evidence enough that a change of policy is needed and that we should not have to wait for the 1970 season as well before taking action?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries if in view of the recent survey of An Foras Talúntais which seems to indicate that the use of imported pollard in pig feed may add at least 10/- to the cost of producing a pig, he intends to take steps to prevent the inclusion of low grade or defective pollards in compound pig feeds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>An Foras Talúntais have recently furnished to the Department a preliminary report on the outcome of trials carried out in relation to the use of imported pollard in pig rations.  This report has been examined in consultation with An Foras and its implications are being considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that the report indicates a great need for much more stringent inspection at the ports of all pollard coming into the country before it is <Col N="12" /> put into compound feeds because once pollard has been put into compound feeds it is virtually indistinguishable? There is a need for a proper comprehensive system of inspection and if it is found that anybody attempts to bring in pollards that are defective, the Minister should insist that no further licences are issued to those people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter is not as simple as the Deputy outlines.  We have a system of inspection at the ports of entry in so far as pollard is concerned.  It is one matter to describe pollard that may or may not be allowed in but to determine good or poor pollard is another matter because pollard can, as the term is, be &ldquo;sweet and sound&rdquo; but this is not the whole story.  Pollard can come in sweet and sound as far as composition is concerned but it may not be as good as other pollard coming in under the same sort of determination.</P>
      <P>The report we are studying at the moment deals with the merits of pollard and its application as a mixture in compound feeding.  It does this in a much broader sense than is done in determining whether pollard is sweet and sound.  I believe that the report may give us the answers to some of the problems in connection with this matter.  It may also help to eradicate and relieve the pressure to bring in pollard to the extent that we are now doing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>In other words, the criteria being applied by the inspectors of the Department are inadequate and should be revised before any further harm is done?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Again, the Deputy is not on the ball.  The same criteria in determining whether pollard is sweet and sound cannot be applied from season to season because pollard may differ in different seasons in different places or in the same season in different places.  In so far as the quality of the pollard is concerned, it can be quite good in the overall sense but may vary considerably as to its feed value content from area to area of origin and from season to season in the same area.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if, in view of the fact that a reply of 25th February, 1970, suggested that the workload on the inspections of new houses for grant purposes in the counties of Meath and Kildare was substantially above the national average, he will state if he has any proposals to remedy this situation; and if, in particular, he will appoint one extra inspector to cover both these counties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>My reply to Question No. 48 of 25th February last dealt with the position in relation to new houses only.</P>
      <P>Apart from new house work, inspectors also deal with applications for reconstruction grants, water and sewerage grants, and grants for group water supply schemes.  A balance is maintained between the overall workload in the various areas and the total number of inspectors on duty from time to time.  In this context, the workload in Meath and Kildare is not appreciably above the national average.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that additional inspectors are required to deal with the increasing flow of private housing work generally and steps are being taken to recruit them.  Consideration will be given to the position in Kildare and Meath, relative to other areas, in assigning additional staff so recruited.</P>

      <P>The question of making proper provision for the preservation of public records has been under active consideration in a number of Departments for some time.  As the Deputy will be aware, the Devlin Review Group has since recommended that the Public Record Office be split between the National Library and the Land Registry.

      <P>Eight statutory meetings of district justices have been held since 1961 pursuant to section 36 of the Courts (Supplemental Provisions) Act, 1961.  The last meeting was held on 12th October, 1968.  The section empowers the president of the district court to convene meetings of justices of the district court not more frequently than twice in one year, to discuss, among other things, &ldquo;the avoidance of undue divergences in the exercise by the justices of the jurisdiction of that court and the general level of fines and other penalties&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The subject of disparity of sentencing was listed by the president on the agenda for discussion at a meeting held in 1963, at two meetings held in 1964, and not since.  Prior to the meeting in November, 1964, the Minister for Justice gave a formal address to the justices, in which he referred to the wide disparity in sentencing and to the need for discussion and clarification amongst the justices themselves on that subject.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am informed that there has been <Col N="25" /> a marked reluctance on the part of the justices generally to have the subject opened for discussion and the intentions of the statute in that respect, as passed by the Oireachtas have, in effect, been disregarded.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 33, 34, 36, 37 and 41 together.</P>
      <P>Over the past twelve months and more I have, in statements here and in replies to parliamentary questions, dealt at length with the strength and deployment of the Garda Síochána; and I do not think that I should have to go over that ground again at any length.</P>
      <P>As regards criteria, there will, I think, be general acceptance that the optimum strength of the Garda Síochána is the minimum strength which, when deployed in the most effective way by reference to current requirements, and when equipped with adequate transport and other facilities such as radio, will provide an efficient service to deal with the basic responsibilities of the Garda Síochána.  These responsibilities are the prevention and detection of crime, the control of traffic, and the maintenance of law and order. In recommending the closing of a particular station, the commissioner applies similar criteria&mdash;he has regard to the level of crime and of traffic, to the population and acreage involved and to all local circumstances.  No station is closed without a certificate by the commissioner that he is satisfied that the station can be closed without detriment to the efficient policing of the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The review of the deployment of the force, which has been engaging my attention for some time, has now been expanded by the setting up within the Garda Síochána, as recommended by the Conroy Commission, of a research and planning unit, which is actively engaged in examining how the existing strength can be located and used to the best advantage in present conditions and in those likely to obtain in the future.  I cannot at this stage give <Col N="28" /> particulars of stations which may be closed in the next two years; this will have to await recommendations which the commissioner will make as a result of the work of the research and planning unit.</P>
    <P>The assessment of police requirements in any area is a matter primarily for determination by professional policemen who are the best judges of methods of prevention and detection of crime and of police needs in the locality.  This is not a matter that could be solved in open consultation with local residents, but the Garda authorities always take into account local reports as to the views of responsible citizens.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that some form of consultation should be institutionally provided? Would he not agree that the information requested in Question No. 35 should be made available so that people can see that they are not losing anything, if that is the position, as a result of stations being closed?  Would the Minister not agree that there has been concern in many areas that the closing of a station has led to a great increase in crime in those areas and that figures should be available in this regard so that people would be clear as to what is happening?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the last point made by the Deputy, that is not the case.  In fact, increased mobility, radio equipment and so on have enabled smaller stations to be closed without any increase in the crime rate.  The important aspect of this matter is to deal with crime: that is what a police force is for.  The facts are that you have at the moment deployment of the force in many areas where crime is practically non-existent and you have the force under strength in areas where crime is rampant.  The whole purpose of the proposed redeployment is to ensure that the resources available are deployed where crime is most evident.  It is as simple and as logical as that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to have circulated with the Official Report a list of the rural Garda stations and sub-stations closed in the ten-year period ended 24th April, 1970.  Thirtynine stations and 19 sub-stations were closed in that period.</P>
      <P>The particulars sought by the Deputy of crime at local station level are not available and could at this stage be compiled, if at all, only by the spending by members of the force of a great deal of time which could not be justified.</P>
      <P>As regards the final portion of the question, I should emphasise that the most efficient use of manpower is the primary objective of the policy of redeployment. However, the total number of members attached to the stations and sub-stations which were closed was about 90.  The closings made possible transfers to other centres where extra strength was urgently required and where otherwise extra recruitment would have been unavoidable.  At current cost levels, the annual cost of 90 members, say, 20 sergeants and 70 gardaí, is not less than £150,000 so that maintenance of the existing stations and strengths would have cost £150,000 more than the Garda authorities thought necessary for adequate policing of the districts.</P>

      <P>Allowances for the provision of fuel and light in Garda stations outside Dublin are increased by reference to actual requirements in each case.  In some of the smaller stations, because of shorter opening hours, etc., a basic allowance fixed about 30 years ago is still found adequate in practice, but actual expenditure, if higher, is defrayed without difficulty.</P>
      <P>The allowance in respect of the cleaning of stations outside Dublin is increased regularly in the light of increases in Civil Service pay.  The allowance was last increased with effect from 1st October, 1969.  Fuel and light in Dublin stations are provided by the Office of Public Works, and cleaning is done by civilians employed by the commissioner.</P>
      <P>I have accepted, in principle, the recommendation of the Conroy Commission that district officers outside Dublin be given authority to pay from official funds the cost of heating, lighting and cleaning stations in their districts.  Arrangements to implement this system will shortly be discussed by the consultative council.</P>

I am favourably disposed towards the recommendation, which falls to be examined in the first instance by the research and planning unit of the Garda Síochána.  As regards the census of population, it has been decided that because of the time factor, the Garda Síochána will, in relation to the next census, carry out the duties previously performed by them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The situation posed in the question is not the kind <Col N="34" /> of situation that arises in practice.  The vast majority of alarms that go off are false alarms due to accidental triggering or electrical faults.  Accordingly, the suggestion in the question would amount to arming the gardaí on ordinary patrol duty or in patrol cars and this is not contemplated.  I would add that it is well recognised by the gardaí themselves that the carrying of firearms would not necessarily reduce the risks which they have to take but could, on the contrary, greatly increase these risks.  In fact, the force have let it be known that they would not favour the arming of uniformed members.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Having regard to the desirability of apprehending culprits, and more especially the desirability of protecting our garda force, would it not be wise to make sure that in future no unarmed garda will be sent to investigate a bank robbery?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very sensitive area and the fact of the matter is that members of the force themselves do not favour any extension of arming.  When one examines the question closely and in detail and without any emotion, one can see that one is straightaway into a very dangerous area if the degree of arming the Garda Síochána is extended.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">

        <i>(Cavan):</i> Does the Minister agree that experience has shown that most of these bank raids are carried out by armed men?

      <P>The Garda investigations show that nobody claims to have seen any person firing shots.  The garda who was on duty at Leinster House on the occasion was reported as having told a journalist that he saw a man in a motor-car actually firing shots.  The garda concerned denies that he ever made such a statement and states he witnessed no such incident though he did think the sounds were shots.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of the many people who heard the sounds, some thought they were rifle or revolver shots.  Others, including people with long Army experience, were satisfied that they were not shots. However, when the reports of the incident appeared in the newspapers, a number of eye-witnesses got in touch with the Garda to testify that they not only saw the car in question but <Col N="36" /> saw the actual flashes and smoke from the exhaust as it repeatedly backfired. These were reliable witnesses whose statements put the matter beyond all shadow of doubt and I would like, on behalf of the Garda Síochána, to thank them publicly for the valuable help they have given to refute a story that could have caused needless alarm.</P>

      <P>The reply is in the form of a statement which, with your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to circulate with the Official Report.</P>
      <P>The information requested is as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>1.  Particulars of improved sick pay conditions which have been offered to State industrial employees in full-time direct employment</P>
      <P>(i)  After six months' continuous service (or 34 weeks' aggregate service), sick pay at full rate (less social welfare benefit) for up to six weeks in any period of 12 months' service.</P>
      <P>(ii)  After 12 months' continuous service (or 68 weeks' aggregate service), sick pay at full rate (less social welfare benefit) for up to nine weeks in any period of 12 months' service.</P>
      <P>(iii)  The restriction on the admission of employees who are under 21 years of age will be removed.</P>
      <P>These proposals, if accepted, will have effect from 1st April, 1970.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>2.  The proposed pension scheme provides pensions and lump sums for temporary full-time workers directly employed by the State on or after 1st January, 1970, who have not hitherto been pensionable and who retire on age or ill health with at least ten <Col N="37" /> years reckonable service.  The normal retirement age under the scheme is 70.  The principal benefits are&mdash;</P>
    <P>Pension:&mdash; 1/80th of pensionable pay for each year of reckonable service up to a maximum of 40/80ths. Pensionable pay means retiring pay less twice the rate of contributory old age pension payable to a single man on the last day of reckonable service.</P>
    <P>Lump sum:&mdash;1/30th of pay for each year of reckonable service up to a maximum of 45/30ths.</P>
    <P>Death benefit, payable on death in service after at least five years reckonable service, is a year's pay or the appropriate retirement lump sum if greater.</P>
    <P>In the case of lump sum and death benefit no deduction is made from pay in respect of social welfare benefits.</P>
    <P>These are the main provisions of the scheme.  If and when they are accepted by the unions, details will be worked out in consultation with the parties concerned.</P>

      <P>The question of the denomination of coins to be issued for the operation of decimal currency was carefully considered before the Decimal Currency Act, 1969, was drafted and it was decided that a coin of the value of 6d would not be appropriate because, in the new currency, it would have the awkward value of two and a half new pence.  It was felt that the series a half, one, two, five, ten and 50 new pence would be sufficient for all practical purposes.  The 6d will not, of course, be withdrawn on Decimal Day, but will continue to be legal tender during the changeover period following that day, when both currencies will be in circulation.</P>

The experience in other countries has been that the 6d has been used less after decimal day.  If there is a demand for the coin during the change-over period, there is nothing to prevent the Minister from introducing one at that time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Minister for Education (Mr. Faulkner) Padraig Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Faulkner)</NameTxt>
      <P>When I spoke last I stated I would refer to the question of corporal punishment.  In this regard, let me state that in my view the basis of all true discipline is love&mdash;the love of the wise and prudent parent for his child.  This love is not necessarily an emotional kind of love but rather a desire to seek the best for the child and to help him to develop.  I doubt if anybody would suggest that the truly loving parent is one who allows his child to do whatever he wishes, overriding the rights of others in the process.  Such a child would be ill-prepared for life and would have great difficulty in adjusting himself to a world where his activities would, of necessity, be limited.  The wise parent trains his child to act in a considerate manner towards others and the method used by each parent varies.</P>
      <P>The teacher stands <i>in loco parentis</i> and he should act as a wise and sensible parent would do; the vast majority of teachers fulfil this role in an admirable way.  The teacher must also concern himself with his responsibility to others.  Where he finds himself faced with a child who persistently disrupts the class, thus denying the other children the right to education, then there must be some deterrent.  In such circumstances I think the teacher should and does act as a wise parent would in deciding to what deterrent he should have recourse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this context corporal punishment should only be used as a last resort when all other sanctions have been <Col N="44" /> found ineffective.  The vast majority of our teachers have no desire to use corporal punishment and are very pleased that it is being phased-out. There are 15,000 teachers taking care of 500,000 children and the number of validated complaints investigated by my Department is absolutely minimal. This, in itself, is a manifestation of the humane and kindly manner in which teachers treat the children. Corporal punishment is being gradually phased-out and this fact reflects the developing attitude of the community in general in regard to the treatment of children in the context of their educational progress.  The increasing co-operation between parents and teachers, the recognition of the limitations of ability of the pupils, the treating of the child as an individual, the introduction of the child-centred curriculum, and the changing methods of teaching are all helping to accelerate the phasing-out of corporal punishment from the school scene.</P>
    <P>I may be asked why I speak of phasing-out corporal punishment, why not end it immediately?  In my view this would leave a void that would create more problems than it would solve.  The fact must be faced that most normal children require correction of some kind and the question arises as to what sanctions could be effectively imposed in place of corporal punishment.  The unruly child cannot be allowed to disrupt the education of other children in the class. When we speak of other sanctions the number of alternatives that readily come to mind have their own disadvantages. Do we keep the child in after school hours or impose additional homework?  Could such be defended on educational grounds?  To suspend the child from school, either temporarily or permanently, would deny him the education which is his right. To operate on the basis, as some people appear to do, that every unruly child is a subject for a psychiatrist is, in my view, entirely wrong and I can think of no greater punishment one could inflict on a child or on his parents than to say that the child should be submitted for psychiatric examination.</P>
    <P>If society demands that corporal <Col N="45" /> punishment must end, it must provide an alternative if the rights of others are to be maintained.  In this instance society is represented by the individual parents who must make the decision in respect of their own child.  I think my attitude in relation to this is the correct one: we are all pleased that corporal punishment is being phased-out.</P>
    <P>I shall not waste time by speaking of the NBC film on corporal punishment in Ireland which was shown here recently except to say I was shocked by its selectivity.  I am afraid its main effect on our people, who know the exact circumstances, was that they will tend to view with extreme caution documentaries on any subject coming from the United States in relation to other countries.  Having listened to some of the speakers on this film who spoke emotionally of our teachers as sadists, it was clear to me that they did not appear to recognise that in the depths of their own emotion they were betraying a streak of sadism and intolerance in themselves.  Whatever the merits of an objective we should have learned by now that verbal violence does not destroy violence and that the exercise of restraint and Christian charity could be much more effective in arriving at a solution to this problem.</P>
    <P>As I did the last day, I shall continue to try to take the different matters in order and I shall now deal with some matters concerning post-primary education.  Some Deputies seemed to think we were not proceeding rapidly enough with our development of comprehensive education and particularly with the building of comprehensive schools.  State comprehensive schools will be provided in a limited number of areas only, where other arrangements for providing full comprehensive facilities are not likely to prove successful.  This is the keynote.  It is not State comprehensive schools we are aiming at but a comprehensive system.</P>
    <P>The comprehensive school attempts to combine the academic and practical subjects in one broad curriculum, in that way offering each pupil an education which is structured to his needs, abilities and interests.  It avoids <Col N="46" /> the approach to education which is inherent in systems of early selectivity and rigid streaming.  Accordingly there is no streaming of pupils based on ability at entry and there is no entry examination.  Instead education is offered which attempts to individualise the instruction of the pupil by allowing him a wide range of educational experience and by postponing final curricular choice for as long as possible.  To enable pupils to make a career choice suitable to their own aptitudes and abilities, a guidance centre backed by the Department's psychologists is made available, and remedial teaching is also provided in these schools to help the weaker pupils.  As the new comprehensive schools cater for all the post-primary pupils in their areas, the schools built to date are co-educational schools.  Up to the present the proportion of boys and girls in the schools is roughly half and half.</P>
    <P>In regard to the subjects, during the first three years every student is required to take courses of study in certain subjects.  These are religious instruction, Irish, English, mathematics, social and environmental studies, including civics, physical education, library projects and musical appreciation. In addition, every student must take at least one practical subject, that is, either woodwork or metalwork, or arts and crafts or home economics.</P>
    <P>This compulsory core of subjects will occupy about 21 hours of the pupil's school week, leaving him time for three optional subjects in his school week of about 30 hours.  The pupil may select the optional subjects from among the remaining practical subjects or he may select them from among continental languages, Latin, history and geography and the science subjects.</P>
    <P>There are four comprehensive schools in operation at present: at Carraroe, County Galway, Cootehill, County Cavan, Glenties, County Donegal, and Shannon Airport, County Clare.  Further comprehensive schools are being built at Ballymun, Dublin and at Raphoe, County Donegal.  It is proposed to build comprehensive schools at Manorhamilton and Limerick.  It is expected that the junior division of the new Ballymun schools <Col N="47" /> will come into operation in September of this year and that the other schools mentioned will be completed by the end of 1971.</P>
    <P>We are conducting a number of experiments in relation to streaming and setting in these comprehensive schools, and I have no doubt that the information gained from these experiments will be of considerable use to us.</P>
    <P>Arising from what I have said in relation to comprehensive education, I come to co-operation between a number of schools in an area.  The purposes of this co-operation is, first, to provide the advantages of a comprehensive education in each post-primary centre, secondly, to make the best possible use of the facilities available, that is, teachers, equipment, buildings and so on, and, thirdly, to offer the widest possible choice of subjects or groupings at the leaving certificate level.</P>
    <P>I should like very briefly to go back over what has been done since the letter on this matter was issued by a previous Minister for Education, the present Minister for Industry and Commerce. Meetings were arranged with all school authorities in each county where the general situation in each county was discussed.  Local meetings at most centres took place at which practical possibilities were examined. Rules and regulations applicable to secondary and vocational schools were brought into line with one another for example, the recognition for incremental purposes of teaching hours in either type of school; the alignment of the school day, the school week, the school year; the settlement of various questions relating to grants and so on; the common basic scale for teachers.  New arrangements were also devised to meet with particular situations such as common enrolment, which exists in Ballinamore and in Boyle; local representations on the board of management, as occurs in Oldcastle; extension of the powers of the vocational education committees to enable them to engage in joint management of schools.  I hope a Bill to grant such extension of powers to vocational education committees will be introduced shortly.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="48" /> As regards the working out of co-operation in practice, first, on an elementary basis, there is the exchange of a teacher, for example, of French for a teacher of woodwork; the sharing of a teacher, for example, in physical education, in music; the use of facilities, such as a science room, being extended to another school; a woodwork teacher supplied to secondary school boys and so on.</P>
    <P>In regard to the more advanced types of co-operation, there is the sharing of a common block of specialist facilities, like the assembly room, or the gymnasium, the siting of schools beside one another.  There is the sharing of the same school building, common time-tabling and movement of pupils for a certain space of time from one school to another. Finally, at the advanced stage, we have something I have mentioned already, the introduction of the common enrolment whereby independent schools work as one unit.  As I mentioned a moment ago, there are specific examples of that in Boyle and Ballinamore. Each school retains its own management structure but establishes a co-ordinating committee which is representative of each.  All the children are treated as if they had been enrolled in one school and they utilise all the facilities.</P>
    <P>A matter arising out of the introduction of comprehensive schools is the question of co-education.  I have already stated that the Department has no doctrinaire approach to co-education but in a number of situations, particularly in rural areas, great practical advantages can be gained from the organisation of a school on a co-educational basis.  There are many areas where it is possible to maintain a mixed post-primary school where it would not be possible to maintain two single sex post-primary schools.  In such areas co-education would provide a wider range of options as well as a better utilisation of facilities.  Vocational schools have always catered for both boys and girls but up to recent times the arrangements were more coinstitutional than co-educational, that is to say, boys and girls made use of the same facilities but were not mixed <Col N="49" /> in classes.  Until recent times mixed secondary schools were a rarity, but there are now 103 mixed secondary schools&mdash;85 Catholic and 18 Protestant&mdash;in the country.  We also have a good deal of partial co-education with mixed classes for specialised subjects. Another matter of importance which is being given a good deal of consideration at present is the question of guidance.  It has been clear for a number of years that a considerable demand exists for the provision of pupil guidance.  Many schools have attempted to meet this need on an informal basis by giving career talks, and out of school organisations have held seminars and exhibitions giving career information.  Following a study of existing services in other countries a number of concepts were formulated which might be said to be the basis for a policy of guidance.  It was decided that the role of guidance should be to try to pinpoint the aptitudes and abilities of the pupils and endeavour to gear their education towards the careers which are likely to be available to them and for which they are likely to qualify.  Educational guidance should not be looked upon as a job-finding agency and I think this is an error we are liable to make.  We seem to think that guidance means telling the students when they reach the end of their post-primary course what job they should take up instead of directing them all the time along lines in keeping with their ability.</P>
    <P>It was therefore decided that pupil guidance should be an integral part of the education provided by the school. This involves assisting pupils and parents in deciding what subjects and courses the pupil should follow while at school and what further study or career they might take up when leaving school.  I feel the provision of pupil guidance should be the responsibility of the school, assisted if necessary by a specialist service.  Pupil guidance should be the responsibility of a person who knows about education, who knows the system and who knows the children.  For this reason I feel that the person undertaking career guidance should be a teacher specially trained for this work.  If pupil guidance is to be effective the wholehearted co-operation <Col N="50" /> of all members of staff in the school is essential and I think a member of the staff will be more likely to get this co-operation than an outsider. Specialist services are needed to support the school in providing pupil guidance.  Psychological services provide specialist advice on the request of the school.  If the school requests it a psychologist may undertake psychological testing and interviewing of the pupils.</P>
    <P>The preparation of teachers for their special role in guidance presents a particular problem.  It is evident that in-service training is needed and that it is preferable to have teachers with several years teaching experience.  For this reason the Department decided to start modestly with short courses and limited objectives and then develop the course content and depth as experienced teachers became available.  The alternative to what I have already mentioned would be to start with personnel trained on a full-time university course. In fact, such a course is offered at UCD and is open to all graduates.  This would mean that individual schools would employ graduates once they obtained their diploma and became available. Recognition would have to be afforded them either as teachers or as career officers or counsellors in the school. The advantage claimed for such a course of action is that highly qualified people would be available from the start to do guidance work in the school. As I see it, the difficulty of adopting this course is that it would be against the principle of integrating guidance with the general work of the school, something which I feel is essential.</P>
    <P>To recap very briefly, as far as the Department are concerned they have initiated a school-based system; they have made time available in the school for guidance work; they have seen to it that accommodation will be available in which to do this work; they have started in-service training; they have granted recognition to graduates with diplomas in guidance, provided they are qualified teachers, and they have set up an advisory committee on guidance composed of representatives of the Department, the school authorities and the teaching organisations.</P>
    <P>There has been some discussion <Col N="51" /> about school transport during the course of this debate.  When dealing with school transport I think we should take a look at what has been achieved in the very short space of time since free transport was introduced.  As Deputies know, until quite recently the education of many country children began and ended at primary school simply because they were too far away from the nearest secondary or vocational school and their parents could not afford the cost of transport.  Indeed, in many instances there was no transport of any kind available.  The Government decided if free post-primary education were to mean anything to these children then a free school transport scheme would have to be introduced.  During the course of the debate some Deputies said they thought my priorities were wrong and that I should not spend so much on transport.  It is obvious that at the beginning of a new free education scheme such as ours it is essential to make this free transport available but I am always willing to have a look at it in relation to the priorities as adumbrated by some of the Deputies.</P>
    <P>The scheme was introduced in April, 1967.  In the normal way transport for up to 50,000 children might have been expected to take at least three years, since the service had to be started almost from scratch.  Buses had to be found, drivers had to be recruited, routes planned, insurance looked after and all the numerous other technical details which are involved in a scheme of this magnitude.  Most important of all, money had to be made available. In the event, transport was made available for all eligible pupils within 12 months and I feel that this is greatly to the credit of all concerned.</P>
    <P>The transport scheme has, as all Deputies here are aware, involved a massive financial commitment on the part of the State.  Although the cost was very high last year we have made further money available for it this year. The State has also provided very large sums in capital, several million pounds, for the construction of hundreds of school buses.  It is obvious to anybody who sees the increasing number of these buses on our roads that <Col N="52" /> we are making more and more of them available as rapidly as possible.  By the end of the school year we will have them carrying 100,000 children to primary and post-primary schools.</P>
    <P>Most of the criticism related to the qualifying distances and whether ineligible children should be allowed to travel by bus when there are a couple of seats available.  The present qualifying distances for free transport to primary schools are two miles for children under ten years of age and three miles for children of ten years and over.  In framing the scheme the Government had to strike a balance between what might be desirable and what it would be possible to do.  We are a small nation with correspondingly small financial resources.  Nevertheless, our qualifying distances for free transport&mdash;and I would underline this&mdash; compare very favourably with those of our nearest European neighbours.</P>
    <P>On the face of it any proposal that school buses should carry ineligible children where spare seats are available seems to be eminently reasonable but I want to point out here that there are considerable difficulties.  In the first place, the initial planning of routes is done in such a way that as few spare seats as possible are available. In other words, the size of the vehicle and the length of the route are geared to the number of eligible children. This is, of course, obviously done for reasons of economy and efficiency. If a considerable number of spare seats are available on a bus then the transport officer has not done his planning properly.  This is very seldom the case because most of the complaints we get are from the opposite direction.</P>
    <P>If there could be any question of taking up the few spare seats that might happen to be available on a school bus the question arises as to how we would reconcile the conflicting demands.  Who would get the seats?  Would it be the youngest?  Would it be those farthest away?  Would it be girls?  Would it be children of poor parents?  Who would allot the seats?  Would it be the driver or CIE or the Department?  Who would deal with complaints where children fail to get seats?  The number of spare <Col N="53" /> seats could change from quarter to quarter.  What would happen when children who are paying have to be put off a bus in favour of eligible children? The present rule is relatively simple and easily understood by everybody. Whenever spare seats are available CIE allocate them on a fare-paying basis and on the basis of first come first served.  This is the best we can do in relation to it, considering the enormous expense which is involved.</P>
    <P>Deputy FitzGerald when speaking on the Estimate stated that we were not treating Protestant children fairly in so far as free post-primary education is concerned.  I want to say that this is completely unjustified.  The simple fact is that because of the cost structure in Protestant secondary schools none of them were in a position to avail of the free education system.  In these circumstances the Government decided to make a special grant available over and above the terms of the free scheme. In the current school year this grant amounts to the equivalent of £23 10s for each day pupil and £40 approximately for each boarding pupil.  To pay these substantial additional grants where nothing was paid previously cannot surely, as was stated by some Deputies in this House, have worsened the position of Protestant pupils.</P>

      <P>In areas where there are State comprehensive schools free post-primary education is available to Protestant children in a way which is acceptable to them.  The comprehensive school in Raphoe will open for the acceptance of Protestant pupils in 1971.  I met deputations from the Protestant community on a number of occasions in relation to the special grants.  I have explained the situation to them and I have, in fact, during the past year made a very considerable concession in relation to transport which I think was very much appreciated by them.</P>
      <P>Deputy FitzGerald also made considerable play about what he called professional educators.  I was glad to hear Deputy Thornley say that he did not know what the term &ldquo;professional educator&rdquo; meant.  Perhaps Deputy FitzGerald is differentiating between those engaged in administration and those whose main task is to give technical and professional advice.  As far as my Department are concerned there is no question of the administration and the professional sides operating in a vacuum.  Both sides contribute and it is essential that both sides should contribute to our educational development. It should not be lost sight of that in the ultimate most problems become matters which call for administrative skill and judgement if they are to be satisfactorily solved.  Administration is also a highly developed science and it is a science which can only be mastered after a considerable number of years experience. It is essential that we should have the inter-play of the administrative and the educational side if we are to evolve an educational policy which is not only best but which can be put into operation.</P>

      <P>I listened to the Deputy for three and a half hours very patiently and very silently and I have no doubt he will continue to listen to me in like manner.</P>
      <P>Deputy Sir Anthony Esmonde mentioned the question of the teaching of European languages in the context of our possible entry into the EEC.  I should like to inform him that we are making very considerable progress in this respect.  In 1953 there were 22,513 students taking French; in 1963, 49,136; in 1969, 79,152.  In 1953 there were 340 students taking German; in 1963, 1,538 and in 1969, 3,176.  In the case of Spanish the figures were : 1953, 158; 1963, 1,759 and in 1969, 11,149. So, we are making very considerable progress in that sphere.</P>
      <P>To move on to the regional technical colleges I would say that the main long-term function of the colleges will be to educate for trade and industry over a broad spectrum of occupations ranging from craft to professional level, notably in engineering and science but also in commercial, linguistic and other specialities.  They will, however, be more immediately concerned with providing courses aimed at filling gaps in the industrial manpower structure, particularly in the technician area. Various Deputies during the course of this debate stressed the need here.</P>
      <P>No rigid pattern of courses has been fixed for the regional technical colleges. Local needs will determine the necessity for specific courses.  It is envisaged, however, that we would provide a certain core of courses. These are as follows:&mdash;post-intermediate courses leading to the leaving certificate with special bias towards commerce, science and technical subjects; junior and senior trade certificate courses for apprentices; courses for technician and higher technician qualification; courses for apprentices in the distributive trades and adult education courses.  Courses for higher technicians and up to professional level will be provided in the larger centres only.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is expected that persons who complete courses in the regional technical colleges will find employment, some as craftsmen in such trades as carpentry, <Col N="56" /> joinery, automobile engineering, electrical installation, mechanical engineering, plumbing, printing, furniture and other trades; others, as technicians in building construction, mechanical engineering, civil and mining engineering, electrical power engineering, telecommunications, marine radio, radar, computer programming, work study, in medical and science laboratories, in agricultural, food and fertiliser industries and in other industries such as catering, textiles, footwear and so on; and, the third group as higher technicians in mechanical engineering, in electrical power engineering, electronics, marine engineering, building, commerce, science, and so on.  To date we have the post-intermediate courses in operation but we hope to make considerable advance in the coming year.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies spoke of the need for an extension of adult education.  In June, 1969, my predecessor appointed Mr. Con Murphy to carry out a survey of the needs of the community in the matter of adult education and to indicate the type of permanent organisation to be set up in order to serve these needs.  He has been assisted in this work by a representative advisory committee. I can say that the greater part of the work on this survey has now been done.  Data and submissions have been collected from statutory and from voluntary bodies in regard to needs and resources, and personal contact has been made with most people engaged in adult education.</P>
    <P>The present position regarding the provision of adult education is that classes for adults are provided by vocational education committees, the extramural departments of the universities, in two grant-aided institutions, the Dublin Institute of Adult Education and the College of Industrial Relations, and by a large number of voluntary organisations including such bodies as Macra na Tuaithe.</P>
    <P>It became evident during the past few years that some kind of co-ordination was necessary to ensure that the best use would be made of the existing services and to plan for the further extension of services to cater adequately for the needs of adults in the seventies.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="57" /> It was for this reason that the adult education survey was undertaken. When I get the report of this survey decisions will be taken on it.</P>
    <P>I wish now to refer to secondary school building, with particular reference to the building unit in my Department.  A very considerable amount has been done in this regard in recent years.  The number of classrooms being provided between 1967 and 1971 is 1,650.  The number of special rooms, science laboratories, woodwork rooms, home economics rooms, <i>et cetera</i>, is 950; others, such as libraries, general purposes rooms, 300.  This is equivalent to approximately 50,000 new places.  To make this programme possible special measures were required.  A building unit was set up in the Department to handle all post-primary school building projects.  New design and cost planning techniques were introduced which enabled a wider range of teaching accommodation to be provided at lesser cost.  Indeed, I could say that because of such techniques the cost per student place over the past three years has been cut by half.  A process of phasing was introduced under which a certain amount of accommodation, but not all the accommodation which would ultimately be required, was provided immediately for schools.  In other words, the building projects were staged.  This enabled permanent accommodation, which was adequate to meet the demand for places, to be provided in the maximum possible number of cases.  In this way well over 100 secondary schools annually are receiving extra accommodation.</P>
    <P>Finally, priorities were established with provision for new places having first priority.  The result of all this has been that places have been, and will be, available in post-primary schools for all children seeking places.  I want to emphasise this.  A choice of school may not always be possible but every child seeking to follow a post-primary course can be accommodated.  This is no mean achievement in view of the very considerable pressures over the last few years.  That is not to suggest, of course, that there is not a long and <Col N="58" /> difficult road ahead of us.  To provide the full range of facilities that we would like to see in post-primary schools will take a number of years to accomplish.</P>
    <P>I must also stress the fact that problems such as this are world-wide. Most countries have had or are having school population booms.  The solutions to those booms have varied in different countries but all of them had their short-term problems in terms of financial and administrative resources and in the resources of the building industry.  In recent years very many school authorities have shown a keen appreciation of those factors.  I think with this type of understanding we can cope with many of our short-term difficulties.</P>
    <P>I have seen some statements attributed to An Bráthair Ó Muimhnea-cháin in relation to the provision of money for secondary schools.  I might at this stage say that I would like to express my appreciation of the fine contribution of the religious in our schools system and the very excellent work they have done over the years.  If I were to refer simply to myself I could say that I appreciate this very much because possibly if it were not for the Irish Christian Brothers I would not have been able to get a secondary education.  I should like to say in relation to the remarks which were quoted in regard to the building grants being made available for secondary schools that in actual fact only a very few years ago there were no grants available at all.  While making available the grants that are now being paid we are at least moving in the right direction.</P>
    <P>I should also like to refer to An Bráthair Ó Muimhneacháin's remarks on my statement about the leaving certificate and to say that here, again, I was simply making a statement of fact.  I was not trying to place the blame on anybody nor was I trying to exonerate my Department for whatever defects there might have been. For historical reasons our education has been academically orientated&mdash;I need not go into the reasons&mdash;but to a certain extent we need to reconsider the situation particularly in the light <Col N="59" /> of our industrial development and from the point of view that last year 16,000 new jobs were made available.  As I said, I did not make this remark in the sense that I was placing any blame on anybody.  What I was simply doing then, as I am doing now, was asking for co-operation from all educational interests and I have no doubt I will get this co-operation.</P>
    <P>I will now deal with higher education. First, I should like to make a few comments on the report of the Higher Education Authority.  I feel a notable feature of the first report of the Higher Education Authority is the stress it lays at several points on the responsibility of institutes of higher education towards promoting the common good through ensuring that the State gets a fair return for its investment. In relation to the report as a whole, while it is naturally condensed, it can be said it has the basic quality that it highlights a large number of problems in relation to higher education generally and to university education in particular.  It forces us to dwell on and to analyse those problems in a way in which we might not otherwise do.</P>
    <P>In that process, of course, we are compelled to ask a number of questions which at this point of time might be considered fundamental.  The first question is: &ldquo;How do we compare with the rest of Western Europe in the matter of participation in higher education&rdquo;?  An examination of the relevant statistics shows that we compare very favourably in this respect with other Western European countries. For this purpose we have taken into account the numbers in our training colleges and in our colleges of technology as well as the numbers in our universities.  This was necessary in order that we might compare like with like. The large growth in numbers receiving higher education, particularly in recent years, compels us to ask whether in the normal course of working out our priorities we can afford to go on providing higher education on an open-ended basis or whethere we should go on providing more and more such <Col N="60" /> education on the present lines having regard to our social and economic requirements.</P>
    <P>It is in the light of this that we must view the authority's projected additional 5,000 arts students by 1975. This figure stems from the projection that there will be 7,000 additional students seeking higher education by that year and that only 2,000 of them will find their way into other faculties. Therefore, 5,000 of them must be consigned to arts.  I feel that this raises a fundamental question in relation to our priorities.  While due regard must be had to education for its own sake, the overall needs of the nation cannot be lost sight of.  On the one hand, it could hardly be argued on any basis that the nation requires an additional 5,000 arts graduates and, on the other hand, it is obvious that we require more higher-grade technicians and technologists.  Rather than provide for 5,000 additional arts students, should we not direct our attention towards the regional technical colleges and the technological institutes?  Should we not look at the major role they must play, not only in catering for additional students, but also in providing persons with qualifications for which there will be great demand and who will supply an urgent national need?</P>
    <P>There is another item in the authority's report which I feel calls for comment.  This has been commented on on many occasions.  A sum of £24 million has been mentioned as the capital requirement over the next six years.  Certain university commentators have said that this projection is too low.  I cannot understand how they arrived at this conclusion so quickly. They made their comment on this particular matter the day after the report was published.  It took me a considerable time to arrive at my own conclusions in relation to it.</P>
    <P>The authority had accommodation for 13,000 students in mind in relation to this figure both by way of replacing existing unsuitable accommodation and of providing additional accommodation. This would represent a cost of £1,846 per student place.  While undoubtedly providing facilities for medical students is very costly, all our <Col N="61" /> experience in relation to building puts the cost per student place far below £1,846.  The cost per student place in the regional technical colleges in which a large proportion of the accommodation is devoted to science and workshops was £600.  The cost per student place at Belfield was £650.  In the proposed arts block at TCD the cost per student place is estimated at £650. Through the work of the building unit to which I have referred earlier we succeeded in having the regional technical colleges built at a figure of £2 million below the estimated cost.  In relation to certain university buildings we also succeeded in having the costs reduced very considerably.  In the light of these figures the sum of £15 million capital expenditure over six years was arrived at.  I consider the sum will be adequate. I should emphasise also that it represents a considerable increase in the actual capital expenditure over the past ten years.  It is ridiculous to describe this as a cutback, as has been done in a number of places.</P>
    <P>The report sets out a target of 1-12 in relation to the staff/student ratio. With the tremendous advances in audio-visual aids and with the development of closed-circuit television the report might, perhaps, have laid greater stress on increasing the application of technology to university teaching rather than relying solely on increasing the manpower engaged on the academic side.  These comments are made as a contribution to the debate which must go on as a necessary part of future planning for higher education.</P>
    <P>While making reference to the Higher Education Authority, I owe it to the members of that authority to say that it is very difficult, indeed, to find words which would express adequately the debt of gratitude we owe to them for what they have accomplished.  They have undertaken many complex tasks. They have given much time to these tasks.  This is evident by the fact that not only did they produce excellent reports but they did so in the shortest possible time.  They deserve our greatest thanks.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dr. FitzGerald and others spoke on university autonomy.  They gave their views on this subject.  I feel I should give my views on it also.  The <Col N="62" /> concept of university autonomy is one which must be respected in any society which adheres to the democratic principle.  Difficulty and differences, however, arise in the definition of that concept.  In Ireland the revenue of the universities derives almost entirely from funds provided through the fees paid by students and, to a very much greater extent, by State grants, both capital and current.  The university in a modern context is part of the structure through which society seeks its own good and the fulfilment of its individual members.  Society is dependent for its wellbeing on the technical competence of its members and on whatever natural resources are available to it.</P>
    <P>The university has a dual responsibility. It has a responsibility to pure learning and a responsibility to the society which sustains it.  We must accept that university autonomy includes freedom of speech and freedom to publish the findings of research.  The university alone may decide on the standard of the qualifications it awards and on the standard of entry of undergraduates. In regard to the latter point, I should point out that the university has a grave public responsibility in relation to entry conditions.  I accept its right to set standards but I am concerned about its action in confining recognition to a limited range of subjects.</P>
    <P>The fulfilment of the individual is the very core of the university concept. It seems rather strange to find that while at the first and second levels of education the emphasis is on the development of the individual's abilities and aptitudes the university has put a brake on such development by the narrow range of subjects acceptable for university entrance.  I would repeat that the standard of achievement is not an issue here.</P>
    <P>It is implicit in the acceptance of the university's prerogatives in regard to standards that one accepts its right to define the courses leading to its qualifications. This does not take from the fact that society has a right to demand from the university and other third-level institutions that they should provide the professional or technological <Col N="63" /> skills which society needs. Universities and other institutions concerned, should decide within their own spheres, how these skills are achieved.  I accept the university's prerogative in regard to the appointment of academic staff.  I cannot accept their right to decide the remuneration of the staff.  As the State must ultimately pay the bill, the State through Dáil Éireann, must continue to have a final say in the matter.  In the matter of university autonomy there are rights on both sides.  I have tried to delineate the areas within which, as I see it, the respective rights lie.</P>
    <P>I should like to say a few words on university students' fees.  In regard to the proposed increase, there are a few fundamental points which should be mentioned.  There is a constitutional onus on the State to provide free primary education.  The State, as part of its social development policy and in keeping with the practice in other countries, has introduced a scheme of free post-primary education and thereby has assumed certain obligations in that field.  It is true to say that neither here nor anywhere else has the State assumed full obligations in the field of third-level education which would extend to every student receiving it.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding this the financial provisions made for higher education, is such that the education of every university student is being subsidised to the extent of over £400 per annum.  This subsidy, which is increasing every year, must be borne by the general body of taxpayers and it is only reasonable to ask that those benefiting directly should bear some relatively small portion of the cost which has increased enormously since the university fees were last raised in 1963-64.  I explained this matter fully to a deputation from the Union of Students in Ireland recently. I promised them that I would consider fully the representations they made to me.  I have now done so and I am satisfied there is validity in one particular point they made.  This relates to students in the faculties in which higher fees are charged and on whom the increase would bear most heavily.  I am prepared in the case of students in these <Col N="64" /> faculties to make funds available to the universities so that the increase in each case might be limited to £10. This is as far as I can go, having regard to the necessity for establishing priorities in relation to public expenditure so that taxation may be kept within limits.</P>
    <P>While on the subject of higher education, I should like to speak on what is popularly known as the merger.  Deputies will have seen several statements in the Press recently in regard to it. These statements were based on proposals emanating from a series of meetings between representatives of the NUI and Trinity College.  So that what is involved will be kept in balance and in proper perspective, it must be borne in mind that while these proposals represent the outcome of important deliberations they must be treated as a further set of proposals which will be considered by the Higher Education Authority in relation to higher education in general and to university education in particular.</P>
    <P>This brings me to the statement issued by the then Minister for Education on behalf of the Government on 6th July, 1968.  That statement made it clear that the Government's examination of the problems involved was made in the context of the national interest and of higher education in the country generally.  While the Government will welcome any proposals or recommendations made to them their decision as to the ultimate proposals to be placed before the House will be taken in the same context as that underlying the statement made on 6th July, 1968.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, I have seen a number of references&mdash;I have already referred to <Col N="65" /> this&mdash;to what has been described as a cut-back on expenditure on education. How any person who has studied the bald facts could arrive at such a conclusion baffles me.  We are budgeting for an expenditure of £5,253,000 more this year than last year.  The total of more than £75 million represents a massive investment in education and any Deputy who says that is a cut-back is simply talking nonsense.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>When progress was reported last week I contrasted critically the budgetary strategy of the Government with the consensus of opinion expressed in recent reports published <Col N="67" /> by the NIEC, the Department of Finance and the Central Bank.  My conclusions&mdash;and, I submit, the conclusions of any objective observer&mdash;on such a comparison must be very far from favourable in terms of an analysis of the Government's strategy in the Budget.</P>
      <P>On Thursday last I dealt with the injurious effect of the turnover tax and, in particular, with the bad psychological impact that this particular tax will inevitably have on the prospect of a prices and incomes policy evolving in the country.  Finally, last Thursday, I dealt with the question of an autumn budget and with the role of the NIEC reports, their involvement and the involvement of those who prepared them in the development of the economic policy of the country.  This afternoon, I propose to deal with some further aspects of the report.  It is not without significance that since the adjournment of the House on Thursday and since the publication of the Budget speech, there has been a series of further comment which, if anything, reinforces the attitude of the Opposition towards the Budget.  For instance, in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of Saturday, April 25th, as in other papers, a warning was published from the final published quarterly report of the Central Bank of Ireland.  I am quoting from the report as reported in the <i>Irish Independent</i> so that it might be put on the record of the House:</P>
      <P>The impact on exports, on tourism and on employment and economic growth, though delayed and blunted for a time by efforts to hold existing markets, cannot but assume grave dimensions if the present rate of inflation continues.</P>
      <P>It goes on to say:</P>
      <P>Demand and cost pressures were such that even with a widening gap in the balance of payments, price increases in Ireland were outpacing those generally experienced in other countries and the competitiveness of Irish goods and services was being undermined.</P>
      <P>Finally:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Report says that the 1970 situation required action on three <Col N="68" /> fronts&mdash;incomes, public expenditure and credit&mdash;with the principal emphasis on incomes.  Containing the &ldquo;12th round&rdquo; as far as possible and preventing its escalation and arranging that further income increases were delayed long enough to allow competitiveness to be regained, must evidently be the immediate aims of incomes and prices policy.</P>
    <P>Incomes restraint and the moderate rate of price increase which would accompany it would promote the growth of employment and output by making a greater range and quantity of Irish goods and services competitive.  Restrictions on Government expenditure and credit had the indirect but necessary effect of moderating the consequence of envisaged cost and price inflation.</P>
    <P>These are but some of the comments made by the Central Bank whose report was unusually published in advance of the Budget.  That report can certainly not give any consolation to the apologists of the Government and it can certainly not give any consolation to the Tánaiste who is one of the strongest advocates of a prices and incomes policy.  He will not find in the Budget confirmation of his particular economic views.</P>
    <P>Many more comments have been made on the Budget and, without wishing to appear selective in any way, I will confine myself to a number of the comments made since the Budget. <i>The Sunday Press</i> whose articles on economic affairs are generally interesting carried comments by &ldquo;Maynard&rdquo; in last Sunday's issue.  I do not suppose that it is any State secret to disclose that &ldquo;Maynard&rdquo; is, allegedly, a strong Fianna Fáil supporter and a lecturer in TCD.  While that may not be welcome in certain sections of Fianna Fáil I understand &ldquo;Maynard&rdquo; to be Mr. Paddy Lyons who is a prominent Fianna Fáil adviser, if I may give him such elevation.  In any event, he is part of the inner economic consultative circle of Fianna Fáil.  He was very critical of the Budget and of the Government's policy.  In his column last Sunday in relation to our economic difficulties he said:</P>
    <P>... the Budget has done little, if <Col N="69" /> anything, to assist us.  Advice proffered by NIEC, the Central Bank, OECD, the Department of Finance Review, and many commentators appear not to have been followed.</P>
    <P>As a whole, the Budget was a traditional balancing of estimated receipts and expenditure for the coming year.  Obviously, since there was an inflation, all the benefits were squeezed from it in terms of increased revenue.  The implicit assumption was that the inflation, of incomes and prices, will continue, and little will be done about it.  If, as stated in the Budget, consumer spending is to be reduced substantially, then estimate revenue looks to be optimistic.</P>
    <P>He went on to say:</P>
    <P>Spending has, however, increased rapidly, at a time when there are sound reasons for slowing the rate of increase considerably.  There appears to be a philosophy that &ldquo;deflation&rdquo; means a rate of inflation less than what it might have been.  This cannot be accepted. Further, there were good arguments in favour of a surplus Budget this year, to reduce private spending, and to pay for the deficit in the capital budget.</P>
    <P>Further on in his column &ldquo;Maynard&rdquo; said:</P>
    <P>However, the extra money had to be found somewhere, and, as we know and will feel shortly in our pockets, turnover tax was doubled. This was regrettable since the tax is not selective, it hits every commodity and every purchase.  In addition, it is repressive, taxing most severely the poorer sections of the community, who since they spend all they earn, have an additional tax of 2½ per cent on their incomes.</P>
    <P>Those who are well off, spend a lower proportion of their income, and so pay a lower rate of tax on their income.  Surely there is enough sophistication in our taxation system to exempt certain essential items, and to apply a higher rate on other goods, as is done with the wholesale tax.</P>
    <P>Finally:</P>
    <P>The Budget cannot be regarded as <Col N="70" /> being completed.  Post Office charges, for example, will increase later this year.  It is very much a wait-and-see Budget.  But the longer we wait the more drastic will be the final dose of medicine.  I am afraid that more effective measures will be required before the end of the year.</P>
    <P>The Government cannot expect any Hosannas of congratulations on that particular aspect of the Budget. Finally, I shall quote from <i>The Economist</i> of the 25th April.  I shall quote the last sentence first:</P>
    <P>The luck of the Irish may hold, but, on this week's performance, they don't deserve it.</P>
    <P>On page 65 of this publication there is the following comment :</P>
    <P>Until the Budget, a strong whiff of common sense had been creeping into the management of the Irish economy.  Economic pacemakers like Dr. Kenneth Whitaker, governor of the increasingly powerful Central Bank of Ireland, are, in their open-plan offices, an age away from the old Dublin of compulsory Gaelic. The white paper on Irish entry into the common market, published on the eve of the budget, did not run away from the probability that food prices could rise by between 11 per cent and 16 per cent, which it considered a fair price to pay for access to a market of 250 million.</P>
    <P>Finally, there is the following comment :</P>
    <P>The sporting chance that Dublin is taking in the budget is that a 7 per cent increase in incomes, which would become 11 per cent when farm incomes, pensions and other marginal items are added, will mean a price rise of between 4½ per cent and 5 per cent.  Combined with this would be, according to the department of finance's pre-budget economic survey, moderation in both investment and spending.  Added to this restraint at home would be a considerable increase in exports, including farm products, to Britain.  Whatever makes them think they can get away with it? Mainly the fact that Ireland's gross national product rose in real terms <Col N="71" /> by 3.75 per cent last year&mdash;and between 1958 and 1969 it increased spectacularly by 50 per cent in real terms.  And of this gnp total of £1,444 million the most cheering thing of all, especially to Irishmen yearning to be free of the yoke of marginal farming, is the fact that for the first time ever Ireland exported more industrial goods, £176 million, than it did agricultural £162 million. The luck of the Irish may hold, but, on this week's performance, they do not deserve it.</P>
    <P>I would certainly think that British investors, seeing the Minister for Transport and Power and the Minister for Health so preoccupied about capital inflow from Britain, who were thinking of sending their money over here from the point of view of purely political insurance because of the impending general election in Britain might feel that Harold Wilson is just as capable of looking after their money as this country would be.</P>
    <P>There is possibly at the back of the mind of the Government the disinflationary effect of the cement dispute. I do not propose to comment on that dispute except to say that it may be one of the reasons why the taxation impact has not been as harsh as it could have been.  The dispute has now lasted for three months.  A great deal of construction work is at a standstill. There are 10,000 workers idle.  The disinflationary effect of that situation is not insignificant.  It is not a welcome aspect of disinflation but it is one which it would be quite improper to neglect.</P>
    <P>I must confess I am considerably disappointed at the somewhat scant comment on the Devlin Report and the rather perfunctory treatment of that report in the Budget.  It is one of the most important reports ever presented to a Government.  We are still awaiting a major public discussion on the report and the reorganisation of State Departments on the lines recommended in the report.  There is little indication in the Budget that the Government have been studying the report in any real depth.  There are profound <Col N="72" /> implications in the report with regard to the future organisation of the State machine and the work of public servants. I would have expected more from the Minister than the rather curt statement that the Government had decided to set up within the Departments various specialised staff units for planning, finance, organisation and personnel.  I welcome the setting up of such units but we would, of course, be in a much better position to comment more comprehensively had we been given more detail in the Financial Statement on these matters.  I welcome the acceptance of a central co-ordinating unit to operate under the Minister for Finance.  This is a rational evolution towards a more coherent public service institutional set-up.  I commend the Government for taking the initiative here.</P>
    <P>I welcome, too, the setting up of management advisory committees.  This is of major significance since it involves the staffs in a more active participation within the organisation of the State.  For too long we have had an excessive dependence on the unduly hierarchical structure of the public service, in which all power and authority was vested in the secretary of a Government Department.  It is a good thing to see some authority devolving to consultant management committees. There is no logical reason why principal officers should not be more involved than they have been.  In the past assistant secretaries and principal officers were often regarded by their own secretaries as glorified messenger boys.  I am glad we are facing the seventies with management consultant committees at top level in the different Departments.  That will be bound to have an important effect on the overall effectiveness of the public service generally.  Decision making will be improved.</P>
    <P>The trouble with a great many reports is that they become outdated because of rapid developments.  The Government have had six months now in which to digest this report.  By no manner of means has the implementation of the other aspects of the report been as rapid as it should have been and I want to refer now specifically to <Col N="73" /> some of the major criticisms in the report.  It is time some comment was made on the internal frustration that exists in the public service from the point of view of promotion barriers. At page 95, paragraph 8.3.21, the report says:</P>
    <P>Promotion seldom takes place across class barriers.  The Chief Inspector of Taxes begins his career as an Assistant Inspector; the Chief Engineer in a Department normally begins in the lowest entry grade, usually Engineer Grade III.  Since there are no other outlets from these structures, there are bound to be promotion blocks and frustrations.  In the general service, similar restrictions apply, particularly at the levels with which this group is concerned. Up to Higher Executive Officer level there have been developments in recent years to secure a fair degree of inter-Departmental mobility by competitions open to eligible officers in all Departments but, above this level, movements between Departments is exceptional.  In recent years, however, some posts at Assistant Principal and Principal level have been filled by competition open to eligible staff in other Departments. In practice, therefore, the high generalist posts in Departments are, to a large extent, Departmentalised. This cannot but affect top management in the civil service.</P>
    <P>I think this particular comment is sufficient. I shall be quite selective and brief in these comments.  It is imperative that the Government should take urgent steps to remedy this frustrating picture of public service employment, in full consultation with staff organisations directly concerned.</P>
    <P>The report contains a very serious denunciation of the current system of personnel assessment internally in the public service in terms of the annual gaining of increments, of the so-called probationary reports and in respect of the total lack of advanced manpower planning within the service as a whole. I shall quote one comment which the report makes.  It says:</P>
    <P>Of the dangers which can result &ldquo;from the rigid adherence to <Col N="74" /> seniority in promotion&rdquo; the most serious is a tendency towards mediocrity in the whole organisation. As promotion is the one real incentive in the Civil Service and because a seniority practice could divorce promotion in general from special effort, civil servants tend to be undermotivated.</P>
    <P>We had better not let that into the hands of Professor Lynn of the Economic and Social Research Institute; he would certainly draw from it many of the more outrageous deductions he tends to make from time to time, not alone about the public service but about people in general.</P>
    <P>The report says:</P>
    <P>This makes the danger of deterioration the hazard of the middle career civil servant.  In many cases, at the higher levels, it may be difficult to pass over officers who have not done anything actually wrong: a promotion out of turn may give rise to suspicion of favouritism. If superior officers are not to fall back on seniority as an easy way out it is essential that they should be supported by an efficient system of assessment and appraisal of staff.  The only formal reporting systems on Civil Service staff, now in existence, are:</P>
    <P>(i)  The annual incremental certificate. Superiors are required to certify that an officer's work and conduct have been satisfactory during the previous year before he is granted his annual increment. In fact, an increment is seldom deferred.</P>
    <P>(ii)  Probationary reports.  A six-monthly report is made on each established new appointee during his first two years of service when he is on probation and he can be dismissed by his Minister if unsatisfactory.  (After he is out of probation an established officer can only be dismissed by the Government.)  In fact, we have found that it is very difficult to dispense with an officer's services even when he is on probation.</P>
    <P>(iii)  A more detailed form of <Col N="75" /> annual report on Administrative Officers is being used in the Department of Finance.  This report is not, however, tied to any service-wide systems of appraisals.</P>
    <P>(iv)  Specific reports on candidates at inter-Departmental competitions. The Department of Finance has been trying to improve this type of report.</P>
    <P>There is legitimate criticism in this report that should have occupied the attention of the Minister for Finance and his colleagues in the Cabinet since the publication of the report last September.  I fully appreciate the tremendous difficulty of consultation with staff organisations and the need for intensive internal discussions with such organisations and I appreciate the controversial aspects likely to arise on any system of improving the internal efficiency of assessment and appraisal of public service staff.  This is one of the major difficulties facing the Cabinet.  At present an appalling apathy and lethargy seem to be descending on the Government now that they are secure in their seats for another three or four years.  Perhaps because of this atmosphere one gets the impression that they could not care less provided nothing happens that will get them into trouble in the next few years.  After the great song and dance made about this report and the tremendous amount of work put into it by the Devlin group it is quite appalling that in the Financial Statement immediately following it there is very little indication of effective Government action on this matter.</P>
    <P>The report also spoke of the absence of an efficient system of assessment and appraisal of staff and said it was perhaps due to the absence of a comprehensive system of manpower planning linked to the identifying needs of the organisation.  It says:</P>
    <P>It may be that, throughout the Public Service, there is a failure to grasp the idea of manpower as a dynamic resource.  Such manpower planning as exists is on a very short <Col N="76" /> time-scale.  For general service posts&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>On a point of order.  If every Deputy is going to quote at length from the Devlin Report we will finish the Budget about July.  Surely there will be an opportunity to discuss the details of this report on the Estimate for the Department of Finance.  We could perpetuate the discussion on all the pros and cons of the Devlin Report and the Budget discussion could go on indefinitely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I submit since the report, to take one elementary aspect of it, cost somewhere in the region of £130,000 to prepare and print, that if Members of the House are not given the opportunity of commenting on it &mdash;and in view of the fact that is contained substantially in the Minister's statement&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>There will be plenty of time to comment on it on the Finance Estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure the Minister that I do not propose to delay unduly but I feel that a number of aspects of the report are worthy of general comment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I can read the whole report of NIEC on the prospects for 1970 and take up the entire debate on that basis.  It takes about three hours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister does not claim to read my intentions at this time.  I strongly commend to the Government that it should re-appraise the whole question of manpower planning in the public service.  I suggest that in respect of a great many vacancies in the public service there is not, as yet, acceptance of the need for advanced planning of manpower requirements and that this strongly impedes the effective operation of the public service. Likewise, it can hardly be taken from the statement of the Minister for Finance on this occasion that the Government are taking immediate initiatives on a matter which I submit is <Col N="77" /> very relevant : the question of the superannuation of public servants.  If the Minister suggests this it not a costly item in the Budget I can assure him he will not prevent us from commenting. I shall refrain from quoting the particular section of the report but I want to assure the Minister that, as mentioned in one paragraph of the report, &ldquo;lack of a common superannuation scheme is one of the greatest barriers to mobility across the public service; the fact that pension rights are non-transferable and lost on early retirement also prevents movement of dissatisfied staff out of the service.&rdquo;  The report continues with criticism with which we are quite familiar.</P>
      <P>I suggest that in that section of the report a further major anomaly is pinpointed which should receive the immediate attention of the Government. It could improve the internal mobility of the public service enormously.  It gives rise to a great deal of frustration from the point of view of remuneration. I am referring to improving or remedying the so-called common superannuation schemes within the service.</P>
      <P>A further major criticism is made in the Devlin Report which relates specifically, if I may say so, to the Minister. The rather alarming statement is made that there is in practice no Dáil debate on the capital Budget.  I do not suppose that the Tánaiste would suggest it is improper for me to give that quotation from the Devlin Report.  It is also stated in that report:</P>
      <P>On the capital side, the Dáil exercises no co-ordinated control comparable to that on the current side.  Voted capital services for 1969-70 amount to £52 million and, of the remainder, £66 million is to be provided from the resources of local authorities and state-sponsored bodies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Denis Francis Jones">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that in a debate like this we can have general comments but not extended quotations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that and I am curtailing myself.  In paragraph 9.3.9. of that report there is a very strong indictment of the Government <Col N="78" /> in the statement: &ldquo;There is, in practice, no Dáil debate on the capital Budget.&rdquo;  Would the Minister care to assure us as public representatives that he agrees that there should be full and effective Parliamentary reform on that particular aspect?  I suggest we should give serious consideration to the overall position relating to the capital Budget.</P>
      <P>Since the Minister objects to too many quotations I will just refer to page 120 of the Devlin Report in which it is stated :</P>
      <P>The current cost of the capital services it not shown anywhere but is hidden in a lump sum for service of public debt in the Central Fund services.  This huge expenditure on public debt services is not seen to be related to the various projects for which the debt was raised and the return to the State of its enormous investments cannot easily be calculated.</P>
      <P>That is a very strong criticism of the budgetary system which we are supposed to discuss in a coherent and rational manner in this House this evening.  Other strong criticisms are made in this report which I would have thought would have been given the immediate attention of the Government. There is a criticism of the dual structure of the departmental grades and the effect which this dual structure has on promotional prospects.  I have already referred to that.  What is the effect of this double-barrelled structure within the public service on the decision-making processes within the Government and within the various Departments?  Let us be quite brutal about it: we are talking now about the expenditure of £460 million a year, a not inconsiderable sum by any stretch of the imagination in any economy. This House is entitled to know how the decisions are made on that expenditure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this report there is a strong implication that the dual structure of decision-making within the Government and within the public service impedes the real effectiveness of these decisions.  Finally there is strong criticism of the fact that there is not in <Col N="79" /> operation in the public service an effective system of cost benefit analysis in respect of budgetary expenditure. That is a valid criticism, bearing in mind the fact that we are spending over £465 million a year.  We need to introduce into the public service a much more effective system of cost benefit analysis of various projects.</P>
    <P>These are some of the criticisms which must be made.  I want to pay tribute to the Devlin Group and to the Institute of Public Administration for holding for Members of the Oireachtas symposia and seminars on the implementation of this report.  I have no doubt that the report will be of immense benefit to Members of the House in the years ahead.  It will lead to a much more effective Dáil debate on the Budget.</P>
    <P>I do not accept, generally speaking, the provision contained in the Budget for £10 million to cover the overall cost of remunerating public servants excluding the cost of pay adjustments in the post office.  Frankly I consider this is an underestimation on the part of the Government.  I want to draw the attention of the House to this matter and say it is quite unsatisfactory for the Minister to tell the House that there will be an increase in the cost of paying public servants and that he has laid aside £10 million for it, but that he cannot say what the figure will be in regard to the post office.</P>
    <P>Half of the civil servants are in the post office.  I want to point out to the Tánaiste, who has had experience in that field, that it is quite unsatisfactory that it should be stated in the Budget that since the post office service is intended to pay its way increases will have to be met by raising post office charges rather than through increased taxation. That bald statement is contained in the Financial Statement.  I can assure the Minister that in any other country such a statement would bring down the wrath of Parliament on the head of any Cabinet Minister who had the nerve to make it without coming before the House with much more comprehensive details than we have been given on this occasion.</P>
    <P>Without being repetitive and without <Col N="80" /> being unduly loquacious or giving too many quotations, I want to refer the House to the continued paralysis within the Cabinet which is preventing them from getting to grips with a broad and cohesive incomes and prices policy in accordance with the recommendations made <i>ad nauseam</i> since the Report on Full Employment in 1965.  I do not want to belabour the Minister about what he should have done by way of written reports but I must draw the attention of the House to a number of clearcut criteria which must be considered as a matter of urgency if we are not to get&mdash;if I may quote from the NIEC report&mdash;dangerous tension building up within the economy.  The Minister is aware that on page 14 of the report it is stated:</P>
    <P>A necessary step for bringing profits within the ambit of an incomes and prices policy is that adequate information be published on the <i>aggregate</i> profits of both public and private companies and of unincorporated firms in the various sectors and industries in the economy.  Where information on profits is not available, it is more difficult for workers to feel they are full partners in production....</P>
    <P>It was further stated in the report that representatives of the trade union movement stated that in their view the disclosure of profits and certain other information concerning private companies above a certain size should be made mandatory.</P>
    <P>That report was published as an adequate advance warning; yet we have not had from the Government any expression of intention whatsoever in the Financial Statement.</P>
    <P>On page 16 of the NIEC report critical comment was made of another aspect of Irish life which deserves the urgent attention of the Minister for Finance.  The report stated:</P>
    <P>In other sectors of the economy &mdash;and especially in those that for one reason or another are sheltered from external competition&mdash;competition is weaker.</P>
    <P>These sectors supply many services which the transportable <Col N="81" /> goods industries require, and the capacity of the latter to compete with imports (or succeed with exports) depends not only on their own internal efficiency but also on the prices they have to pay for the materials and services they buy in Ireland.  Many of the services which industry requires must, by their very nature, be produced in Ireland: examples are legal and auctioneering services, building, electricity, gas and water.  These services are, and always have been, largely sheltered from external competition.</P>
    <P>There is a further comment by the NIEC:</P>
    <P>It is, therefore, important to ensure that these services will be made available as cheaply as possible to the industrial sector.  In many professions the fee structure is archaic with little evidence of adaptation to changes in the work being done. Moreover, the charging of fees on a percentage basis may result in unjustifiably large increases in fee incomes by reference to changes in the effort required....</P>
    <P>I would suggest to the Minister that this is an area of considerable sensitivity in relation to services but one which bears little indication that there is within the Government an attitude or general intention to do something in the context of a prices and incomes policy.  Until such time as we have some evidence of this intention, the Minister for Transport and Power has no cause to look so benign on television and speak so softly to the people on the need for a prices and incomes policy.  We know what has to be done; we have had five years of general economic advice on what should be done but as yet there seems to be little indication of intention on the part of the Government.  I commend all these aspects as being worthy of attention.</P>
    <P>In regard to the question of farmers' incomes, and this is referred to on page 20 of the NIEC report, I think the Minister would run away from the chapel gates in County Monaghan at 40 m.p.h. rather than discuss that particular section.  I very much doubt whether the Minister would accept <Col N="82" /> that there is a need to bring within the income taxation code&mdash;which is very narrow in this country&mdash;those sectors of the farming community. Admittedly this is not a very large group but in terms of social equity they should not be excluded from the taxation net.  Where a farmer is earning a large income&mdash;and I stress the word &ldquo;large&rdquo;, which is a matter of opinion in terms of definition&mdash;I see no social or moral justification why a farmer who makes substantial profit should not be included within the income taxation net when wage and salary earners are liable for tax under PAYE.  On that basis there are tax disparities in this country, unpopular as that may be in terms of Fianna Fáil propaganda.  I have no doubt they will say I am advocating taxing all farmers; unfortunately Fianna Fáil suffer from an overdose of economic simplicity which does not lead to a general elevation of discussion.</P>
    <P>We have evolved new forms of taxation, particularly in this Budget, and we have a dramatic increase of £110,500,000 in respect of income tax compared with £90 million last year. Turnover tax will be increased from £23 million to almost £50 million; there is the implication in the Financial Statement that we will shortly have the value added tax&mdash;in alleged preparation for EEC entry.  There are many substantial changes in the taxation system.  Therefore, I think it is a logical proposition that there should be set up once again a commission on general taxation to evaluate the tremendous developments that have taken place in the 1960s and to report objectively on future alternative taxation strategies.  I would certainly commend to the Minister that he should consider this proposition.  There is no reason why any self-respecting democracy should not have a standing select committee on the question of taxation generally.</P>
    <P>A Budget debate is not the most satisfactory way of discussing all the many considerations such as income tax, turnover tax, stamp duty, customs and excise, the role of corporation profits tax and export reliefs.  In the context of a Budget debate, when one is <Col N="83" /> supposed to speak extempore on a mass of financial detail, it is impossible to discuss all these matters and, at the same time, put forward coherent alternative policies for future taxation strategy.  A commission similar to the one that did such tremendous work in the 1950s on the matter of income taxation would be very valuable.</P>
    <P>Perhaps there is a hint of this contained in the Minister's statement in which he promised a comprehensive recasting of the general pattern of taxation and where he stated that he was taking considerable steps in that direction this year.  I dislike ambiguity as much as the Minister for Finance and also the Minister for Health and the matter should be clarified.</P>
    <P>If I may turn to the alleged social aspects of the Budget, the first point I wish to make is that contrary to the general proposition advanced by the Government that they spent a relatively greater proportion of the GNP on social services, the statistics indicate an increase of one or two per cent in some areas, and the overall impression is that the benefits have been matched by rises in the cost of living and that there have been only marginal increases in the standard of living of the beneficiaries of the system. Government expenditure on social welfare declined from 20 per cent of the total in 1959 to 15 per cent in 1969, even though in money terms it was 2½ times greater.  This is not the great change of social conscience in the seventies envisaged and promised to us with loud clapping of hands and pounding of feet at the Fianna Fáil Ard Fheis, nor does it indicate any great upsurge of social conscience on the part of our people generally.</P>
    <P>It should be brought home very emphatically to Deputies that, even though there is an increase of 17/6d a week in the contributory old age pension, there is a section of the Budget which points out that at a future date the related changes in other benefits will be further outlined.  This is a clear indication that there will not be any changes.  Taking this increase as one for a husband and wife, it is very marginal especially when one <Col N="84" /> considers dependants and the fact that the general increases are not spread throughout all dependant rates.</P>
    <P>I would equally draw the attention of the House to another major omission. It is customary and it is only fitting that there should have been some indication within the Financial Statement of the increases which are pending in respect of social insurance.  It will be recalled that almost every year for the past four or five years there have been successive increases, around 1s 10d in 1969, 1s 8d in 1968 and 1s 7d in 1967. That is roughly the magnitude of those increases.  I would imagine that next October, the increase in the stamp, at a conservative estimate, will be 2s, or perhaps it will go as high as 2s 6d.  We are entitled to clarification on this matter because it has a bearing on our system of social security.  If there is to be such an increase next October in social insurance contributory rates it will have a dramatic effect on the lower income group.  The odious, totally outdated and reactionary flat rate contributory system for social insurance imposes quite a penalty on those earning low incomes.  It is disgraceful that the Minister for Finance, Deputy Haughey, the Minister for Local Government, Deputy Boland, and the Cabinet generally have failed to come to grips with the problem of introducing a wage related system of social insurance contributions. I have not the slightest objection to somebody who is earning £2,000 or £2,500 paying £2 a week social insurance.  I see no reason why the social insurance limit of £1,200 should not be abolished.  Admittedly there are difficulties in relation to the agricultural sector of the population but I do not think that is an insurmountable obstacle to reforming the social security system.  I would strongly urge the Minister to be more explicit about the rates to be charged next October.</P>
    <P>While industrial earnings have risen by 126 per cent over the past ten years, the weekly social insurance contributions payable by an insured worker increased 4½ times, that is, from 2s 9d a week to 12s 6d a week.  That is an undesirable development.  Ten years ago the insured man's contribution represented 1½ per cent of average industrial <Col N="85" /> earnings.  Now at the beginning of 1970 it represents 3 per cent of industrial earnings.  This is not what might be expected from an equitable contributory system.  There has been a doubling of the contribution relative to the increases in earnings.  These statistics are derived from a publication which the Minister will find impeccable, &ldquo;Trade Union Information&rdquo; published by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  I have never had reason to dispute any of the data from that publication.  In 1959-60 the contributions of insured workers and employers jointly represented less than one-fifth or 19 per cent of total spending on social welfare.  This year they represent one-third or 34 per cent of social welfare expenditure.  Therefore the Government cannot maintain that they have been siphoning off more taxation into social insurance.  On the basis of those figures I would submit to the Minister that the State's contribution to the schemes of social insurance has fallen from 81 per cent to 66 per cent.</P>
    <P>Where is the great plethora of hosannas from the Minister for Social Welfare?  There has been a drop in the State's contribution towards social insurance and this drop leads me to think that the Fianna Fáil Party are not concerned with evolving a more egalitarian system of social security. Because of the impact of inflation there has not been any dramatic change in social welfare benefits.  While there has been a definite improvement a comparison is necessary here.  Average male industrial earnings in 1959 were about £9 per week, which seems amazingly small nowadays, and unemployment and disability benefit for a married man with two children was about £3 per week, which represented 33 per cent of average industrial earnings. The average industrial wage today is about £22 10s per week while unemployment and disability benefit for a married man with two children, after this Budget, will be £9 8s a week, which represents 42 per cent of average industrial earnings.  Bearing in mind the greater strength of the economy in the seventies, the substantial increases in social insurance contributions and the tremendous effort made by political <Col N="86" /> parties to increase unemployment and disability benefit I do not think a 9 per cent increase over a decade is a tremendous improvement.</P>
    <P>I should like to deal with the comments made in the Minister's speech about care of the aged.  At column 1739 of the Official Report of 22nd April, 1970, the Minister said:</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health accepts in principle the recommendation that a National Council for the Aged be established and in the meantime will appoint a social work adviser in his Department who will visit local areas and encourage the establishment or extension of voluntary agencies to take care of the aged.</P>
    <P>I welcome this development.  It has been predicted that by 1981 we shall have 372,000 people over the age of 65, which is 56,000 more than we have now.  This is going to throw a tremendous responsibility on us.  While the Minister for Health, Deputy Childers, has shown tremendous concern for this problem&mdash;he is certainly the most active Minister for Health, with the notable exception of Deputy Dr. Browne, I have ever read about in this country&mdash;a lot more must be done in relation to the care of the aged. The Budget has gone some way towards dealing with the situation and as far as I am concerned this is very welcome.</P>
    <P>A notable omission on the social side of the Budget is the lack of special allowances for blind people. Successive Governments have displayed an extraordinary stinginess in providing tax reliefs or incentive allowances for blind people.  I see no reason why some special relief or tax exemption could not have been given in this Budget to all those on the registered list of blind persons.  Such allowances and reliefs already exist in Britain and many European countries.  In Britain, for example, a blind person is allowed an additional £100 tax free on top of the tax free allowances applicable to a full-sighted person.  Where a blind person is married he gets a further £100 tax free allowance for his wife.  I have suggested to the Minister that if an additional tax free allowance is not feasible he should consider the introduction <Col N="87" /> of handicapped allowances, free of means tests, applicable to all registered blind persons.</P>
    <P>I am tired of saying to the Minister that special allowances are paid to the blind in Sweden, Denmark, the Federal Republic of Germany, Australia, New Zealand and France.  I find the statement made here that no other form of allowance, except the blind pension, is made available incomprehensible.  A blind person has many additional expenses not readily understood by many of us.  His clothing and footwear need frequent repair.  Those of us who see do not brush our clothes against wet paint.  We do not sit on dirty seats.  We certainly do not have to meet the tremendous costs of house decoration and repair which a blind person must meet.  He must pay for such an elementary job as fixing a fuse.  One has only to see the difficulties of a blind housewife doing her shopping and trying to choose foodstuffs at a reasonable price or a blind worker who must get special apparatus such as a Braille writing machine or special typewriter to realise the additional expenses involved. If a blind person uses a guide dog it costs him from £50 upwards a year.  This means £100 if both husband and wife are blind.</P>
    <P>There are many other extra expenses such as telephone costs, fuel costs because of restricted mobility, and so on.  I do not think it should require any special pleading on my part to drive home to the Government that special allowances should be given to blind persons.  Both Ministers are already aware of these circumstances.  As late as 10th April, 1970, the National League of the Blind of Ireland made special representations to the Minister. There has been very little indication in the Budget that these concessions will be given.  If the British Chancellor of the Exchequer could think of giving these reliefs in 1962 it is time we decided to do likewise now.</P>
    <P>I welcome the decision of the Government to increase children's allowances by 5s after the first two children. It is only fair and just that these allowances should be increased.  I <Col N="88" /> regard that as being worthy of approval.  However, I feel we are entering a somewhat dangerous phase in respect of children's allowances.  Within the Department of Social Welfare there appears to be a peculiar lack of awareness of and concern for child poverty and deprivation generally which is a tremendous problem in Britain.  All we do here in the Republic is to add an extra few shillings each year to children's allowances and that is that.  We do nothing else for children who are deprived, who are in dire poverty, who are deserted and so on.  These children have no votes and, as far as this generation of politicians is concerned, so far as I can gauge, are not very likely to be their special concern.  An inter-departmental committee or some form of committee should be set up by the Government because I am not impressed by the Department of Social Welfare.  I have a new regard and respect, of late, for the Department of Health but the Department of Social Welfare, not so much in terms of its secretary but in terms of the internal attitudes of the Department and the Ministers who have been in charge of it, is far from progressive.  In that context I would strongly urge the Government to consider setting up a committee which would investigate the question of children's allowances in the country and the question of special statutory allowances which would be made available for children in dire poverty, children who have been deserted and suffer from deprivation or neglect.  These aspects are not covered in the Budget.</P>
    <P>I welcome equally the provision for deserted wives in this Budget.  It is long overdue.  However, I would suggest to the Minister in an objective way that, perhaps, it is half the solution to a very serious problem.  Perhaps, this House should occasionally ponder on this aspect of human life.  It is one of the salient anomalies of this Budget that we make financial provision&mdash;which is very welcome&mdash;within the social security system for&mdash;if I might put it crudely&mdash;sweeping under the carpet the remains of family life after it has disintegrated. I would like to see, parallel with the decision of the Government <Col N="89" /> to introduce a system of payment to deserted wives, some proportion of State funds voted towards an effective national system of marriage counselling or guidance by State welfare officers. I do not particularly relish the word &ldquo;welfare&rdquo;.  This job is absolutely necessary and is invaluable from the point of view of preventing family disasters.</P>
    <P>It is not generally recognised that very often what is needed more than any kind of solemn, amateur marital psychiatry in respect of families on the point of disintegration and women who are on the point of being deserted by their husbands or vice versa, is the introduction of helpful social advice and financial guidance by trained social marriage guidance counsellors either lay, State, voluntary or otherwise. These counsellors and the money which would be devoted by the State towards the development of this elementary human service would do a great deal to prevent marital breakdowns and would do as much, in some instances, as this expenditure towards the maintenance of deserted wives and children. I say this not to minimise in any way the tremendous relief that this scheme will be for deserted wives but because it strikes me as rather odd that in a country which lays such emphasis and insistence upon the importance of developing and preserving the family and keeping it together, there should be a system of payment for deserted wives without any effective system for preventing desertion.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I strongly welcome the reference in the Financial Statement to itinerants. It is a very valuable incentive to increase from 50 per cent to 90 per cent the State subsidy to local authorities in respect of social workers employed wholly or partly on the work of rehabilitating <Col N="90" /> itinerants.  It is a singular effort on the part of the Government. I very rarely find cause to congratulate the Minister for Local Government but in regard to this provision he deserves the thanks of this House as do the Government for the attitude they have repeatedly adopted in regard to itinerancy.  The Opposition should give every possible support in this regard.</P>
    <P>In regard to the constituency that I represent, I do not know of any tangible efforts on the part of Dún Laoghaire Borough Corporation, the Bray Urban District Council or Dublin County Council to integrate the 16 families, representing 100 persons, living in South County Dublin.  This should not be an insurmountable problem.  I have been appalled by the intolerable conditions in which many of these itinerants live, conditions which cry out for action.  I have been equally appalled by the reaction of electors in some areas towards itinerant families.  The Government have done all they can do and it now remains for local authorities to undertake integration as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>I want now to refer to the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement which was referred to also by the Taoiseach. I do not think the full significance of the tariff cuts due in July next has dawned upon Irish management or Irish trade unions.  These cuts will mark the half-way stage in the elimination of tariff protection for Irish industries against imports from the United Kingdom.  I do not think the Government have as yet underlined the urgent necessity to use the time available to us to improve our competitive position.  It appears quite obvious now that the Free Trade Area Agreement must be phased in with entry to the Common Market which, it is accepted by objective political commentators, will take place in approximately 1978 or 1980, assuming the transitional period will begin in January, 1973. There is a distinct possibility that the transitional period will be prolonged into the 1980s.  My own guess is that it will certainly continue until 1980, assuming that it will be for a five or six year period.  Therefore, the Government are hoist with their own petard <Col N="91" /> in respect of the agreement because by, say, 1975, we will be bearing the full brunt of British exports to the Irish market while not obtaining very much benefit from membership of the EEC.</P>
    <P>This is one of the reasons why I would strongly support the plea by Deputy Cosgrave and by my colleagues in the Labour Party for a sharp review by the Government of the Free Trade Area Agreement and an effort to have it amended either on the basis of a longer phasing period or on valuation which would mean that the agreement might run to the 1980s and be phased in with projected entry to the Common Market.</P>
    <P>The Government are facing a serious problem in respect of tariff reduction and unless they deal with this matter urgently I can see that we will be in rather considerable economic difficulty in the years ahead.  We have already reached the point where British exporters are finding it quite profitable to increase exports to the Irish market.  One has only to glance at the foodstuffs on display in Irish supermarkets to realise the growing interest of British exporters in our home market.  The Government should pay considerable attention to the question of phasing in the final stages of the agreement with entry to the Common Market.  The agreement exists.  It is there to stay.  A very sharp review of the agreement must be undertaken by the Government.</P>
    <P>The situation arising from the British general election will have very considerable impact.  This is of direct concern to this House more particularly as the British Conservative shadow Minister of Agriculture, Mr. Godber, and, indeed, the Leader of the Conservative Party in Britain, have not made any secret of their hostility towards this country and towards the limited gains which we have under the Free Trade Area Agreement.  Frankly, it would be a matter of concern to me if either of those two gentlemen had an opportunity in June or in October of whittling away&mdash;they imply very strongly they would in fact abolish&mdash; the limited agricultural benefits&mdash;I would stress their limitation&mdash;enjoyed <Col N="92" /> by this country under the current agreement.  I assume they would abolish them because they have said so in no uncertain terms.  I would prefer to negotiate with and see re-elected in Britain, despite the ambiguity which surrounds a great deal of its policy, the Labour Party.  The employment of our emigrants would be jeopardised were they to be exposed to the rather perverse brand of racism of Mr. Enoch Powell in his attitude to the people of this country.</P>

      <P>The final matter I should like to deal with is the statement by the Government in regard to conservation.  It rather amazes me that the Minister should be so concerned with the length of my speech and with the number of my quotations because I would classify him, although I have no intention of emulating him, as one of the most loquacious Irish Government Ministers ever to occupy a Cabinet seat.  I certainly welcome the special allocation of £100,000 to be administered by the Minister for Lands in respect of conservation.  Conservation should not be the concern only of the Minister for Lands and hived off to him&mdash;as it seems to be now with a view to keeping Deputy Seán Flanagan quiet for another year&mdash;but it should be the special concern of each Minister. The Minister for Local Government has a special and a unique responsibility in respect of conservation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I see a rash of advertising hoardings marring the scenery and beauty of this country and when I see the lack of urban renewal, the lack of elementary amenities I see conservation not merely as the sole responsibility of the Minister for Lands but that of all Government Departments. It should be their direct responsibility to ensure that the haphazard kind of social development which we have witnessed <Col N="93" /> in this country in terms of our physical infrastructure should be, as far as possible, eliminated.</P>
    <P>I have deliberately refrained from commenting on aspects relating to economic planning and on the more elaborate aspects relating to an incomes policy as I propose to deal with those on the Estimate for the Department of Finance.  I feel that the one significant omission from the statement of the Taoiseach is the failure to chart for the 1970s the kind of society which we desire in relation to taxation, social security and employment in this country.  In that setting the criticisms that have been made of the Budget in regard to its lack of imagination, its extraordinary triteness of approach and its burden of conventional taxation have been well and truly justified.</P>
    <P>I do not see any attempt on the part of the Government to define the frontiers of the affluent society of Fianna Fáil in the 1970s.  Would it be too much to hope that in the 1970s the energies of this House and the minds of all our political parties would not concentrate on achieving the kind of affluent society which one sees in sectors of Britain, with its intense class structure, or on achieving the kind of society one sees in sectors of America, where $3½ million is spent on cosmetics alone, or about $20 billion a year on alcohol and tobacco, or $100 million on defence, or, indeed, the best part of $4 million on TV commercials. Indeed we should not pursue the kind of affluence which is judged on the basis of having so many drive-on and drive-off car ferries, so many drive-in banks or, for that matter, so many drive-through motorways.</P>
    <P>That is not the kind of society I want to see evolve.  As far as I and the members of my party are concerned, our prime consideration in any Budget would be to ensure that the one-third of our population who are young or very young, who are old or very old, who are temporarily or permanently disabled, who are ill or deprived, would be afforded equal rights.  Until such time as that is done the Government will have to face from these benches a good deal of criticism, much of which I would hope would be constructive.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Childers) Erskine Hamilton Childers">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I ought to say, in reference to the last observation by Deputy Desmond, that in a country where free enterprise exists the Government do not propose to try to alter the features of human society or the spiritual growth of human society.  There has been a failure to do that in quite a number of countries under the Marxist system.  We do not propose to tell people what their spiritual development will be.</P>
      <P>In relation to the comments on the Budget, it is a good thing to recall very briefly the progress that has been made over the last ten years and then examine in some detail the particular problems we face in relation to inflation at present.  It is well to remind the House that, for example, our exports in 1956 totalled £108 million and increased to £371 million in 1969 with the accompanying growth in employment and better financial circumstances that that inevitably produced.  In the past year exports of manufactured goods increased by 17 per cent over the previous year.  Agricultural exports increased by 5½ per cent, indicating further continuous progress.  It is also satisfactory to recall that although we have not yet provided sufficient employment in many areas of the country, and there is still a programme of economic development required if we are to succeed in that venture, we have the highest number of insured persons ever recorded in the history of the country&mdash;some 738,000 at a recent date.  It is equally good to record the fact that the increase in employment in the non-agricultural sphere in 1969 totalled 16,000 persons over the figure for 1968, which meant there was a presumed increase in our population of about 4,000 persons having allowed for emigration and for those who left the land in the way they are doing in all countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is equally satisfactory to note that in spite of the difficulties of inflation the real gross national product rose by the amount that had been projected in the Third Programme&mdash;3¾ per cent. The evidence of inflation can be seen in the enormous growth of the gross national product since 1958, which compares well with a number of European <Col N="95" /> countries, of about 140 per cent which was diminished by increased living costs and inflation to a net 50 per cent.  Even that can be regarded as a figure which places us among the developing nations of the world.  It is interesting to note that one of the reasons for that great growth has been the fact that some 11 years ago just one-quarter of the gross national product came from industry and that now one-third of our total production is the result of great industrial development and a great number of factories having been started.</P>
    <P>There has been an enormous growth in capital formation over the last ten years.  It is interesting to note in relation to the public capital programme for housing that this was some £10 million ten years ago and in the coming year it will be £35 million, which is over three times the amount.  Of still greater importance in the sense that the growth of industry produces the funds for housing, the public capital programme for industrial development about ten years ago was running somewhere between £1 million and £2 million.  In the coming year the public capital development in relation to industry will be £36 million&mdash;again illustrating progress.  As an illustration of the growth of social welfare services, I could mention my own Department. I do not think it has been realised yet that the cost of the health services was £16 million ten years ago and in the coming year it will be £55 million. Allowing for inflation, increases in wages and salaries and increases in the cost of materials used in the hospitals, the actual value of the increase for the health services has doubled in the period and indicated a campaign of what might be described as transfer payments and the collection of taxation and rates in order to afford better health services.</P>
    <P>Finally, as an example of progress, one might quote the fact that in 1966 the number of houses built each month was 848.  This rose to 1,165 or almost 14,000 houses in the year.  It is hard to give an impression of what almost 14,000 houses mean.  One rather imaginative comparison is that <Col N="96" /> it represents the replacement of all the dwellings in the whole of some counties. It represents rebuilding in one year one-half of all the residential dwellings in Cork city.  That is quite a lot of houses, thinking in human terms like that.  We are making progress.</P>
    <P>I come now to the serious question of inflation which has been raised many times in the Budget debate by Deputies.  This question has also been raised outside the House.  It is true that we have a serious element of inflation. We had it before and we overcame the difficulties which arose.  I suppose one of the best illustrations of inflation is the fact that in March, 1969, compared with March, 1968, earnings rose by 12 per cent gross and in real terms, after allowing for the increase in the cost of living, by 6 per cent.  That is due to the fact that the public do not seem to realise there is an inevitable rule and an inevitable sequence to the increase of earnings over and above productivity.  In this and every other country this produces increases in the cost of living so that a great deal of the increase in wages and salaries is lost.  People can be told in advance how much they will lose.  They know that loss is absolutely inevitable.</P>
    <P>It is a sign of social and economic progress if people look all at once for very much higher standards of living even though they are not justified by the actual growth in production.  It is important to point out that since 1958 earnings in transportable goods industries rose by about 120 per cent. They have risen by 50 per cent since 1964.  During the same period, 1958-1969, the cost of living went up by about 50 per cent and from 1964 to 1969 by about 27 per cent.  One can see that the great majority of people are about 50 per cent better off in real terms than they were ten or 11 years ago having allowed for the increases that have taken place in the cost of living.  I do not think that is unsatisfactory progress.  If the figures for other European countries are examined it will be seen that there has been a very great measure of improvement in standards of living due to the growth of industry and to the growth of productivity. That being the case, it is quite fair to ask everybody to think very <Col N="97" /> seriously about the proposals being made by the NIEC in relation to a prices and incomes policy because there has been very great progress in the growth of real living standards.</P>
    <P>An illustration of the kind of inflation which has taken place recently, and which is very undesirable, is that the cost of living went up by 11 per cent from February, 1968, to November, 1969, whereas from 1964 to 1968 it only went up by 17 per cent.  Something unusual has happened.  There has been a very turbulent demand for increases in incomes which does not seem to relate to what is commonsense and to what is required if we are to continue to make progress.</P>
    <P>The financial comparison with what has taken place in other countries deserves to be dealt with.  The base year for earnings per hour is 1963.  The earnings in the United Kingdom went up 50 per cent.  In France they went up by 61 per cent and by 46 per cent in Italy.  Here they went up 71 per cent, although there was not anything in our economic life that justified such a bound in incomes.  It did not reflect itself as far as the economy was concerned because the workers were not able to benefit: the increases were inevitably lost by increases in the cost of living that took place in this and in every country.</P>
    <P>Again, there is an illustration of the difficulties we face in the figures given in the NIEC report to the effect that the productivity per man hour in 1969 rose by 2½ per cent while earnings increased by 13 per cent.  If we are facing free trade, entry to the EEC, that deterioration in the wage unit cost output cannot continue.  If it does we will be in considerable trouble.  The hour wage cost went up by double the rate the British cost went up, and our goods have to compete with theirs.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to the adverse trade balance of £60 million in the past year.  This no doubt is a serious figure but it must be associated with the huge inflow to the country of £66 million, including great sums by way of capital equipment.  It must be related to the fact that when we had an inflationary period in 1955 we had <Col N="98" /> an adverse balance of payments of £35 million in relation to total exports of £108 million, whereas on this occasion, although admittedly we have a problem, there is an adverse balance of payments of £60 million in relation to exports totalling £371 million.</P>
    <P>It is to be noted at the same time that, because of the very great inflow of capital payments, the net external assets of the banking system have remained comparatively stable, not having varied from between £290 million and £297 million during the last three years.  If the external assets of the banking system were collapsing rapidly, the Government would have had to undertake far harsher measures than they have undertaken.</P>
    <P>Again, if one looks at the list of imports, there is the fairly satisfactory feature that though total imports are too great in relation to exports the proportion of consumer goods ready to use has been reasonable.  If we look at the categories of goods, really enormous increases could be regarded as undesirable in respect of such items as consumption goods ready to use.  It is satisfactory to note, however, that consumption goods ready to use last year represented between 22 per cent and 23 per cent of the total value of imports, whereas some ten years ago the figure was 21 per cent.  Therefore, excessive imports are not associated in any material way with goods not manufactured here which are ready to use. The proportion of producer capital goods to total imports is 19 per cent whereas ten years ago it was 12 per cent.  Ten years ago, materials for industry represented 57 per cent and the figure is now 52.9 per cent, presumably because there is more making up of materials at various stages by new industries in this country.</P>
    <P>In mentioning these facts I do not wish to underrate the difficulty in relation to inflation and the balance of payments.  However, everybody seems to have failed to notice that we have already taken some steps to control inflation.  The Central Bank, through the banking credit system, has to maintain the circulation of credit to a point which should result in the balance of payments being only £50 million this <Col N="99" /> year.  This means that the increase being permitted is less than it was in 1968.  As well, we have quite severe hire purchase restrictions.  The Government have reduced capital programme expenditure to a level at which they would like to have it.  While preserving economic growth through the money we spend, current expenditure has been cut to the last possible penny and we propose to watch the situation.</P>
    <P>Deputies have suggested that the Budget should have been harsher. Deputy O'Higgins quite clearly suggested it and Deputy Desmond said there should have been a very much harsher Budget&mdash;that we should have imposed much higher taxation and imposed a greater credit squeeze than we have done.  I suppose the answer to it is that, in spite of everything the economists have been stating in the newspapers, it is a question of timing. Is there some sacred moment when one must take harsh measures, or does one watch the situation?  I do not think we can be criticised if we decide to watch the situation and I see no reason why we should have clamped on harsher measures.  Indeed the economists are now mending their hand in the newspapers by agreeing that it is a question for argument at which point of time you take harsh measures or whether you should watch the situation, as we are doing.</P>
    <P>It is very difficult to judge how to control inflation.  Countries with very good economic advisers have made mistakes in the control of inflation by taking measures either too late or too severe.  In north Europe during the past ten years practically every country has had an inflationary period to face in one form or another.  Mistakes have been made.  There has been controversy among economists in each country and the position was corrected to the extent that it more or less righted itself. They are countries which run their economies with reasonable intelligence.</P>
    <P>The idea that it is always possible to protect against inflation is not true. I will not go into detail about the appalling situation that arose in the case of Great Britain.  With all the economic advice in the world, they faced almost economic disaster.  They <Col N="100" /> had all the measures for economic control, all the devices through which they could control the economy.</P>
    <P>We hope, as I have said, to watch the situation.  I wish to make it clear that, in watching the situation and in limiting our present activities to restrain inflation to those I have already mentioned, we will assume in relation to wage and salary demands that come in the shape of new agreements which will arise during the current year, that those concerned will occasionally read the NIEC report on incomes and prices and consider everything that has been said by Ministers, and by the Opposition in many cases, before they make the kind of exaggerated demands that can only make harsher measures necessary.</P>
    <P>The other element we have to watch is the question of savings.  There have been very big increases in interest both in 1968 and 1969 and, allowing for part of those increases being inevitably eaten up by increases in the cost of living, it should be possible for everybody to think of saving, particularly now that we are offering the new form of savings certificate with an interest rate of 9 per cent.  If a more moderate demand is made for increases in incomes the value of money will not decrease so rapidly, and if the value of money does not decrease so rapidly it will be more worthwhile for people to save, particularly, as I have said, since we have improved the arrangements for saving.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I am coming to that. I wish to make it perfectly clear that we do not have to have any harsher measures.  The Government's decision will depend on the trend arising from the growth of incomes consequent on still further demands over and above those that are in the pipeline and the growth of the savings.  It is time for everybody to face reality with regard to inflation.  Why do people go on putting up the cost of living quite deliberately?  I wish to reject all of the suggestions by members of the Labour <Col N="101" /> Party that the Government are not controlling prices and that it is not necessary for prices to increase when earnings increase.  I challenge the Labour Party to examine the entire structure of what happens when the cost of living goes up in any civilised country in Europe and to see if there is any difference in the rate of increase in the cost of living here compared with the rate of increase of earnings.  If they can find any exceptional difference I shall be interested to hear it.  I would like to give two comparative figures in this regard under the Labour Government of the United Kingdom.  In that country, wages and salaries increased by 35 per cent from 1964 to 1968 and the cost of living increased by 22.7 per cent while in this country wages and salaries increased by 35.6 per cent and retail prices increased by 16.9 per cent.  Perhaps members of the Labour Party think that the Ministers in the Labour Party in England were totally neglectful of their duties, but this is an example.  In fact, I would have expected the cost of living in this country to have increased a good deal more than it did because there is a clear indication that this occurs in other countries with strongly interventionist private enterprise plus socialist administration and the same facts can be found elsewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I might add that for the same period incomes went up by 38 per cent in the United Kingdom and by 31.5 per cent here.  What is interesting about these two facts is that the United Kingdom was brought to the edge of disaster from failure to control inflation.  So far, we have escaped that situation and our position now is not anything like as serious as it was at one time in Great Britain.  Those who wish to live on public opinion have only to look at the actual facts in countries that might be described as having reasonably civilised economic structures to find the relationship of wage and salary increases to the cost of living.  They are more or less comparable; if in any one country there are more labour intensive industries there may be a slight change; but if the average cost of labour as a percentage of the total cost of production is 50 per cent, as it is in quite a number of countries, they <Col N="102" /> will see that the same changes are more or less taking place.  Although one country may be, perhaps, a little less stringent in price control than another, the main fact is that these increases in the cost of living will take place inevitably as long as we continue not to follow the golden rule that general increases in income should be the same as the general income of productivity.</P>
    <P>Obviously, while this is only a general guideline and does not mean that any sector of the community who are very badly paid should not get a special increase provided this can be done without repercussions right through to the top level salaries, it does mean that people on an average basis have been left behind in the demand for increased wages.  It should not mean this so long as the general pattern is preserved.  In other words, what is the point of getting an increase of 12 per cent if, year after year, this, in real terms, amounts to only 6 per cent because the cost of living is increasing?  Why not get 6 or 7 per cent and benefit by the entire amount?  This is a lesson that quite a number of countries have learned over a period of years.  Quite a number of countries, too, have observed the rules. In any country where the rules were observed, such as Switzerland, West Germany or the Netherlands is there any evidence to show that workers have found that in the long run they have a lower standard of living than the standard enjoyed by workers here? The reason for this is quite simple. First of all, there is restraint in increases in the cost of living, the value of savings is maintained to a satisfactory degree&mdash;and savings are an essential part of our civilisation.  People on incomes save for many purposes. They save for house purchase, for marriage, for retirement and for other reasons and it is in order to encourage savings that we have made savings worthwhile.</P>
    <P>We had had an increase in the cost of living of some 7 per cent in 1969 as compared with 1968.  In Germany the increase was less than 3 per cent, while in Switzerland it was only 2½ per cent. I should like any Deputy to give me facts and figures to prove that the standard of living of the Swiss or of the Germans was unduly depressed in <Col N="103" /> 1969 because of their observance of the golden rule in relation to incomes and productivity, as a result of which their cost of living increased by only 2½ or 3 per cent.  Switzerland is one of the most prosperous countries in the world. It has become prosperous mainly because the guidelines were almost entirely kept by the Swiss people through careful and intelligent wage and salaries negotiations in which the economic facts were examined at great length and in which the employers gave the necessary facts to the trade unions, following which agreements were made. Anybody who lived in Switzerland at the end of the war and who still lives there will tell you that he suffered nothing by keeping to an incomes policy, even though there were certain exceptions in various years.</P>
    <P>I suppose it might be well to place some comparative figures on the records of the House so that people can judge the situation.  From 1963 to 1969 industrial earnings in West Germany increased by 50 per cent and the cost of living increased by 24 per cent in that period.  They had a period of inflation and they seem now to have got it under control.  Earnings in this country went up by 71 per cent and the cost of living by 34 per cent in the same period. Everyone can see the inevitable ratio of the cost of living to increases in earnings and, if that is related to the growth of productivity, it will be found that economists in general are right. The strange thing is that the steady growth of inflation that we have had is not really a matter for argument so far as the economists are concerned, but socialists, capitalists, and all others agree about the preservation of the guidelines and there exists in certain countries a sort of emotional approach which says that one must never obey the guidelines for fear one may lose something one might otherwise gain. I think this is a very foolish approach.</P>
    <P>I come now to the question of profits.  I have thought for some time that one of the things the Department of Finance should do is to make a closer examination of profits than they have hitherto done.  I say, without any hesitation, that if profits in general in 1969 increased by 11.6 per cent over <Col N="104" /> 1968, and after allowing for the amount that would be used for further investment and the tax paid, I do not think any group of workers could consider that to be excessive particularly when it relates to the growth in the number of industries in the country and to new production.  It does not relate to the same number of factories or the same turnover of business; it relates to a growth in the actual number of factories and the figure of 11.6 per cent, therefore, has to be looked at from that point of view.  If those who are trying to create unease and envy in the minds of those looking for higher wages and salaries would look into this a little further they would find that the share of the national income allocated to employees in the non-agricultural sector was 49.7 per cent of the national income in 1958 and 57 per cent of the national income in 1968. So far as that fact is concerned, there is no evidence that a great many companies are making grossly excessive profits and taking more out of the pool of income than they were ten years ago.  The amount is, in fact, diminishing.</P>
    <P>Another statement made in the green book, <i>National Income</i>, is that the income from trades, profits, rents and professional earnings has remained one-fifth of the total national income over a long period.  Although there may be excessive profits or excessive fees charged by this, that or the other professional group&mdash;I have no evidence of this but I am taking the whole lot collectively&mdash;there is no reason for people deliberately to deprive themselves of better opportunities for employment and for saving by making demands for salaries and wages, half of which will be lost in increased living costs solely because they suspect people here and there, in this or that part of the country, of taking some huge amount out of the total income pool and seeking to get the same amount, even though they will eventually lose half of it anyway.  There is a perfectly clear statement made about our national statistics which shows that the income from trades, profits, rents and professional earnings has remained for at least nine or ten years at one-fifth of the total national income.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I bulk these together. My argument is that, even if there are certain small groups who have managed to get for themselves higher incomes than would be desirable, I do not see why that should compel the general body of salary and wage earners to make demands which will result in the general savings of the community losing their value and they themselves losing half of what they gain in increased living costs.  I honestly do not see the point.  It seems to me to be an extreme attitude which will get no one anywhere.</P>
      <P>
        <i>The Irish Times</i> gave a list of profits which, before interest and tax, represented 11.5 per cent of the capital invested.  I made investigations and I asked economists about this and, as far as I can gather, that rate of profit is not in the least excessive and does not suggest everybody should scamper for inflation just because they believe others are making excessive profits.</P>
      <P>Quite obviously the NIEC appreciate this and they made a statement in which they said there should be reasonable profits and that profits should accrue.  They pointed out that the rate of profit in various industries varies according to the efficiency of the industry and the capital employed.  They pointed out that profits were a major source of funds for investment.  I should like to hear those who hold that profits are excessive in this country make a comparison with other countries which have social welfare legislation and a social welfare system such as we have here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The value of not having an incomes policy is that, first of all, we avoid having to introduce measures when there is inflation and, secondly, as I have indicated, it maintains the value of savings.  That is something which should be thought of immediately one thinks of increases in salaries and wages.  People should ponder how that would affect the value of the savings for housing, for instance, for their children and for their own retirement. People have not yet begun to do that. This will also increase employment.  If people would think in terms of total <Col N="106" /> family income they would find that, over a period of five years, there has been far greater real spending.  If they would accept the guidelines there would be far more employment.</P>
    <P>We are all agreed on the concept of new industries.  If people would accept the guidelines we would have far more industries, particularly industries in which costs are of very great significance. With far more industries we would have a much more prosperous country and our economic growth could have been even greater if the rules had been kept and if people had thought of family life as a whole, of opportunity of employment for children reaching the ages of 16, 17 and 18. In a climate in which the guidelines were adhered to, as they were in Switzerland and Germany, I am quite certain we would have seen greater industrial development and a greater growth of trade.  Although we have had reasonable economic stability&mdash;we are regarded as one of the most credit-worthy countries in Europe&mdash;we would have had greater economic stability.</P>
    <P>I do not believe it is necessary to point out the obvious: people can see for themselves the results of inflation.  If there is a 7 or 8 per cent increase in salaries and wages and then the cost of housing goes up, that has an immediate effect on the lower income groups.  I should like to repeat here what the Minister said: gross inflation means that those who already receive higher wages and salaries over and above a growth of productivity will have to pay year by year more and more taxation.  If we believe in continuing to do what we did in the Budget last year, and in this Budget, namely, look after the lower income groups by increased social welfare payments, increased children's allowances and follow the example we set in the public sector in regard to increasing the wages in the lower income groups, we will have to go on doing this.  I do not mean we should not increase social welfare payments, but the extent to which they are affected depends purely on, first of all, compensating for the effect of inflation on those with lower incomes, many of whom are not so well organised and are not able to get <Col N="107" /> the kind of increases those who are particularly well organised can command.</P>
    <P>So that nobody can reasonably say that I have either overestimated or underestimated the situation I should like to repeat what I have said already. We have the hire purchase arrangements, the bank credit restrictions; we have a limitation of current and capital expenditure which we felt was wise.  We look first at the international situation in general and the terms of trade which we cannot completely predict for this year.  We look for a moderation of attitude by asking people to try for two or three years the experiment suggested by the National Industrial Economic Council.  We have suggested that the trade unions should get together to consider the proposal; that the employers should get together and do likewise and that the employers should consider, as Deputy Desmond said, whether there should not be more participation in this kind of venture by giving more information on prices and profits and more effort at persuading the people who receive salaries and wages that they have been getting their fair share of the growth of prosperity and that all this should be examined in the general climate of whatever guideline is presented by the NIEC for these negotiations.  We suggest it is worthwhile to have this experiment if we are to avoid inflation.</P>
    <P>We have been asked, what more? The answer is that if, as a result of what I have already said, plus evidence of moderation in respect of incomes and its effect on prices, savings are not sufficient, and if the exports and imports during the year show a continuous deterioration over and above our target of £50 million adverse trade balance, if there should not be a reduction of capital imported goods, in that situation we shall have to reconsider the matter.  The fact that we have decided to do this later in the year is our own decision.  I do not see why we should do it now.  I grant that this is an arguable matter.</P>
    <P>I do not want to go on repeating what I regard as a matter of very great importance, that as soon as possible <Col N="108" /> these NIEC plans should be examined. Nobody has a long memory in this country.  We think from day to day.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy FitzGerald will know, if you go back to the almost forgotten period of 1958-1961 there was a very remarkable economic growth in exports and everything else. If I remember correctly the cost of living for those three years went up by 17 per cent and earnings went up by something like 13 per cent.  It was a remarkable example of how we were keeping the rules.  I do not think the people were particularly disappointed or frustrated when they were able to keep nearly the whole value of the increases they got in incomes.  In the next three years the rules were broken.  I can remember the figures. From 1961-1964 earnings went up by 28 per cent but because productivity did not go up the average increase in earnings was again only about 14 per cent.  In the meantime we entered on a period of inflation.</P>
      <P>I hope I have spoken reasonably.  I want to make it clear that quite evidently the employers have an equal responsibility with the unions for engaging in this exercise with the NIEC.  Quite evidently, prices must be restrained within reasonable limits. Obviously, the Minister for Industry and Commerce must continue to keep his hand on the pulse of price levels by examining demands for increases in prices at all times.  We accept that absolutely.  Quite evidently, employers should go as far as they can towards giving the workers the feeling that negotiations can be meaningful.  If we can get this new system adopted I think we can make progress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, people ask why we did not do this before.  All of this must be voluntary.  Perhaps when the economic history of this period is written the Government will be judged harshly for not having made some specific proposal before about this matter.  We have talked about it, and although it was occasionally put into the Fine Gael policy during a general election, nobody has really fought for an incomes <Col N="109" /> policy, taking all the Members of the House&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Before coming to the Budget itself I should like to stand back from the present situation and try to set it in context.  We are at the beginning of a decade and for various reasons this particular time may be a time when changes will occur and are occurring in our economy which may make the seventies a different period economically and in other ways from the sixties.  As the Minister for Health said, and has said frequently, we have over the last ten years made considerable economic progress.  Over this period the economy has grown at a rate of something like 4 per cent. It is not spectacular.  Possibly it is somewhat less than that achieved in Western Europe as a whole but it <Col N="110" /> is very close to the European average and it compares so favourably with the failure of economic growth in the 1950s, which I may say persisted just as much in the period of Fianna Fáil Government as in that of the inter-Party Government, that we have naturally felt ourselves to be in a better and a different situation.</P>
      <P>We have not, I think, drawn conclusions from this that we should have drawn and this is the lesson that must be hammered home in this House. Again and again I have tried to point out that we have failed to adjust. Particularly this Government have failed in their attitudes and policies to respond to this new situation.  In a sense, they have been taken by surprise by the economic growth of this period. They did not expect to find themselves in this situation.  This was for reasons largely outside their competence.  We all know that what launched this was the First Programme.  We all know from the appendix to the First Programme that it was not the idea of the present Government, nor was the content attributable to the Government but to their advisers.  The impetus came from them as did the advice.  The Government had the courage at that time not only to adopt this programme but to publish the advice given to them and they deserve credit for doing so.  We know from that the extent to which we owe a debt to certain public servants in this respect.</P>
      <P>But, presented with this bonanza in the early sixties, the Government failed, and have persistently failed since then, to adapt themselves to the situation.  It is remarkable that we are here today, ten years later, and Government policies in such fields as the provision of drainage and sewerage facilities for towns and cities, the provision of housing and water supplies, are policies which would have been inadequate ten years ago and are incredibly inappropriate at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Throughout this whole period the Government acted as if they could not believe their luck in facing this economic growth and as if it was something that might go away in the morning: that it would be a great mistake to accept its existence and do anything <Col N="111" /> about planning to utilise it or planning to face the problems it would create.  Government attitudes, on the whole, have been those of expecting stagnation to recur and not facing up to the problems of growth.  One cannot stress this too much because, in this House by the tone of our utterances, I think we can push the Government into action, embarrass them into action, if we keep hammering away at certain areas where the Government have failed.  It is right that we should do that.</P>
    <P>I now want to consider the seventies rather than the sixties.  The Minister for Health said&mdash;I thought it was remarkably inappropriate&mdash;that we have short memories.  In the context of what he said this is probably true.  It is right that we do not remember clearly enough the particular years he mentioned.  It is right that for a brief period we did secure economic growth without price increases or income increases, but to say that people in this country have short memories is something that could be said only by somebody who does not listen to much that is said in this House.</P>
    <P>I do not think we should dwell all the time on the past.  We should consider where we are going.  I should like to consider this question of the economic growth in the seventies.  If we adapted ourselves to change, if we were prepared to tackle energetically the problems of growth, if the resistance to change to be found everywhere &mdash;and I am afraid most of all in the public service and the Government&mdash; could be overcome, we could not only secure the benefits of economic growth, some of which we have not secured by a failure to face the problems it created in the sixties, but we could also I believe secure an acceleration of economic growth.</P>
    <P>If we could overcome our present difficulties and if we could, above all, overcome the problems of which the Minister for Health spoke towards the end of his speech, problems connected with the growth of incomes&mdash;and particularly when we overcome the problems associated with the freeing of trade both with Britain and the EEC &mdash;in the latter part of the seventies we <Col N="112" /> could find ourselves in a period of significantly rapid growth.</P>
    <P>I want to stress this because it is right that we should contrast on the one hand the prospects that lie ahead of us, the very real possibility of a very real continuing and perhaps accelerated betterment of the conditions of our people, with what in fact looks like happening because of the way things are now going.  It is perhaps only by contrasting the disastrous consequences of present policies and attitudes, not alone on the part of the Government but on the part of many sections of the community, with what could come about if we and the Government were prepared to act in a more responsible manner, that we can measure how unfortunate present policies are, how dangerous they are and how important it is that they should be changed.</P>
    <P>I believe this 4 per cent growth rate can be accelerated.  There are certain basic almost arithmetic reasons for this.  We all know that in our economy at present&mdash;and, indeed, this will be true in the future except perhaps for a short period while we adjust to the Common Market conditions&mdash;the growth of industrial output is far more rapid than the growth of agricultural output.  As a result of this, between 1957 and 1970 industrial output has grown from less than that of agriculture to twice that of agriculture.  This means that the agricultural sector although growing slowly, and very slowly, is diminishing in relative importance.</P>
    <P>As time goes on, even if indefinitely the growth rates of these two sectors remained individually unchanged, even if we went on for the next ten, 15 or 20 years with a 1 per cent growth rate in agriculture, which is an optimistic assessment of what has been attained over the past ten, 15 or 20 years, and with a 7 per cent growth rate in industry, which is what we have attained roughly over the past ten years, the arithmetic consequences of these two separate growth rates would be an acceleration of national growth because, as time went on, the faster growth rate in the case of industry would itself, as it has been doing, <Col N="113" /> expand the industrial sector so that a bigger and bigger sector of the economy would be benefiting from the higher growth rate and a relatively smaller sector would be suffering from the slow growth rate of agriculture.</P>
    <P>Therefore, even if nothing changed, even if we went on as we have been going, with agriculture barely securing any increase in output but with industry forging ahead at a rate which has been throughout this period on the whole satisfactory we would, in fact, tend in time to secure a faster national growth rate.  If, in addition to this, several other things happened, this acceleration in economic growth could be even faster.</P>
    <P>If we become members of the European Economic Community, during the period of transition we will face changes which on the industrial side will tend to slow down growth and on the agricultural side will tend to accelerate it.  I suspect myself that there will be several years during which the net effect of these changes will be adverse but, after that period, there will be a period during which the effects of the agricultural policy of the EEC will continue to operate, after we have overcome the difficulties in the industrial sector.  I can see, therefore, a period in the latter part of the 'seventies when industrial growth will be at least at its present rate and, at least for some years as we adjust to the quite different level of output appropriate to the much higher level of prices in the EEC, our agricultural growth rate can be significantly higher.</P>
    <P>At the same time, the continued growth of savings is giving us a bigger amount to invest.  The proportion of national output available for investment is rising, nothing like half fast enough for the increased demands of investment but rising nonetheless and, as the years go by, and as we invest a higher and higher proportion of our national output this, in turn, should tend to yield a higher growth rate.  These are factors working in our favour.  There is another factor.  I have not referred to the acceleration in the growth of foreign investment as a result of the activities of the IDA with growing success.  These factors together <Col N="114" /> should yield us over the ten years ahead an accelerated rate of growth moving towards, even if not quite attaining, the kind of growth which the Report on Full Employment of the NIEC visualised as being likely to give us full employment by 1980.  That, I think, is an optimistic target.  We could conceivably be in sight of full employment as we enter the 'eighties.  That is a rational and fair and perhaps somewhat optimistic view of what could lie ahead.</P>
    <P>I do not think anyone, economist or serious politician, or any observer of our economy, could at this stage have anything but fear lest this vision of the future be destroyed in the years immediately ahead.  It is striking that, at the very moment when we can look forward at last to a longer-term possibility of going a long way towards solving our economic problems, we proceed under the guidance of the Government to wreck these prospects, to undermine the growth which we have achieved and create in our country a situation much more serious than anything we have experienced economically since the foundation of the State.</P>
    <P>The trends that we see at work at present are of more fundamental danger to this economy even than the Economic War and could lead to a crisis more serious than that of 1956 to 1958.  They are self-imposed.  It is not that there is a world inflation that has got out of hand and we are caught up in it and can do nothing about it. That was true, I think, in 1951 in the period of the Korean War inflation. Indeed, in 1957 our position was aggravated by the Suez War and the closure of the Suez Canal, but not to a very significant degree.</P>
    <P>Today, however, we have no such excuse.  Of course, other countries have problems.  Of course, there are certain inflationary pressures elsewhere, but they are not a significant factor in our problems.  The simple fact is that our economy is well on the way to being wrecked.  If it is in that position it is we ourselves who have brought it about and by &ldquo;we ourselves,&rdquo; I mean this country under the guidance of the Government.  I am not saying that the <Col N="115" /> entire direct responsibility for this critical situation rests with the Government. Of course, it does not.  Every group in the community must carry some of the blame.</P>
    <P>First of all, the Government are the Government, and the Government of the day must take responsibility. Secondly, for much of the direct cause of our present situation and certainly for the failure to correct it, the blame rests squarely and fairly on the shoulders of the Government.  It is not that the Government lacked economic advice.  It is not that they got conflicting advice.  One could see a Government, torn between the conflicting views of economists telling them to go in different directions, shrugging their shoulders and making up their minds as best they could to go their own way.</P>
    <P>One could sympathise with such a Government but I do not recall any time in this country since I became interested in economics when the unanimity of the advice given to the Government has been so great.  Nor do I recall any time when the rejection of this advice by a Government was so absolute.  That is the position in which we find ourselves.  I should like to set what I have to say against that background, a background of very real hope of the solution of our economic problems within ten or 15 years and the prospect that, just as it appears on the horizon, it is likely to be wrecked by irresponsibility on the part of the Government and, indeed, much of the rest of the community as well.</P>
    <P>Let us consider in that context the Budget which was presented to us.  I intend to speak of the Budget in economic terms.  I would not for one moment deny that there are good things in the Budget.  Of course, there are. Most of the benefits in the Budget are not only to be applauded in their own right but are, in many cases, well judged and well balanced. In fact, as a Budget for another year it could be a very good Budget.  Even in this year, if the Government had been prepared to pay for the benefits, or to require the people to pay for the benefits they <Col N="116" /> are lashing out, the Budget might not perhaps be open to so much criticism. It is not that this Budget has been enormously over-generous in what it gives away but rather that the failure to balance the Budget and the over-optimistic attitude adopted creates serious dangers.</P>
    <P>Let us consider the background to the Budget.  What kind of situation has led up to this and why are we where we are?  I was amused listening to the Minister for Health; he spent the first part of his speech telling us why the Government should ignore the NIEC Report No. 28 dealing with the economy and he pointed out that the Government could not be tied down by the NIEC or the economists, and then he said that we must all do what the NIEC Report No. 27 told us to do.  I do not think he was conscious of the contrast; there were two parts of his speech which should have been made by two different people.  They certainly were not reconcilable with each other by any standards.</P>
    <P>In the NIEC Report No. 28&mdash;which the Minister did not dwell on and to the views of which he does not defer&mdash; reference is made to what the NIEC had stated the previous year.  The NIEC then concluded that further action by way of fiscal or monetary policy and/or new approaches in the growth in money incomes would be appropriate in 1969 to restrain the growth in domestic demand.  Even at that stage the NIEC were calling for some restraint.  A sharply deflationary policy was not needed because action taken in time need not be drastic. The NIEC reported that disappointingly little was achieved in the course of the year.  That is indeed an epitaph for the work of the Government in a vital year.</P>
    <P>The NIEC stated that for the financial year 1969-70 fiscal policy was, on balance, expansionary.  This was in a situation where the Government were advised that a mildly deflationary policy was advisable, where we should have been cutting back slightly to keep things under control.  The NIEC stated that the increase in public capital expenditure was of the same order in 1969-70 as in 1968-69; there was no <Col N="117" /> moderation in the growth of public capital expenditure and last year's Budget tended to offset the deflationary impact of the November, 1968, measures.  The NIEC said in polite terms what some of us have been saying from platforms in more political tones in recent months: that the November, 1968, measures taken by the Government, possibly even too harsh at that time, were not followed up and reinforced by the April, 1969, Budget.  On the contrary, the Government sabotaged their own measures by introducting an inflationary Budget in April, 1969, and there need be no doubt as to the reason.  It was because we were immediately before a general election.  There is clear condemnation of this in the NIEC Report.  They remark also that Government guidelines for money incomes were announced in 1969 but they seemed to have had little effect.  The reason for this, of course, is that they were not followed up by the Government.  Nothing was done about the inflationary momentum that continued in 1969 and there was no attempt to deal with the situation.</P>
    <P>That is a brief description of the NIEC's report of what happened during the year.  It has led to a situation where they felt obliged to call for pretty drastic deflationary action&mdash; possibly too drastic.  All the various reports we have had recommending that the Government should take action to bring the situation under control vary in tone.  The document issued by the Department of Finance, while it is not very explicit on what needs to be done and does not alert people to the dangers, displays undue optimism; on the other hand, the NIEC may be erring too much on the side of deflation. A balance must be maintained but when one speaks of a balance one is talking of a balance between different degrees of deflation.  However, the Government have inflated the economy in a Budget which clearly is likely to have a deficit rather than a surplus.</P>
    <P>What kind of advice did the Government get?  They got advice from various sources.  Of course the Department of Finance are more inhibited in their document; they could not state in advance of the Budget what they thought <Col N="118" /> should be done, especially when dealing with a Government who are quite capable of rejecting advice.  The Department adopted a roundabout approach.  First, they set up an Aunt Sally in the form of the kinds of things that might happen to the economy if everything went well.  They started off by telling us about the excessive increases in incomes and then said&mdash; as if they did not know what had been happening in the last few months &mdash;that if the Government's norm of 7 per cent for the first year of a new agreement were accepted for agreements falling due for renewal in 1970 the resulting increase in 1970 in non-agricultural wages, salaries and pensions, allowing for wage drift, increased employment and carry-over of awards made in 1969, would be of the order of 11 per cent.  Allowance for a moderate rise in agricultural incomes and a slower rise than in 1969 outside agriculture should result in an increase of consumer expenditure of 9 per cent and a rise in consumer prices of 4½ to 5 per cent.  On these assumptions, particularly the acceptance of the Government's norm of 7 per cent, the balance of payments deficit would be significantly smaller than in 1969 and should not exceed £50 million.</P>
    <P>However, should the pattern laid down by the maintenance men's settlement become general throughout the economy&mdash;as if they did not know that this had happened&mdash;the effects, in the absence of corrective measures, would give grounds for concern.  The report went on to say what would happen in those circumstances, including the 15 per cent increase in non-agricultural wages and salaries and a balance of payments deficit up to £80 million.  I suppose that was the best the Department of Finance could do; they could not say that the economy is now in a position where, because of the growth of incomes beyond the Government's norm, the situation facing us is an external deficit of £80 million and that it requires action.  The Government were not taking action and they, therefore, set up an imaginary situation, stating that if the Government's advice was heeded everything would be all right but if at some distant point in the future it was not heeded action would <Col N="119" /> be required.  They knew of course that the Government's advice about 7 per cent came too late to have any effect and was, in fact, outdated by events.</P>
    <P>The Economic and Social Research Institute, who have tended to be relatively optimistic, have written that there seems to be a case for moderate fiscal action of a deflationary nature. They visualise an external deficit of not more than £76 million as against the £90 million envisaged by the NIEC, but even the Economic and Social Research Institute stated that action of a deflationary nature is necessary.  They stated that a small increase in the current Budget surplus would counteract some of the effective increased money incomes and might avert the need for a further tightening of monetary controls which could have dangerous effects on investment prospects. They stated if such a policy is adopted, if the Government have a Budget surplus and if it seems inevitable, in spite of a revenue buoyancy to be expected in 1970, that this would involve an increase in rates of taxation there are strong grounds for advocating an increase in direct rather than indirect taxes.</P>
    <P>Having dealt with the question of the form the extra taxation should take, the report of the Economic and Social Research Institute says that the immediate implications of the excessive rise in money incomes can be regarded as &ldquo;just manageable&rdquo; by a combination of severe, though not drastic, fiscal and monetary measures.  The long-term implications are more damaging.  Here is the most optimistic advice given to the Government and this suggests that the present situation may be &ldquo;just manageable&rdquo; by a combination of severe fiscal and monetary measures to control credit and increases in taxation designed to yield a Budget surplus.</P>
    <P>That was the advice given by the Economic and Social Research Institute. The NIEC is more pessimistic. At the end of a long account it gives of the situation and the proposals it makes&mdash;I shall not go through them all; they make such depressing reading and I do not want to depress the House any more&mdash;it suggests the situation is such that it is necessary to <Col N="120" /> reduce total expenditure by £80 million to £90 million, a figure which I think myself is excessive.  They say it was obvious the Government would not cut public expenditure.  They thought it should not come out of private investment and must, therefore, come out of consumption and called for this to be achieved within the calendar year.</P>
    <P>I do not know how they did their sums but I reckon this would mean cutting personal consumption by ten per cent in the next eight months.  That seems to me excessively drastic, but it is a measure of the seriousness of the situation that this body of employers, trade unionists, civil servants and representatives of the public interest should call for such drastic action as that.  They spell out the need for a Budget surplus:</P>
    <P>The measures outlined in the previous paragraph would transfer purchasing power from the private sector to the public sector and produce a surplus in the current Budget. This surplus would be available to finance public capital expenditures and to that extent less new bank lending and external borrowing would be required by the public sector.  At the same time the fact that this surplus was raised by reducing private expenditures would help to reduce the demands for bank credit in the private sector.</P>
    <P>It sees the need, therefore, for credit restraint measures and a Budget surplus.</P>
    <P>Then there is the Central Bank, which, like the Department of Finance, sets out two hypotheses, although it does not commit itself to the Department of Finance suggestion that the first hypothesis is possible.  However, it shows what might have happened and then what is likely to happen with present trends of income, and it concludes that it is necessary to cut back the growth of credit from £120 million to £75 million.  It is inexplicit on the subject of a Budget surplus.  Here it was inhibited in saying what it thought but the omission is an obvious one. It is clear it was intentional because it indicates on the first hypothesis, &ldquo;if things had worked out better&rdquo; the kind of situation we might have had.  It <Col N="121" /> starts off listing certain assumptions, and these assumptions include three as regards public finance, including the assumption that the public capital programme would rise by substantially less than it rose by last year, an assumption which has been validated by the public capital programme presented to us in which the increase is one-third less than last year.</P>
    <P>Its second assumption is that public current expenditure will rise by less than it rose by in the previous year. This assumption has been invalidated by the Budget, as a result of which the increase in public current expenditure this year will be £6 million more than last year even if not a halfpenny extra is spent over and above the sum provided, and I know from past experience that at least £9 million or £10 million extra will be spent.</P>
    <P>Their third assumption is a balanced Budget.  Having said that an increase in credit of £120 million would lead to a balance of payments deficit of £80 million to £90 million, a very dangerous situation, they then go on to say: Therefore we have to take remedial measures.  We have to cut the growth of credit from £120 million to £75 million.  It then repeats these assumptions, but omits the assumption in respect of the balanced Budget. This omission was significant because clearly what they intended was a Budget surplus.  However, having certain relationship with the Department of Finance, they felt it tactful not to mention that.</P>
    <P>The fact that both the NIEC and the Central Bank documents start from the hypothesis that failure to take action would lead to a deficit of £80 million to £90 million in the balance of payments, that the taking of action could reduce this to £50 million, and that the kind of action, where it is made explicit, is similar, and that the chairman of both bodies is the same&mdash;the Governor of the Central Bank and the Chairman of the NIEC&mdash;makes it clear they are working on parallel lines and that the Central Bank must also have been thinking of a Budget surplus, even though considerations of tact prevented it from saying so explicitly.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="122" /> This volume of advice varies in strength, the NIEC, perhaps, overstating what needs to be done and the Economic and Social Research Institute, perhaps, being a little on the optimistic side.  However, the whole range of advice indicates that several things are needed, moderation in the growth of credit and fiscal action leading to a Budget surplus.  The clear statement emerging from this is that a Budget surplus is needed to take some money out of circulation, to cut back demands in order to prevent our facing an intolerable level of external deficit requiring then far more drastic action. It also emerges that a Budget surplus was needed to help finance a capital Budget which otherwise would require a massive injection of foreign borrowing which the Central Bank itself said was undesirable.</P>
    <P>That is the recipe put to the Government and the Government were in a position to do it.  The Government were re-elected last June by the people on the mistaken assumption that &ldquo;if you elect this Government instead of having one of these weak, wishy-washy coalitions who are not prepared to take action, you will get thorough men who are prepared to do the right thing by the country.&rdquo;  Was it because they lost two by-elections they were terrified into this panic measure?  I do not know.  Perhaps the Budget was planned before that, but this Government which was re-elected to govern the country strongly although it has four years to go now, nevertheless, are so terrified of the Irish people that they were unprepared to take the necessary action and are prepared to let matters drift and take the consequential risks of doing so.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste has said you cannot always take economic advice.  I think he is right.  First of all, economic advice is sometimes conflicting and, secondly, the Government must make up their minds on the advice given.  Nevertheless, there are times when the truth that is staring one in the face is of such a character that it is flying in the face of Providence to refuse to take it.</P>
    <P>While I can understand the Government having divided views as to the <Col N="123" /> amount of deflation required and while no one could say with any kind of dogmatism &ldquo;you ought to have this size of Budget surplus or that kind of deflation&rdquo;, it is clear some measure of deflation was needed.  The first sign they were not prepared to do their duty on this occasion came when they published a suspiciously short time before the Budget the Estimates of Receipts and Expenditure.  I wonder why this was not published the week before the Budget as was always the case, as far as I can recall.  I have been working on this document as an economic commentator, latterly as a politician, for many years now.  I do not recall ever being faced with this document on the day before the Budget.  It was usually available the previous week.  Why?  Was it because it was revelatory of the Government's intentions?  Perhaps the Minister or whoever is replying on his behalf would explain why we did not get it until the day before the Budget.</P>
    <P>This document produced a picture of what is likely to happen if things are left alone, if you do not add expenditure or increase taxation in the Budget.  It is astonishing because it was clear to anybody looking at the picture that if you left things alone on any normal assumptions or any rational, responsible assumptions of revenue and expenditure, you would not get a Budget surplus in the year ahead but, if anything, a small deficit.  Yet this document emerges the day before the Budget with an imaginary surplus of £9 million for the Government to play with, to give away.  How was it arrived at?  Let us see how it was calculated.  The calculation of the buoyancy of revenue in this kind of statement here is something that is usually carried out responsibly.</P>
    <P>The method adopted is to make an assessment of the likely growth of personal consumption and of non-agricultural incomes and from these figures to assess the likely growth of indirect taxation, turnover tax, wholesale tax and excise duties on the one hand and of income tax and surtax on the other hand relating this to the growth of our agricultural income.  The <Col N="124" /> calculation is somewhat complicated because when one comes to calculate the growth of motor vehicle duty one has to assess the extent to which the growth of demand will outrun the growth of consumption generally, but there are good guidelines from the elasticity figures obtained from past performance.  Again, on the income tax side it is not quite so simple as just looking at the likely growth of our agricultural incomes because at a certain stage, with a given level of personal allowances and a given wage structure, the situation arises where a number of people are suddenly brought within the income tax net because of a wage round, and this brings about a buoyancy of income.  These require careful study, but the Department of Finance is well equipped to do this and it is able each year to assess the likely buoyancy of revenue.</P>
    <P>The kind of buoyancy arrived at by that calculation has never up to now been fully taken account of in pre-Budget statements.  Having arrived at these figures, the Department of Finance do not put in the full figure; they cautiously deduct something from it because, although they can predict with reasonable accuracy what the buoyancy of revenue will be in the year ahead, assuming there are no sharp deflationary measures which will cut back consumption, they cannot in the same way assess accurately and item by item the growth of expenditure. They are required to list expenditure under different Votes and it is impossible for a Government looking at the year ahead to think of all the things that might happen.  It would be improvident of a Government to make in every Vote contingency provisions for things which might not happen at all.</P>
    <P>In practice what happens is that the Book of Estimates is produced on certain assumptions and everyone knows that actual expenditure will exceed this by a significant margin, either because of public service pay increases or other increases.  The Government know this and so does the Department of Finance.  If they aim to produce a balanced Budget they do not take full credit for buoyancy of revenue; they deduct something from the buoyancy of revenue as first arrived at and set it <Col N="125" /> aside to meet unspecified increases in expenditure which are certain to occur. In that way the Budget is normally reasonably balanced, although not every year.  More often than not it is to some degree in deficit because the amount of buoyancy held back, although considerable, is not sufficient to cover extremely buoyant expenditure which outruns expectations.  By and large, an attempt is made to secure a balance and, by and large, it succeeds reasonably well.</P>
    <P>Let us turn now to the actual figures and see the kind of fiddling which went on this year.  When the Government prepared the Budget for 1969 they must have done this calculation.  They must have arrived at a figure of buoyancy of revenue, judging by the forecasts available to them from such sources as the Economic and Social Research Institute, of between £40 million and £50 million.  I would hazard a guess that it lay between £40 million and £45 million.  In fact, they did not take full account of this, they took credit for only £28½ million of natural buoyancy.  In addition to that they were able to count on another £13½ million, overflow effect of the November, 1968, Budget, the second Budget of that year.  This was the harshest Budget ever introduced here, yielding an increase of £19½ million in a full year, of which about £6 million could accrue and did accrue in the financial year 1968-69.  As the Government entered the year 1969-70 they knew they were going to get £13½ million extra from the November, 1968, Budget for the months April to October.  In addition, they took credit for £28½ million of natural buoyancy, the buoyancy of revenue one gets from any given tax rate.  That gave them £42 million altogether.  In fact, when the £13½ million was added in, they knew they would get a figure of the order of £55 million.  But they cut it back to £42 million, including the £13½ million from the previous year's taxation.</P>
    <P>In the current year we were faced with a year of credit restrictions likely to cut back the growth of consumption. The picture facing the Government of the growth of consumption and incomes, again shown by the Economic <Col N="126" /> and Social Research Institute forecast, is one which, before taking account of the credit restrictions, was somewhat more buoyant than that of the previous year.  In fact, the expectations of the institute and of the Department of Finance must have been somewhat similar because the two sets of forecasts are consistent with each other, in so far as the Department of Finance have given us any specific guidance about their thinking.  They forecast an increase in incomes for the year 1970-71 and it was expected that the increase in personal expenditure if there were no deflationary measures at all and no cuts in bank credit, would be 25 per cent greater.  If there was to be no deflation of any kind the Government could count on getting £55 million in the current year.  They got £46 million from natural buoyancy last year and they could therefore count on getting £55 million this year. In fact, the Central Bank has taken measures to control credit which is going to cut consumption.  In those circumstances it is clear already from the steps that have been taken that the buoyancy of revenue is unlikely this year to exceed £50 million.</P>
    <P>What allowances do the Government make on the revenue side for the unexpected increases in expenditure which they know will occur?  Whereas last year they assumed a natural buoyancy of revenue at existing taxation levels of £28½ million, this year they assume a natural buoyancy of £50 million&mdash;the entire figure&mdash;even though the measures taken by the Central Bank show that consumption is not likely to rise by more than in the previous year and incomes by not very much more.  This is grossly optimistic.  I think the Government will probably get £50 million but there is no leeway of any kind for a halfpenny of extra expenditure to occur.</P>
    <P>The scale on which excess expenditure occurs beyond what is provided for in the Book of Estimates is now very considerable.  Last year excess expenditure over what was in the Book of Estimates was £16½ million.  Of this, it is true, £7½ million consisted of increases in remuneration, and the Government have this year made provision in the Budget for increases in remuneration <Col N="127" /> amounting to £10 million.  To that extent they have covered unexpected future increases in expenditure. Last year, extra expenditure, excluding increases in public service remuneration, not provided for in the Book of Estimates, amounted to £9 million and in the year before it was £9½ million. We know from past experience that the bill facing the Government for the year ahead will be £9 million or £10 million more than what is in the Book of Estimates.  But no money is available to pay this bill because the Government have taken credit in the Budget for the entire buoyancy of revenue and the reserve which is normally kept to meet such extra expenditure has been dispensed with.</P>
    <P>What this means is that, if things take their course, this Budget is likely to show a deficit of up to £10 million &mdash;let us say cautiously £5 million to £10 million.  That is what the Government have done in spite of the fact that they were advised by every source of economic advice, not just outside commentators but responsible bodies such as the Central Bank, to produce a Budget with a surplus; instead they have budgeted for a deficit.  It is difficult to think of a more irresponsible act on the part of the Government in our present critical position.  One could understand a Government cautiously discounting the advice and budgeting for a small surplus.  As the Minister for Health has said, there is always something to be said for waiting before taking drastic action.  I sympathise with that view.  I think the Government could legitimately have produced a Budget with a small surplus. This might not have been enough. It might have led to a situation which would require further action later in the year.  That would be legitimate; what is illegitimate and irresponsible is to produce a Budget which, far from having even a small surplus, is likely to produce a deficit and which will inflate the economy further.  In simple terms, the Government have lashed out £22 million in extra expenditure and increased taxation by a net £12½ million.</P>
    <P>That is what an inflationary Budget means.  It is a Budget in which decisions <Col N="128" /> taken by the Minister involve increasing expenditure more than increasing income.  Against all the advice given to him he has done that.  That is the position facing us.  Frankly, I do not understand why the Government have acted in this irresponsible way.  One could understand it politically, while deploring it economically and nationally, if it were before an election.  But, as I remarked rather bitterly the other day, what is the use of the people electing a Fianna Fáil Government if they go on producing election Budgets when the election is over?  It is not what they were elected for.  When one elects a Fianna Fáil Government one expects one election Budget four years later, not four in a row, which is what we seem to be in for at the moment.</P>
    <P>What kind of reaction has the Budget had?  The Minister for Health claims he found some consolation from some economist in <i>This Week</i> saying something not too critical about the Budget.  I must not have read the same things as he.  I read the papers the day after the Budget.  &ldquo;Budget Proves a Damp Squib&mdash;No measures to check Inflation.&rdquo;  There are a number of other comments in the same paper.  &ldquo;It is magnificent, but it is not a Budget.&rdquo; I am not too sure about the magnificence but I agree with the latter part of the statement.</P>

        <i>The Irish Times</i> of 23rd April.  &ldquo;Almost certainly it will be followed by a Supplementary&mdash;and much tougher&mdash;Budget in about three or four months.&rdquo;&ldquo;No measures to check inflation.&rdquo;&ldquo;Really a non-Budget of a curiously old-fashioned nature.&rdquo; There is a comment by the Federation of Irish Industries &ldquo;The Budget has not been used to curb inflation.&rdquo;  I have another quotation from another source&mdash;a distinguished stock-broking firm in the city.  This is one of the more important stock-broking firms and one whose judgment is fairly good in these matters.  They produced on the morning after the Budget&mdash;and they are to be congratulated on the speed with which they produced it&mdash;a full account <Col N="129" /> of the Budget and it is headed &ldquo;The Budget 1970&mdash;More Inflation.&rdquo;  In a comment they said:</P>
      <P>This Budget is clearly inflationary. The Central Bank and other economic advisers all agreed that a sharp restrictionist Budget was necessary to curb the growth in incomes, consumption and our payments deficit.  The Department of Finance itself admitted that anything higher than a £50 million payments deficit would have grave implications for the economy.  The Central Bank, the NIEC and the ESRI bulletin agreed that unless the dose was severe we would have an £80 million to £90 million deficit this year.  There is thus a deep divergence in thinking between the Minister and his advisers.  On his side will be last year's performance when he took the risk of a slightly inflationary Budget against the same advisers' recommendations.</P>
      <P>Having analysed the Budget in detail it concludes:</P>
      <P>The Budget does nothing material to get to grips with the wages spiral. The Budget has probably aggravated the demand push scene last year and the picture emerging this year is likely to have similar landmarks though more pronounced ones. Markets will be relieved particularly those sectors which had fully discounted being hit in the Budget in the short term.  However, a difficult summer with a growing prospect of restrictive measures to come as the year wears on will act as a drag on any worthwhile rise on the stock market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I could go on quoting but there is no point.  We all know what the reaction has been to the Budget&mdash;one of unanimous shock among all responsible people concerned for the future of the country.  Of course, it enables the Government to get some cheap popularity at the moment.  The Government have made the most of the increase in social welfare benefit and they are entitled to do so.  All these things were well chosen, well judged and useful in themselves, but the fact remains that the Government in their failure to produce <Col N="130" /> a balanced Budget, let alone a Budget with a surplus, have acted irresponsibly. They have aggravated the economic situation facing us.</P>
    <P>The situation we are in now is one for which the Government must bear a good deal of the blame not just for this Budget&mdash;though this is the nail in the coffin&mdash;but because over the past couple of years they have acted irresponsibly in two respects.  The first was the 1969 pre-election Budget and the fact that it allowed the economy to drift and that even now they have failed to take any action to set it right.  The second has been in the field of an incomes policy.  The Tánaiste has just spoken eloquently on this subject.  I know he feels strongly about it.  He is a responsible Minister who has been concerned for a long time about this and he has tried to bring the Government with him to deal with this question of an incomes policy.  I know he has failed.  The history of this incomes policy situation is a drab one.</P>
    <P>One of the first steps taken in regard to it was the Fine Gael policy for the 1965 election which spelled out the need for an incomes and prices policy.  The Tánaiste dismissed what was said as pious pie in the sky but he is not right in that.  He either did not read the Fine Gael policy at the time or he has forgotten it because not alone did it say that such a policy is necessary but it went on to say that such a policy cannot just be a wages policy but that it must be a policy for all incomes.</P>
    <P>It went beyond that to suggest how, in fact, other incomes could be brought under control in a way that would enable workers to be convinced, to be sure, that if they did accept restraint they would not suffer, that the effects of their restraint would not be that other people would be better off.  A specific proposal was made for a dividend equalisation tax which was spelled out in detail as to how it would work.  This was a responsible act by an Opposition party.  Opposition parties do not gain many votes by proposing taxes even rather obscure ones like this but the Fine Gael Party felt it was not enough to mouth clichés about an incomes and prices policy. <Col N="131" /> They felt they must as a responsible party suggest how this problem could be tackled.  This proposal for a dividend equalisation tax was taken up by the NIEC and was included in NIEC Report No. 11 which set out in a very important paragraph proposals to deal with this matter:</P>
    <P>Application of the principle (of an incomes policy) in an acceptable manner to contractual incomes (i.e. wages and salaries) depends on the difficulties in applying it to other incomes being overcome ... Incomes policy must be accepted as a whole and its application to all sectors must have equal priority and effectiveness. The measures relating to other incomes should be set out in advance by the Government and applied to them contemporaneously with the application of an incomes policy to wages and salaries.</P>
    <P>It went on beyond that to draw a clear distinction between a policy of taxing profits and one that would deal with incomes derived from profits. That report had the great merit that it secured a consensus among management and unions for a number of propositions which it is not easy to get them to agree on.  Thus the unions agreed that the control of profits is not desirable and can be damaging and that if profits are earned competitively they should not be controlled and also that a straight control of dividends that would keep the increase in dividends down to a specific figure would also be damaging because such a policy hits the efficient firm which through its efficiency is able to increase its profits.  If its shareholders are to have their dividends held down to the same level as those of inefficient firms new flows of capital will be misdirected and will not go to the efficient firms to ensure that they continue to expand.</P>
    <P>This was a very responsible report and the acceptance of it by the trade unions was a remarkable step forward. It went on to say that as profits should not be controlled and as dividends should not be controlled some other action was required because clearly wage earners will not accept that their <Col N="132" /> incomes will be controlled, whereas the incomes of people who derive unearned income from dividends were not controlled.  It went on with a specific proposal to deal with this which was, in fact, the Fine Gael proposal for a dividend equalisation tax. It went on to draw a distinction between profits on the one hand and personal income derived from profits on the other.  The principle was enunciated that, if an unacceptable distribution of purchasing power between those with incomes derived from profits and wage and salary earners emerged, tax or other measures &ldquo;must be introduced&rdquo;.  I quote:</P>
    <P>... to ensure that the rate of increase in aggregate post-tax purchasing power derived from investment is no higher than the rate of increase in aggregate post-tax wages, salaries and other incomes.  A number of measures which might be effective for this purpose already exist in other countries and their application in Irish conditions should be considered.</P>
    <P>This means that in a given period if dividend income is rising more rapidly than wages and salaries and if the amount of it left after taxation is rising more rapidly than the amount of wages and salaries left after taxation, then an extra tax should be imposed on the dividend income so that people living on dividends will not find themselves getting an increase in income more quickly perhaps because of the restraint of workers&mdash;because restraint on the part of workers could lead to profits rising faster.</P>
    <P>This is a very enlightened approach. It is one which could offer workers an assurance on the one hand that they would not suffer as a result of restraint. On the other hand, it avoids any question of controlling profits or controlling dividends, which has bad economic effects.  For the first time a proposal was made for an incomes policy that would avoid the bad effect of price control, profit control and dividend control but that would nevertheless offer workers an assurance that they would not suffer unjustly.  That proposal was contained in that report.  What happened to it?  Nothing, as far as one <Col N="133" /> can judge.  There is no evidence that the Government ever even examined that proposal.  All that has happened since then has been a continuous exhortation to wages and salary earners for restraint; no suggestion that anything will be done to secure restraint in the growth of other people's incomes &mdash;no, it is only the wages and salary earners who are to be restrained.</P>
    <P>Earlier Deputy Noel Browne intervened when the Minister for Health was talking, as he often does, about the control of wages and salaries and the Minister said, &ldquo;Wait.  I am coming to deal with other incomes.&rdquo;  How did he deal with them?  By telling us that profits had not risen too much and it was a good thing for profits to rise. Nobody disagrees with profits rising. Even the trade unions have committed themselves to the view that profits should not be controlled if they are earned competitively.  That is not the issue.  The issue is whether the incomes of people who get incomes from dividends might if you had a restraint of wages, rise more rapidly and whether the only effect of workers restraining the growth of wages and salaries would be to divert income into the pockets of people in receipt of dividends.  That is the issue and that the Minister for Health did not deal with or grapple with or even mention.  All he had to offer workers was: profits are a good thing; therefore your incomes should be restrained and profits keep on going up.  If those profits were all to be ploughed back into expansion of the industries the workers would not object.  The Minister for Health had nothing to offer by way of assurance on that score and there has been total silence for 4½ years on the proposal in the NIEC report for some kind of taxation system which would ensure equity to workers in an incomes policy.</P>
    <P>When we come to the latest NIEC report, all we find is a watering down, in fact, a step backwards.  The whole proposal to tackle this problem in this way and to avoid control of profits is dropped and we have a proposal that something should be done to control the growth of profits, if necessary by additional corporation profits tax.  I do not know why the unions accepted this watering down.  I do not know why <Col N="134" /> management did.  It is against both their interests.  All that has happened is that the workers are getting less of an assurance than they had that their restraint will not benefit people in receipt of dividends and the employers find themselves with greater taxation of profits which will reduce the amount that they can plough back.  I do not know what they mean by both selling out to the administrators, who told them, perhaps, for all I know, that a dividend equalisation tax would be difficult to introduce, if they even discussed it at all.  The latest NIEC report is a great step backwards in this respect. It is deplorable.  But over this whole period there has been no action taken on this.</P>
    <P>When that report was produced in 1965 something should have been done on it.  The Government should have acted imaginatively.  They should have taken this report for the great break-through it was, congratulated the employers on agreeing that there should be much more information given about profits than had been given hitherto and about the incomes of management, and congratulated the unions on agreeing that there should be no control over profits earned competitively, and made a great break-through from the basis it established.  Instead of which we had nothing but negative attitudes from Government Ministers, other than the Minister for Health who talked hopefully on about a wages and salaries policy but never about an incomes policy; nothing but negative attitudes from them and negative attitudes from the public servants concerned.  All we have now in this report is a step backwards to a position which will be economically more damaging and from the workers' point of view less satisfactory. That is a deplorable record.</P>
    <P>I would hope that even at this late stage the Government would make some imaginative attempt to break through to a genuine incomes policy, but I must say I am discouraged by this report and discouraged by the institutional solution they have found because it has been evident for some time past that what we need is one body to cope with incomes policy, one body which would prevent incomes policy being sabotaged by other Government <Col N="135" /> agencies.  We have not got it.  We have a co-ordinating committee to be established. Well, I suppose, if that is all people can agree on we had better take it and hope it will work but it is pretty discouraging.  We should have reached the stage at this point where a prices and incomes board of some kind could have been established but I am afraid that once again the deep conservatism in the public service, the resistance to any institutional change, anything that involved changing or modifying the powers or functions of an existing body, has proved too powerful and this solution which is one which they are known to have favoured for quite a while past has emerged now through the mouth of the NIEC and it is not at all what is needed in these circumstances.</P>
    <P>The basic difficulty here has not been faced.  It is skirted around, it is referred to, but not faced, that is, the role of the Labour Court.  The Labour Court has a very important role to play but it is a role which may not always be played for the benefit of the nation.  It sees its role as one of conciliation, badly needed God knows, in our industrial relations.  Conciliation means that when you have got somebody offering 7 per cent and somebody looking for 14 per cent you propose a solution of 10½ per cent, or something like that.  The Labour Court's whole way of working for the last 25 years has been to produce compromise solutions.  It has no function in guarding the national interest. It is not required to have regard to the national interest.  It would, in fact, I think, be going against its terms of reference if it thought about the national interest.  Its job is to settle disputes and as, naturally, the workers' representatives always look for a lot more than is desirable in the national interest and employers who want to settle disputes are not that concerned about inflation, which benefits them very often, anyway, always offer at least as much as the national interest would tolerate, a settlement between the two always produces a figure which is more than the national interest requires.</P>
    <P>The Labour Court, in fact, in this <Col N="136" /> operation tends therefore to undermine any kind of incomes policy.  I am not saying this in criticism.  The Labour Court is doing its job.  Its job is to settle disputes.  Nobody ever told it to have regard to the national interest. In fact, as I have said, its terms of reference are such that if it did regard the national interest it would not be doing the job it was given to do.  It is not the Labour Court's fault, it is the fault of the Government who have constituted as the only relevant agency in this area a body whose whole terms of reference are such as to be likely to undermine the national interest.</P>
    <P>The solution to this would require reorganisation of the structure so that you would avoid having this situation in future.  It would need a prices and incomes board of a very powerful character which would not readily or at all be sabotaged by Labour Court conciliation decisions.  That, I am afraid, we are not going to get because a co-ordinating committee of 13 &mdash;or whatever it is&mdash;is not going to be able to control the situation.  In deed, that is tactitly accepted in the report which talks about reviewing the position in three years' time and seeing whether perhaps a stronger institutional structure is required.  They all know it is needed now.  They all know that if it is not established now the chances of solving our problems are minimal and yet, largely I believe because of institutional pressures within the public service, it is not in fact being done.</P>
    <P>However, this is what is recommended. It is a half measure.  I am not confident that it will work.  For what it is worth, it must be tried.  It is up to the Government now to try to put this half measure into effect and to hope that they can get across the message which the Minister for Health has been trying to get across, about the disastrous effects of a continuous rise in money incomes.  It is a message which will not be got across by a Government who are not prepared to face the fact that you cannot have a wages and salaries policy, that it has to be an incomes policy.  An incomes policy will not be devised by just controlling profits.  It will require some kind of control over the income derived from profits, some kind of control that <Col N="137" /> would satisfy workers that their sacrifices will not be in vain.  That is not what we have got.  That, the Government should face and do something about.</P>
    <P>The consequences of not succeeding in this respect cannot be exaggerated. We are in the difficulty at the moment &mdash;and this is mentioned in one of these reports, perhaps the NIEC report&mdash;that various public authorities and the Government have cried &ldquo;wolf&rdquo; so often that people have given up listening.  If they are told now that if they continue to look for more income it will be disastrous for the economy, they have heard that ten times before and it never happened and therefore they will ignore it.  I can recall 11 years ago Mr. Lemass solemnly telling the unions that if they had an increase of 7 or 8 per cent then&mdash;1959&mdash;the economy would be wrecked.  I remember he made a speech in this House in March of that year and I recall the whole series of economic nonsense talked about the disastrous effect of the increase then being given.  The increase then being given was a moderate increase required to keep up demand in the economy and to keep up the domestic demand at a time when we were expanding exports and could well afford to do so.</P>
    <P>We have had this type of nonsense repeated at intervals ever since.  There are times when it has been necessary to say it when there has been a measure of inflation but at other times it has possibly been said when, in fact, there was not such a problem.  I am afraid the effect of those warnings has diminished as time goes on through abuse.  Now, when the situation is really serious people are not prepared to listen.  It is really serious for the simple reason that for the first time in the history of this State, not merely in the history of this Government, our costs of production are beginning to outrun, to rise faster than those of Britain to a measurable degree.</P>
    <P>The parity of the Irish £ with the British £ depends on maintaining a certain cost relationship between the two economies.  As long as our costs are lower than the costs in Britain by a certain margin and that margin is <Col N="138" /> about equivalent to the lower productivity in this country, then the two £s can remain at parity but if at some point we start inflating our costs more rapidly than the costs in Britain and keep at it for a year, 18 months or two years, then we will have undermined the value of our £ and established a new relationship which at some point if persisted in might have to find some form of expression.  That is the danger we face.  That has not happened before.</P>
    <P>There have been periods in the 1960s when, owing to the fact that our wage rounds have been two-yearly and wages in Britain have on the whole been increased annually, for a brief period our costs structure has risen. perhaps, by 5 per cent ahead of the British costs structure for a few months and then as our wages have relatively stabilised again for a year or so and as wages in Britain have risen that gap has been narrowed again very quickly and it has not been anything to worry about.  One could keep an eye on it and see it is a purely temporary phenomenon. Over that whole period the relationship between the Irish costs structure and the British costs structure has been almost unchanged.  I think that in 1967 and, perhaps, in 1968 it was a couple of times different from what it was, for example, in 1968 but over the whole period we have maintained our costs relative to the costs in Britain.</P>
    <P>It is true that both countries have been inflating their costs of production at faster rates than those of other countries and it is true that as a result of this we had to devalue our £ in 1967.  It was written off at the time as if it was simply that the Central Bank Act required our £ to be the same as that in Britain and, therefore, it was a purely technical adjustment. The simple fact is that between 1963 and 1967 the British and Irish £s devalued because in both countries we inflated our costs of production faster than the rest of the world.  This had to be adjusted by the devaluation of both pounds which were both devalued by the same amount in the same period.  That devaluation occurred at the end of 1967.  Although our £ lost <Col N="139" /> its value <i>vis-à-vis</i> the rest of the world at least it did not lose its value <i>vis-à-vis</i> sterling because we had inflated our costs at the same rate, an excessive rate, perhaps, but no more excessive than the British rate of inflation.  In those circumstances our £ maintained its value <i>vis-à-vis</i> sterling but <i>vis-à-vis</i> damn all else.</P>
    <P>That situation no longer applies.  The NIEC report shows figures for the change in our costs structure in this recent period.  It shows that in a 12-month period ending the third quarter of last year labour costs per unit of output in this country rose by 11½ per cent.  This is the footnote on page seven of the NIEC report.  The increase in unit wage costs of manual workers in the manufacturing sector in this country between the third quarters of 1968 and 1969, the latest period for which figures were available when this was produced, was 11½ per cent and in the United Kingdom 3½ per cent.  In that brief period of 12 months our costs structure disimproved <i>vis-à-vis</i> that of Britain by 8 per cent as far as wages were concerned and as wages represent about 60 per cent of the total cost of output our total production costs disimproved by 5 per cent in that 12-month period.  In effect, the purchasing power of our £ disimproved by that amount.</P>
    <P>Does anybody think that the trends of wages over the last six or seven months since then have been such as to bridge that gap?  Do we not all know that this trend has continued, that although Britain itself is facing inflation in wage costs over the same period our inflation in wage costs has continued to outrun that of Britain?  Does anybody doubt if we had up-to-date figures for the month of April, 1970, we would see here a gap not of 8 per cent in labour costs and 5 per cent in total costs but, perhaps, 11 or 12 per cent in labour costs and 7 or 8 per cent in total costs?  Does anybody doubt over the months ahead that gap will widen further, that by the summer of this year our total production costs will be 10 per cent out of line with those of Britain? It has not happened before in the history of this country that I have been able to trace anyway and nothing like <Col N="140" /> it has happened before in circumstances in which there is no particular prospect of its being reversed.</P>
    <P>It is one thing to have a temporary fluctuation but it is a different thing to have a long-term trend and no prospect of its being reversed.  It cannot be reversed unless we adopt and accept an incomes policy involving very severe restraint in the growth of incomes in the next year or 18 months.  If this is done we can save the position.  Rather fortunately, perhaps, the British are in the same position but to a much lesser degree.  Fortunately for us, taking a short term view, Britain's costs are being inflated rather rapidly.  If we could hold our costs at the present inflated level for 18 months, if we could, in fact, hold our wages and salaries at roughly the present level for 18 months or a year and allow our productivity to grow, our wage costs would come down somewhat and the British wage costs would rise and one could hope, perhaps, to restore our equilibrium in, perhaps, 18 months' time.</P>
    <P>That is possible but it is only possible if we achieve a very severe measure of restraint in the growth of wages and salaries.  We will not secure that unless we can convince the workers that if they do restrain themselves others will be restrained too.  It is that which the Government have failed to do.  It is there lies the failure in an incomes policy.  It is there the great gains made by the NIEC report No. 11 have been frittered away by inactivity and inaction over a period of almost five years.  There is still this hope left.  We could retrieve the position but there is little sign that this is being done.  Nothing said from the benches over there suggests a recognition of the seriousness of the situation.</P>
    <P>It is a critical position which has no parallel in the history of this country. One would have expected a responsible Government to have introduced a Budget that would have brought home to people the seriousness of the position, a Budget that would have helped to create the climate of opinion in which wage restraint could be achieved.  One of the most impressive passages of the NIEC report is where <Col N="141" /> they point out that one should not be fatalistic about this and one should not take the line that you cannot stop those things happening, that you cannot change fundamental attitudes.  They make the valid point that as late as 1965 the Government did in a critical situation, which at that time they again allowed to go on too long, take fairly drastic action.  What was the consequence? The consequence was that faced with a deflation of the economy, not anything like as severe as that of 1968, the trade unions moderated their claims very drastically.  They saw themselves faced through this deflation with the problems of unemployment.  They knew that if they pressed for the usual kind of wage increase of 12 per cent there would be large-scale unemployment. The Government had brought home to them the seriousness of the position and introduced budgetary measures of an exceptional character. One can argue about the details of that package.  I had faults to find with it myself at the time and I could repeat the criticism now.  The Government took action, even if belatedly, and it was action of a dramatic character to make their point.  It did, as the NIEC report points out, convince the trade unions that they should moderate their claim.</P>
    <P>What was the result?  We had the £1 a week increase, the smallest increase we had in wages for, perhaps, ten years.  Who is to expect the trade unions of this country after this Budget to take similar action?  They have been given the green light by an irresponsible Government.  They have been told by the Government: &ldquo;Look, those people opposite and all those economists are fooling you, there is no crisis; things are all right here, social welfare benefits for the farmers, £10 million more given away than increase in taxes.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I have made that point laboriously for the past hour. If the Parliamentary Secretary had come in he would have got the drift of my remarks earlier.  The Parliamentary Secretary can make what he likes about it politically.  The time has passed when we should be concerned about the politics of this Budget in this House.  We should be concerned about the far more serious economic situation. I am not going to be put off saying what I feel I should say by any remarks of that kind from the Parliamentary Secretary.  The NIEC made the point that in 1965 the Government secured wage restraint because it brought home the gravity of the situation to the people and to the trade unions and on this occasion the Government have flown in the face of that.</P>
      <P>On this occasion the Government have flown in the face of that and told the trade unions &ldquo;You can forget all that nonsense about an incomes policy. There is no problem or no crisis.  Perhaps next year we will come back with something to do but at the moment all is well.&rdquo;  I could not imagine a more inappropriate or irresponsible approach at the moment.  The Parliamentary Secretary and the Government can be assured as the year progresses, and if the situation evolves as it seems likely to evolve, they will be reminded of what they have not done and of what has been said about irresponsibility during the course of this debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to turn to two other aspects. I will deal first with the capital budget briefly and then with the remarks about the Devlin report at the end of the Minister's speech.  I want to agree with what I think Deputy Desmond was saying and that is that the capital budget should be separately discussed in this House.  It never gets adequate attention.  There is much which is important in it.  The Government are to be congratulated on the way they have presented this capital budget over <Col N="143" /> recent years.  It was published in good time before the Budget.  It contains very full explanations of all the items in it.  We have no complaints on that score unlike the complaint I made earlier about the failure to publish the Estimates of Receipts and Expenditure and the Book of Estimates.  The information contained in the capital budget is enlightening and valuable.</P>
    <P>I want to direct attention to the part which is always the most difficult&mdash; paying.  Table 3 sets out the estimate of the resources and requirements for the year ahead.  It is possible that when the Government have taken account of all the profit and depreciation fund provisions for State companies and for the extra borrowing external to these companies and local authorities, but not necessarily external to the State, and have taken account of loan repayments to the Government and the investment resources of departmental funds and the small savings on the prize bonds, together with all the odds and ends, and the National Loans, that they are left with a sum of £75 million to be found under the heading of &ldquo;Other&rdquo;.  I must explain what &ldquo;Other&rdquo; means.  It means three things&mdash;the banks, external borrowing and budget surplus.  I have dealt with budget surplus. I believe there will be a budget deficit.  To the extent that there is a budget deficit, this will mean that no contribution will be made to the £75 million but there will be an increase to meet the deficit which I believe will be £5 million or £10 million.  We are faced with finding £75 million on the Government's reckoning.  I would reckon that we must find £80 million or more from the banks or through external borrowing.</P>
    <P>We know what the banks are to provide.  The Central Bank have made that clear.  The banks are authorised to lend an additional £75 million this year.  If the Government got all their money from the banks, the banks would not be able to increase lending for private purposes at all.  Quite possibly they would have to reduce borrowing slightly.  Therefore, if there is to be any increase in private credit this year&mdash;and it seems desirable there should be some increase, though <Col N="144" /> somewhat restrained&mdash;the Government will have to borrow abroad and have made plans to do so on a certain scale. This foreign borrowing has its uses but is additionally inflationary.  It pumps more money into the economy when we should be trying not to do so.  The price the Government have to pay for this additional inflationary input is very high.  They pay nine or ten per cent interest rates to people who do not pay taxes.  This is equivalent to 14 or 15 per cent interest rate paid to people in this country.  That is a dear price to pay for money, the introduction of which will do nothing but inflate the economy.</P>
    <P>The Central Bank were caustic in their comments.  The Central Bank commenting on this further additional inflow of capital were very definite indeed.  It is clear that the Government have got into a position where, through a failure to budget for a surplus as they were advised to do and having instead got into a position where they are likely to have a deficit, they will have to squeeze the private sector of all additional capital, leaving it with no additional capital or even with a reduction, or with having to borrow abroad which would agrgevate the inflation which they should be tackling. This is unsatisfactory.  It is clear that for capital budget purposes alone, even without other considerations, there should have been provision made for a surplus budget on this occasion.  This was not done.  The scale of the capital budget is very large.  The Government have been right to try to maintain it so far as possible in this difficult situation.  I sympathise with them faced with the demands on the capital side. It is not easy to say what should be cut.  Some of the demands are ones we should probably be providing for at this time.  It is encouraging to see the rapid growth in the provision which must be made for industrial grants. This is associated with a more rapid growth in industrialisation than heretofore. It would be a great pity, by reason of a short term crisis, if we had to cut back on this.  I hope the Government's failure to take the measures they should have will not create the type of crisis in which they would be forced to cut back on the capital budget. <Col N="145" /> If the Government had acted responsibly in this Budget and sought even a small surplus they could have got through with the fair assurance that the capital budget could be held intact.  I fear for the capital budget in 1971-72 in the light of the Government's irresponsibility last week.</P>
    <P>I will now speak on the Devlin report. The Taoiseach spoke about it in the Budget speech.  It may be that what was said on this subject in the Budget speech may, in the long run, prove more serious to the country than what was said in the financial part of the speech.  It has not yet received sufficient attention.  It is unfortunate that the Government made this announcement in the last pages of the Budget speech which contained so much else of importance.  Very little attention has been given to this.  The Taoiseach said:</P>
    <P>Broadly, the report covers three main subjects&mdash;the structure and organisation of the public service, the management of that service and the distribution of functions among Departments of State and between Departments and other bodies.  The central feature of the report concerns the arrangements for the overall organisation and management of the public service through the functions of planning, finance, organisation and personnel.</P>
    <P>It goes on to deal with what the Government are going to do about that. Anybody who believes that is the central feature of the Devlin report has not read it.  Anybody who has read it could only make such a statement knowing it to be untrue.  The central feature of the Devlin report&mdash;and I challenge anybody to produce a review or critique of it which does not make this clear&mdash;is the proposal for the introduction of a division between the policy-making and executive functions of Government Departments, and the introduction of the new concept of the Aireacht.  Everything hinges on that. That is the vital change.  The introduction of these planning, finance, organisation and personnel functions are vital to the reform of the public service.  To say that they are the central feature and to omit any reference to <Col N="146" /> the concept of the Aireacht is to be utterly and totally dishonest.  It is depressing for the Government reference to be dishonest.  There is no reference to the Aireacht proposal.  We are left in uncertainty as to what the Government will do.  Judging by the Government's performance on other similar reports when they decide to turn down good recommendations they do not talk about them; they just leave them there.  One cannot help feeling that is what is happening here.  If this is not what is happening I trust the Minister or whoever will be replying for him in this debate will make that clear.  It is difficult to draw the other conclusion from the Budget speech which manages to pretend that the central feature of this report is something different and then to omit to make any reference to the Aireacht. I hope I am unduly suspicious.  That is an occupational hazard on this side of the House.  I hope this is an omission of some kind or that the Government have not considered the report yet and thought it was better not to mention it at all until they took a decision.  I hope that the Government will consider the report seriously and positively.  This proposal has received a very general welcome.  There are difficulties about it.  The whole proposal involving devolution of executive functions is different to the ones we have been used to.  It raises problems of parliamentary responsibility which will have to be examined very carefully.</P>
    <P>All of us who have had contact with, who have had to work with Government Departments know the extent to which public servants are burdened by day to day responsibilities in their Departments, where senior officers have very little time to do the work that fundamentally they are employed to do.  When the first of the economic programmes was drawn up, it had to be done by senior civil servants in their spare time, at night, because there was nobody to do it in the normal way&mdash; they were too busy with day to day work.</P>
    <P>I am sure it can be found in books on administration&mdash;I have not read <Col N="147" /> them&mdash;that there is a basic difference between the urgent and the important issues and that when it comes to doing them the urgent issue will always take precedence, that the important issue will always lose out to the urgent.  I found this to be true when I worked for the State air company.  A particular branch of that company was concerned with what aircraft to fly and also with making provision for additional services in two, three or four months ahead, and there was the tendency for the work unit to be concerned with the more urgent problem, to have a double door on a plane to fit a greyhound, and the problem of how many and which aircraft should be used to take in tens of thousands of holiday-makers sometimes in the future went into the drawers.</P>
    <P>Of course, I exaggerate, but between the two functions, the one which is urgent and the one which is important, the important always takes second place.  Basically, the public service functions with this defect.  Though there were reasonable standards laid down in 1920 as to the methods in which policy-making should be executed, in fact, the policy-makers are so busy executing that they have very inadequate time for policy-making. That is the observation of the people who prepared the Devlin report.  It is the experience of anybody in close contact with the public service.</P>
    <P>Therefore, if we are to have the really important ingredients injected into our national policy aims, into our programmes for social progress, it is essential that we have a reform which would release some of the abilities within the public service for the work of policy formulation.  This involves some form of division.  I hope the issue has not been prejudiced, that it remains an open matter.  In this context there are extracts from the Devlin report which I should like to read.  Paragraph 13.1.1 states:</P>
    <P>We have mentioned that the greatest single defect that we have found in the present organisation of the Irish public service is that the top levels of the Departments of State are so involved in the press of daily <Col N="148" /> business that they have little time to participate in the formulation of overall policy for their Departments' functional areas or in the management of their Departments.  We quote from the former Secretary of the Department of Finance, Dr. Whitaker:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I am not sure now if the biggest problem after all will not be one of organisation&mdash;how Secretaries and other senior officers can organise their time and work so as to get away from their desks and the harassing experiences of everyday sufficiently to read, consider and consult with others in order to be able to give sound and comprehensive advice on future development policy.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Unless this defect is remedied, the other reforms we suggest will be, at best, palliatives.</P>
    <P>Then the report goes on to recommend this concept.  The second vital proposal in the report is more a point of time&mdash;the most urgent because it is the thing which has to be done first for the establishment of a public service Department whose job will be to re-organise the public service.  It is something which has developed, for different reasons, in Britain in recent years.  Paragraph 14 of the report recommends:</P>
    <P>That the central organisation and personnel functions for the public service should be removed from the Department of Finance and assigned to a new Department.  The reorganisation of the public service should be the responsibility of this Department which we call the Public Service Department.</P>
    <P>It is made clear that the recommendation is that the Public Service Department should report to the Minister for Finance and it is made clear throughout that the new Department should be under the control of the secretary who, it is suggested, should report to the Minister for Finance.  One can argue about reporting to the Minister for Finance.  There are different sides to this.</P>
    <P>The first change the Devlin committee suggested is based on the particular development of the Office of Taoiseach&mdash;I mean the Department of <Col N="149" /> the Taoiseach.  That Department are not operated on a scale equivalent to the Cabinet office in London and their functions are not familiar.  The committe came to the conclusion, therefore &mdash;I am not sure they were right&mdash; that in Irish circumstances, because of the importance of having this new Department reporting to a senior Minister, if you attach it to the Taoiseach it might not work properly.  Therefore, they recommend that it should be attached to the Department of Finance.</P>
    <P>There is a problem here in relation to the complexity of our system. We have only the positions of Cabinet members and Parliamentary Secretaries. The British in their wisdom have got anachronistic offices like that of Privy Seal.  They are historical, anachronistic institutions, but they give titles to Ministers, titles of seniority, and because of such a title a Minister can be very senior and work under the Prime Minister.</P>
    <P>Here, if you appointed a Minister in charge of this Department he would not be completely under the Taoiseach, but if you appointed a Parliamentary Secretary you would downgrade the Department.  That is why the committee decided to recommend that this should be a separate Department with a separate secretary who would report to the Minister for Finance.  What is important to note is that it would be a Department and a secretary responsible to the most senior Minister in the Cabinet in terms of the importance of his office.</P>
    <P>There have been recommendations in regard to a single co-ordinating public service unit.  At no stage in the report, however, is this described as a single co-ordinating unit.  On the contrary, the report emphasises that it must be a separate Department, and the downgrading of this to a unit may be ominous.  Of course, it may not be: it may be that the Government have not made up their mind, that they may have used the term &ldquo;unit&rdquo; in a neutral way.  It is vital that the function for which it is intended is carried out by a full Department which would be given great authority.</P>
    <P>The work to be done in reforming the public service is enormous.  It is <Col N="150" /> not that the public service is not doing an excellent job.  It is that every unit of it should be changed in order to be able to face changing circumstances. The complexities facing Government today are far greater than they were 50 years ago, and yet the Civil Service has had no significant reform since 1920, and I am not convinced that the 1920 reform was particularly beneficial in the light of current needs.  Since then, nothing has been done to meet new deeds, and in the Devlin report one finds an extraordinary amount of things about the need for change in the public service.</P>
    <P>Of course, the report rightly pays tribute to the many great strengths of the public service.  One cannot repeat too often the debt we owe to the public service because of the fact that it is a body of complete integrity.  In some countries where there are deficiencies in the integrity of the public service the whole of public life is disordered. Therefore, we are fortunate in having a public service whose integrity we can trust.  There are many other merits, too, which the Devlin report enumerates. It says that the service has worked with what is described as reasonable efficiency, but perhaps this is not an enormously warm compliment.</P>
    <P>The report goes on to say that the public service has supported different Governments with loyalty and with regard to the national interest.  This is an important point.  This tradition was established by the first Government. The civil servants who served that Government were, in many cases, intimate friends of the Ministers and had been their friends throughout the movement and afterwards.  They had the difficult job of steering this State in difficult conditions during its earlier years.  They had to fight a civil war against people who were to become the successors of that Government and it is only fair to say that the first Government achieved a lot in handing over a public service which transferred its loyalty totally to the new Government. The new Government, in turn, despite the difficult conditions of the times and in spite of some mistakes that were made, recognised this and since then we have had a Civil Service which has <Col N="151" /> been able to transfer its loyalty from one Government to another.</P>
    <P>The report goes on to say that the Civil Service operates impartially and tries as best it can to promote the development of the nation.  It says that the Civil Service has given its advice to Ministers fairly and honestly and that it has implemented Government decisions without reservations.  The Civil Service, the report continues, has contributed to much of what is progressive in our national life and its personnel, who include a fair share of the country's resources of talent, have adapted themselves to changing conditions within the official constraints imposed.  It concludes that the Irish Civil Service measures up well to international standards.</P>
    <P>Having said that&mdash;and it needs to be said because if one makes criticisms it is only fair to give the other side of the picture&mdash;the report goes on to make a number of suggestions about the need for changes, and these changes are rather extensive.  The first is that which I have already mentioned and deals with the undue involvement of senior officials in the daily business leaving them little time to participate in policy formulation.  It refers to the rigid application of the policy of ministerial responsibility, which means that a lot of time in the public service is spent in ensuring that the record is kept straight and that, if a question is asked, there is no possibility of the Minister being put in an awkward position.  This entails constant reference of small matters upwards to ensure that no problems arise through the application of this principle.</P>
    <P>In this House we are very sensitive to any diminution of that policy because, unless replaced by some other measure, it would result in diminishing public control of the way the country is run.  It is clear that if we need at this stage, as I think we do, to consider diminution of ministerial responsibility in certain areas, we would have to be sure that this would be accompanied by other changes to ensure public control is maintained.  The report says that senior officials are lacking the necessary staff <Col N="152" /> support in relation to planning, finance, organisation and personnel and that these matters either have no place in the present organisation or are discharged by personnel who have little or no training in these functions.  That is a very strong statement.  The report says further that the senior officials themselves are seen as lacking in training for modern administration, and they refer to the lack of an overall organisation and management service, which they see as the first most serious defect.</P>
    <P>The report refers to there being barriers of class and grade.  By this is meant class in the technical Civil Service sense and not social class.  These barriers of class and grade, continue the report, create problems as do the parallel structures of administrators and professional staff.  It refers to the overstrict control of local bodies which has diminished the responsibility and initiative of these bodies.  This is something for which we on this side of the House have been pressing for a long time.  According to the report, there is nowhere to which one can look to find out the total organisational and manpower needs of the Civil Service. Again, this is an extraordinary statement in that any organisation in this country, especially a leading one, has no way of knowing what are its ultimate needs.</P>
    <P>Lack of co-ordination and out-of-date selection procedures are also mentioned in the report.  These, it says, prevent the Civil Service from continuing to attract its fair share of talent.  It speaks of the barriers between the different Departments which prevent the flow of talent.  It refers to the lack of any system of appeal which, from the point of view of public control and, indeed, of justice, is a very serious defect as far as members of the public are concerned.</P>
    <P>The report refers also to the builtin resentment of change in the present public service and says there is no attempt to measure utility against cost. Individual Departments are criticised at great length but I shall not go into these criticisms now because they are more appropriate to the Votes and can <Col N="153" /> be dealt with when the Votes are being taken for the various Departments.</P>
    <P>All of these criticisms are serious and require a fundamental change if we are to right the situation.  It is disturbing to find how much the Civil Service is impeded from dealing with problems because of persistent recruitment problems.  Those of us on the Committee of Public Accounts have had occasion to notice time and again the situations arising where matters have not yet been dealt with because of lack of staff.  The staff are not there because the present recruiting system is not producing them. The figures in this respect are incredibly depressing.  For example, out of 1,278 candidates only 56 appointments had been made to executive grade during the year 1968 up to the time the report was prepared.  In order to get those 56 people, it was necessary to go down the list to the six hundredth candidate so that ten out of 11 people who had applied and had been offered a position had turned it down.  This is in marked contrast to what was the position at an earlier stage.  Other figures show that 40 per cent of the professional posts are left unfilled.</P>
    <P>The picture in regard to recruitment is appalling.  In fact if one were to get this same sort of picture in relation to any other organisation, one would probably dismiss the entire management and start all over again.  That this should have happened is no credit to the Civil Service.  I recognise, of course, that the blame is political. Responsibility lies with the Minister to do something about such a situation. However, I am not sure that he has always been helped because the resistance to change in the public service and the arguments put forward that recruitment procedures cannot be changed must be very persuasive to any Minister.  Therefore, while the Minister is responsible and must take the blame, he has not always been helped by the negative attitudes within the public service to proposals for reform and recruitment.</P>
    <P>These, then, are some of the problems facing us and my fears are that they will not be tackled.  What is said <Col N="154" /> in the Budget speech with regard to recruitment is ominous.  It says that the adaptation of recruitment procedures will be continued.  If we are to have a continuance of what has been going on in the past, whereby year after year the situation becomes worse in regard to the problem of quality, we are in for a very serious time indeed.</P>
    <P>The Civil Service has been living on its fat for a long time.  Decade after decade they have succeeded in recruiting the most intelligent people from the schools because heretofore there was no alternative for school leavers. University education was not open to most of these people.  In some cases the senior cycle of the secondary school examinations was not open to them. The Civil Service, consequently, were able to take in people at low salaries but this does not apply any longer because other opportunities are now available.</P>
    <P>According to this report the proportion of those we are now appointing to the very important post of assistant principal, who got a full-day university education on leaving school is lower than the total of the population now getting that education.  They have fallen so far behind that promotion to the top posts in the Civil Service contains a lesser number of people who got a university education after leaving school than is actually happening to ordinary school leavers at the moment.  In other words, the education level in those terms of the highest level in the Civil Service is now lower than the education level of the ordinary school leaver of the country.</P>
    <P>That is an extraordinary indication of the failure to recruit university graduates.  During the past few years the total number of university graduates recruited to the administrative officer grade has been only seven per annum.  It is difficult to find words strong enough to speak of the situation. One can only hope that the Budget speech is simply saying that &ldquo;We have not bothered to look at the Devlin report yet but we will have a look at it someday and take a decision.&rdquo; The Devlin report has been out now for six months and there should have been time for decisions.  If the Government have taken decisions, and if <Col N="155" /> these are the decisions, then we are ditched and the prospect of getting the kind of public service that will see us through the seventies and the eighties is minimal.  I only hope the Government here, like Governments elsewhere, have failed to take decisions.  It is absurd that that should be one's highest hope, but it is one's highest hope in this regard.  Six months should be long enough to take some decisions on reports of this kind.</P>
    <P>When we talk of recruitment we are talking of the people who will formulate policy in this country in the first 15 years of the 21st century.  Unless there is a change, the policy we will be formulating will be a policy formulated by people who are now entering the public service.  They will be the 56th appointee and 600 down the list.  This is the way we are staffing our public service for the challenge of the 21st century.  That is how serious our situation is.  When we join the EEC we will be expected to have a staff not alone capable of doing the work here but capable also of dealing with civil servants of other countries on equal terms.  We will have to compete on equal terms with the existing staff in Brussels.  From that point of view the position becomes all the more worrying.</P>
    <P>Remembering the way in which we have allowed our talents to run down how can we hope to face this situation with any equanimity?  It is most important that we should be able to help the staff in Brussels.  Three weeks ago a senior official said to me: &ldquo;Do not underestimate this; the quality of these people will greatly influence what happens to you in the Common Market in the years ahead.&rdquo;  He said that the Germans had sent rather poor personnel in the beginning and they are still suffering and losing out because the people they have there should, as a result of their own past experience and remembering what the German problems are, be making sure that these problems are not overlooked.  But that is not the position because the quality is not as high as it should be. On the other hand, the French have dominated the whole exercise from the <Col N="156" /> beginning.  In relation to one particular policy, which was of importance to Luxembourg, the Luxembourg representative more than held his own because he happens to be a man of great brilliance.</P>
    <P>That is the kind of situation with which we will be faced.  Can we afford in a rundown Civil Service the number of people we require and can we be sure that the Civil Service can provide the expert personnel required? Have we got the qualified people in the administrative posts in the Civil Service?  Remember other countries have not the same peculiar approach to qualified personnel that there is in this country where qualified personnel are used merely as advisers.  In other countries the man who does the negotiating is highly qualified.  Here the highly qualified are not allowed to intrude. They are allowed to advise. They are not allowed to negotiate.  How will we negotiate with the French with their extraordinary high educational level?</P>
    <P>God knows, from the Budget speech, one would not think we were thinking about this problem at all.  It has all been kept extraordinarily quiet.  I spoke today for a short while about the prospects I see if we manage our affairs properly.  By nature, I am not by any means gloomy.  Indeed, I have a certain record for optimism, running at times to overoptimism, as in 1965 when I misjudged the trends, and I cannot claim credit for being more percipient than the Department of Finance.  In the beginning of my speech I tried to sketch the kind of picture which may result and the growth prospects.  I can see us in the eighties reaching the point when some of our problems will be nearing solution, but then I had to point out how the failure of the Government to produce an incomes policy and the inappropriate character of the Budget is threatening the possibilities for the future because we could so disrupt our economy that it would take us many years to recover.</P>
    <P>I looked then at the kind of Civil Service we need to ensure the realities can be fully reached and that the changes in the shape of our society that such growth would make possible <Col N="157" /> would be achieved.  I looked at the kind of public service we have and whether it would be capable of reaping all the advantages and I had to express great doubts about that. Another optimism I have is conditional on a sudden change of heart on the part of the Government who have shown themselves both complacent and inept in recent times, the Government who in the past have operated rather differently.  There have been periods in which the management of economic affairs has been good.  That must be said.  I do not think there was any period in which their management of social policy was good but they are now being pushed into social policies, somewhat belatedly, by this party, giving adequate priorities to social demands.</P>
    <P>In the past their economic policies have been sound.  Under the guidance of certain public servants and under the leadership of the former Taoiseach, Mr. Lemass, whose economic performance was considerable, this country made economic progress.  Under his successor it now looks like making a very severe economic retreat.  That has to be said.  I would not be doing my job if I did not make these points.  Any optimism I have about the future is subject to grave doubts about the immediate future and grave concern lest failure to tackle this problem could undermine the stability of our economy in such fashion as to make it difficult or almost impossible to retrieve the situation.  Let no one think we could get out of that situation by adjusting the value of the £.  That might be an irretrievable step leading to a continuous running down and permanent stagnation.  South America has discovered that.  We could become another South America.  The danger is there.  If we overcome that danger we then face the problem of having a public service adequate to the needs of the task to be performed.  That could be our Achilles heel because of our failure over 50 years of independence to do anything to change the structure of our public service and we could move into the next century still handicapped and incapable of reaping all the advantages of the full economic potential of this country.  That is what the Devlin report is telling us.  The failure of the Government <Col N="158" /> to come to grips with that problem is, in the long run, most serious; just as their failure, in the short term, to cope with the economic situation is likely to lead to economic disaster.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>We have listened to a detailed speech from Deputy FitzGerald and an equally detailed dissertation from the Minister for Health.  In many ways this is a surprising Budget.  It has surprised the economists, the Press and other categories of our society.  It was somewhat unexpected.  All the reports from the Central Bank, the Department of Finance and the NIEC pointed to a difficult economic situation.  That has not always been the trend.  It would seem that this situation is of our own making.</P>
      <P>I can recall a somewhat similar situation culminating in the credit squeeze of June, 1965.  That, too, was of our own making.  It was something initiated at that time for purely political reasons.  In the spring of 1963 the then Taoiseach, Mr. Lemass, produced a White Paper called <i>Closing the Gap</i> adumbrating the various economic difficulties facing us at the time.  We had the usual jargon, to which I have become accustomed, about wages, salaries and productivity.  His thesis was the old one, that production had not kept pace with increased salary and wage demands and that we should tighten our belts. Some saw in this a threatened wage freeze.  This was followed in the Budget of that year by the introduction for the first time of the turnover tax of 2½ per cent.  That 6d in the £ caused an outcry. It was debated at length here and particularly opposed on this side of the House on the basis that it was an indirect form of taxation to which many had objection and particularly on the basis that, as a broadly-based tax, it hit the income of the less well-off section of the community.  It was nonselective. It did exclude some things like agricultural requirements, fertilisers and machinery and I think, pharmaceutical bills for veterinary but not for human purposes.  This is the same turnover tax which it is now proposed to double.  The Government became very unpopular.  It was a minority Government at that time ruling with the help of three Independents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="159" /> Subsequently a by-election took place in a Dublin constituency and Deputy Paddy Belton was successful.  The election was largely fought on the turnover tax and about 6,000 people who, it appeared, had previously voted for the Government, voted for the Opposition. This alarmed Mr. Lemass.  Shortly afterwards a Deputy from a Cork constituency died.  One month afterwards, when in the ordinary accepted fashion the Taoiseach should come into the House to move the writ for the by-election, he did something quite different.  I do not know and have never been able to find out whether he did this with the knowledge and consent of the Cabinet but it was something unprecedented.  He wrote to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the Federated Union of Employers telling them that the economy was now so good, sound and progressive that salary improvements all round were in order and that a national wage adjustment would be favourably considered by the Government.</P>
    <P>It was clear that this was an exaggerated statement.  It is difficult to understand that an economy which was in a precarious position in the spring, requiring the issue of the White Paper <i>Closing the Gap</i> had, in a period of a few months, become so sound that the Taoiseach felt he should announce to the nation that a spending spree was &ldquo;on&rdquo;.  Congress knew that they had the Taoiseach across a barrel.  Negotiations were begun.  They broke down but the Taoiseach prevailed on the parties to re-assemble.  Negotiations again broke down.  The Taoiseach was advised at that time by his economic advisers that the economy could not stand the percentage wage increase being demanded.  Eventually, the parties were persuaded to meet for the third time and on that occasion an agreement was reached.  The famous 12 per cent increase was put into operation, but not immediately. It took some time to organise that. In the meantime another Deputy died, the late Deputy William Norton, and we were faced with two by-elections, in Cork and Kildare.</P>
    <P>These two by-elections were deliberately <Col N="160" /> delayed by the Government in order to secure the political advantages of the 12 per cent wage increase. Ultimately, the elections were held after long delay and in time for the increase to have reached the pockets of the people voting in the by-elections. The Government won both seats.  This was an outrageous political performance perpetrated on the people by the then Taoiseach.  An inflationary era was deliberately initiated in order to secure political advantage.  I mention this because history has a habit of repeating itself, a lesson the Irish people should learn.  That upset in our economy was not brought to the notice of the people by our economic advisers or by political economists of the type of Deputy Dr. FitzGerald, who has been speaking here, although it was obvious for a considerable time from bank reports that our economy was in a difficult, inflationary position.</P>
    <P>The situation culminated in a credit squeeze and the economic collapse of June, 1965, when Deputy Lynch, the present Taoiseach, had to come to the House and say pathetically: &ldquo;What happened to my last Budget?&rdquo; Admittedly, a general election occurred in the meantime but the precarious economic position of the country prior to that election was not disclosed. None of our economic advisers adverted to it, nor did we hear a word from any of the NIEC gentlemen in these days.  The only indication, perhaps, was contained in the bank reports.  Yet, it was quite obvious that the situation was bad.  It was disguised and was not revealed or made obvious to the community at large until the general election was safely in the pocket of Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>This is the pattern which has beset our economic progress.  We have an apparently straightforward Budget and then the next Budget is tailored to meet some political situation, a general election or a vital by-election.  This is the &ldquo;stop-go&rdquo; type of economics for which we have no one to blame but ourselves.  In the instance which I mentioned, the 12 per cent wage increase, there was no outside pressure on our economy.  Our terms of trade were good.  There was nothing whatsoever <Col N="161" /> to force us to take that gamble with the economy&mdash;a gamble which Mr. Lemass took, a gamble which did not come off, a gamble which caused a recession in our economy from which we began to recover only a couple of years ago.</P>
    <P>This was reflected in my own constituency at the time.  We paid dearly for the Cork and Kildare by-elections. In my constituency at that time we had £2 million worth of regional water schemes ready to be done.  The contracts were given for some of them. All these were put in cold storage.  One excuse after another was offered.  At present those regional schemes have been completely dwarfed and cut down because we have not even been, as yet, able to get the necessary finance to do that work.  That finance would have been available at that time were it not for the economic recession which was politically induced by the then leader of the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
    <P>We had a repetition of the same kind of behaviour in more recent times. Everyone can remember quite distinctly about a year ago when the Minister for Finance announced that we were facing a difficult economic situation.  Yet, a short time later when we were facing a general election, suddenly the economy had improved and the Minister was able to go on television and give an impression to the people at large that the economy was all right.  He was able to back that up by a relatively mild Budget last year. Everyone thought that was the precursor of a difficult mini-Budget in the autumn but that did not materialise. The restrictive measures for the cooling of the economy which the economic advisers have been advocating have not been introduced.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach, acting for the Minister for Finance, mentioned social concern.  It has always been the boast of the Fianna Fáil Party that they are the party with a social conscience.  I find it hard to reconcile that with certain developments in relation to two fields of activity.  The first is the question of housing and the second is the question of an emigrant welfare service, something we have not got at all. There is nothing in this Budget, nor have I ever seen anything in any <Col N="162" /> Budget by any Minister for Finance, to suggest the institution of any form of emigrant welfare service.</P>
    <P>We were described by the late Deputy Norton as the only dying white race in the world.  In proportion to our population we have the highest emigrant rate.  I do not know whether there are coloured races which have a higher emigrant rate than ours.  I doubt it.  Certainly, of all the white races we have the highest rate of emigration and have had it for many, many years.  Yet, since the State was founded&mdash;and this is a reflection not only upon Fianna Fáil but upon all of us&mdash;practically nothing whatsoever has been done at State level to help the thousands and thousands of emigrants who have left this country.  In spite of some little improvement which I understand has taken place in recent years, our figure for emigration is an appalling one.</P>
    <P>According to the OECD statistics for 1968, between 1926 and 1966 half the people born here had to earn their livelihood outside Ireland.  That is an appalling record.  In the face of that we can hardly speak&mdash;neither Fianna Fáil nor the rest of us perhaps&mdash;about our social conscience because we have done nothing whatsoever to provide even the bare skeleton of a social welfare service for people who had to leave this country, most of them in poor economic circumstances, often badly educated, and all we have to offer them is steerage on an emigrant ship.  If they are successful through their own efforts, if they achieve a niche in society, we are the first to claim them.  If they happen to fall by the wayside, for which we must bear certain moral responsibilities, we disown them.  This is the social conscience which we exhibit.  Down through the years nothing has been done in any Budget.  At present in Birmingham and London, Irish centres are, on a miserable budget, by voluntary effort, trying to provide some guidance and some help for our emigrants when they leave this country to earn their livelihood in various cities in England.  They are frightfully short of funds.  They are mostly religious bodies who do this work.  Their capital is limited, yet no <Col N="163" /> help has been forthcoming from this country.</P>
    <P>I admit that we have embassy services and so on, but they are of little use to the ordinary labourer arriving at Euston Station who does not know where to get a roof over his head.  The irony of the situation is that, down through the years, we have been living on these emigrants.  We speak here with puffed out arrogance about our affluent society.  We are just a race of pensioners.  We are pensioners upon the most oppressed section of our society for whom we have been unable to provide employment in their own country.</P>
    <P>According to the data furnished by the Government the amount in respect of remittances from emigrants at present is approaching a figure of £20 million per year.  From 1926 to 1966 half of our population have had to find employment outside these shores.  I venture to ask if I am wrong in saying that 50 per cent of our tourists are Irish or of Irish extraction?  It is claimed that the tourist industry accounts for £100 million per year and that we are getting £40 million profit on that.  If half of our tourists are Irish or of Irish extraction we can easily add a substantial amount to the figure of £20 million in respect of remittances from emigrants.</P>
    <P>On one occasion I put down a Parliamentary question to the then Minister for External Affairs, Deputy Aiken.  The request I made was very simple: I asked him if he would arrange to provide some guidance leaflets at every point of outlet from this country, which leaflets would be handed to people leaving, giving a list of social centres and places at which emigrants who might not have any address to go to would find a refuge. I got one of the shortest answers ever given in this House&mdash;&ldquo;No&rdquo; and then the Minister sat down.  I was so surprised that I did not recover myself in time and the Minister got away with it.</P>
    <P>Since the State was founded that has been the extent of the help we have provided for our emigrants.  We speak of social concern but it seems to me <Col N="164" /> our concern is closely interwoven with the question of votes.  Our emigrants have not got votes and therefore, we have no social concern for them. Apparently that attitude is considered quite sufficient as we go into the 1970s. This has been a very neglected matter and it is something of which we should be ashamed.  We have failed to face up to our moral obligations in this regard. In so far as we have the highest emigrant rate of any white nation in the world we should be giving an example in the matter of caring for our emigrants.</P>
    <P>I have been an emigrant myself in England and I am well aware of the conditions obtaining there.  I know other countries with a smaller rate of emigration provide help for their people.  For example, I well remember whenever a German national was in England, working either on a short-term basis or even on an educational or study tour, a German welfare official immediately contacted him to see everything was all right and that he was not being exploited.  We, however, have no such similar service for our emigrants.  This is a matter that has not been mentioned in any Budget speech or by any Minister and I am raising it for the first time in order to alert the Government.  The way in which we treat our emigrants is a blemish on this country.  If we have not a social conscience let us at least have national pride and do something about the matter.  Our resources are adequate to provide some small subvention, even if only to aid the existing voluntary units which operate on a shoestring in London and Birmingham.</P>
    <P>Another aspect is the question of our housing.  I have forgotten how much is provided in the capital Budget for housing but much play has been made about what we are doing in this matter.  It is true that recently the figures for housing have improved as regards the total number built.  One of the Ministers quoted a figure of 14,000 houses, which I had not heard before.  The last figure I got for 1968-69 was 13,000 odd; in other words the number of houses built had not reached the 14,000 mark achieved at the time of the inter-Party Governments. Admittedly, in the last decade <Col N="165" /> the total number of houses built has nearly reached the number built during the two inter-Party Governments. However, there is one fundamental difference and this is where the question of social conscience and concern arises.  There has been a complete policy switch in the matter of housing. Two-thirds of our houses are privately owned.  This is in contradistinction to what obtains in many European countries, in Northern Ireland and possibly in Britain.</P>
    <P>The tendency in recent years has been to switch from local authority housebuilding to grant-aided building. It is economically attractive to any Government which wants to get credit for building a large number of houses without spending too much money.  It is much cheaper for a Government to pay the £275 for grant-aided houses than to provide local authority housing. However this is socially unjust because it means that houses are not being provided for the sections of our community who are unable to provide accommodation for themselves.  The switch to grant-aided housing also means that many people in the borderline class are being hard pressed to provide homes for themselves; they are compelled to go to insurance companies, building societies and banks to try to raise the necessary money.  In many cases they should properly be regarded as eligible for housing by the local authorities.</P>
    <P>The majority of houses built in the decade following 1948 were local authority houses whereas now the majority are grant-aided.  There is no subterfuge about it; it is Government policy and, while it is economically sound, it is socially unjust.  When I hear the Minister in his speech talking about concern for the less privileged sections of our society I am at a loss to reconcile that change of policy with the notion of social concern and conscience.</P>
    <P>I stress this point because, with the exception of a small number of houses now being provided by the National Building Agency, these grant-aided houses are not available to poor people.  Therefore they are compelled to go to the banks, to insurance companies <Col N="166" /> or building societies in order to secure the wherewithal to provide a house for themselves.</P>
    <P>As regards the Budget in general, having read the various reports which were posted out to us beforehand, I felt we would be faced with a Budget of a different type, and that we would be given some indication of the Government's thinking for the years ahead. We have had here a very bad history as regards industrial relations for the past few years.  This stemmed largely from the days of Mr. Lemass when he upset the economy and threw us into the inflationary spiral back in 1933 and 1934, an inflationary spiral from which we have not yet recovered.</P>
    <P>I believed that at this time the Minister for Finance would have taken cognisance of the difficulties we were facing, that the time had arrived when some effort should be made to place us in a more competitive position, particularly as we are said to be approaching entry to the Common Market.  I do agree that perhaps in certain respects the Minister for Finance has brought us into some parallel with Europe in so far as he has placed emphasis on indirect taxation, the turnover tax, as a type of taxation which can be easily and readily adapted to the added value tax which is operated in Europe.  That is one point in favour of his method of thinking.  The second point is that we have a poor social welfare structure here.  We are not a rich country, but having regard to the necessity for harmonisation of taxation and fiscal structures and of the social welfare structure with corresponding structures in the Common Market, it may be claimed this is a move in the right direction.  The Minister is also raising our social welfare benefits somewhat on the same lines as obtain over there, but not to the same extent. Our social welfare system is much inferior to what obtains even in the countries of comparable income like Italy.</P>
    <P>Be that as it may, those are the points which may be cited in favour of the type of Budget the Minister has introduced.  However, it is also arguable, and it is offered as sound economics, that if the economy is <Col N="167" /> overheated and the country threatened with inflation you must cool the economy.  One of the methods is to take some of the money out of circulation. What a person has not got in his pocket he cannot spend.</P>
    <P>Consumer spending here has been increasing rapidly in the past couple of years.  If anybody here goes into the ballad sessions in County Limerick, County Tipperary or anywhere else he will find they are filled with people who are prepared to drink and smoke and they have motor cars outside. Therefore, there is quite a considerable degree of non-productive consumer spending at the present time. The Minister for Finance, seeing that situation and knowing that our competitive position was deteriorating, should say to himself: &ldquo;There is too much money in circulation,&rdquo; however it got into circulation, whether it was too much bank credit being given out, too much by way of increases in salaries and wages, or too much profit. People with too much money will spend too much, import too much; our production costs go up and our exports go down.</P>
    <P>In that situation I can easily see the Minister would be anxious, by taxation, to take up that spare money. That will cool the economy, cut down costs and stabilise prices, that is, if the system of taxation is acceptable to the community at large.  This increase in turnover tax which the Minister has introduced might have been popular at a later stage.  In the atmosphere obtaining at the present time I think it was bad psychology and bad economics.  It will not be effective if it is followed by increased demands for rising incomes and rising salaries and wages.  The turnover tax will aggravate still further the notion in the ordinary shopkeeper's mind that he is becoming more and more a tax collector.  It will be at once apparent to the salaried classes and the trade unions that &ldquo;Here is more taxation placed on top of us and we shall have to demand a further round of wages to compensate for that&rdquo;.  Being direct taxation affecting everybody, it is traditionally anathema to trade <Col N="168" /> unions and a number of salaried people, and I do not think the concessions given with regard to income tax will compensate for the general attitude of the public towards an increase of that kind of taxation.</P>

      <P>The turnover tax will put something on the price of cigarettes but this Budget has not specifically taxed beer, spirits or cigarettes.  I do not think anyone who takes a drink minds paying the tax on it, because it is a luxury and the tax he is paying on it is helping some poor person.  The only objection to increasing the tax on cigarettes and drink is if the law of diminishing returns becomes operative, but there is no sign of that.  Certainly, the bars that I frequent have never done such a roaring business as they are doing now and I do not think an extra few pence tax on beer or spirits would make that much difference.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">

    <Speaker pid="PatHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that.  I understand cigarette advertising on RTE is to cease at the end of this year.  It has been claimed that cigarettes cause one-sixth or one-seventh of the total deaths in society.  If cigarettes are as pernicious <Col N="169" /> as that, should the Minister for Finance not proceed with taxation in the hope of making people stop smoking?  It would be difficult both socially and financially to do so immediately, but eventually it should be possible to arrive at the time when cigarette smoking will cease to be a habit.</P>
      <P>It is essential that the Government draw up a prices and incomes policy. When Fine Gael first mentioned a prices and incomes policy in their policy document during the 1965 General Election not many people on the other side of the House treated it very seriously.  In fact, the mere idea of price control was regarded as being something which would be impossible to implement, but it should be possible to implement such a policy in a small community.  I remember when Fine Gael first mentioned giving the Central Bank more teeth as regards credit control&mdash;a method of monetary control accepted everywhere&mdash;the idea was pooh-poohed by Mr. Lemass.  It was regarded as a daft departure and nothing more.  Now it is accepted practice; but it took a long time to get it across to the other side of the House that the Central Bank should operate in the same way as central banks operate in other countries.  I do not know why there is a resistance to a prices and incomes policy.  If we had had one several years ago I think it would have obviated some of our industrial relations problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="170" /> I think the Minister for Finance has made a mistake in introducing this kind of Budget instead of introducing the traditional type of Budget with mildly restrictive measures to cool the economy.  There would have been less objection to a switch from formal direct taxation to indirect taxation. Everybody is now a taxpayer in one form or another, whether it is by PAYE or any other method, and the Minister should have pursued a selective type of taxation on the old reliables namely, beer, spirits and cigarettes.</P>
    <P>I was disappointed that only slight reference was made to the Devlin report. Deputy FitzGerald has dealt at length with the question of recruitment to the Civil Service.  As a member of the Public Accounts Committee I hear accounting officers from every Department telling the same story: that it is nearly impossible to get satisfactory recruitment in our Civil Service.  Something is fundamentally wrong.  I recognise there is a brain drain from the less opulent to the more opulent countries. We lose many people to Great Britain and in the same way Great Britain loses many people to the United States.</P>
