      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach the total exports to and the <Col N="1908" /> total imports from communist countries for 1965 and 1969; and what the Government intends to do about the imbalance of trade with these countries.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to circulate, with the Official Report, a tabular statement setting out the information sought in the first part of the question.</P>
      <P>In the case of countries with which we have an adverse trade balance, the general aim is to seek to improve the position by encouraging the expansion of exports.</P>
      <P>The question of what special action might be taken to secure an increase in exports to State-trading countries, particularly those with whom our trade is in serious imbalance, is kept under continuous review by the Government Departments concerned.  During the past year a trade agreement has been concluded with Bulgaria and preliminary discussions on questions of trade, including the possibility of concluding trade agreements, have taken place with a number of the other countries concerned, namely, the USSR, Poland and Czechslovakia. Discussions with Rumania are being arranged.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is, no doubt, aware, the Government, through Córas Tráchtála, has made a wide range of grants, incentives and other services available to exporters.  As part of its range of services, Córas Tráchtála established an office in Vienna early this year which has special responsibility for developing exports to Eastern Europe.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach the total number of people at work during 1951; the total number at work at the latest available date in 1970; the reduction expressed as a percentage of total number of people; and the reasons for the reduction.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>The total number of persons at work in the State in April, 1951, was 1,217,000.  The corresponding figure for 1970 is not yet available, the most recent estimate being that for 1969.  In 1969 the total at work was 1,069,000, representing a reduction of 12.2 per cent on the 1951 figure.</P>
      <P>Over the period 1951 to 1969, the number at work in agriculture, forestry and fishing declined by 195,000 while in non-agricultural economic activity the number at work increased by 47,000.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>According to the figures the Parliamentary Secretary has given there has been a reduction of about 100,000 people at work since 1951 despite the promises made by Fianna Fáil in the past to give employment to our own people.  Is that not true?  It is to be seen plainly in Donegal and Leitrim that our own people are being banished from the land of Ireland especially from the small farms.</P>

      <P>Do the Parliamentary Secretary's figures, if they mean anything, not prove that over 100,000 people have been driven out of jobs and employment since 1951, under a Fianna Fáil Government?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>They have not been driven out of jobs.  The Deputy is relating the figures to Donegal and Leitrim, which is typical.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>The employment allowance was introduced in 1934.  On the basis of the consumer price index numbers, it is estimated that £1 at mid-August, 1934, would purchase the same quantum of goods and services at retail prices as would £4 18s 8d at mid-August, 1970.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs if he will state, with reference to the Recommendation on the position of Greek refugees which was adopted by the Consultative Assembly of the Council of Europe on 20th April last, whether the Government is prepared to reconsider this Recommendation in the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe with the aim of improving the precarious situation of the Greeks in exile by the joint payment to the Council of Europe Resettlement Fund of a total sum of 100,000 dollars.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for External Affairs (Dr. Hillery)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Committee of Ministers' Deputies in Strasbourg decided to send Recommendation 602 on the position of Greek refugees to Governments inviting them to give effect as far as possible <Col N="1912" /> to the first six proposals in the Recommendation.  However, they were unable to agree to the seventh proposal for a joint payment of a total sum of $100,000 to the Council of Europe Resettlement Fund for the purpose of improving the situation of Greeks who have left their country for political reasons.  As this conclusion was reached after lengthy and careful consideration of all aspects of the matter including the humanitarian one the Government does not consider that reconsideration of the Recommendation on this subject would serve any useful purpose.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen the reply to which the Deputy refers.  The reply in dealing with Ireland, adverts to my statements at the opening of the negotiations with the European Communities on 30th June and at the meeting with the Communities on 21st September in which I said that the Government accept the Treaties of Rome and Paris, their political objectives and the decisions taken in their implementation.  This, of course, has been the position taken by the Irish Government since our application for membership of the Communities was first made in 1961 and it is the basis on which the negotiations with this country and with the other applicant countries are taking place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister noted the manner in which our agreement that our neutrality was not in question in the negotiations has been used to thwart Sweden's desire to maintain her neutrality?  Has the Minister noted the effect which our abandonment of insistence on our neutrality has had on other applicants for entry into the EEC?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>A <i>sine quo non</i> of negotiating was that an applicant country would accept the Treaty of Rome and the political implications and implement them.  It is only because we accepted these that we are negotiating. Sweden was not able to accept the Treaty of Rome in that form.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Presumably Sweden is as well acquainted with the clauses of the Treaty of Rome as are the Minister and his officials. Sweden is seeking to maintain her neutral status.  Our application never sought to maintain our neutral status. Does the Minister observe how our negotiating procedure has been used to thwart the Swedes, for example, in their legitimate desire to maintain their neutrality?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not understand how the Deputy owes more loyalty to Sweden than he does to Ireland.  Applications were accepted on the basis that applicants accepted the Treaties of <Col N="1915" /> Rome and Paris.  If they said they could not accept, and are not negotiating, that is not my problem.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not require us to abandon the neutral status but what we sought since 1961 was co-operation on monetary and foreign policy matters. Of the Six already existing in the EEC, there are many conflicting areas of foreign policy.  Political co-operation is sought and, in an effort to bring about co-operation, we are willing to follow this is the years ahead and to participate. Already, a spokesman of one of the Six, speaking here, said he could not envisage a situation where any major political decisions would be made in the Community against the will of any one member.  I do not think the Deputy need be too much afraid of what would happen.  We would be members of the Community evolving towards political co-operation.  We are willing to accept the Treaty of Rome and its political implications: without that acceptance, we would not be negotiating.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>There was room for change between our position in 1961 and that taken in the second phase after the lapse of so many years. Our application in 1961, which we have slavishly followed in the present one, assumed what the Treaty of Rome did not ask us to assume: the Treaty of Rome did not specifically request us to abandon neutrality.  This is something specifically offered by our Fianna Fáil negotiators.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if he is aware of the public dissatisfaction that sentences imposed on persons and gangs convicted of robbery, theft and using knives do not effectively discourage such crimes; and if he will introduce legislation to increase the maximum sentence which may be imposed in such cases and to provide for minimum sentences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. O'Malley) Desmond J. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of any general dissatisfaction at the penalties imposed for offences of the kind referred to.  I should like to have it understood that the newspaper reports of court hearings may not convey the full picture of all the circumstances as they emerge at the hearing, simply because of the need to summarise by reason of the pressure on newspaper space and, on occasion, a very reasonable sentence in all the circumstances can appear unduly lenient if considered in the light of the newspaper reports alone.</P>
      <P>The maximum sentences that may be imposed for the offences in question are severe by any standards.  They range from five years penal servitude in the case of simple larceny to penal servitude for life in the case of such offences as armed robbery and assault with intent to cause serious bodily harm which succeeds in its intention. Of course, a large proportion of the less serious offences in these categories are, with the consent of the accused person, tried in the district court, which cannot impose a penalty greater than 12 months imprisonment.  But before it can assume jurisdiction the district court must be of opinion that the facts proved or alleged constitute a minor offence fit to be tried summarily.</P>
      <P>It would, in my opinion, be futile to seek to impose a minimum sentence for these offences.  Any such penalty would have to be very low to allow for the great variety of circumstances that can attend the offences and the courts would naturally tend to find it difficult to convict at all in cases where they were satisfied that the minimum penalty was on the high side in relation to the facts of the case before them.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister not aware that there is grave dissatisfaction about this especially in the city of Dublin?  Is he aware that a man stole a car from Dublin, drove 100 miles, shot a man, robbed him, came back and threw the gun into a river on the way back, stole another car and got a two years suspensory sentence and the man is out scot-free?  Is he not further aware that last year a man knifed a policeman and got away scot-free?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>In my reply I commented in general on the matters raised by the Deputy.  It can be very misleading at times to conclude from a newspaper report which, as I say, must necessarily be condensed and which may not get the point of the case at all, that the penalties in any particular case are inadequate.  I am not saying that in every case the penalties are adequate.  From time to time I receive complaints in relation to particular cases but the Deputy and the House will appreciate that it is not my function to take up the question with individual judges or justices of the adequacy or otherwise of the penalties imposed by them.  To do so would be very unwise of me.  The independence of the justices is very valuable&mdash;so valuable that every effort should be made to maintain it.</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 32 and 33 together.</P>
      <P>The employment allowance was introduced in 1934-35.  The allowance varied from county to county and, in respect of that year, ranged from a maximum of £2 18s 10d in County Meath to a maximum of £5 8s 4d in County Kerry.  Those figures are not comparable with the present standard maximum employment allowance of £17, in respect of which no change is at present contemplated, which is paid in relief of the balance of the rates remaining after the deduction of the primary allowance now 100 per cent and the supplementary allowance.</P>

      <P>In view of the fact that this £17 allowance was introduced in 1934 and that since then about 80,000 workers have left employment on the land, would the Minister not now consider increasing this figure to encourage farmers, especially small farmers, to employ more people?</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 34 and 35 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a normal feature of local government administration that at any time the number and value of projects which are at various stages of planning or are the subject of consultations or correspondence between my Department and local authorities are considerable&mdash; covering as they do capital expenditures of the order of £45 million in the current financial year.  It would not be possible without using an inordinate amount of staff time to list all of those projects or to calculate the precise amount of money involved.  Many projects <Col N="1936" /> undertaken by local authorities do not, in fact, require specific sanction.</P>
    <P>If the Deputy is referring to projects for which local authorities have submitted proposals for the acceptance of tenders, the number of such proposals at present is about 50 and the estimated total expenditure involved is slightly less than £2 million.  Those projects are being examined generally on technical grounds.  Capital expenditure by local authorities on them and on other projects in the current financial year, even taking into account the disruption caused by the cement strike and other factors, will be a record and should exceed last year's expenditure by about £7 million.</P>
    <P>There are no tender proposals from Westmeath County Council at present awaiting sanction by me.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister is aware that a proposal was sanctioned to bring water to a factory in the Collinstown area.  This factory began operations a few years ago with a staff of 15 or 20 people but it is now employing more than 100 people.  However, sanction has been before the Minister's Department for the past four or five months.</P>

      <P>The total amounts of rates collected in 1932, 1956 and 1965 are set out in the Returns of Local Taxation for those years.  The amount collected in the financial year ended 31st March, 1970, was £40.552 million.</P>
      <P>The system of local finance and taxation has been the subject of investigation by an interdepartmental committee which has to date furnished three interim reports.  While the more long-term recommendations made by the committee are being studied, effect has already been given to some of the recommendations in the Local Government (Rates) Act, 1970.  That Act conferred a right on certain classes of ratepayers to spread their rate payments over the greater part of the year, and enabled local authorities to waive the rates liability of persons for whom payment would involve hardship. Over 6,000 people benefited from the rates waiver schemes last year.  The Government has, of course, continued its policy of protecting ratepayers from the full effect of increases in local rates by means of State grants which, this year, total £77 million.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that Fianna Fáil came into power because of a promise to derate at a time when the average rate was about 5s in the £?  Further, is he aware that the Taoiseach dangled the carrot before the people, particularly before the people of Donegal, that they were about to do something about the rates situation?  The rates in Donegal, for example, have gone up from £4 to £6 since that promise was made, while the Minister was standing idly by.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose, with your permission a Cheann Comhairle, to take Questions Nos. 41 and 42 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I share the concern of both Deputies about the substantial increase in road deaths for the first ten months of this year as indicated by provisional figures issued by the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána.  Up to the end of July last, there had been no significant increase in fatal accidents as compared with the previous year.  In the three months of August, September and October, however, the figures published show substantial increases in each <Col N="1940" /> month over the corresponding months in 1969.</P>
    <P>Accident figures for any particular month will, from time to time, rise to a new peak.  In the past this has usually been followed by a drop in a succeeding month.  The pattern of consistent and substantial increases in the last three months has, however, been so disturbing that I have requested An Foras Forbartha to carry out a survey in depth of fatal accidents which occurred in the months of August, September and October with particular reference to fatal accidents on apparently good stretches of straight road.</P>
    <P>On the wider issue, An Foras Forbartha are carrying out a detailed study of high accident locations on the main road network.  The results of the first part of this study will be available early next year, providing an analysis of all accidents in 1968 and 1969 on the most important and heavily trafficked 3,000 miles of our road network and pin-pointing high accident locations.  This will enable steps to be taken to apply remedial measures calculated to have maximum possible effect.</P>
    <P>My Department, in conjunction with other agencies, including the Safety First Association, are working incessantly to make people aware of the need for better road behaviour and of their responsibilities towards themselves and other road users.  A considerable amount of road safety literature is produced by my Department and projects in hand include the production of a special booklet for motor cyclists and a revised edition of the Rules of the Road.  Television, radio, the cinemas and the newspapers are constantly being used to publicise various aspects of road safety promotion.</P>
    <P>In recent months new safety regulations for tractors and heavy vehicles were introduced and these are soon to be followed by regulations dealing with the compulsory fitting of seat belts in cars, station wagons and light vans. Each new measure is accompanied by an extensive publicity campaign.  In addition, special steps are being taken to spread the road safety message <Col N="1941" /> through the schools.  Road safety officers appointed by the Safety First Association already cover several regions.  A further development will take place on 1st January next when a number of local authorities outside these regions will for the first time appoint road safety officers for their areas.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Deputies that so far as I and my Department are concerned no effort is being spared in increasing public awareness of the road accident problem, but I must point out that official action by itself cannot compensate for the degree of recklessness and irresponsibility which is so evident on our roads.  There is no escaping the fact that the safety of the individual lies mainly in his own hands.</P>
    <P>We are now approaching what was last year our worst month for road deaths&mdash;December.  I earnestly appeal to all road users, whether they are walking, cycling or driving, to learn the lesson so tragically taught over the past few months and to use the roads with care for themselves, a thought for the rights of others and above all with courtesy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that the standard of driving in this country is appallingly low?  If so, will he have published a driving manual, such as that published by the British Ministry of Transport, in order to educate the driving public of this country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Many measures have been taken to try to improve the standard of driving.  The driving test is one of the most recent measures taken.  If there is anything further I can do to bring about a high standard among drivers on our roads in order to reduce accidents I will certainly do it.</P>

      <P>Certain duties in relation to air pollution control are performed by health inspectors, of which there are about 160.  I am not in a position to say what proportion of the time of those officers is taken up with those duties or how many other staff are at present engaged by sanitary authorities fulltime or part time on this work.  An officer of my Department holds the post of the Chief Alkali Inspector under the Alkali etc.  Works Regulation Act, 1906.  There were no prosecutions this year or in any of the previous five years under this Act.  Statistics of prosecutions for breach of other existing air pollution controls are not available in my Department.</P>
      <P>It will be a matter for each sanitary authority to decide how many inspectors will be assigned to air pollution control duties when the Control of Atmospheric Pollution Regulations, 1970 come into force.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LukeBelton" hpid="Mr. L. Belton Mr. L. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister must be aware that if there are inspectors there should be prosecutions in a period of five years? I am sure everybody here has noticed from time to time very heavy smoke emitting from <Col N="1943" /> heavy vehicles and also pollution caused by them over the past five years. What is the use of having inspectors if no action is taken?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">

      <P>The emission of heavy smoke from vehicles is a matter for the Garda Síochána under the Road Traffic Act, 1961.  I can deal here only with matters which are the responsibility of my Department.  The only controls for which I am responsible at present are those exercisable under the Alkali, etc., Works Regulation Act, 1906, and that Act only applies in relation to certain specified industries.  The Deputy should not assume that prosecutions should have been made unless he has evidence. If the Deputy has any knowledge of these specified industries creating pollution which would warrant prosecutions, I would ask him to please bring them to my notice and I will have the matter dealt with.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that one of the great difficulties in enforcement of regulations in relation to air pollution is that the officers concerned have not the power to enter on premises to measure the degree of pollution at the point at which the smoke enters the atmosphere? They have this power in relation to water or effluent from factories which is coming into sewerage but they have not got it in relation to air pollution.  The regulations are therefore difficult to enforce and that is where the Minister should employ his energies at the moment.</P>

      <P>Under section 30 of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, a planning authority may, by notice served on the owners and occupiers of the land and any other person who may be affected, revoke or modify a permission.  In deciding whether it is expedient to serve such a notice the planning authority are restricted to considering the proper planning and development of the area of the authority.  This power may be exercised at any time before the works have been commenced or, where a change of use is concerned, at any time before the change has taken place.  The planning authority would of course be liable for compensation as a result.  An appeal lies to me against a notice served under section 30.</P>

      <P>I had just started to discuss this very important measure last Wednesday night.  I regard it as important because I have been in this House and seen the economy of this State going to pieces.  I saw thousands and thousands of people unemployed and thousands of men, women and children going to the boats.  I saw hundreds of houses idle and hundreds of houses which could not be finished <Col N="1949" /> because the money had run out.  I do not want to see that situation again. Some of the people who were responsible for allowing the economy to get into that chaotic condition at that period are still Members of this House.</P>
      <P>I am not concerned with the political affiliation of anybody, but I am concerned with the well-being of this nation.  Is it likely that Fianna Fáil, with two by-elections on their hands, would introduce a Bill of this kind unless it was necessary?  As a democrat I would like to see this matter resolved between the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the Federated Union of Employers.  In my day I chaired many conciliation meetings when there were disputes on. The chairman of a conference of this kind who would keep both sides talking would get something done. That is no reflection on the previous chairman.  I suppose he did his best, but he is not here to defend himself.</P>
      <P>People have accused the Minister of changing his mind from the hard line he had taken.  The Minister is right to have changed his mind.  As I said in this House before, it is often a good thing for any Government or Minister or individual to change their minds in the light of better knowledge.  As far as we are concerned we have not cures for all ills as other people here think they have.  I do not want this country to face again the ordeal it underwent from 1955 to 1957.  I had the sad experience of people asking me to give them their fare to England or to do this or that for them in days when I had very little myself.  We are criticised in relation to the building of houses.  The housing authority of the city and county of Dublin was just washed out within a few months of being elected.  The people talking about full employment now are the very people who did not consider the workers at that time; instead they ran away from their responsibilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a serious national position. It is not a position out of which we can gain political kudos.  It is very easy for the Opposition to say they have a cure for full employment and <Col N="1950" /> a cure for bad housing.  I have seen their crash programme for housing. There were 100,000 people unemployed; thousands and thousands of people left the country; 1,800 corporation houses were empty and many houses were left unfinished in the city and county of Dublin.  I do not want to see that situation arising again.  I know my colleague, the Minister for Finance, is trying to do everything he can, as Minister for Finance, to ensure that that position will never obtain again.  As I met the constituents I had the honour to represent at that time&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Before I was interrupted by Deputy Cluskey, who used to be a member of Dublin Corporation and was at one time Lord Mayor, I was telling the House about cases I had to deal with in Finglas and Ballyfermot during the crisis when the Labour Party, the Fine Gael Party and Clann na Poblachta were in the Coalition Government.

      <P>No political party wants to interfere with the free conciliation machinery open to employer and employee.  The Minister has been good enough to say he will meet the Trade Union Congress and do anything he can to help.  He cannot go any further than that.  He is carrying out the wishes of his party. We are not a dictatorial party.  A certain gentleman who had the honour of chairing a number of meetings referred to us as being an autocratic party.  If it is autocratic to save employment for our people then we are autocratic.  I would ask the Minister to do everything in his power to save employment, to see that hospitals and houses are built and to see that in every budget social services are improved for the weaker section.</P>
      <P>We are all sick of listening to the nonsense we hear from the pro-socialist organisations: &ldquo;Labour near decision&rdquo;.  I have never heard the Labour Party make a constructive statement in the 27 years I have been a Member of this House.  It is very easy to criticise and tear things asunder from time to time but I appeal to the people, no matter what their political views are, to think nationally on this occasion and ask themselves what Government will serve them best instead of listening to this phoney stuff about full employment and a crash programme for housing.</P>

      <P>Having listened to the socialists' programme, may I say to the pros&mdash;I would not call them pro-socialists&mdash;that we on this side of the House are Christian socialists!  At budget time we try to distribute the money at our disposal in the best way we can to help the weaker sections of the community.  We are concerned with all sections of the community and not just one section only.  We are trying to ensure that no section goes hungry and that no section goes without shelter.  If that is not Christian socialism of the highest degree I do not know what it is.  If it is a mortal sin to try to save people's jobs and the economy of the country then we are guilty.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is quite properly accepting his responsibility.  If the Labour Party Deputies were constructive instead of destructive they would get more support because people would appreciate they were a responsible party.  There are people who, from public platforms at the moment, are painting us as dictators, interfering with free bargaining, with this, that and the other.  Would those people like to see us back in the position in which the country was in 1956 and 1957?  There were thousands unemployed.  There was economic chaos.  There was depression. There was neither a loan nor a grant for houses.  If one owed a bank £2 one got a letter telling one to pay up.  The Coalition Government rocked the boat. Believe it or not, there was not the price of a bag of cement in the kitty. There were promises and nothing but <Col N="1953" /> promises.  These were the people who were going to cure all our ills.  The present leader of the Labour Party was a Minister in that Government.  There was no political foresight in that Government and we are still suffering from the consequences of that curious lack. It took Fianna Fáil six years to get over the appalling mismanagement of the Coalition Government.</P>

      <P>I shall never again seek economic advice from the Deputy. He is a gracious, kindly man but his economic philosophy is not successful. I came into this House in 1944.  We had built up certain assets in Britain during the war years and these assets were dissipated during the period in office of the inter-Party Government.  I heard the fallacies preached.  We were building hotels so that tourists could eat our food.  Our tourist industry was bound to fail.  At that time our tourist industry was worth less than £1 million.  Now it is worth almost £100 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No one likes to see a Bill of this kind introduced, least of all the Minister.  It would be much easier for the Minister to pretend that everything in the garden was lovely.  Every government in the western hemisphere have had their problems and have had to solve those problems.  I trust that people will appreciate that what we are doing now is being done in their best interests.  We would like to see everyone with a great deal more money.  We would like to see more prosperity.  We have come a long way under our own resources.  We had to depend for anything we have on our own people.  We want to preserve and protect our people's prosperity and well-being. <Col N="1954" /> During the last four or five years we have spent almost £16 million on extending services in Dublin city and county.  We hope to spend another £40 million on further extensions.  What would be the situation if that drive suddenly ceased?</P>
    <P>We have gone into the export market in quite a big way.  We want to ensure our ability to complete successfully in that market.  The only way in which we can do that is by facing up to our responsibilities.  Everything we do is in the interests of our people, in the interests of their children and their children's children.  Again, I say to the Labour Party that all we ask from them is their co-operation.</P>
    <P>Housewives have been appreciative of the efforts made by the Minister to stabilise food prices.  The provision regarding restriction on increases of rents is worthwhile and should be welcomed by all.  In this Bill there are worthwhile provisions in relation to expenditure by landlords, in the matter of certain lettings, records of employment and returns by companies.</P>
    <P>The restriction on increases of rents is a major step forward.  At the moment in the case of lettings in this city the sky is the limit.  The people concerned must realise that what they are doing affects the economy as a whole.  We have had reports of hotels and restaurants increasing their charges and, again, this can affect adversely our tourist industry.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to have absolute control over prices but the Minister is making a valiant effort to do this and we must wish him success.  The most important task is to get the co-operation of the people.  They must realise that any decision we make is in their interest and in the interests of their children.  The prosperity of this country is at stake.  All of us, and this includes the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the Employers' Federation, should do everything possible to help the Minister clear up the misunderstanding that has been created by some people.  We should remember that the provisions before us are of a temporary nature.  They do not constitute a standstill on wages because a <Col N="1955" /> percentage is allowed and the Minister is not interfering where negotiations have been entered into.  It is much better that the restrictions be enforced for one year; the alternative could mean ruin for our economy.  The Minister has my sympathy and encouragement. He is doing a good job and may God bless him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be brief in my comments because all that has to be said regarding this Bill has been stated by other speakers.  They have referred to its obvious inadequacies and have made the point that the Bill does not tackle the roots of inflation. They have made the point that the spiral of rising prices followed by salary increases will continue at the end of 1971, probably in an accentuated form.  It has been stated that the Bill is a panic measure, that it does not answer the needs of the economy and comes after a series of mistakes in the management of the economy.</P>
      <P>Probably the major mistake early this year was the Budget itself.  Admittedly, the present Minister for Finance did not draw up the terms of that Budget but, when he became Minister for Finance, he committed himself totally to its terms during the course of the Budget discussion.  At the time I thought it was extraordinary support to give to a Budget he did not introduce. However, he gave that support totally and without qualification, as can be seen from the Official Report.</P>
      <P>The Budget early this year did nothing to damp down the inflation that was raging throughout the country.  The increase of turnover tax threw fuel on the flames and merely aggravated the problem.  We pointed out that, in practical terms, the increase in turnover tax would not be confined to a 2½ per cent increase. We stated that it would lead to further calls for wage claims and add to the difficulties many working people were experiencing in attempting to cope with the increased cost of living.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Budget was a grievous error: it was incomprehensible when it was introduced and it is even more so now. The Minister now comes to the House and seeks support for the Prices and <Col N="1956" /> Incomes Bill.  The Minister does not inspire us with confidence in his judgment and the provisions of the Bill do not convince any of us that it will lead to an improvement in the matter of incomes.</P>
    <P>The Minister's speeches prior to the introduction of the Bill, as well as the Bill itself, have alienated major sections of the trade union movement.  The Bill was not introduced into this House without introductory speeches by the Minister.  In the early stages he announced his intention of not honouring the 12th round pay agreement. Therefore, even if the Bill were the best in the world, the Minister's opening salvos in introducing the Bill were disastrous in their consequences.  After the Minister's reckless intervention it can be questioned whether the employer labour conference can ever be the same again.  The Minister's sally into the sphere of industrial relations this year will probably be seen in years ahead as the most disastrous intervention by any Minister in the last ten years.</P>
    <P>The clauses of the Bill give no sign of departing from this mistaken way of dealing with the problem.  The employer-labour conference structure may well be affected and the whole concept of free negotiations between employers and employees has sustained deep injury.  The Minister stands convicted of contributing to this serious turn of events.</P>
    <P>I do not know what was in the Minister's mind when he suggested at the outset that the 12th round of the agreement he had entered into would not be honoured.  Some advisers may have suggested that there would be some psychological bonus to be gained from saying that he intended to stop the 12th round and to stop the gains offered in that round being given to employees. They may have suggested that there would be some psychological bonus to the employees when, in fact, the Minister changed his mind on this decision of his not to honour the 12th round agreement.</P>
    <P>If such advice was tendered it was very mistaken and certainly misunderstood. It disimproved the whole climate of trust between employer and employee. <Col N="1957" /> It helped to make matters worse.  Many trade unions, and those who have experience in this field, know that the whole idea of phased agreements and of employees agreeing to accept increases 12 months ahead was a hopeful sign in the arrangement of incomes in this country.  If modest, it was, to some extent, a rational approach to the matter of incomes and their distribution.  Where one could get employees to agree to take a percentage increase one year, and more the following year, this move contributed to an orderly assessment of how we should distribute incomes throughout the community.</P>
    <P>It is no secret to say that the future of phased agreements looks bleak.  The union leaders, at the end of 1971 or 1972, suggesting to their members that they might abide by a phased agreement, would not get an encouraging reception following the Minister's recent mishandling and intervention in this area.  The Minister has contributed to growing militancy on the part of the unions as a result of his recent speeches and actions.  It does not matter that he withdrew from his first ridiculous position.  The damage had already been done.</P>
    <P>I do not see how we can trust either the Minister or this Government to come to a correct assessment of what should be done.  They stand convicted for adding their own quota to the inflationary processes at work.  They ignored the warnings given and dismissed them as Opposition speeches.  They did not consider that the warnings merited serious consideration.  We have this Bill now.  The speeches leading up to its publication and the psychological climate and mentality which produced it, and notably the Minister's own speeches, have worsened the situation considerably.</P>
    <P>In fairness, I do not see how one could ask the unions and the employers to come together nationally for rational, meaningful discussions.  The possibility remains that the Minister may be totally out of touch with the point the negotiations have reached in the national discussions.  Some people who took part in the discussions have already mentioned that the Minister appeared to be out of touch with what <Col N="1958" /> was happening at the employer/labour conference.  It has been said that the Minister's intervention was disastrous. The Minister's first intervention came two months before the conclusion of the conference, and it terminated any possibility of success.</P>
    <P>We come now to the reasons one cannot support this Bill.  How can one suggest that this is a sincere attempt to control the rise in prices? There have been many warnings during the past two years of the massive increases in prices.  It is not an original observation to suggest that prices were rising at a phenomenal rate.  I do not know of any other European country where prices have risen so fast.  Prices have risen by 17½ per cent in the last two years.</P>
    <P>If the Government had wished the trade unions to moderate their wage claims, action obviously was called for at an earlier stage in order to control prices.  This was the approach adopted by other countries in a similar situation. On the other hand, we ignored those warnings.  When Deputy Colley was Minister for Industry and Commerce, we on many occasions raised the problem of rising prices.  The Minister told us then that he was not aware of any complaints on that score.  The Minister considered that the existing price control machinery was adequate.</P>
    <P>This Bill shows, in view of the changes inaugurated on the prices machinery front, that the previous machinery is not considered adequate. There is no guarantee that prices will stop rising in 1971.  All evidence points to further increases in prices at a time when the Government are seeking to stall wage increases.  If this Bill is carried, we can predict that, by the end of 1971, employees will be worse off than they are this Christmas.  The trade unionists of this country will be poorer than they are now.</P>
    <P>There is no attempt to clarify the intent of this Bill to control prices during this 12-month period.  The Minister has shown sympathy towards the need for price increases: he spoke during the Budget debate of having examined applications for price increases. He told Deputies that they would sympathise with many of those <Col N="1959" /> applications if they were in a position to read them, as he was.  I am not suggesting that certain price increases are not warranted.  The Minister appeared to have more understanding of the factors leading to price increases than he has for those at the receiving end of the same price increases.</P>
    <P>We can ask how we could support a Bill which we can foresee leaving the poor poorer and the rich richer in one year's time, if this Government are still in office to see its full passage.  We could not in conscience support this Bill.  It is a stopgap measure.  The fundamental thinking behind it assumes that if we can halt the wage increases for a year stability will be restored to the economy.  This is a fundamental misconception.  It is one-sided in its effect.  It will not control prices and, in fact, it will not stabilise wage increases in our economy.  Rather it will have an explosive effect and we will have a real move forward for very large increases at the end of 1971.  The Bill does not improve the area of industrial relations between employers and employees.  Industrial relations will be worsened as a result of the provisions in this Bill.</P>
    <P>If the Bill has damaged the overall atmosphere of trust and the whole organised structure of industrial relations, it can also be said to have dampened down any possibility of what I would refer to as creative or constructive relations between employer and employee.  One of its clauses actually puts a stay on productivity agreements in the year of the Bill's duration, 1971. It states that there should be no change in such productivity agreements over this particular area and, in effect, says there must be a moratorium, a stay, on all innovation based on productivity agreements during 1971.  In other words, those employers and employees who base the improvement of their relations between themselves on the rock of productivity must, during 1971, no longer constructively base their relationship on productivity.  The Bill specifically forbids them so to arrange their affairs.</P>
    <P>Whether the Bill, if enacted, will call for even sterner measures against the <Col N="1960" /> unions at any time in the year in question&mdash;further restriction on their scope for withdrawal of labour, and so on&mdash;the Minister has not yet said.  This is not simply a fantasy of the people in Opposition.  We have had previous expressions of intention to control unions in relation to their freedom to negotiate.</P>
    <P>Nobody here would suggest that our economy is not in a bad way and that we do not face serious problems.  I fear we are much closer to the type of situation Deputy Burke mentioned in relation to the middle-fifties than some Members of this House may realise. No doubt some members of the Government realise it.  If we are not close to national bankruptcy we are certainly very close to increasing unemployment, emigration, and all the ugly and sad things that happen when we have an increase in unemployment.</P>
    <P>I believe that had action been taken, in sufficient time, on the prices front there would have been trade union response to such Government action. Had the Government won moral authority in this area by demonstrating their determination to control prices I think we would have found a response from trade unions.  The trade unions were left alone to cope with rising prices and, coming on to the 13th round agreement, they were putting forward large claims for increases which, in the light of experience of rising prices over the past two years, were necessary and essential.</P>
    <P>The experience of other countries suggests that had the Government tackled prices in a determined fashion the response of trade unions would have been favourable.  In the sense of the positive direction of the economy, of meeting the problem of inflation, of doing something about our adverse balance of payments situation, and of bringing about a growth in the economy, we have not had such government here since November, 1968. Since the PR campaign, I do not imagine we have had any government of this sort in this country.  The events of the past year suggest the Government had not time to think about their business in the past 12 months.  Nobody <Col N="1961" /> would quarrel because a party has internal problems but it is a matter of concern to all of us when the party happens to be in government; we are all involved in the mess; we are all involved in the things they did not deal with.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach recently said that inflation is a world-wide phenomenon. Various Governments have sought to tackle the problem as their circumstances suggested.  We shrugged the problem aside.  Our whole taxation policy added to the dimension of our problem.  Our Budgets are monuments to the absence of measures to cope firmly with inflation here.  In conscience, we could not support this Bill. It does not give any guarantee of rigid control of prices over the next year.  It does not add up to any Government realisation that to control inflation means controlling it at the correct time. A carefully determined schedule of control is necessary.  By trying to tackle all the problems at once, by confining the operations to a year and by giving no guarantee about control of prices, the prospect is that the end of the year 1971 will see a really horrific situation in which our inflationary problems will not be even half-way towards solution.  The danger is that, if this Bill is enacted we shall be worse off before the end of 1971 than we are now.</P>
    <P>If industrial relations have been damaged then this Bill adds to the damage.  Consider the provision which empowers the Government to take over union funds.  Whether this power conflicts with our ratification of Convention No. 87 of the ILO is something that requires more study.  Article 4 of Convention No. 87 states that workers' and employers' associations shall not be liable to be dissolved or sustained by administrative authority. It is arguable whether the deregistration of a union&mdash;the witholding of an negotiating licence&mdash;becomes an essential condition of a union's existence and whether the power to take away the licence of a union by seizing its funds amounts to dissolution under the terms of Convention No. 87.  This matter should be looked into closely.</P>
    <P>Certainly, it can be said that the <Col N="1962" /> Government's intention to seize union funds must further affect relations between employer and employee.  To think that they can be improved against the background of this Bill is naïve.  If we are sincere and serious about improving industrial relations, it is almost a platitude to say that the rôle of government should be one of improving the organisational structure between employer and employee. When this neutral balance is titled at any stage in the direction of one or the other of these pillars of our economy, there is trouble in store for us.  Where it seems the balance has been so titled, and where there appear to be penalties aimed at the actual corporate existence of the unions, it can be said there will be little constructive advance in relations between employer and employee. I do not think anyone can say this is a healthy situation and it cannot be said that we can look forward hopefully to controlling inflation.</P>
    <P>To control inflation a partnership between Government, employers, employees and their unions is needed.  This Bill and the Minister's statements disrupt any possibility of any such partnership being a reality in the coming year. Theoretically and on paper the Bill may appear to be an answer to some of the problems we face but it is a superficial, facile and panic measure. It does not show any evidence of a serious analysis of our problems having been undertaken by the Government. The Bill does not call for support and it does not justify support on this side of the House.</P>
    <P>Our Budget arrangements contributed to growing inflation.  Various developments in industrial negotiations have been seriously harmed. Phased agreements may become of interest only to historians of industrial relations.  I suggest that the man or woman who would advocate a phased agreement in 1972 or 1973 would get a very bad reception.  The phased agreement was one of the hopeful developments in our industrial relations. It was a modest one and it did not achieve the full objective of an incomes policy of course, but it was a step in the right direction.  Theoretical <Col N="1963" /> and dogmatic conceptions should be discarded in the area of industrial relations.  We should be satisfied if we can advance step by step in the right direction.</P>
    <P>I am suggesting that this Bill represents a backward step.  It is a one-sided approach to the problem.  It is superficial. It will not solve the inflationary problems we are faced with and it is particularly tragic that this should be the Government's response at this time of danger to our economy.  I am convinced that our economy is at that dangerous stage and that a large increase in unemployment is possible during next year.  The figures for last month show an increasing trend towards rising unemployment.  Whatever about politics and political parties it is regrettable that the Government of the day have lost the confidence of the unions at this terribly crucial time when confidence between all the important elements in the economy is so essential if the country is to ward off some of the problems.</P>
    <P>Admittedly, inflation as a world phenomenon is beyond our control but we have failed to take the steps, the logical and intelligent steps at the right time, to try to surmount our problems. We failed this year and last year.  We had the evidence of rising prices, but no action was taken.  This Bill gives no guarantee that increases in prices can be held back during the coming year. At the same time, it is clear that some control is sought over wages.  There has been too much aggravation.  As employees have been left severely alone in the past year as they faced rising prices, I do not imagine that this Bill will get a constructive reception from the trade unions.  They have lost confidence in the ability of the Government to legislate for the economy as, in fact, we have ourselves.</P>

      <P>I disagree strongly with the methods adopted by the Government.  I disagree strongly with their view on the economy.  They have been contradictory in practically every statement they have ever made in relation to our economy, and particularly during the past 12 months or so.  I <Col N="1964" /> accept my responsibilities, as I am sure other Deputies do, as a public representative in saying that we are all in this together and in saying that the national economy and the outlook generally in the country at the moment are extremely bad.  One must indict the Government entirely for that and nobody else.  They have no excuse whatsoever.  They were given a safe and workable majority at the last general election.  The people trusted them and voted for them because they thought they would bring some sort of stability to the nation as a whole.  This Bill which is brought into the Dáil for us to pass is an admission of total failure.</P>
      <P>How can the Government expect everybody else to retrench and save money when they are not doing so themselves?  We knew that when the extra 2½ per cent turnover tax was imposed in this year's Budget disaster was absolutely bound to follow in its wake.  Economists always have some deep scheme in their minds, worked out in figures.  I understand that economic advice was offered to the then Minister for Finance in 1964, to the late Dr. Ryan, that he should impose a turnover tax and that everything would be lovely afterwards.  He was informed by his advisers of that day&mdash;and I understand most of them were economists&mdash;that all he had to do was impose a 2½ per cent turnover tax, expand the economy, and give all the social services he wanted and that, if he were in trouble, he could come back with a further imposition of the turnover tax.  Unfortunately, that advice was accepted by the present Minister's predecessor and a further 2½ per cent was imposed last spring.  We face very serious trouble as a result.</P>
      <P>On top of that, the present Minister brought in another Budget the other day and we had a further imposition of taxation.  So, the Government are spending more and more and asking the people to spend less and less, and to save money.  How can anybody be expected to save money when every time a question is asked in the Dáil about the value of the £ we are told it is depreciating?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The member of the Government I feel rather sorry for in this debate is <Col N="1965" /> the Tánaiste, because he seems to have been the one member of the Fianna Fáil Party who has gone up and down the country preaching inflation for the past 12 months and, apparently, his colleagues would not listen to him.  He seems to have been the one man who realised that we were heading for some sort of financial disaster so it was only reasonable to expect that he would have been sent in here, as he was.  He spoke the other day and tried to support his colleagues in the action they are at present taking.  The gist of what he said was that there is inflation all over the world&mdash;that is not any reason why we should have inflation in Ireland&mdash;and that the Government did not do anything about it because they felt the time was not right to do anything about it, that the people would not accept any restriction on their expenditure until the crisis was upon us.</P>
    <P>We now know that the Fianna Fáil method of government is to wait until the country is practically broke and then to impose restrictions.  However, they did not impose the restrictions in the way they wanted to impose them. We always seem to be plagued in this country with a threat either of a general election or of by-elections.  The Minister for Finance came out as a strong silent man recently.  He would bring in legislation and force the trade unions to accept his will as the law and there would be no redress.  We were told the nation was faced with disaster and he had to do this.  Then we had the prospect of two by-elections and the situation changed.  Now we have this Bill from which nobody can get a clear picture of what the Government intend to do.</P>
    <P>I believe the Government have not withdrawn one inch.  They have only pretended to withdraw.  Of necessity they must withdraw because the ballot boxes will speak again in two by-elections but they have left the situation open to impose the original restrictions. First of all, it was 6 per cent. The only thing they have given way on&mdash;they were forced to give way on it because the Fine Gael Party came out very strongly on it&mdash;is to allow the 12th round.  That is in the Bill because it specifically mentions the date 16th <Col N="1966" /> October and any agreements prior to that which covers the 12th round.  They have not withdrawn on anything else. The actual 6 per cent no longer exists but it is replaced by whatever the Government decide is permissible in the national economic interest.</P>
    <P>How can the Government expect the country to listen to them?  How can they have any credibility when one day they say one thing and another day they say another, when they are afraid to come out and face facts?  A few weeks ago they got a majority behind them because all the tied hacks walked into the lobby and voted for them.  They know that all the tied hacks will do that on every occasion that arises.  They have the majority. They have what they are always searching for&mdash;a strong Government, in voting power anyway, to do what they want to do.  Can they not come clean with the people instead of messing about and giving the impression that they are calling the whole thing off while still leaving it open to jump in again when the ballot boxes have spoken?  Any government who spend their time looking at the ballot boxes and worrying about them when there is a national emergency are not worthy of the name of a government.</P>
    <P>Everything that is being brought in now is eyewash.  Whether they intend to try to rectify our economy or not remains to be seen.  I sincerely hope they will do so and that there will be no inflationary rises in prices or in salaries.  The fact is that the country cannot stand it.  We are supposed to be negotiating for entry to the Common Market.  Although one of the political parties, I believe, opposes our entry, it looks to me as if the majority of the Dáil have decided on that point.  We cannot afford any further inflation.  We are all in this, not only the people who are responsible for controlling prices, not only those who are pressing for higher wages: we all have a responsibility to the country when we are faced with a disastrous situation.  That does not in any way let the Government off. They are responsible for it and nobody else.</P>
    <P>I wonder if the Government ever thought of the idea which is being propounded at present in Britain where <Col N="1967" /> they are also faced with inflation.  It is always an unpopular thing to suggest something that has been suggested by a conservative party but the Conservative Party in Britain have a definite approach to their problem.  It is quite a different approach to the one we have here.  Our approach here is to impose more taxation, to put more on the people's backs and stop them spending. The Conservative Party's approach is to reduce taxation.  They have already given a guarantee that they will reduce taxation by a considerable amount.  By doing that they maintain they are in a position to say to the people, &ldquo;We have cut down our expenditure.  Can you not stop your pressure, too?&rdquo;  In other words, they will allow private enterprise to operate.</P>
    <P>In this country it is different.  We are to have more taxation, more restriction on the individual per taxation and more and more restriction on the private rights of the individual.  I have nothing to do with business but I have many contacts with business people.  They all know that the country is rampant with inspectors at present, running hither and thither, searching books, going into everybody's private business on the pretext of controlling prices, whereas their real interest is to gather all the taxes they can so that the Government can have more money to spend.  If we say a word about that we are called diehards and we are supposed to be against the old age pensioners.  What did Fianna Fáil give the old age pensioners? They gave them a rise in the cost of living so that they can barely exist.  Though they may have more money than they had before, their circumstances are very much worse than they were several years ago.</P>

      <P>There may be higher wages here, agricultural workers may be getting £14 a week to which they are entitled.  It is towards the lesser paid worker that I am sympathetic, not the higher paid worker, the fellow who is getting £25 or £26 a week for watching a machine.  I am more interested in the lower paid worker, the man with £14 a week.  Any agricultural worker will tell you that that is not buying him what his smaller wage bought him in 1957 in spite of all the howling and screaming from the Fianna Fáil benches about it.  That is all they have to fall back on, the national economy, and they are supposed to be trying to save the country. They have been at that for years.</P>
      <P>I shall quote now for the benefit of the Minister for Finance, who is not here &mdash; no doubt he will read the Official Report &mdash; from a journal called <i>Public Affairs</i> published by the Institute of Public Administration.  There is an article on inflation in the October, 1970 issue and I shall quote from page 11.</P>
      <P>The resurgence of confidence in financial assets is a pre-condition for increased savings.  Increased savings would be a particularly valuable method of reducing inflationary pressures. It is significant that during the recent inflation net Post Office savings, Bank deposits, sales of Saving Certificates and Prize Bond issues have remained static.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In other words, those who have money to invest &mdash; I want to tell Deputy Briscoe, who has such confidence in the Fianna Fáil Party &mdash; have no confidence in the Fianna Fáil Government whatever.  The banks were closed for five or six months.  If there was confidence in the present Administration surely Post Office savings would have increased considerably during that time, but they remained static.  Where is the money going to?  It is going outside the <Col N="1969" /> country and this is happening because the people have lost confidence in Fianna Fáil.  The Government have no one to blame but themselves.  Instead of dealing with issues that were of vital importance to the nation as a whole, they frittered away their time fighting among themselves as to who should lead the clan.  There has been an outflow of money from this country during the past six months and the full effects of this, when they become known, will be staggering to the people.</P>
    <P>In relation to what this Bill proposes to do or what it does not propose to do, it is difficult to say because in a sense the Bill is ambiguous.  We do not know whether the Government will take strong action.  We do not know whether they will try to control the financial situation.  We do not know whether they will reach agreement with the unions.  At this point I might say that the trade unions have as much responsibility to the community as has any other section.  We were told that there was an attempt to reach agreement between employers and employees but that the attempt failed.  I ask those who represent those who speak for the trade unions to recognise the fact that the unions have as much responsibility to the country as has any other sector and that they should have as much interest in the preservation of our future as has any other section of the community.</P>
    <P>With regard to prices and incomes, I wonder how often, how long and by how many people who are in a position to know, have the Government been warned of the necessity of controlling prices but they said this was impossible.  Everything suggested by Fine Gael is impossible to them.  It is extraordinary that during the time I have been in this House-almost 20 years &mdash; I have been hearing good advice from these benches but that this advice has been disregarded always by Fianna Fáil.  Everything we say is disregarded but very often some time afterwards a Minister introduces a Bill with the very ideas that were promulgated from these benches and we are told that this is a new line of thought from Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>I shall not detain the House any <Col N="1970" /> longer.  I am sure that the Deputies opposite have resented strongly the remarks I have made about them because the truth is always painful. The truth is this: over there is a party who have behind them a trained Civil Service and all the assistance they could possibly require to govern the country, but this they have failed to do.  They have wasted almost two years of parliamentary time doing nothing.  They come to us now crying about a crisis.  I wonder if they will have the guts to go ahead and do what must be done or if they will run like rats with their tails between their legs afraid to do what is possibly the unpopular thing.  I hope they will do what is necessary to put the country on its feet again.</P>
    <P>Before I sit down I should mention that in 1957, the late Gerard Sweetman, as the then Minister for Finance, did what was unpopular when he imposed restrictions, but Fianna Fáil cried and howled and went to the country.  The people decided against us and Fianna Fáil, when they were returned to office, not only left the restrictions that had been imposed but they imposed them permanently.  That is how far one can trust the standing and the integrity of Fianna Fáil.  So far as I can see, they intend to remain in power for the remainder of their time of office, if they can.  If they do, I can only hope that they will face up to their responsibilities and that they will not mess this country about any more than they have done already.</P>

      <P>Listening to Deputy Esmonde one could not help but notice the contradictions in his contribution particularly towards the end of his speech.  He states that we do not have the courage to introduce unpopular measures when called upon to do so. He cites what happened in the case of the Coalition Government having introduced unpopular measures in 1957 and he gives that as the reason why they were not returned to power.  However, the Deputy fails to recognise that the reason the Coalition were not returned to power was that they made the fatal mistake of causing people to lose their employment.</P>

We are anxious to see that we do not lose all by irresponsible wage demands being put in.  Nobody in all honesty can say that the wage demands which have been put in in recent months have been of a responsible nature.  We are trying to control this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite true.  They have made personal attacks on members of the Government.  They have been antagonistic about this Bill.  I feel they do not have the interests of the workers at heart.  They are trying to make political capital out of the workers.  The fact that this legislation is before the House is already having an effect on the kind of wage demands which are being put in.  I have seen no evidence of any of those absurd demands being put in since this Bill came before the House.  This Bill has done a good thing by making the people aware of and concerned about the dangers and the possibility of inflation and pricing ourselves out of markets.  If we price ourselves out of world markets unemployment will follow.  Everyone in the country has a vested interest in this country continuing as a going concern.  They have young families to bring up, to see that they are educated, to clothe and to feed.  They have their cars to pay for. People want security more than anything else.  The people can forgive a Government anything but losing them their jobs.  If people lose their jobs as a result of irresponsible government that Government will be thrown into Opposition just as those members of former Coalition Governments have been thrown into and kept in Opposition.</P>
      <P>We have been abused about the turnover tax and how it caused the increase in the cost of living.  This tax was introduced in 1963 and we have been in office since that time.  We have come through a number of elections.  The people have still returned us.  I am well aware that people do not like paying taxes but they will pay them willingly rather than not have any money to pay those taxes, in other words, they have lost their jobs and have to go on the emigrant ships.  If you can keep your people in employment you are doing a good job in government.  The Labour Government in England lost the last election because there was higher unemployment in that country at that time than at any time in the previous 30 years.</P>

They tried it and they did not get away with it simply because they were looked on as traitors by the trade union movement whom they had all the time supported whilst they were in Opposition.  The Opposition on one hand say that this Bill is not necessary, that there is no serious inflation which would warrant legislation like this and, on the other hand, they say that there is such a situation but that this action is being taken too late.

    <P>Fianna Fáil have never been afraid of the ballot box.

People elected Fianna Fáil at the last election <Col N="1978" /> simply because when it came to the time for voting they asked themselves: under whom is our employment more likely to continue, under a Fianna Fáil government, under a Labour government, under a Fine Gael government or under a Coalition government?

This Bill protects those people who live on fixed incomes.  Those are the hardest hit sector of any community.  We have been accused of having lowered the value of the old age pensioner's money and been told that the old age pensioner is worse off now than he was ten years ago.  This is not the case.  Every year under successive Fianna Fáil Governments the lot of the old age pensioner has been improved, not nearly as much as we would like to improve it or as everyone in the House would like, but nevertheless the improvement has always been in excess of the increase in the cost of living in that year.  This has been borne out in successive elections.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>It means people are better fed, much better than Deputy Bruton would indicate from his interruption. One of the complaints is that the sales of bread have fallen very considerably in the last few years.  This indicates that people are eating more meat, fish and various other dishes.  One has only to look at the many stores, supermarkets and shops.  People are not living on bread and potatoes any more.  Look at the range of goods in these stores.  These goods would not be in the stores if the people did not have the money to buy them.  No businessman buys goods just to put in a shop window, particularly perishable goods. Go to any supermarket on a Saturday afternoon, or go down to Ballymun and see the third largest supermarket in Europe crammed with people ordering good food to eat over the weekend and during the week.  Therefore it is no use for the Opposition to scream about poverty.  We are not a poverty-stricken country.  We are one of the few creditor nations in Europe, and that was not so after the last Coalition left office in 1957 when all our external assets&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>All our external assets &mdash; the Deputy can check on this if he wishes &mdash; had been spent.  We did not have a bean.  That is not the position today.  We are one of the few creditor nations in Europe.  We have managed our affairs pretty well and intend to continue to do so even if it means introducing unpopular measures.  As I have said, and as my whole speech underlines, this Bill is to protect employment and that is Fianna Fáil's main policy, to protect our people's employment and therefore, to protect people like old age pensioners, the widows and the orphans, to whom reference is so often made here and for <Col N="1981" /> whom we gather taxes in order to give them their fair share.  The Opposition have criticised us.  After all it is the Opposition's job to criticise, but they have not suggested anything.</P>

      <P>In his speech the Minister said that the Bill is not aimed at cutting back workers' living standards; it is rather aimed at safeguarding their existing living standards...</P>
      <P>This is what I have been endeavouring to say.  The Government have made exhortations for claims for increases to be realistic.  The Minister in his speech went on to say:</P>
      <P>The Government had repeatedly made it clear that the level of the 12th round increases which followed the maintenance settlement was grossly excessive and bound to worsen the economy's competitive position and to affect adversely both employment and economic growth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The people know that Fianna Fáil have their interests at heart.  As long as they are able to collect their pay packets each week everything is all right.  We need to increase production. If workers are able to increase production they can expect wage increases. Most people realise that unless we can produce goods at a cheaper price than our competitors abroad we will not stay in business but this message has to be driven home at local level.  Trade unions should talk to their workers along these lines: &ldquo;Look, we as a trade union can only do so much, you have to play your part and produce the goods.  If you produce the goods we will see to it that you get your fair <Col N="1982" /> whack of the profits.  &ldquo;I have said before that no one would be happier than me to see every worker able to afford two cars and a Continental holiday every year if he so wished because then I would know the country was doing well.  Certainly, it has the potential to do well.  This party have never lost faith in the people.  We shall continue to have faith in the people.  We have achieved too much to lose it by default. We have no intention of allowing pecple to be led into believing that they are not getting a fair deal.  We have to instil into people the ambition to work for better things.</P>
    <P>From the moment post-primary education was available to all who wished to avail of it, the face of this country began to change.  We shall receive the benefit of this scheme in a very short time now because many of the people who have received post-primary education under the scheme will soon be able to play their part in building an Ireland more prosperous than ever.  The sooner people realise that by making a concerted effort we shall make more progress and a better standard of living will be available for everyone, the better.  This is the ideal to aim for.  I emphasise the word &ldquo;ideal&rdquo;.  We want to motivate our young people into building a better Ireland for all our people, always maintaining that those who are least well off will get a greater share of the national cake.  We have done this very well up till now and we shall continue to do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been present at almost every sitting of the Dáil since my election to this House one-and-a half years ago and during that time a large proportion of the debates have been about the problems which have arisen as a result either of inaction or ineptitude on the part of the present Government.  The net result of this is that the country has got itself into probably the greatest difficulties it has faced in the 50 years of its existence as an independent State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In his opening statement the Minister attempted to put the blame for the problems we are now facing fairly and squarely on the shoulders of the workers.  This attempt will not succeed because speaker after speaker has reminded <Col N="1983" /> the Minister for Finance and the Government that the present problems were created by the present Government.</P>
    <P>When the Tánaiste addressed this House on this Bill he pointed out that most European countries had to face serious inflationary problems at one time or another.  He cited as examples countries like Sweden, Denmark, Britain and Germany.  He argued that the problems those countries faced at varying times were rooted in inflation but he did not put forward the cause of the inflation.</P>
    <P>The problem of inflation in this country and in those countries stem from completely different sources.  I am sure my learned friend, Deputy O'Donovan, who has already spoken on this Bill has pointed out the reason for inflation in this country.  The inflationary causes in the countries mentioned by the Tánaiste were brought about primarily by full employment. Full employment had prevailed in those countries for many years.  The demands on the resources of those countries had been very strong during that period.  The competition for the labour force was much greater and so a situation developed in which the inducement of higher wages was used to compete for workers for the many jobs available.  The result was money incomes rose faster than the volume of production.  As a result of that these countries had to face inflationary problems. Indeed, Britain is still facing that problem.</P>
    <P>The same position has never existed here.  The pattern has been too few jobs for the work force available.  Unemployment has never been below a figure of 6 per cent and it has often, unfortunately, been as high as 10 per cent.  Our present inflationary problems can be clearly traced to the Government's handling of our economy, particularly during the last two years, and the present crisis in which we find ourselves was predicted time and again by speaker after speaker on these benches in the Budget debate.  The increase in the turnover tax from 2½ per cent to 5 per cent-an increase of 100 per <Col N="1984" /> cent &mdash; gave rise to a spate of price increases, increases which have gone on unchecked in the last six months.  It was argued that that increase of 100 per cent in turnover tax was required to balance the Budget.  When the turnover tax was introduced in the early sixties it was hotly debated in this House and the 100 per cent increase recently was just as hotly debated: on both occasions it was pointed out that this type of taxation leads to inflation because of increasing prices.</P>
    <P>The Government, having the benefit of hindsight after the introduction of the turnover tax, chose to ignore the problems which resulted and balanced the Budget by using the same device again this year.  In an effort to remove the blame for what has happened the Minister for Finance has now introduced this Prices and Incomes Bill.  It is a poor measure.  It makes little or no attempt to lay down the groundwork for a proper prices and incomes policy.  In fact, there is no suggestion of laying down any groundwork necessary for an incomes policy. Because of that lack there can be no hope of success.  There has not even been a separate section set up in the Department of Industry and Commerce, or anywhere else, to deal with incomes.</P>
    <P>The problem of inflation is now being blamed on the workers.  The workers, in the process of phased agreements, have seen increases in wages eaten away long before the end of the phased agreement on, for example, the 12th round.  Workers who agreed to increases two years ago, increases which seemed reasonable at the time, found their wages had fallen far short of the increases in prices which occurred during the same period.</P>
    <P>Many trade unionists were not in favour of phased agreements at the outset but these were, in fact, the basis on which the Government could have worked towards a proper prices and incomes policy.  The experience has been that, although wages can be controlled, there has been little effort by the Government, particularly during the last two years, to control prices. The present measure pays lip-service to controlling prices but nothing definite <Col N="1985" /> is spelled out in the Bill or in the Minister's speech.  There is no indication as to what steps will be taken so that a better watch can be kept on the movement of prices.  In certain areas it is possible to note increases in prices. That can be done in the case of ordinary consumer goods.  It is not so easy in other areas.  In these areas prices have been rising and nothing can be done, apparently, to curb these increases. I refer to such items as clothes, coal, firing and so on.  What attempt has been made in the past year to control prices of these commodities?  What attempt will be made next year to keep prices down?  I suggest it is impossible to exercise surveillance on these commodities. How can the price of shoes be noted from week to week?  These items are bought once in a year.  A pair of shoes may be priced at 69s 11d this month and next month the same shoes may be 80s.  Nobody will be aware of that increase.  A check cannot be kept on that kind of commodity.  It is hardly likely the buyer will be aware of the increase in price and will not, therefore, be in a position to give this information to whatever section of the Department of Industry and Commerce will be exercising surveillance on such prices.</P>
    <P>I should like to mention the condition of the trade union movement as a result of this measure.  As a member of a trade union and a part-time branch secretary of the largest union in the country, I am well aware of the indignation felt by fellow-workers as a result of this Bill.  The trade unions were aware that the ICTU had been negotiating a 13th round agreement with the employers.  That conference had been in session for a number of months and it was a shock to the workers to hear that it had been terminated abruptly by the chairman because he considered that the differences in the proposals of the unions and those of the employers were too great.  The proposal put forward by the trade unions was to act as a bridge in an effort to achieve a real growth of 5 or 6 per cent in wage increases.  However, this was merely a proposal and was negotiable. In dealing with employers trade unions know and expect that negotiations <Col N="1986" /> will be conducted on the proposals they put forward.  That has always been the case and I hope that in the future it will continue to be so.</P>
    <P>It is obvious that the Government were using the employer/labour conference as a lever to introduce this Bill. With the failure of the conference the Bill was introduced almost immediately. By interfering with free collective bargaining the Government have created a situation whereby industrial relations will deteriorate in the future. As a result of their treatment by the Government, when workers next approach the negotiating table they will look for the largest possible allowance in the shortest period.</P>
    <P>The termination of the employer/ labour conference and the introduction of the Bill mean the end of phased agreements for some time to come.  In the past four years phased agreements were negotiated.  They gave a breathing space to employers to make arrangements in future budgets to meet wage increases and allowed them an opportunity to rationalise their production so that they could absorb wage increases.</P>
    <P>The lack of trust which workers will have in any future phased agreements is one of the most disturbing aspects of the matter.  Negotiations between workers and management must be free. The gun, in the form of legislative sanctions against workers, cannot be held to the heads of negotiators when they seek to work out a voluntary solution to pay increases.  This Bill has temporarily halted the process of free negotiations and I hope the Minister will not try to enforce the sanctions after the end of 1971.  He has changed his mind before about the terms of the Bill and there is every likelihood that he could do that again.  It would be a pity if the guarantees he gives now about the termination date were not honoured.  I hope there will be no attempt to prolong any of the measures after the end of 1971.</P>
    <P>The Government have attempted to implement a dividend freeze but in the Labour Party we are sceptical about this effort.  In the journal <i>Business and Finance</i> a measure of scepticism about the feasibility of a dividend freeze has been expressed.  In the issue dated 23rd <Col N="1987" /> October, 1970, it is stated:</P>
    <P>As a means of keeping money out of the consumer end of the economy the dividend freeze is pathetic, for the one or two points which most Irish companies would add to their distribution to ordinary shareholders if the trading results warranted it would amount to very little in the national context.</P>
    <P>The move by the Minister was, of course, taken to show that he was treating all sections of the community in a similar fashion and not penalising anyone, i.e. the worker.</P>
    <P>There are many loopholes open to firms by which they may distribute dividends.  They can withhold them until the end of the freeze and distribute them in the following year. This loophole is not open to workers who are paid on a weekly basis.  Everything they will lose in the coming year will be lost forever.</P>
    <P>It is for this reason that many people feel the inclusion of the dividend freeze is, as the journal <i>Business and Finance</i> suggests, just a sop to the workers.  It suggests that the Government are treating all sections of the community equally.  In the matter of the freeze on rents, no suggestion is made in the Bill as to whether the Government intend to clamp down on the rents of new office blocks.  No one knows what yardstick is used to measure at what rents office space should be rented in the coming year, so that new office buildings which will come on the market may be rented at whatever figure their owners care to charge for them, depending on demand for space at that time.</P>
    <P>The decision of the Minister for Finance to relent on the clamp-down on the last phase of the 12th round is very welcome to all sections of the working classes.  If the Minister had gone ahead with that section of the pay freeze, I doubt if he could have put any part of this Bill into effect.  The outcry from every section of the community would have been such that the Minister would have been forced to alter the Bill.</P>
    <P>When the public services increase was <Col N="1988" /> negotiated by members of the Government and the trade union movement it was hailed by the public as a great break-through in negotiations.  It was a welcome break-through because we had seen in the past that the poorer sections of the working classes, and particularly the road workers and the forestry workers, were always the last to receive increases.  They usually received the smallest increases: the increases were given on a percentage basis and the smaller the wages the smaller the increase.  The percentage system operated to give the lower-paid worker less than any other section of the community.</P>
    <P>The 12th round settlement for the public services gave a substantially higher increase to the lower-paid workers than they had got in the past. It would be manifestly unfair to that section of the community if the Minister for Finance had not come to his senses and changed the practice.  It would have been unfair if the Minister had included the last phase of the public services increase in the increases which were suggested as maximum increases during 1971.</P>
    <P>In giving the public services increase under the 12th round many local authority managers were able to nullify part of that increase by removing medical cards from a number of road-workers and lorry-drivers working for them.  Medical cards were removed from many family men who were earning about £17 per week and, in some cases less than that.  This meant in many cases that there was continual and recurring outlay on drugs and hospitalisation which had to be paid for out of weekly earnings.  In many cases these payments negatived the increase.</P>
    <P>I know one sad case with which I had to deal.  This was a man who worked in a pumping station in County Wicklow for seven days a week for £17 10s gross.  His medical card was taken away from him when he received an increase under the 12th round.  This man has a wife and nine children.  The loss of the medical card was a serious blow to him and seriously affected his income.  This is only one case which I had to deal with. <Col N="1989" /> There have been many such cases in my constituency.  In many cases the first phase of the 12th round agreement was to some degree negatived by such actions.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I should like to say that if an incomes and prices policy is to be effective it must deal with blatant inequality in living standards at its source.  I can find no evidence of an attempt in this Bill to deal with the inequality which exists in this country at the present time.  The Bill itself has been described by a number of speakers as a pay-freeze or low wages bill.  In order to have a proper prices and incomes policy there must be a great deal of extra work by the Government in setting up bodies to ensure proper surveillance of all aspects of price increases and to yet all types of wage increases.  This is very necessary. There has been no attempt in this Bill to do this.</P>
    <P>The measure will obviously be passed by this House because of the numbers on the Government benches. I feel that the Bill will never be acceptable to the rank and file of the workers in this country.  This type of legislation should be forgotten by the present Government.  They should get down to the real problems which confront the country.  I hope that they will come to terms with the problem in the coming year, in co-operation with the trade union movement and the employers, and that they will all work out some sort of rational policy from which workers will benefit considerably in real increases in their wages in the years ahead.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to refer to the context of the Bill itself, first.  Take sections 2 and 3.  How effective will the provisions here be in regard to people in salaried employment &mdash; people in insurance companies, people in firms of solicitors and people in employment like that? It is very difficult to disguise a basic increase in wages for a labourer or a man in a fixed and clearly defined category; but consider, for instance, the position of a newly qualified solicitor. Before he was qualified, he could have been earning little or nothing as an apprentice.  He would take a big jump <Col N="1990" /> in earnings immediately he was qualified. Maybe a month later, on the basis that he had now considerable experience as a solicitor, he could get what could be termed promotion.  His category could change again, a few months later.  On each of these occasions he could receive an increase in his salary which would have no relation to the norms referred to by the Minister because it would not be an increase in basic remuneration but consequent on promotion.  I do not think this Bill meets this possible danger, if one calls it a danger, to the concept behind the Bill &mdash; a concept, anyway which I do not consider very good.</P>
      <P>Sections 11 and 12 cover rents and the like.  Under the Landlord and Tenant Act, 1931, where a lease expires which is covered by the Act the tenant is entitled to have a new rent fixed and to renew his lease at a certain figure.  Leases may fall due for renewal under the Landlord and Tenant Act in the period while the control of increases in rent referred to in this measure are effective.  What will happen to these rents which are fixed at a specific rate and controlled by the Act during the period of operation of the Act?  Will they have to remain at that level for the remaining period of 21 years during which the leases will be effective?  The effect would be that you would have the Landlord and Tenant Act covering a period of 21 years and giving the people entitlement to have a lease renewal.  If it is renewed during the period of the effectiveness of this measure, it would have to be renewed at a certain figure but that figure, fixed during the effectiveness of this measure, will be binding not just for the period of the measure but for the period of 21 years as under the Landlord and Tenant Act, 1931, or the whole period of the lease, anyway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a good idea that excessive increases in rent should not take place. However, this is a roundabout way of achieving control of increases in rent. It may prove a rather strange and irrational way.  If we are going to control increases in rent, in leases which may fall due in the next year during the effectiveness of this measure, we should do so specifically and not sideways, <Col N="1991" /> through this measure.  It is possible that it could be got around in the drafting of the agreement.  While I support the idea of minimising increases in rents and while I consider that some people are paying extortionate rent, nevertheless, if we are going to control increases in rents we should do so specifically and on the basis of a long term policy and not in this offhand fashion incorporated in legislation in which rents play only an incidental part.</P>
    <P>The most disturbing section in this Bill is section 22 (1) which is to the effect that if, in any respect, any difficulty arises in bringing into operation or in giving full effect to any provisions of this Bill, when enacted, the Minister for Finance may by order do anything which appears to be necessary or expedient for bringing that provision into operation and giving full effect thereto.  Could we just think about this? The result will be legislation by order which is a by-passing of this House. The Minister may do anything &mdash; anything &mdash; which appears to be necessary or expedient.  What sort of legislation is that? Are we going to confer freedom on a Minister to do anything which appears necessary or expedient without it having to come before this House? That is not legislation.  What is the point in having a Parliament and a requirement that a matter should be brought before this House and debated and that legislation be approved by this House, if we confer power on a Minister to take action without coming to this House?</P>
    <P>One cannot discuss this Bill without discussing the Government's economic policy over the past five or six years.  It is clear that this has been an erratic and politically-motivated policy.  There has been no consistency.  The Government have not even been basically honest with the people in regard to economic policy.  I know there are matters which have been pointed out so often from this side of the House that the people are practically deaf to what we have to say, but they are nonetheless true despite how often they are repeated.</P>
    <P>A particular instance of this is what happened in relation to the economic <Col N="1992" /> crisis that was heralded on television by Deputy Haughey and which within months had disappeared in a haze of glorious prosperity when the Government were facing an election.  We have an economic crisis one month and &ldquo;we never had it so good&rdquo; two months later when the Government want to win an election.  If the Government do things like that, they can hardly expect other people to be disciplined, or expect them to accept restraints, or to be honest in accepting their responsibilities as members of a total community and not just individuals seeking increases for themselves.</P>
    <P>If the Government cannot tell the basic truth about the economy, and have to use the economy as a means of attaining political power for themselves, and have to make statements so contradictory and so blatantly contradictory as the statement made by Deputy Haughey one month and effectively taken back two or three months later when an election was due, what can they expect from the people? If the Government are indisciplined in what they do, they can hardly act as leaders in asking people to accept discipline.</P>
    <P>It is clear also that there has been a grave lack of foresight on the part of the Government.  We need only look at the editorial in Scéala Éireann, the <i>Irish Press,</i> of 17th October, 1970, to read that perhaps, indeed, the Government delayed too long and that a more opportune time would have been 18 months ago.  It is a masterly understatement on the part of the <i>Irish Press,</i> referring to the approach of the Government to our economic problem to say that perhaps they delayed too long. They delayed for much longer than even the <i>Irish Press</i> concedes that they delayed.</P>
    <P>However, there were members of the Government who were issuing warnings on this subject.  We had the Tánaiste, Deputy Childers, being reported in the <i>Irish Times</i> practically every week bemoaning the irresponsibility of people who were looking for increased incomes.  Evidently the Tánaiste has no influence with the Government because, if he had, presumably <Col N="1993" /> he would have done something to back up his persistent exhortations.  In fact, nothing was done.</P>
    <P>Another contributing factor to our economic problems was the great increase in Government expenditure.  I know that one is getting on to very difficult political ground when one talks about restricting the increase in Government expenditure.  I am not qualified to say and I will not attempt to say where cuts should be made.  I have not made a sufficiently comprehensive study of all the facets of Government expenditure to make any such assessment.  As was pointed out in an article in <i>Léargas,</i> October, 1970, to which my colleague, Deputy Esmonde, referred, there is a need for a movement away from cost benefit analysis in Government expenditure to cost effectiveness analysis.  Possibly, if we had more cost effectiveness analysis of Government expenditure we might find that there are certain schemes which are not doing what they are supposed to be doing and not meeting the needs which they are supposed to be meeting.</P>
    <P>It is clear that over a long period schemes are introduced to meet a need which is pressing and genuine at that particular time but due to lethargy and inertia those schemes remain in existence long after the need which they were originally and validly introduced to serve has disappeared.  This is possibly the case with many measures of Government intervention in our economy which are causing very great expenditure which is borne by the taxpayer. There always is and always will be a vested interest of some description to call out loudly for the retention of any scheme, no matter how archaic. There will always be somebody benefiting from it who will be able to put forward a case to have it kept in existence.  There will always be votes to be lost by cutting out any scheme, no matter how archaic.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I said I am not in a position to do so.  I pointed out that a proper cost effectiveness analysis of <Col N="1994" /> all Government expenditure should be carried out.  In the absence of such an analysis, which I certainly as an individual Deputy am not in a position to carry out but which the Government are in a position to carry out, it is impossible for me to specify the schemes. I would point out that there is a need to have this analysis of Government expenditure because the steady increase in Government expenditure, which has been well in excess of the increase in expenditure in other sections of the community, has obviously been a major contributing factor to the inflationary situation in which we find ourselves at present.</P>
      <P>I should also like to mention what our concept in the Fine Gael Party is of an incomes policy.  I personally am not by any means the best qualified member of the party to talk about this. I have always had and still have a sort of pathological fear of economics and economic concepts.  I do not understand many of them.  Taking it in more homely terms, we need to have a Government which can provide leadership, a Government which can have the respect of all sections of the community when they ask them to accept particular restraints.  Under that heading the Government must fall down.  They cannot ask with credibility for restraint on the part of other sections of the community.</P>
      <P>They are clearly convicted now and were convicted before of telling untruths and half truths.  I do not propose to go into the current major political debate arising from the recent arms trial.  That is not relevant here except to the extent that it is clear from it that we have a Government which can come in here and without any shame tell untruths to the House.  If the Government tell untruths in this House they can hardly expect to have the respect of the people they ask to accept restraints and to whom they preach about responsibility in the incomes sphere.  What could be more irresponsible than a Government who tell lies to the Dáil?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is need for greater co-operation among all sections of the community to achieve norms of income increases which will prevent the inflationary spiral from continuing.  A much <Col N="1995" /> more intensive educational process could reach all sections of the community. It is not enough for the Government merely to issue the occasional script to the newspapers, as the Tánaiste was doing.  This is not really educating; this is not really getting down to the people who really make the decisions in the incomes sphere. The people who make the decisions in the incomes sphere are the workers on the shop floor, the farmers on the farms.  Many of them do not have the time to read abstruse arguments from the Tánaiste or anybody else.  Clearly, the Government have not gone into the market place to persuade these people in terms they will understand of the need for action to curb inflation.</P>
    <P>There is a need for a series of councils, not just one national prices and incomes council, but for similar councils to operate at provincial or county level as well, affiliated to a national prices and incomes council. These local councils would relate the policy being laid down at national level to sectors of industry operating in the particular counties concerned.  It is only by a massive effort of institutional organisation, and by consultation between all sections of the community that the message can be got across to the people who really matter.  We need economic councils which will have a responsibility for applying a commonly agreed prices and incomes policy at local level and at county level.  These should be a duplication of similar councils which would be in operation at national level.  These councils would obviously have to incorporate not just employers and labour, as was the case with the recent employer labour conference which was abortive; they must include the farming community, the people who are not represented by trade unions, representatives of the self-employed; they must be comprehensive.</P>
    <P>While the Government are attempting in this legislation to be comprehensive, none of their efforts to devise an incomes policy on a voluntary basis was truly comprehensive.  It is very important that whatever economic wisdom is going around should not be enunciated solely in the form of rather <Col N="1996" /> high-flown scripts issued to the newspapers; it must be translated into terms which can be understood and sold in a vigorous way to the people on the shop floor and on the farm.  This can only be done by a necessarily more complex organisation going right down to local level which will have the effect of applying whatever incomes policy is agreed and also changing that policy through making suggestions upwards to the national body.</P>
    <P>I should like to get some information on how the Government, who must have known about the dangers of inflation earlier could, in the earlier part of this year introduce a Budget which could not be described as anything but highly inflationary, a Budget which increased the cost of living immediately and directly through increasing turnover tax.  It is difficult to imagine anything which could have been more calculated to aggravate people into making demands for large increases which the economy could not stand. The Government could not have been more effective in bringing about such demands than they were by introducing this Budget to increase turnover tax to 5 per cent.  What sort of economic thinking was behind this Budget?  Was it something that was dreamed up suddenly in a panic because the Minister for Finance was somehow or other indisposed?  Was it a Budget which had been thought out carefully in advance or was it a panic measure devised in a few hours to fill a gap?  If the latter is the case, it indicates something rather serious about the way in which the Government conduct their affairs.</P>
    <P>I should like to get some information about the long-term plans of the Government, so far as the Government will be long term, which is highly doubtful. What do the Government intend to happen when this Bill lapses?  Will we go back to the old ways which failed, or have they got some new concept of how they will handle our economic problems?  Are they just going to lapse back to what they have been doing, the economic policy guided solely by political expediency, or have they got something genuine in mind to devise a long-term voluntary incomes policy which will <Col N="1997" /> work?  In this context I should like to draw the attention of the House to what has happened in relation to fighting inflation in Finland.  It is fair to say that Finland and this country have many similarities.</P>

    <P>In relation to Finland I should like to draw the attention of the House to an article in <i>The Times</i> of London of Friday, October 2nd, 1970, under the heading &ldquo;How the Finns are fighting inflation.&rdquo;  It is an article by a man named Anthony Rowley and it says that the outcome of the policy measures adopted in Finland has been that the rate of inflation, which averaged 5 per cent for four years, from 1964 to 1968, and reached 8.4 per cent in 1968, was kept down to 2.4 per cent last year.  It also says that, while the unions were not altogether happy with the wage restraint in Finland, they were genuinely consoled by the fact that whereas real earnings in industry increased by 6.3 per cent during 1968-69 price increases were kept down to 2.3 per cent, compared with 5 per cent for the OECD countries as a whole, and <Col N="1998" /> are expected to rise by no more than 3 per cent this year.

      <P>Compared to the experiments in central control of the economy that are entering a further phase in Finland, Britain's attempts so far at a prices and incomes policy look like the mildest and most limited exercise in persuasion.

      <P>First there is the fact that the Finmark was devalued in October, 1967, around the time that sterling was devalued.  Finland's devaluation of 24 per cent was some 10 per cent greater than Britain's, but the consequent problems of making the most of devaluation&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am not suggesting anything.  I am reading what this man wrote in <i>The Times</i> of London of 2nd October, 1970.  This is a point worth noting here in relation to devaluation. We have always followed the British in regard to the amount by which we devalued our currency and so far as I know, the Government are almost entirely tied to the concept of following Britain in regard to devaluation of currency.</P>

      <P>The Government do not have the spark of originality that is evident in the Finnish economic policy.  I quote further from the article:</P>
      <P>Unlike Britain, however, Finland adopted stabilising measures such as an export-levy scheme, an anti-cyclical reserve fund acting direct on industry, and a certain reorganisation of the money markets, as well as a strict price freeze and wages control tied to productivity increases. The outcome has been that inflation in Finland, which averaged 5 per cent for four years and reached 8.4 per cent in 1968, was kept down to 2.4 per cent last year.  Meanwhile, the Finmark, a weak currency four years ago, is now one of the &ldquo;world's strongest currencies&rdquo;, according to Dr. Klaus Warris, former Governor of the Bank of Finland and Finnish representative to the International Monetary Fund.  Finland's rate of economic growth is, at 7 per cent, considerably greater than the average for western Europe.</P>
      <P>The Finns were able to do that although they are a small nation overshadowed by Russia and other countries in a similar way to which we, too, are overshadowed. The Finnish population is similar to ours.  When Britain devalued her currency and when general rounds of devaluation took place, they adopted positive measures to derive some benefit from the situation, whereas we did nothing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not particularly tied to the factors mentioned in this article but they should be investigated.  In view of the success that the Finns had in this field, I wonder whether the Government have investigated what the Finns have been doing.  There is another point worth noting and it is this point which <Col N="2000" /> distinguishes the Finnish situation from ours.  I quote:</P>
    <P>The fact that the Helsinki Government was not able to impose its prices and incomes and stabilization policies without the &ldquo;voluntary&rdquo; co-operation of business and industry and the labour movement gives them a more general relevance.</P>
    <P>They were able to do this on a voluntary basis which, clearly, this Government are not able to do.  I quote further from the article:</P>
    <P>An account of what was involved has been set out by Dr. Warris in a document published by the Bank of Finland.</P>
    <P>There is then a quotation from what he said and it is as follows:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;When we devalued the Finmark in 1967, trade unions had to be convinced a restrictive wage policy was necessary.  We became successful in coping with inflation problems.  We were able to increase our exports and get a pretty good equilibrium in our foreign trade, and also gradually to get a nice expansion in the national economy.  Last year the expansion was in real terms about 8 per cent.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>On the trade unions, Dr. Warris said: &ldquo; They were facing two alternatives: either a restrictive wage policy or a continuous wage and price spiral with much unrest in the labour market.  The labour movement was represented in the Government; it had simultaneously a political responsibility and a responsibility to labour.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is very important.  It is clear that the present Government have not the confidence of the labour movement and it is difficult to imagine them having the real support of the labour movement. However, that is not the only thing.  To continue with the quotation:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The employers were very cooperative in attaining our moderate policy.  The policy was determined largely by parties outside the Government.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This was not so in our case.  In the case of the Finns, this was something devised by the people themselves and the Government were able to convince them effectively of the necessity for it <Col N="2001" /> by their own constant approach to public finance whereas our Government have failed in this field.  The Finns were able to effect a situation whereby the people themselves were able to bring into effect an incomes policy without having the heavy hand of the Government fall on them as has been the case here in the form of the legislation put before us.  I quote further from the article:</P>
    <P>The Government adopted the lines put out jointly by employers and by employee organisations, which also demanded discipline in fiscal policies of the Government.  It was not an easy thing for politicians who were used to acting independently.  I feel almost everybody is happy about the results now.</P>
    <P>The idea of anybody demanding fiscal responsibility from this Government is unthinkable at the present time. The Government do not have the concept that they must be responsible in the same way as are the people to whom they are preaching.  There are one or two points in the article in relation to fiscal policy that are worth mentioning.  I quote:</P>
    <P>Fiscal policy was also connected with the stabilization policy.  A limit was imposed on the increase in government expenditure and this has been held.</P>
    <P>There is another point and this one possibly deserves some elucidation but I am not qualified to give such elucidation. I quote:</P>
    <P>One of the later &mdash; and perhaps most interesting &mdash; elements of the post-devaluation policy, and one which was not adopted until the autumn of 1969, involved the introduction of a counter-cyclical reserve system in Finland.  As the result of negotiations, the Finnish Council of State, the Federation of Finnish Industry, and the Central Association of Finnish Wood-working Industries signed a document binding them to create by the beginning of 1971 counter-cyclical reserves amounting to at least 400m.  Finmarks (£40m.). These will be partly in the form of counter-cyclical deposits with the Bank of Finland made by companies and partly as transfers to investment <Col N="2002" /> funds.</P>
    <P>The counter-cyclical deposits can be deducted from the firm's income in state and municipal taxation in the year in which it is made, and the Bank of Finland pays a 6 per cent tax-free interest rate on the deposit. Deposits are scheduled to be repaid in three equal instalments (at which time the money becomes liable to taxation) at the end of 1972, 1973 and 1974.</P>
    <P>The Council of State may decide, however, that counter-cyclical deposits can be drawn earlier if increased fixed investment is believed desirable in order to stimulate the economy.</P>
    <P>It is important that the points raised in general in this article and that the economic experience of the Finnish Government which is covered partly in this OECD survey that I have here, should be examined carefully by the Government to see if there is anything to be learned from them.  Certainly, if results are any indication, the results in this case have been very good.</P>
    <P>I should like to know what is the Minister's approach to the question of the dividend equalisation tax that was proposed originally in an article in <i>The Economist</i> sometime in 1964.  It was adopted by Fine Gael in our Just Society policy published in 1965 in which we foresaw many of the difficulties that have now arisen.  At that time, well in advance of the prices and incomes situation becoming critical we made some solid and practical proposals to meet the situation.  These were mainly based on a comprehensive prices and incomes policy to cover all sections of the community on a voluntary basis but this obviously needed teeth.  One of the teeth which Fine Gael proposed was a dividend equalisation tax, which was subsequently accepted by the NIEC in their first report on prices and incomes.  In their most recent report, Report No. 27, for some reason or other they have dropped this. They apparently do not believe in a dividend equalisation tax any more. They apparently believed in it in their first approach to the problem.  They have dropped it now in what has been described by Deputy Dr. FitzGerald as <Col N="2003" /> an NIEC report on incomes and prices which showed backward progress.  This dropping of the dividend equalisation tax is probably part of the backward progress to which he referred.</P>
    <P>I would like to know why the Government have not adopted this proposal. What is their attitude to it?  Do they not see the need for some tax which could be held in abeyance as long as the general overall increases in dividends were within the norms laid down for the economy, but which could be brought into effect if the general increase in dividends as a whole were to exceed the general increases in income which are considered by the Government to be correct.</P>
    <P>The dividend equalisation tax would not discourage competitive firms, who were making a lot of money and who wanted to pay handsome dividends and would not discourage people from investing their money in go-ahead firms.  This might happen if all dividends were limited to a particular ceiling. As long as the overall increase in dividends was kept within the particular norms laid down by the Government the tax would not be effective at all.  This would mean that it would be possible for very high dividends to be paid by one firm as long as low dividends were paid by other less successful firms.  Competition for finance would still operate.  It would only be when the overall level of dividends exceeded the norms laid down by the Government that the dividend equalisation tax would become effective. I would like to know what the attitude of the Government is to this.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, I do not claim to have any great knowledge of economics or of the methods by which this problem of inflation should be tackled. However, some of the suggestions I have made, although I am not qualified to hold rigid or firm beliefs in this field, should be investigated by the Government. I would particularly ask them to take a look at the experience in Finland and see if something could be learned from that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyOConnor" hpid="Mr. O'Connor Mr. O'Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>The measures which are being debated here, and which have been severely criticised by various <Col N="2004" /> speakers, would appear to be absolutely necessary because one would gather from the trend of the speakers opposite that they agree that they are necessary.  They are certainly necessary if we are to bring sanity back to our people and to correct the trend which was leading the nation into a dangerous situation.  This situation was brought about by the demands of highly organised associations to get the maximum, and, indeed, in many cases to get more out of the pot than was in it.</P>
      <P>I have never held that the system of agreeing to percentage increases, where wages are concerned, was the correct one.  There is a differentiation in the various scales of wages in the public service and indeed in that of our lowest paid workers.  The ordinary road-worker or the ordinary labourer needs as much to run his household as the civil servant and whatever increase the lower paid man gets should be the measure of the increase the highest paid man gets.  I do not believe it was ever intended that we should give our public servants double, treble and in many cases 20 times, the increase which some of our poorer people have got.</P>
      <P>Recently we had a demand for the 12th round wage increase for all the workers in Kerry County Council.  As far as I remember this increase cost the county over £200,000.  I asked for an increase for our home assistance recipients.  At a Kerry County Council meeting we passed the ignoble sum of £12,000 to help those poor people.  I asked for an increase of a £1 a week, which would come to about £4,000, to be guaranteed before the other increase was passed.  This happened about seven or eight weeks ago but the poorer sections of our people have not yet got their increase.  Our executive staff are still examining the position, trying to find out how many people there are and how much would be needed to meet this demand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are too many people nowadays trying to get more than they are entitled to.  We have still a long way to go to build up this nation of ours, to enable us to provide full employment for everybody and to give the <Col N="2005" /> maximum to the weaker sections.  It is the weaker sections who have spent their lives trying to build up this nation.  They had very frugal means by which to educate their children and to develop their small holdings and now they are left with very little to live on. I suppose it is natural that top organisations have to get the maximum and somebody has to go without.  This seems to be the system that prevails all the time.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that the demands of organisations for the maximum can bring about this situation whereby the rights of other people are ignored.  I have heard some of the speakers opposite, particularly Deputy Bruton, suggesting that the position that obtains in Finland should be examined in relation to our own.  I suppose we would learn something from them but our position and that of Finland and other countries are not comparable.  The number of people in insurable employment in Finland is very high in relation to both the sections of land workers and the people who are not at work. The opposite is the case in this country. We must obtain money to sustain our entire farming population.  We must also find money to support our old age pensioners and our home assistance and incapacitated people.  The numbers of those in relation to our working population are close to treble those in Finland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Twenty-six per cent of the population of Finland are in agriculture and forestry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyOConnor" hpid="Mr. O'Connor Mr. O'Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>But what about those industrially employed?  A large number of those employed in forestry and even in agriculture are in insurable employment, which is different altogether from our situation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>They are.  I spent two years in Europe, and that is one of the things I learned from the various countries.  The one thing that upsets the position here is that we have to subsidise people to an extent to which the Finns engaged in agriculture are not <Col N="2006" /> subsidised.  They earn very big money in afforestation and work their small holdings as a secondary line of production. They earn big money from forestry products, tree felling and timber manufacture, and all this is under the term &ldquo;agriculture&rdquo;.  In Ireland there is an imbalance in that many workers are earning very good money and other people have to live on a very low plane because of that. In my own area, in Killorglin and all around Killarney, there are young fellows of 17, 18 and 19 years of age earning £25 to £30 a week in a factory. This is more than comparable with many of the industrial areas, certainly the smaller areas, in Europe.  How this will be levelled out is anybody's guess. Many Deputies on the far side of the House stated that the last Budget started off this inflationary trend.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I was referring to a suggestion from across the House that the last Budget had an inflationary trend.  Budgets are necessary.  We cannot raise the money which is so badly needed for further development, for building houses, for giving increases to old age pensioners, for giving all-round increases, except through the Budget.  As far as I remember Deputy O'Donovan referred to it.  Does he suggest that progress should be brought to a halt and we should not give the necessary increases to old age pensioners and the helpless sections of our community?  We have to raise money through Budgets, but I cannot accept that the last Budget had the inflationary trends it is suggested it had.  If we are to keep industry moving forward and attain the target of full employment we must find ways and means of continuing to develop this programme. If our overall economic position is to be improved this is the only line of action we can take.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Bruton was particularly worried about how the Bill would affect solicitors, particularly young ones, who would be entitled to get increases at various stages.  I am not worried about solicitors because they <Col N="2007" /> are a group of people well able to look after themselves.  I do not think they will get lost in the race.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton made one remark with which I am in complete agreement. He said that the entire co-operation of the people, and I take it this applies to everyone in the House as well, is needed if we are to reach new heights in development and production to enable us to get the maximum amount of what is going.  It is this type of co-operation and direction which everyone, particularly the worker, needs.  If every Deputy broadcast that message at the crossroads and the different towns he would be doing a good job of work, because the people need that type of advice at the moment.</P>
    <P>I should like to draw the Minister's attention to an incident which was cited at a meeting of the Dingle Chamber of Commerce.  A trader told the meeting that all traders had been notified by a biscuit manufacturer that a price increase of 3d had been allowed under the price control system operated by the Minister.  Almost immediately the manufacturers sent a notice to the merchants concerned to the effect that they could suffer a reduction of 3d.  If this kind of thing can happen there is a need for a closer look at price increases before they are granted.</P>
    <P>Serious increases are facing coal and oil users.  The Government should look once again at the redevelopment of our bogland for the production of more fuel.  Coal is supposed to be going up by £2 per ton.  With this type of increase in the offing it would be worth the Government's while to redevelop our bogland particularly on the west coast where so much turf could be used. This would improve our balance of payments position considerably and give employment in areas where it is much needed.</P>
    <P>We are importing nearly £2 million worth of fish every year.  This is another side of our imports which could be examined and corrected because if fish imports were reduced our balance of payments would be helped. Pre-packed food is playing an important part in our everyday life but the packaging sometimes accounts for 10 <Col N="2008" /> per cent of the cost.  Food presented in this way is more convenient and easier to use but if we could get people back to eating natural food this would be of great help to our own industry.</P>
    <P>Recent wage increases granted to roadworkers in Kerry have resulted in a loss of working hours.  The workers have been given a wages increase for seven or eight months of the year but that is not really the answer for a man with a family to rear.  All too often engineers rush through work early on in the year, and even employ more men to get the work done more quickly, instead of spreading the work over the whole year, thereby keeping those employed in full employment throughout the year.</P>
    <P>I am sorry to note that not one member of the Fine Gael Party is in the House.  I should like to hear a member of that party endorse what Deputy Bruton has said about the co-operation of the entire country &mdash; I take it he also means the co-operation of all Deputies &mdash; being necessary.  Indeed, it is necessary.  We have a good country. We have good people, by and large. If we can lead them, advise them and help them, developing all their energies in the right direction, then they will make a proper contribution.  However, people cannot be allowed to have more than they are earning.  There must be a levelling off and more must be given to those in greatest need.  I trust that both sides of this House will co-operate in a policy which will bring a little sanity back into the situation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should, I think, admit that he made a mistake and withdraw this Bill.  It is not necessary.  Both the Taoiseach and the Minister have admitted that it is not necessary.  They have allowed negotiations to continue and they have asked for a voluntary agreement. Simultaneously, they put this gun to the heads of both the employers and the trade unions.  This is not the way in which to approach negotiations on wage increases.  There should be no gun involved in such negotiations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From the beginning we have seen this new Minister for Finance make mistakes.  I see him as a man who <Col N="2009" /> suddenly finds himself with real power as Minister for Finance.  He decides his predecessor was wrong.  He says he was not watching the economy.  He decides he must take urgent action and the Taoiseach, unfortunately, listens to him.  He decides there will be no backing down.  He rushes in like a bull in a china shop and makes a statement to the Press.  The Taoiseach, having recovered from the stress and strain of his visit to New York, realised that his new Minister for Finance was, perhaps, wrong and a more flexible approach must be adopted; that was followed by an admission that there would be a backing down on certain aspects.  The Minister should have admitted his mistake. He should have gone a step further and withdrawn this Bill for the time being, giving both parties an opportunity of sitting down and negotiating.</P>
    <P>We have seen a good deal of arrogance on the part of Ministers, Ministers quite unprepared to listen to reason.  I believe it was arrogance on the part of the present Minister for Finance that prevented him from saying he had been a little hasty.  I believe arrogance prevented him from withdrawing the Bill.  Before rushing in like a bull in a china shop he should have gone to both Congress and the employers and asked them to sit down and negotiate and told them that, if negotiations failed, then the Government might have to come in with a prices and incomes policy.  The Minister should not be above going to these bodies and discussing the position with them.  Had he done that this Bill would not have been necessary.  It is not necessary now.</P>
    <P>I am not saying there is no inflation. There is.  It is world-wide, but the Government have allowed inflation to continue beyond what was necessary.  We saw that in the turnover tax and the wholesale tax.  That was political expediency in action.  On 18th March, 1969, the Minister for Finance at the time &mdash; it was one of his periods of cool judgment &mdash; said we had a crisis on our hands and action would have to be taken to meet that crisis.  He was being an honest Minister then.  What he said was true.  Three weeks later the crisis <Col N="2010" /> suddenly disappeared like a mist.  This is where political expediency came in. It was not wise to have a crisis on the eve of a general election.  He adopted a Micawber-like attitude; he hoped something would turn up.  This was a covering up.  We do not know exactly what other covering up took place in the economic sphere though we are well aware of the covering up that took place in another sphere in regard to a matter which was debated here at length.  Perhaps it is the results of this covering up that we are suffering from today.</P>
    <P>The turnover tax was doubled this year.  I heard a man in a shop say that only the turnover tax had been increased and there was no increase on cigarettes and drink.  This shows how naïve the general public can be. Then the repercussions began.  Prices spiralled; inflation began to gallop. The Minister was aware of the fact that he was bringing in this measure but he allowed CIE to increase fares and he allowed the Department of Posts and Telegraphs to increase the cost of postage and other charges.  This was dishonest.  These increases should not have been allowed.</P>
    <P>There has been an obvious wavering from day to day.  There is no set policy.  The Government were advised by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and by the Central Bank that there should be more emphasis on direct taxation.  They ignored the warnings and advice given by the two bodies. It is interesting that the Central Bank and the ICTU agreed that there should be more emphasis on direct taxation. The policy of the Government has always been indirect taxation &mdash; a policy that has increased the prices of essential goods and one that weighs heavily on the most vulnerable in our community. The Government cannot pretend to have concern for the underdog and for the people on low incomes; they have never had concern for those people and their policy of indirect taxation proves this.  Turnover tax has been put on food and medicines by this Government &mdash; the people who claim to be concerned about the poor of the country.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2011" /> We hear frequently that the former Minister for Finance, Deputy Haughey, was a brilliant Minister.  With his knowledge, experience and grasp of economic affairs it is puzzling that we have not heard what he thinks of the Prices and Incomes Bill.  As far as I remember, he more or less denounced it.  I do not think Fianna Fáil is overburdened with economists and financial experts and it is puzzling that we have not had the good fortune to hear Deputy Haughey speak on this Bill.</P>
    <P>The former Minister for Finance presented a very simple Budget that was endorsed subsequently by the present Minister.  I am quite sure that the present Minister did not like that Budget; however, he had no option but to endorse it, even though he knew it would create an inflationary trend.  I have read the Minister's speech but there are several points he made that force me to regard the statement with some derision.</P>
    <P>The Minister said &ldquo;This Bill is not aimed at cutting back workers' living standards&rdquo;.  I represent a constituency that comprises 99 per cent of workers at Ballyfermot, Crumlin, Inchicore and Drimnagh.  I have been in their houses, both as doctor and TD; I have not seen any great opulence &mdash; most of them live from week to week.  Some of them may have a car and it is an effort to provide petrol, tax and insurance. Incidentally, the Government allowed an increase in insurance rates prior to the introduction of the Bill but they now say that there are provisions for ensuring that insurance rates will not be increased.  I know the problems of people in my constituency and at the end of many years of struggle few of them have, by their standards, a little comfort.</P>
    <P>I was surprised to hear the Tánaiste compare this country with Sweden and speak about Sweden's difficulties.  He spoke about the severe problems that country was experiencing but he did not trouble to compare the benefits to the workers in Sweden with those in this country.  The Tánaiste said that the rise in consumer prices in Sweden has not been more than 7 per cent and said that people <Col N="2012" /> should realise the fact that these problems occur elsewhere.  He further stated:</P>
    <P>At the moment the Swedes are facing an acute inflation.  This is the kind of thing to which people here should pay attention in order to get the right perspective.  The Swedes are in a state of great consternation because there has been an increase of 7 per cent in consumer prices in one year.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste is quick to make a comparison with Sweden.  We would be glad to give him time to discuss the social welfare and superannuation benefits paid to employees in Sweden as compared to benefits in Ireland.  A different picture might emerge from such a comparison.  It is easy to compare when it suits one's purpose but a fair comparison is essential and this has not been made.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste also compared us with Denmark where he stated there is a serious balance of payments problem. However, Denmark is providing much more for workers than we are.  The Government say that the Bill is not aimed at cutting back the living standards of workers.  I say it is.  That is the intention of this Bill.</P>

The Tánaiste compared our standards today with those obtaining 12 or 15 years ago.  They were very low 12 or 15 years ago.  We cannot honestly talk about percentage increases; we must remember how low our standard of living was 15 years ago.  I have not <Col N="2013" /> seen great opulence in Ballyfermot, Crumlin, Drimnagh or Bluebell.  I see ordinary working people, living in small houses, frequently in overcrowded conditions.

      <P>The intention of this Bill is to prevent the workers seeking a greater slice of the national cake and the Labour Party are fully aware of this.  During my five years in this House I was involved in a few strikes. I do not like strikes and do not think they should take place; I have always thought that problems could be solved if people got together and talked.  However, I have not been convinced that on every occasion employers were anxious to talk.  I remember the occasion of a bus strike when the general manager of CIE, Mr. Lemass, was unwilling to talk with the employees. I remember a printers strike and on that occasion the employers' federation said they were going on holidays to the continent and it suited them to have a strike.</P>
      <P>This decision to strike and to bring about the turmoil of which we speak is not all on the part of the workers.  The workers have not the high living standard of which Ministers boast.  The workers are entitled to a bigger share. They should not be satisfied with a small share of the profits of these companies.  If we talk about productivity not being as high as it should be this may be due to bad management. The workers and the employers do not meet often enough in the big concerns. This is where the breakdowns occur.  If the workers were taken into the employers' confidence we might have more productivity and more understanding. The workers are more than willing on all occasions to consider the problems of the employers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said that the Bill is aimed at avoiding further disimprovement in the level of employment.  There is a disimprovement in the level of employment.  That is obvious.  The <Col N="2014" /> Minister agrees with this.  This is due to the fact that we have not got an independent economy.  Our trouble arose because we were too anxious to bring in foreign capital.  I spoke to many Irish people who were anxious to set up on their own here and they always said that if one did not know how to complete a form or spell one's name but applied for an industrial grant one would get it.  They felt that if one's name was not Irish one would be certain to get a grant.  A foreigner going to the IDA or An Foras Tionscal would have the form completed for him and would be given a grant.  We have much talent in this country, much ability among the workers, but that talent and ability have never been fostered.  We were anxious to bring in foreign companies to establish offshoots of the big international corporations here.  This has proved to be very dangerous.  If anything goes wrong, the offshoot is the part of the international corporation that suffers and if this happens we may find ourselves faced with mass unemployment.  We have not got an independent economy.  We have never really tried to exploit our own resources.  Fishing is one example of this.</P>
    <P>The Minister says that this legislation is clearly in the long-term interests of every section of the community.  I cannot see how this is so.  How could this incomes policy which is due to expire in December, 1971, have any other effect except to open the floodgates to wage demands and increases long overdue?  I may have a suspicious mind but I must ask what will happen in November, 1971?  It may be the Minister's intention to continue with this policy.  The record has shown that one cannot trust the Fianna Fáil Government very much.  The Minister says that ever since the pay settlement for the maintenance craftsmen the Government have repeatedly made it clear that the level of the 12th round increase was grossly excessive and bound to lead to unemployment.  The ex-Minister for Finance went on television and stated that things were not good. That was denied three weeks later.  It was said in the House that no such statement had been made and that no such state of affairs existed.  It was <Col N="2015" /> claimed to be a myth.  This is where the question arises as to whether we can believe the Government in regard to what they intend to do.  We cannot trust them at all.  This country cannot trust the Government.</P>
    <P>I read what the Tánaiste said about constant exhortations to the workers. I do not think there have been constant exhortations such as the Tánaiste has referred to.  Any such exhortations have taken place at businessmen's lunches and such functions.  The phraseology used has not been comprehensible to the ordinary person. There is talk of the gross national product and of the price index but these terms are not comprehensible to the ordinary worker or to the housewife. The Government have not explained their plans.  They were not anxious to state the position in this House.  Both Opposition parties were constantly telling the Government about the price increases.  The present Minister for Finance, who was Minister for Industry and Commerce, said often that there was no evidence in his Department of price increases.  I attacked him on several occasions about price increases.  I asked the Minister how he would get evidence of such increases.  The Minister felt that people would write and tell him about them.</P>
    <P>Before I came to this House I did not know that I should write to a Minister.  I was a doctor in general practice and yet I did not know about writing to the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  In my opinion people would not write to the Minister to tell him about every single increase.  The Minister left the onus on the consumer to find out about such increases.  He said that price control was working well.  We have a different admission here by a few Ministers and a Parliamentary Secretary. Things did not work out well with the Prices Act of 1965.  The Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach admitted that the Prices (Amendment) Act was not working out properly even though the Government had wide powers of control.  The wide powers of control were there but nothing was being done.  This is obvious from the <Col N="2016" /> fact that prices have been increasing out of all proportion and nothing has been done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Out of all proportion to what?  The Deputy is ignoring the whole basic point when he says that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Prices have increased out of all proportion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to what? Costs?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, in relation to costs, to workers' wages and wage increases. We think prices are exorbitant. This point has never been tackled. The Minister would say that he had granted an increase but he never gave details of the investigation which took place to justify that increase.  It is simple to give workers 10s or £1 increase and to increase prices by 6d. If it is a fast selling product, and the volume is good, the Minister will be assured of 30s or £2 a week per worker back.  This is shown where the profits of companies have increased by so much in the past two years.</P>
      <P>They keep saying, in effect: &ldquo;This Bill will do the job&rdquo;.  They said that the Prices (Amendment) Bill, 1965, would do everything.  In an amendment which was not accepted, we suggested that there should be a closer scrutiny of the application for a price increase but the Minister thought everything was fine.  Certainly, in reply to questions of ours, on all occasions he felt everything would be all right and that we had no need to worry; that the prices increases were not excessive and were fully justified. When so many Members of this side of the House told the Minister that unnecessary price increases were taking place, he said there was no evidence to that effect in his Department.  We now know that he had not even the personnel to check.  He had no way of detecting what price increases on essential goods were taking place unknown to him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Time and time again the Fianna Fáil Party have asked the questions in effect: &ldquo;What would you do?  What would you want done?&rdquo; The Labour Party are not opposed to a prices and incomes policy.  We should like the incomes policy to include all incomes <Col N="2017" />&mdash; everything, right across the board. We would like a prices policy which envisaged the setting up of a court, something like the Labour Court, having on it representatives of the trade unions, consumers &mdash; associations such as these.  Any company wanting to increase the price of its products would have to go before that court and justify the increase.  We should like to see a proper price control body such as this &mdash; not in the Department of Industry and Commerce, separate from that &mdash; that would be able to state all the facts and before which an applicant for an increase would have to appear and make his case.  We would stand by any Government with a prices policy such as that and also an incomes policy that would not be a wages policy but an incomes policy that was spelled out. In this Bill, the Minister does not spell out an incomes policy.  There are no loopholes for the workers to get any thing extra.  If the worker is looking for shorter hours this Bill prevents him from obtaining them.  The emphasis here is on what the worker must do. Then, just to make it look nice and to add the icing on the cake, the Minister states that this will apply to directors, to shareholders, and people like that.  However, a worker cannot go back in January, 1972, and say: &ldquo;You did not give me any increase or enough of an increase; can we not go back and claim it now?&rdquo;  The Minister knows that the shareholders and directors can do it and get the increase but that the worker cannot.  As it is, it is difficult enough for the worker to get an increase to which he is entitled.</P>
    <P>The Minister states that failure of attempts to secure a voluntary agreement was accompanied and followed by substantial wage claims by certain unions.  Would he spell out exactly the number of wage claims, please?  He further states that some claims were for an increase in the region of 50 per cent or £8 to £10 a week.  I should like to know what particular union was involved here which was making a claim for £8 or £10 a week.  I do not think the Minister should infer that unions were doing this unless he gives the full details.  From my knowledge of the situation, this is not so.  There was <Col N="2018" /> one worker in a particular industry who put forward a suggestion for something like a 100 per cent increase but it was thrown out.  It never reached the stage where it would be considered.  We always have those people in our community just as we have psychopaths, and so on.</P>
    <P>The Minister says they have a duty to safeguard the national economy.  Of course, they have: that is the duty of the Government.  The Minister further states that we must protect the weaker sections of the community from the consequences of the selfish actions of their better placed fellows.  He is talking, I presume, about the stronger placed workers.  Is this correct?</P>

We are talking about the better off worker, the man whose neighbour is on a differential rent.  The emphasis is on him.  This is the <i>cri de coeur.</i>  This is the thing that cries to the public.  The person earning £25 or £30 a week is the selfish person.  He must not be allowed to exploit his neighbour who is on the dole or receiving social welfare. This is what is intended here. This is to evoke public sympathy and get people to say it is quite right. What the Minister should be saying <Col N="2020" /> is that there are speculators but he did not say anything about that.  This Fianna Fáil Government did nothing to stop the speculators from defrauding the people, and I call that defrauding the people.</P>

      <P>The Minister talks about controlling the price of new houses.  He has not gone about it the right way.  He has not even talked about controlling the price of land.  This is trying to job off the workers by saying he will control their wages and make sure that there will be price control in relation to new houses, when he knows prices have got out of hand completely and when he knows it is impossible for any working person to raise the deposit on his present income. I advised many people to try to buy their own houses.  I told them if they saved up to £300 they would be able to raise the deposit.  I know people who by stinting and saving managed to get the money but they found that the deposit had gone up to £500.  I have seen people who tried to continue saving but each time the deposit beat them.</P>
      <P>The Minister is allowing this to happen.  I talk about collective responsibility and no Minister there can tell me: &ldquo;I did not say that.  I was not responsible for that,&rdquo; because I say that each man there is responsible and each man there was responsible for allowing the price of houses to go beyond the reach of the workers.  Is it too much for a worker to ask for a house to live in, for a roof and shelter over his head?  I do not think that is a lot to ask for in this country which is talked about as being a Christian country.  The Constitution says that the family is the important unit and that we should therefore provide houses for families.</P>

      <P>If the Government are serious they should say: &ldquo;Let us be honest and put into action some of the <Col N="2023" /> clauses of the Constitution, some of the articles in it&rdquo;&mdash; for instance Article 41.  Let us see what they have done about that.</P>
      <P>This is the fraud in the Minister's statement in which he tells us he will control the price of new houses.  I am not convinced of this and I say this speech is a fraud.  To try to appease the ordinary worker the Minister said that the action which the Government proposed to take is not, of course, confined to pay.  Do not think for one moment that it is a wage freeze.  This is another fraud because he knows in his heart and soul that he cannot implement what is in this Bill.  He cannot do that with regard to profits and dividends.  He is well aware of this. Let him not fool us on it.</P>

I figured it was not worth fighting the last election because they had done so much for the country-everything was marvellous they said. If the gravity of the problem is widely appreciated among our people it is certainly due to no effort on the Government's part.  It was the Opposition who were constantly telling the people that.

      <P>From the way in which the Government have carried on in office, nobody would expect the workers to trust them.  The workers will not be fobbed off by being told that this Bill is aimed at protecting them. Even the Higher Senior Civil Servants Association have expressed a vote of no confidence in the Government.  To my way of thinking, that is the last straw.  All over the country, the attitude has been the same &mdash; no confidence in the present Administration.  Covering up can be done for so long but not forever.  While I was still at school I remember the Bill dealing with CIE being introduced.  At that time, one of our teachers told us of how dishonest the Government were.  Down through the years it has been the same. Deputy Cluskey spoke here about Taca and he read for us one of their dinner menus.  All these things indicate that the Government have never been either sincere or honest.</P>

      <P>I must say that I had great respect for the present Minister for Finance when he first came here.  I thought then that he was a very sincere man.  I remember his view as being that a period in opposition would be good for the Government. His view was that such a period in opposition would rid Fianna Fáil of the maligant growth from which they were suffering.  These were his views. The words I am using may not have <Col N="2031" /> been his &mdash; I have put them in medical terms.  I understood the Minister's view to be that Fianna Fáil did not know who were the true Fianna Fáil men. I believed that the Minister was sincere at that time.  That is why I am talking about the workers.  I regard the Minister as representing this Government.</P>

      <P>I am talking about the Minister and about the sincerity which I had no reason to doubt at one time.  I do not think he liked these Tacateers who were grasping Fianna Fáil and destroying the party.  The Minister for Finance really believed there should be something done about it.  I would not like him to become a part of this business and talk about repressive legislation against the workers.  This is not good enough.</P>
      <P>I admire the Minister though I had occasion one time not to do so.  When I was growing up we lived in poverty and we received a secondary education, probably through accident and a little persuading of the Christian Brothers by my mother that if we got first place in the class we would not have to pay. I heard that when one reached the age of 16 or 17 one could get a job in the corporation if one had a letter from a Fianna Fáil TD.  I went with a friend to see the Minister's father on the Malahide Road.  He did not give me a letter but he gave one to my friend. My father had not been out in 1916. The Minister's father asked my friend if his father had been and when he said he had, he got the letter and got the job in the rates department of Dublin Corporation.  It makes me very bitter when I think over that.  I have known all my life that if you wanted to get anything in this country you had to have a letter from some Fianna Fáil Minister.  I received a letter from a man in Galway seeking a labourer's cottage. I showed it to an important person in the Fianna Fáil Cabinet.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to hold up the House for very long because a lot has already been said on this Bill.  There is an old saying &ldquo;well begun is half done&rdquo;.  There was <Col N="2035" /> a great deal of confused thinking in regard to this Bill when it was introduced. While the Bill may have meant certain things it did not indicate what was wanted.  It was only when the pressure was put on by some of the trade unions that it was seen how difficult it would be to get this Bill through all stages.  We then had a virtual climb down by the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance.  It was shown to them beyond yea or nay how difficult it would be to implement this Bill in full.  This was proved in exactly the same way when a similar type Bill was introduced across the water.  I do not intend to set at naught the efforts of the Minister in trying to rectify a very difficult situation but I believe he went the wrong way about it.  I believe if he had consulted with people prior to the publication of this Bill, he would have found a better answer because there is always an answer to every human problem.  Even though the talks may have started off on the wrong foot by the time they are finished a certain amount of agreement will have been reached without the introduction of the coercion which I see running through this Bill. The Minister is well aware, with his background in the national movement and that of his people that while we may talk with an Irishman and bring him along, he will not be coerced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is what is happening here.  We are putting a standstill on wages, a standstill on incentives and a standstill on bonuses, and we are doing it in many different ways.  We are doing it by the introduction of the differential rents system on corporation estates. Although the Minister admitted to me a fortnight ago that there would be no increase in differential rents, that they were frozen, the Minister for Local Government said the following week that was not the position.  As a result of what the Minister for Local Government said, a questionnaire has been sent to all employers in the country whereby they are to inform the local authorities of every penny that is earned by employees occupying corporation houses.  This is what is happening in all Corporation estates.  Incentives, collective bargaining and bonuses have <Col N="2036" /> all come under the lash of the differential rents system.</P>
    <P>Where will this lead?  The simple answer is that the workers will not bother their heads to improve production. They will not bother their heads about the incentives given because they will be taken back either through the local authority by way of increases in differential rents or by way of income tax.  In my own city they have organised to oppose this and I am proud to say that we in the Labour Party will lead that opposition in Limerick.  The days are gone when if any firm modernise their production, improve their organisation they then say to the workers: &ldquo;Because of your efforts last year we made £X.  We are dividing it down the middle so that there is so much for you and so much for us, and we hope to double that next year.&rdquo; That is what I see in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Then there is the threat against the unions, the fines to be imposed.  Does the Minister not know in his heart and soul that there is no more chance of beating organised labour than of the Pope becoming a Protestant?  I do not know what rushed the Minister into this, because it is not the way he usually handles these things.  Not alone the Parliamentary Labour Party but organised labour throughout the country will oppose this in every shape and form.  To avoid all that, the Minister should allow the worker to increase his income through the incentive bonus so that he can enjoy the results of the labour he has put in on the shop floor.</P>
    <P>There are people in industry who I would not put in charge of a fish stall in Moore Street, with all due respect to the traders in Moore Street.  There is the problem of the Hibernian Transport Company.  No one knows where that will end.  However, I know something about it because we are deeply involved in it in Limerick.  I know why the Hibernian Company crashed and it was not the workers or the dockers who crashed it.  The Government were warned that this was coming and they did nothing about it.</P>
    <P>Here is the comparison.  If an organisation are efficient, if they have good public relations and if there is co-operation between employer and <Col N="2037" /> employee, through their united efforts the cake will be bigger.  It is a different situation where the directors have their business breakfast at 8.30 a.m. provided by a qualified chef; their business coffee between 11 o'clock and 11.30; their business luncheon between 1 and 3 o'clock; and then at 5 o'clock have their tea and go off to the golf links.  That is what was happening in the Hibernian Transport Company.  I know it and the Government knew it.</P>
    <P>You cannot run a rule over society generally as is being done in this Bill. The result will be to curb efficiency and reduce the effectiveness and driving force of workers.  It is like putting a racehorse into a donkey derby.  That is how it seems to me in my business.</P>
    <P>I would advise the Minister to have another look at this whole situation before it is too late.  While the Government increase their expenditure by 20 per cent, the unfortunate man on the workshop floor who is working from 8 o'clock in the morning until late in the evening on overtime, Saturday work and so on, in order to bring home a few more pounds to provide those extra comforts we all need, has his income reduced by the introduction of this Bill.  The Tánaiste has made comparisons with other countries.  I cannot subscribe to comparisons with other countries in these matters, because this is Ireland, Sweden is Sweden, Canada is Canada, and Australia is Australia. We cannot make such comparisons. We must live within our means and within our means of production.</P>
    <P>If we do not produce goods and export them the country is doomed. This Bill is putting a halt on production and incentives.  If collective bargaining is not allowed, if it is to be 6 per cent all round, we are putting a halt on the progressive firm.  I am not going into the details of this Bill as assiduously as I should; I am looking at the overall picture.  We can talk about speculators, but the Minister knows more about that than anybody else.  That is like throwing apples into an orchard as far as the Minister is concerned.  The Minister spoke about people in high places and we admired him for doing so.  It was about time <Col N="2038" /> somebody in his party said, &ldquo;Stop&rdquo;. As far as dividends, directors' fees and expenses are concerned we all know about the old swindle sheet.  Directors are able to wine and dine their customers royally because these expenses are offset by tax reliefs which means the State are paying anyway.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to get involved in details; I am just trying to give the Minister a clear picture.  Unlike the Minister and his colleagues I happen to live with the people day and night. The best way for a man in public life to educate himself is to be a good listener.  In order to prevent chaos in industry I would advise the Minister, in the interests of the country generally and in the interests of the workers, to have another look at this Bill.  The one thing to remember here about an Irishman is that you can lead him but never drive him.</P>

      <P>This has been a lengthy and in some respects a tedious debate on the Second Stage.  It is reasonable to expect that those who oppose the Bill oppose it broadly on one of two grounds: either on the ground that there is no serious problem of inflation and, consequently, there is no necessity for the Bill; or that there is such a problem but that the approach outlined in this Bill is the wrong approach for solving that problem.  A different approach would be spelled out and the Government would be told &ldquo;That is the line you should take&rdquo;.  The most significant thing about this debate is the deafening silence from the Opposition benches on what they think should be done, with the exception of Deputy Keating who did purport to offer an alternative approach, and I shall deal with him separately.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am coming to that. It was quoted in the debate by Deputy Donegan.  The point I am making is that in this situation, where everybody who spoke admitted we have a serious <Col N="2039" /> problem of inflation, what the public wants and expects to know, irrespective of what Mr. Lemass said or what Deputy Donegan or Deputy Tully quoted him as saying, is whether the Opposition are suggesting an alternative approach to this problem.  They now know that the Opposition are not suggesting any alternative.</P>
      <P>We can approach this matter on the basis of whether or not there is a serious problem.  There has been widespread acknowledgment that there is a serious problem.  Virtually all speakers from the Fine Gael Party have said &ldquo;Yes, there is a serious problem&rdquo;. They then went on to tell us why we had this problem.  They alleged it was because the Government had not taken action.  They alleged they had told us in the past how it should be done.  Indeed, some of them went back 20 years, some ten years, some five years and some back to the last Budget, but virtually all of them went back to tell us about the past.  I shall deal with some of the arguments made in that regard, but before I follow that red herring I want to draw attention to the fact that this country is today faced with a serious problem of inflation.</P>
      <P>The public want to know if the Opposition can suggest an alternative approach for dealing with that problem today.  They do not want to know what caused the problem, whether it was 30 years ago, ten years ago or the last Budget, the public's interest is in what is to be done about this problem.  In this Bill and the Supplementary Budget the Government are proposing a certain line of approach.  With the exception, as I have said, of Deputy Keating, who purported to offer an alternative approach, no Opposition Deputy attempted to outline how he thought the problem should be approached. Even in the context of the furious efforts being made by the Fine Gael Party and the Labour Party to lay the foundations for a possible coalition, we did not hear what the Fine Gael Party or the Labour Party, or the Fine Gael Party and the Labour Party in a coalition, if they were in office tomorrow would do about this problem. The deafening silence on this matter is one that the public will not lose sight of.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2040" /> The public will know that the approach which the Government are taking must be, by and large, the best approach because no one has been able to suggest anything better.  I made it very clear from the beginning when announcing the policy enshrined in this Bill that we were reluctant to take this course, that there were certain fundamental aspects of it that were essential, but that we were willing and happy to listen to representations from any quarter in regard to anomalies that would crop up or in regard to a better line of approach to this problem.  As I say, we did not hear anything about it except in the case of Deputy Keating. I had better dispose of that now in case I lose sight of it later.</P>
    <P>Basically, Deputy Keating said that what was wrong was that the system was wrong; inevitably you had to have this kind of problem in a capitalist society and, until the whole system was changed, you could expect this kind of thing to happen.  However, subject to that basic and fundamental point, in the context of the society in which we live &mdash; in other words in the context of the problem with which the Government are faced &mdash; he made certain suggestions. He suggested that we must have a multiple approach to the problem of controlling inflation.  Monetary control and taxation were necessary in addition to an incomes policy.  This is, of course, perfectly true and I would remind the House that, in regard to monetary control, in the early part of this year there were quite stringent restrictions applied in relation to hire purchase and certain guidelines were laid down by the banks in connection with the extension of credit.  Because of the banks closure we do not know precisely what has happened to credit. We will know in a month or two and we should then have a reasonably accurate idea of the position but, as of now, we do not know and this, of course, is a disadvantage in attacking the whole problem of inflation.</P>
    <P>There is no evidence to suggest there has been a wholesale increase in the amount of credit during the banks closure.  If there had been this would be an additional contributory factor in dealing with inflation but, while we do not know and cannot know until the <Col N="2041" /> accounts are made up, such evidence as there is does not suggest that there has been any massive increase in credit.</P>
    <P>Deputy Keating also suggested that a system of differential taxation would induce lower interest rates at home and hold more capital in the country. He did not advert to that working in reverse; he did not advert to whether that would keep capital out.  He would not, I think, suggest that, leaving aside the intricacies of this problem, this and the other points he put forward, taken together and put into operation as a package deal, would solve the problem of inflation with which we are faced.  He dealt with the matter in very competent terms, if I may say so.  He was one of the few speakers on the Opposition benches who adverted to the fact that this is a worldwide problem but he distinguished between the worldwide effect of it and the internal inflation from which we are suffering.  They are two separate items.  There is obviously no way in which we can control the effects of world inflation, if I may call it that.  The really worrying and damaging development in recent times in our economy has been the extent of internal inflation reflected in the rate at which our unit wage costs went ahead.</P>

      <P>I was saying that of all the speakers from the Opposition benches in this debate the only one who purported to offer any alternative line of approach was Deputy Keating.

      <P>No, for the benefit of the Opposition Deputies.  Deputy Keating also said that a reduction in profits was one method that might be used in controlling inflation.  He did not advert &mdash; there was a noticeable absence of advertence by Opposition speakers on this &mdash; to the tax imposed on profits in the Supplementary Budget.  Listening to the Opposition speeches one would think nothing was being controlled except wages.  This is not true.  I know that most Opposition Deputies have met representatives of the Federation of Irish Industries and heard their version of the effect of that tax and, if they are to be believed, the effect will be devastating, to say the least of it.  Whether or not that is true is another matter, but I think it is reasonable to expect&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Deputy Tully is now bearing out the point I am making.  He and Opposition speakers would like to discuss this Bill and pretend there was no increase in taxation on profits.  This is relevant to the debate and I think I have made that point.</P>
      <P>We had statements from Deputies, some of them in rather arrogant, superior tones, about the alleged way in which this matter has been fumbled, mishandled and so on.  We had suggestions from both Opposition parties that, having announced the policy, we ran away from it.  To illustrate this I will refer to a speech made by Deputy Cruise-O'Brien on 4th November in this debate.  In his own inimitable way he painted a picture of the announcement of policy changes.  He went on to say &ldquo;The Minister in whom we are asked to have confidence&rdquo;&mdash; I am sorry.  The Deputy made this statement during the debate on the Vote of Confidence&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>All right.  I will dig it up.  I will now quote from column 956, volume 249 of the Official Report, the debate on the Second Stage of the Prices and Incomes Bill.  I shall quote from my statement and also some interruptions that took place:</P>
      <P>The failure of attempts to secure a voluntary agreement by the Employer/Labour Conference was accompanied and followed by substantial wage claims by certain unions &mdash; some were for an increase in the region of 50 per cent or £8 to £10 a week &mdash; and by a rising level of expectations on the part of the workers generally.</P>
      <P>Dr. O'Donovan: That is not true.</P>
      <P>Mr. Colley: It is true.</P>
      <P>Dr. O'Donovan: It is not.</P>
      <P>Mr. Colley: Of course it is true.</P>
      <P>Mr. Desmond: Which claim?</P>
      <P>An Ceann Comhairle: Deputies will get an opportunity of replying to the Minister later.</P>
      <P>Dr. O'Donovan: We can reply plenty on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2045" /> Mr. Colley: It was agreed that that was true by the Congress of ICTU in our discussions with them.</P>
    <P>I think I actually said the Executive; however, it was agreed in our discussions with them.</P>
    <P>Dr. O'Donovan: It is not true.</P>
    <P>Mr. Colley: I was there.</P>
    <P>Dr. O'Donovan: I have been with them.</P>
    <P>Mr. Colley: I was there.</P>
    <P>In column 957 of the same volume it is further stated:</P>
    <P>Mr. Colley: The Deputy does not know what he is talking about.  I was there.</P>
    <P>Dr. O'Donovan: That is not true.</P>
    <P>Mr. Colley: The Deputy should not accuse me of telling lies.  I am saying I was there and it was said.</P>
    <P>Dr. O'Donovan: I will accuse any member of this Government of telling lies if I feel like it.</P>
    <P>Mr. Colley: It is easy enough for the Deputy to make assertions of that nature.</P>
    <P>Dr. O'Donovan: I am telling the truth.</P>
    <P>Mr. Colley: The Deputy is not telling the truth.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donovan was backed up by Deputy Desmond and by other speakers on that side of the House.  I know the Labour Party do not like this but I have repeated that quotation from the debate because I took grave exception to the statement by Deputy O'Donovan. On thinking over the matter I thought it might have been said in the heat of the moment; therefore when the Deputy was speaking in the debate I said that I was giving the Deputy an opportunity to withdraw the remark. He replied &ldquo;Not at all&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This is in the same pattern as some of the other allegations with which we have had to deal.  I should like to tell the House the following facts.  In the electrical contracting industry two claims were lodged with the National Joint Industrial Council at the end of September, 1970.  The larger claim was for an hourly rate of 20s as against <Col N="2046" /> the existing rate of 10s 3d &mdash; an increase of £19 10s for a 40-hour week, or 95 per cent, plus improvements in shift work, overtime rates, country allowances, <i>et cetera</i>.  The smaller claim that was lodged was for an hourly rate of 15s &mdash; an increase of £9 10s or 46 per cent, plus 2s allowance per hour site allowance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>By whom was it lodged?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I was about to say. The larger claim was made by the Irish Engineering Industrial and Electrical Trade Union and the smaller claim by the Electrical Trade Union of Ireland.  However, these are not the only ones.  In the building construction industry, at a meeting of the Joint Industrial Council on 13th October, 1970, the union claimed, <i>inter alia</i>, a pre-agreement adjustment of 6d per hour, or £1 for a 40-hour week, and an increase for all building workers of £6 per week for a one year agreement, a total of £7 per week. Taking Dublin rates, this £7 per week would mean a 35 per cent increase for skilled workers and 40 per cent increase for unskilled workers. In the ESB there was a claim by the National Engineering and Electrical Trade Union, on the 31st July last, which amounted to an increase of 42 per cent at the minimum and 48 per cent at the maximum, or an increase of £8 at the minimum to £12 at the maximum.  In the case of electricians, there was a claim by the Electrical Trade Union of Ireland on the 12th October, 1970, which would have the effect of giving an increase of £5 to £6 for all workers and up to £8 to workers qualifying for shift premium.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I have made my point. The next thing I want to deal with is that Deputy Dr. FitzGerald in this House and outside it has made great play with the argument that the Government failed to grasp the opportunity which was given to them in 1965 with the publication of the NIEC report on the economic situation, which was known as Report No. 11, and which set out the principles on which an incomes <Col N="2049" /> policy could be based.  Deputy Dr. FitzGerald is being very naïve about this.  I would be the first to acknowledge that the report was a very important first step towards the achievement of a voluntary incomes policy, but it was only a first step.  The NIEC in their subsequent report on full employment said that the statements in Report No. 11 did not add up to an incomes policy in the sense of being a series of measures or actions directed towards establishing the conditions in which an appropriate relationship between income and production could be achieved.</P>
      <P>The Full Employment Report and subsequent NIEC report stressed that institutional arrangements were necessary both to achieve the concensus on which an incomes policy must rest and to enable this consensus to have an effect on what was actually happening on the incomes front.  The theory of an incomes policy is simple, but the effective implementation of an incomes policy is not simple.  It has not been satisfactorily solved in any country in which free enterprise dominates.  As experience in Britain and elsewhere has shown, new institutional arrangements of the type needed for an incomes policy cannot be created overnight.  If they are to work they must be accepted and supported by all the parties concerned.</P>
      <P>The Government, in the Third Programme, set out their ideas of the type of institutional arrangements which might be appropriate.  The NIEC returned to this question early in 1969. They spent over a year trying to reach agreement on the new institutional arrangements.  They finally reached an agreement and that in itself was a tremendous achievement.  The practical recommendations in the report offered a means for implementing the principles which had been set out earlier.  Unfortunately it appears that the proposals in that report, which Deputy Dr. FitzGerald seems to consider unduly conservative, were so far in advance of thinking among some of the trade unions, at any rate, that support for them was not given at the annual congress of ICTU.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2050" /> When the NIEC report came out, the Government accepted that its contents represented a consensus of the views of both unions and employers. The Government made every effort to have them implemented.  The Government moved very fast on that front.</P>

      <P>When that report came out, the Government, accepting that it represented a consensus of view between unions and employers, made every effort to have it implemented. Government policy continues to aim at a rational and realistic policy on incomes &mdash; preferably by way of voluntary agreement.  There is one particular aspect of Deputy FitzGerald's <i>naïveté</i> in this field on which I want to make a special comment.  He seems to consider that the introduction of a dividends equalisation tax is all that is necessary to ensure an effective and voluntary incomes policy.  Yet, in an article in the <i>Irish Times</i> on 22nd October, 1970, he acknowledged that the tax which he proposes &mdash; if it had been in force &mdash; would not have been applicable in any year between 1959 and 1967 except 1966.  I think it is not unfair to say that the importance which wage- and salary-earners would attach to a tax which might never be applied is, at the least, problematical.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2051" /> There is no specific mention of a dividends equalisation tax in the NIEC Report No. 11.  In paragraph 60 of that report, reference is made to tax or other measures and we are advised to look at what other countries are doing.  The idea of a dividends equalisation tax was, as far as I know, first put forward in the British journal, <i>The Economist,</i> in 1963.  Even during the Labour Government's tenure of office in Britain, there was no question of introducing it.  The idea was examined in detail in my Department and by the Revenue Commissioners.  I am satisfied it could not effectively or equitably be applied.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government accept that aggregate profits and income from dividends should not rise excessively compared with other incomes.  Present taxation provisions are, I believe, adequate to deal with any tendency for them to do so.  This is surely confirmed by the fact &mdash; as Deputy FitzGerald accepts &mdash; that only in 1966 have they risen faster than wage and salary incomes. Only in that year would such a tax have operated if we had one enacted. The present Bill deals somewhat more severely with increases in dividends than with increases in wages and salaries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to a dividends equalisation tax, as to why it would not operate effectively or equitably, let me give an example or two.  Take the simple case of a dividends equalisation tax based on the performance of some index of dividends compared to some index of wages and salaries &mdash; the NIEC Report No. 11 was concerned with something different and much more complicated, namely, the question of aggregating post-tax purchasing power derived from investment.  The rate of tax in that case could be fixed only after the out-turn for the year was known.  Even that <Col N="2052" /> would be a short time in which to allow for temporary fluctuations, and so on, and therefore the tax would have to be applied retrospectively.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, if the rate were applied at the same rate to everybody &mdash; with the intention of siphoning-off a certain amount of dividend in the aggregate &mdash; obviously there would be a considerable inequity in the incidence of the tax among individuals.  Dividends vary considerably from company to company, depending on efficiency, capital employed, degree of competition or lack of it and the extent of the risk involved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The persons getting a low rate of dividend would be proportionately hardest hit, taking it on a flat rate, on the example I have taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>It would depend on the comparable prices of the cost of living index&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Taking the simple assumption, and applying it with an index showing dividends on the one hand and incomes and salaries on the other hand, when one goes above the other you apply the tax.  The next assumption is that you apply the tax at the same rate to everyone: this is the assumption I am dealing with at the moment.  In such a case, the persons getting a low rate of dividend would be, proportionally, hardest hit while those getting very big dividends would not be very much affected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood the Minister to say that the low rate of dividend would not reach the taxable ceiling at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not saying that. If, on the other hand, it was decided to fix a norm for dividends corresponding to an increase in the wages and salary index, and to tax, say, at the rate of 20s in the £, anything above that norm would be penal and inequitable and would lead to a misallocation of capital, to say the least.  It would <Col N="2053" /> ultimately necessitate setting different norms to take account of differences between individual companies and industries. Apart from the considerable administrative difficulties, it would also involve a degree of interference by the Government in the affairs and decisions of companies that I think certainly most members of the Fine Gael Party would view with some misgiving.</P>
      <P>I do not suppose I need spell out certain other difficulties arising from the fact that a substantial amount of investment income accrues here from abroad and the operation of the tax on that would present enormous difficulties. Therefore, the panacea on which Deputy FitzGerald seems to rely so much is not a panacea at all.  Even if we could overcome the difficulties I have mentioned and had had it in operation, I would repeat that in all those years it would have operated in only one year.  Clearly, therefore, this is not the answer to an incomes policy.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cruise-O'Brien has unfortunately left the House but since I have started to make the point perhaps I should continue to make it. At column 621, volume 249 of the Official Report, Deputy Cruise-O'Brien is reported as saying:</P>
      <P>The Minister in whom we are asked to have confidence is the man who announced a policy with a blast of trumpets, then qualified it and then finally scrapped it, all in the space of a fortnight.</P>
      <P>I have a question for Deputy Cruise-O'Brien and a number of other Deputies who made similar allegations.  If that is true, if the policy was scrapped, why on earth have they been wasting the time of this House?  If there is no policy what are they opposing?  What have they been talking about at such length?  Let us not fool ourselves. Either there is a policy which they are opposing, or there is not.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is an interesting point.  It is interesting that Deputy O'Donovan should raise that because one thing which I found of great interest in this debate was what emerged from certain contributions from some Members of the Labour Party.  Deputy Keating &mdash; and I think Deputy O'Connell tonight more or less took the same line &mdash; said that if the controls on prices and other incomes were satisfactory he would certainly support it.  Indeed, I understood Deputy Keating to say the Labour Party would actively support a policy which would also be a restraint on incomes.  I think Deputy Keating was being very honest when he said that.  At the time he said it, I asked him did he realise that there were some of his colleagues who might not feel very happy about this because it seemed to involve an interference with the rights of trade unions about which we were hearing a great deal from the Labour benches.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>

When I drew his attention to the fact that some of his colleagues might be somewhat unhappy about this, as I say, interference with the rights of trade unions about which some of them had been speaking at great length and with considerable vehemence, he indicated that in the kind <Col N="2055" /> of society which he visualised there would be no problem with trade unions, that they would go along with this.

      <P>In the course of his contribution, Deputy Desmond suggested that, in Britain, Mrs. Barbara Castle and Mr. Harold Wilson had &mdash; I think he said &mdash; at least more subtlety and more sensitivity than the Government here in introducing this type of legislation.  He referred specifically to the Prices and Incomes Act, 1968, in Britain.  He conveniently ignored the more restrictive 1966 and 1967 Acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must confess I was somewhat taken <Col N="2059" /> aback by Deputy Desmond's choice of comparison.  He must know that what we are proposing in this legislation here is far less drastic than what was introduced in Britain.  In Britain there was an absolute freeze on pay from July, 1966, to December, 1966, including a freeze on agreements which had been made but not implemented.  This was followed by periods of severe restraint and moderate restraint up to April, 1968, during which time there was a nil norm.  The only increases which were allowed were exceptions to that norm.  Then a ceiling of 3½ per cent was introduced from May, 1968.  It is true that, following strong representations from the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, our Bill here contains at the moment no indication of the authorised maximum amount which may be conceded by employers without committing an offence, but the plain fact is that on 16th October last I made it clear that the figure the Government had in mind was 6 per cent or 24s a week, if that were greater, subject to an overall maximum of 36s a week.  In other words, the Government here were prepared to agree to nearly twice the most favourable norm allowed at any stage in Britain.</P>
    <P>In these circumstances, it is a little odd to find that the British practice is quoted as an argument against us and indeed we are told of their sensitivity and subtlety in dealing with it and our &ldquo;bull in a china shop&rdquo; approach.  The distance we were prepared to go in the generality of cases means that there is little scope for providing for special cases, although even here the figures that I announced on the 16th October obviously favoured the lower paid workers.  Furthermore, under this Bill it is possible to deal with certain cases where there were firm commitments or, subject to scrutiny by an independent body with cases where claims had been made before 16th October, 1970, for increases based on comparison with employees doing similar or analogous work.  Deputy Desmond's supercilious approaoh seems to have little basis in fact.</P>
    <P>Several Deputies, including Deputy Dr. O'Donovan, urged a cut in Government expenditure.  I shall not include <Col N="2060" /> Deputy Dr. O'Donovan in what I have to say next &mdash; it might not be fair on him &mdash; but as regards other Deputies it is fair to say that it was a very unusual role for them as I am being constantly pressed to improve existing services and to introduce new services. I mentioned in the recent Supplementary Budget Statement that we have instructed all Departments and agencies that economies must be achieved even at the expense of dislocation and possible suspension of some services.  However I should emphasise that pay is the biggest single item in current Government spending and restraint in incomes increases, apart from its beneficial effects on the economy generally, has a very important effect on expenditure by the State.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies referred to the increases in fares charged by CIE and in Post Office charges. They seemed to suggest that it was dishonest of the Government to have allowed these before the restraints were announced on 16th October. I notice that none of the Deputies who made this charge made the slightest suggestion as to how the Government should have dealt with this problem. There were other ways of dealing with it, I agree.  I suppose we could have borrowed the money even to pay the current amount.  This, I think, would be something which would not commend itself to any Deputy.  We could have refused to pay the amounts of the pay increases or we could, I suppose, have sacked sufficient employees to save the money.  None of these is a practical alternative.  The only other course open would have been to increase taxation still further to make up these deficits.  I would remind the House that, in the case of CIE, apart from the annual subvention provision had to be made in the Supplementary Budget for a further very substantial sum in addition to the fare increases imposed.  This reflects clearly what all this problem is about. These two concerns are extremely labour intensive and therefore inflationary wage settlements affect them much more than a number of other concerns.</P>
    <P>In exchanges which took place earlier this evenng between Deputy Dr. <Col N="2061" /> O'Connell and myself in regard to his allegation that restraint was being exercised under this Bill on workers only, I mentioned that we were also getting at some employers.  This was when we were talking about people operating on a selfish basis.  I do not know if it is generally realised but, if it is not, it is time it was realised that there are some employers whose position is that the wage content of what they have to pay out is relatively so small &mdash; it may be, say, 10 per cent &mdash; that, if the worst comes to the worst, there is no limit on the amount of increase they will pay rather than have a strike.  This is a fact, and these people are just as dangerous in the context of inflation as the most exorbitant demand of the most militant union.  In my view, each of them presents the same kind of threat to our economy and to the lower paid worker.  It was in that context I made the statement that Deputy Dr. O'Connell was quoting.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>On the other hand, the most important job to be done by this Bill is to apply its provisions effectively. As the Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Lemass, said, it is no use having this kind of Bill unless it has teeth.  Deputies will see at a glance that this is a fairly complex and technical Bill.  They will also remember that it had to be produced at considerable speed.</P>

      <P>Deputy Desmond claimed that wages in most firms form only a small part of the total cost.  As I mentioned earlier this is true of a small number of firms but it ignores the wage element and other costs such as bought-in materials.  For the economy as a whole, the NIEC have pointed out that, for every 1 per cent rise in total money incomes which is not matched by a similar increase in real output, the price level rises by 0.6 per cent. That fact, which is a stated economic fact put forward by the NIEC, illustrates the fundamental difficulty we are in.  It illustrates also the fundamental reason for this Bill.  So many Opposition speakers have avoided that issue that I must comment on it.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs whether the Government accept Resolution No. 451 in reply to the memorandum from the Secretary General of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) which was adopted by the Consultative Assembly of the Council of Europe on 18th September, 1970, relating to laying down social priorities as part of the framework within which economic policy should <Col N="1946" /> be determined; and whether they are prepared to instruct their representative to OECD to comply with the proposals set out in paragraph 10 of this resolution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for External Affairs (Dr. Hillery)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government recognises and explicitly stated in the Third Programme that economic growth is not an end in itself, its ultimate objective being an increase in individual and national well-being.  It follows from this that social aims must provide the ultimate framework for economic policies and Resolution No. 451 is acceptable to the Government as far as this is concerned. As regards laying down social priorities, the Government will welcome any help that the OECD may be able to provide in this connection, and will be glad to participate in any discussions with this in mind.  It must be clear, however, that social needs here must be the main determinant of our social priorities and our approach to any initiative by the OECD in this area must be governed accordingly.</P>
      <P>The Government is already represented on the Economic Policy Committee of OECD which has been considering the problem of inflation and the possible measures&mdash;including incomes policy&mdash;to combat it.</P>
