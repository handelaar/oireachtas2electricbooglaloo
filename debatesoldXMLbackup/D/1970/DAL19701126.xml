      <P>Last week I was dealing with drainage matters in general and I should like to start this morning again on drainage. I have some special remarks to make with regard to the Boyne.  I should like to deal first with drainage maintenance. It is settled policy that maintenance be a charge on the county councils in proportion to the drainage benefit.  This was the recommendation of the Drainage Commission which sat from 1938 to 1940 and went into the whole question of drainage.  None of the capital cost of drainage is a charge on the county councils or local people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Luke Belton raised the matter of the drainage of the Tolka.  The Tolka is No. 27 on the list of minor <Col N="2239" /> schemes.  We are now dealing with No. 10 so I am afraid it will be some considerable time before we reach the Tolka.  Deputy Henry Kenny and Deputy Mrs. Hogan O'Higgins referred to the compensation scheme for interference with farmers' lands by the carrying out of work and referred to, the statutory provision that a claim must be made within 12 months of the damage occurring.  That clause was in the Act which was passed by this House in 1945.  It is not aimed at taking any advantage of the farmers affected.  We must remember that large schemes can take up to ten years to carry out and if there were claims for damage coming in long afterwards it would be very hard to establish what the pre-drainage conditions were. When the conditions improve as a result of the drainage scheme the farmer naturally enough is sometimes inclined to forget how bad the land was before the scheme was carried out and it would be quite impossible to have such detailed records as would enable the claims to be dealt with adequately.  The commissioners' engineers and foremen have standing instructions to notify each farmer verbally before his land is entered upon for work and at the same time to advise him of the requirement that any claim for compensation should be made within a year.  I have been assured that this is done and I believe it is widely known by the farmers themselves.  All the same cases do come up where claims come in late and while the claimant's attention is quite properly drawn to the statutory provision it is the commissioners' policy, where they are satisfied that a claim is genuine and real loss has been suffered, not to shelter behind the statute but to deal with the claim on its merits.</P>
    <P>As regards compensation claims generally it is no harm to point out that the drainage works are done primarily for the benefit of farmers, to improve their land.  Because of the dumping of spoil and so on some interference is unavoidable.  It is not possible to make an omelette without breaking eggs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>But it is not necessary <Col N="2240" /> to pile up the shells on the diningroom table.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal with spoil under the heading of the Boyne since that river is of special scenic interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>What about the Nanny?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>We have dealt with one; the other one will be dealt with later.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. J. Lenehan Mr. J. Lenehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lenehan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There was a time when land occupiers were more appreciative of the work being done for them and when compensation claims were few and far between.  However, in recent years there has been a big increase in the number of claims.  Deputy Kenny seemed to think that the amount of compensation paid was not adequate and that farmers generally were dissatisfied. I do not think that is the case at all.  Naturally, farmers bargain very hard but the commissioners have skilled and experienced valuers who consider each case fully and usually negotiate a settlement.  There is provision in the Act for arbitration in cases where agreement is not reached but the cases that go to arbitration are very few.  That in itself is evidence that compensation cases are dealt with very clearly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnLOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I know a case in which compensation has been pending for the past ten years.  The person concerned is an old man who fought at Kilmichael.  It is a pity that the Parliamentary Secretary would not be so gracious as to pay this man after this length of time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot deal with this individual case now but I believe the matter is having attention. The Deputy has been in touch with me already in relation to this case.  Deputy O'Donovan spoke about heavy expenditure in the 1950s and 60s on the purchase of drainage machinery.  He could not understand why money was required for this purpose now because he seemed to think we should be equipped fully.  Of course, machinery, like everything else, wears <Col N="2241" /> out.  A car bought in the early 1950s would not be of much use today.</P>
      <P>Deputy T.J. Fitzpatrick of Cavan was concerned about the Woodford river.  This river forms mostly the Ballyconnell canal.  It is a tributary of the Erne but it is outside the present proposed scheme because of Border complications.  The Woodford river has not been surveyed.  If a drainage scheme should be undertaken eventually it is quite possible that this would have to be done at the expense of navigation on the canal.  Some rivers are more valuable for navigation purposes and as tourist amenities than are others. There is the question as to whether this river should be developed for navigation or for drainage.</P>
      <P>The same Deputy asked me about the weir at Finea.  This weir was constructed at the behest of the Fisheries Division of the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries.  It is necessary in drainage operations to have regard to their requirements.  The purpose of the weir is to prevent the passage of coarse fish from Lough Kinale to Lough Sheelin where, as is known, there has been a very big investment, in developing game fish angling and where also, for this purpose, the lake must be kept at an adequate level during dry periods.  Proposals are under consideration to facilitate the passage of boats around the weir and it is hoped that the matter can be settled agreeably.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Treacy on the importance of the Suir drainage.  I might add that this is the largest such investigation yet undertaken.  It is going ahead as quickly as possible but it is not correct to say that a promise was given to begin drainage in 1971.  All going well, it might be possible to formulate a scheme by 1972.  As the Deputy will recall from a deputation, however, even this cannot be a firm commitment as there is still a lot of work to be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Kenny was concerned about the difficulty of boating between Lough Cullen and Lough Conn because of rocks.  I am told that these are bedrocks which it would be impracticable to remove.  They are not <Col N="2242" /> rocks left after blasting.  Marking of the shoals could be of help and this is being considered.</P>
    <P>I have dealt already in a general way with the maintenance work on the rivers Glyde and Dee.  The workers there will be maintained in employment until Christmas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Until after Christmas perhaps?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The last pay day will be the day after Christmas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>And the number of holidays around that period?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Deputy Tully was concerned particularly about interference with water supplies where drainage operations are carried out. Water supplies such as those for domestic use and deriving from rivers are always either restored or paid for after drainage works have been carried out.  The same applies to drinking slips for cattle.  There are legal difficulties about accepting liability for certain types of spring wells.  We dealt with this matter at Question Time last week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Parliamentary Secretary say whether it would be possible to make even an <i>ex gratia</i> payment to those people?  He will agree that if a group spend several thousand pounds on a water system it is hard luck if the Board of Works can take it away from them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as the Boyne is concerned only one has been turned down and the others are under investigation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Have any been approved?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Not so far.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>One has been turned down and the others are under consideration, so nothing has been given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a difficulty about underground rivers but in so far as it is possible to meet any claim that can be reasonably justified, it is my intention to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I will accept that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to deal now with the Boyne.  This is one of the more recent and the biggest schemes in operation at the moment.  Deputy Tully was concerned about wild life and suggested that the estuary should be turned into a wild life reserve.  There has been no definite proposal for a wild life sanctuary in the Boyne area but we are co-operating with An Taisee in regard to local amenity walks and other facilities that might be made available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Lands said several months ago that the matter was under consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department of Lands, who deal with wild life, have not made any representations to us so far.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps they will as a result of these remarks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope so.  I will deal later with parks and conservation generally.  We hope to link up the Boyne Valley with the lakes of Leitrim and the caves in Cavan as a tourist amenity area.  Perhaps the local authorities might take a close look at the Local Government Act by which they can declare an area to be a special amenity area.  I do not think any local authority, not even the authority in Kerry, have declared any area to be a special amenity area.  Perhaps this is because of the possible risks of not knowing in advance what would be the expenditure involved.  It is my opinion that the entire Killarney area, for instance, should be declared a special amenity area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I will communicate with the Deputy about this.  Several people referred to spoil, for instance, in Foxford.  The Parks and Monuments Section are in discussion with Bord Fáilte to see if we might do something such as putting top soil over some of this rock spoil and, if you like, camouflaging it or making river walks out of it.  In the Boyne Valley the Commissioners are very much aware of the difficulties which can arise from the deposit of spoil on the river banks.  Unfortunately spoil is unavoidable in drainage work.  Normally it is deposited as tidily as possible and where possible the wishes of the landowner are consulted as, for instance, whether he would prefer a narrow high heap or a wide low one.  If the material is suitable, the spoil banks are seeded and in a very short time blend with the adjoining land and we have growth on them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>There is some spoil which will not grow anything and the Parliamentary Secretary must know this.  The Boyne Valley will not cause any trouble because it is simply cleaning up obstructions in the river, all of which will be turned into good land. The soil which most of us have been talking about is called by various names, the sort of stuff they dig out of rocks, grout and other material which will not grow anything and which is an eyesore.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is quite right.  We have different problems with different rivers and different drainage schemes.  The Parks and Monuments Branch are in consultation with Bord Fáilte now to see if between them they can make a way to at least camouflage this spoil so that it will blend in with the ordinary scenic conditions of the area generally.  The scenic areas and where this spoil is near groups of dwellings worry us mostly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The greatest difficulty arises when the spoil consists of rock.  Sometimes it can be disposed of to builders and also to local authorities for the making <Col N="2246" /> of foundations for roads or houses or for the filling in of old quarries. Unfortunately I am afraid the supply of rock spoil exceeds the demand. Arterial drainage work is costly and I am advised it would become an uneconomic proposition, and might even be phased out, if it became an obligation on the Commissioners of Public Works to take away all those spoil heaps.  I believe it would make the whole question of drainage completely uneconomic.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Local authorities take it for filling in quarries and for foundations for new houses and builders take it for foundations for new houses.  On the Moy where we had a great deal of rock I am afraid we left a lot of it around some of the scenic parks of the countryside and we cannot get anybody to take it away.</P>

      <P>Indeed about 100 tons of it was left in the garden of a man with one acre and the fellows with 500 or 600 acres each side of him got none of it at all.  This is the sort of thing which makes bad feeling.</P>

      <P>The point is that it is not our purpose to leave the country unsightly with spoil heaps.  We will keep the matter under review to do as much as we reasonably can to clear those spoil heaps away.  In the case of the Boyne, instructions have been given to pay particular attention to the question of spoil along the scenic sections of the river.  It is not correct that we excluded the scenic and historic sections of the river and compensated the owners.  Fortunately, along the main river below Navan relatively little excavation will be necessary and special steps will be taken to keep to a minimum interference with the scenic amenities of the area.</P>

      <P>I am grateful to Deputy Tully for raising this matter of wild life, birds and so on, because this is a matter which I definitely will have considered now.  We considered fisheries and before any work began the Drogheda conservators of fisheries submitted detailed proposals for the treatment of the Boyne during the drainage work. The Board of Works engineers considered those proposals and, in consultation with the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries experts, worked out a timetable for the entire scheme, carefully phased to minimise the disturbance of fishing and of spawning areas.  This provided that at any time during the course of the drainage works a very high proportion of the spawning and fishing areas would be free from interference.  The timetable was explained to the board of conservators at a meeting in Drogheda in January, 1969, attended also by the Department's fishery engineer.  The programme was broadly acceptable.  It was promised at this meeting that the position would be reviewed each spring when the programme for the coming season, as it would affect fishing matters, could be discussed in greater detail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the programme for the 1970 season was being prepared it was found necessary to modify the original programme somewhat, advancing the date of some operations.  In April, 1970, before this modification programme was put into effect, a meeting took place, as promised, between the resident engineer and the chairman of the board of conservators when the proposed changes in the programme were discussed in detail among many other matters.  The chairman raised no objections <Col N="2248" /> to the changes and no other changes have been made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I have not got a note on net fishing.  I have been looking at the Boyne as an amenity area.  I think it is somewhat different from other schemes which we have because it has got some very important scenic and historic areas which I think have to be protected even though we must try and give the maximum benefit to the farmers around the area from the drainage programme.  I did not even take into consideration, much to my own surprise, the question of wild life in the area but that matter will certainly be examined now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies Bruton, Tully and others raised the question of doing large scale arterial drainage works by contract.  This has been thought of more than once by my predecessor and myself. There is no commercial construction firm in this country with the equipment and experience which would be necessary for the satisfactory execution of works of the magnitude of the drainage work&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not suggest that the arterial drainage work should be done by contract.  I suggested that more of the contractors should be used on small schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Bruton, I think, made this suggestion, and Deputy Tully was associated with it in a lesser way, if I may put it that way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="2249" />
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in favour of direct labour all the time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>If the works were to be thrown open to contractors it is very likely that a foreign firm would be successful.  The initial investment which would be necessary for the purchase of equipment and machinery would be so great that, in effect, the firm successful in the first contract would secure for themselves a monopoly in competing, for the future contracts of the Office of Public Works.  The Office of Public Works have their own machinery, and the total expenditure on the purchase of machinery is something more than £2 million.  There is no evidence that works could be done more expeditiously or satisfactorily by contract than by direct labour.  Contract work was tried on some of the smaller schemes a few years ago and in so far as any definite conclusions can be drawn the experience suggests that there was no advantage in the contract work.  A considerable proportion of the marine construction work, however, is done by contract; such places as Skerries and Kilmore Quay have been done by local contract.</P>
      <P>Deputy Bruton, Deputy Coogan, as well as Deputy Tully, were concerned about the contractors in the Boyne Valley area.  While inspecting major arterial drainage works throughout the country I was struck by the number of farms where field drainage schemes have been carried out with land project assistance.  It was also obvious, unfortunately, that a number of farmers had not taken any such action, and this is disappointing.  We cannot be happy that the full benefits of arterial drainage schemes are being obtained until all farmers have carried out suitable follow-up works.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The scheme must be done first.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government are playing their part under the land project by means of well-designed field drainage schemes and a generous grant-in-aid, and the objective must be a 100 per cent follow-up by farmers whose land needs drainage as soon as arterial drainage provides the necessary <Col N="2250" /> outlets.  To sum up, our experience has been that each time we do a major arterial drainage work there is follow-up work for the contractors under the land project.  It may be that some farmers, in the hope of having their stream drained as an adjunct to the main scheme, are hanging back and that contractors in the Boyne area are at a loss at this time, but ultimately there will be more business available to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>But they will not be able to live for six years.  They had been doing land drainage but it stopped because of the Boyne.  All I was saying was that something might be done to carry them over.  It is not an easy task, but it could be considered; otherwise they will not be there when the job is finished.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I think this is a matter between the farmers and the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries to be followed up under the land drainage project.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It will take about two. Deputy Bruton asked that the Greetagh Bog be drained under the Boyne scheme.  The scheme will provide an outfall to permit full development of the bog and of the townland of Greetagh. The matter of coast erosion was of special interest to Deputy Paddy Burke and to several other Deputies. At first I considered the allocation made under this heading to be generous. I agree it has taken some considerable time to get the Coast Protection Act of 1963 off the ground, but Murrough, Wicklow, is being done at a cost of £30,000 and 700 metres of the north Wicklow harbour are being protected generally by a slope of rock. Work on the front strand in Youghal, County Cork, is also under way, and the eastern half of the 700 metre long promenade is being protected by a stepped sea wall.  This is expected to improve the beach facilities here as well, and the cost involved is £80,000. The Moville, County Donegal, scheme has been exhibited, and the cost here is £18,000.  I hope we shall be able to seek sanction to proceed with this work in the next financial year.  This <Col N="2251" /> is a rock slope which will protect the football field, River Row and the Ark. The Strandhill, County Sligo, scheme which has been prepared under the Coast Protection Act, 1963, is on exhibition at the County Secretary's Office, Courthouse, Teeling Street, Sligo.  It comprises a rock slope protection in front of the car park, bathhouse, house property and adjacent land.  Allowing for procedures under the Act, we can expect work to start next autumn.  The Rossnowlagh, County Donegal, scheme which will be done at a cost of £17,000 is also on exhibition by the local authority, and this is a rock slope protection in front of a hotel and adjacent houses.</P>
      <P>In all 52 proposals have been received and, taking into account the projected spending over the next few years and the availability of qualified staff, it will take many years before all these proposals can be reached.  It is clear to me that this problem is of much greater magnitude than was at first envisaged, and even to acquire an organisation large enough to deal with the problem at a faster rate would take time.  I have asked the responsible officials in the Office of Public Works to re-examine this entire matter and I hope I shall be in a position to make a report to the Minister for Finance with a view to having a submission made to the Government which will enable the commissioners to deal with this very serious problem faster than it has been possible to do so in the recent past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The following preliminary surveys have been carried out: Waterville, County Kerry; Ballygannon, Skerries and Garrettstown.  These are schemes on which it is hoped some progress will be made in the next financial year, but it is not possible to set a date for dealing with these.  I should like to make it very clear that, even if the Government and the Minister for Finance make additional funds available to us, that is not the entire solution to the problem. This requires very special technical qualifications for the engineers, and the recruitment of a greater staff than we have at the moment <Col N="2252" /> might present major difficulties.  However, so far as I am concerned, all of these 52 proposals before me could reasonably be described as urgent, and I would prefer if the Government would deal with the matter as quickly as possible and perhaps reduce their spending at a later stage.  The Department of Finance stipulated when the Bill was going through that each scheme should be examined critically from an economic, amenity, tourist, and regional planning viewpoint as well as from the overall financial viewpoint.</P>
    <P>With regard to fishery harbour development I am very sad that Deputy P. O'Donnell is no longer with us.  He was constantly talking about the development of Burtonport.</P>

      <P>A survey of Burtonport has been completed and we are now preparing up-to-date estimates for the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries.  When they are approved we must obtain the sanction of the Department of Finance after which it will be necessary to prepare drawings and specifications and obtain county council approval.  Work can commence when lodgment of the county council's contribution, which is to be 25 per cent, is made.  I expect this work to commence in the summer of 1971.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelBegley" hpid="Mr. Begley Mr. Begley">

    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The county council have agreed to pay this as a result of discussions.  In fact, that agreement was made as far back as March, 1969.  We have already spent £95,700 on preliminary work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I was in Burtonport some months ago I had the pleasure of boarding the <i>Asgard</i>.  I should like to thank Deputy Browne for the remarks he made about this historic vessel. The Government are glad to be associated with her preservation and intend to continue to vote a grant for her upkeep.  I should like to offer my heartful thanks to the committee who <Col N="2253" /> have put her to such a full and useful occupation.</P>
    <P>Deputies Hogan, Coughlan and Desmond referred to other marine works.  I shall deal first with Dún Laoghaire.  As a result of the continued exhortations of Deputy Andrews, nearly all the requirements of the fishermen have been provided or are in course of being provided at Dún Laoghaire.  I am glad his confidence has not been misplaced as is shown by increased landings.  The flashing beacon at the end of Coal Quay is in full working order.  Some minor repairs are necessary to the surface of Coal Quay and these will be carried out shortly.  The customs buildings, fence and checkpoint of the temporary car ferry terminal have been removed.</P>
    <P>The future of the stern dolphins, approach bridge and the bailey bridge, the syncrolift and link-span is to be the subject of further discussions with the Department of Transport and Power.  When Deputy Childers was Minister for Transport and Power he gave an undertaking to this House about the East Pier at Dún Laoghaire and, as far as I am concerned, I am anxious to see those undertakings fulfilled. It has been suggested that part of the additions to the East Pier might be of amenity benefit to the area and this is the subject of discussion between the Department of Transport and Power, Bord Fáilte and my Department. I expect a decision to be made early next year and I hope by April some of these things will have been removed.  Toilet facilities are being provided for the fishermen.</P>
    <P>Rossaveel pier in Connemara has been mentioned in the course of this debate.  I received a deputation, which included the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy Geoghegan, who has continuously pressed me on this matter.  It is a big scheme and preliminary boring, surveying and presentation of documents inevitably take time.  Work is proceeding on the design but I understand the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries was down there recently and has under consideration a request for <Col N="2254" /> a 40 feet extension to the original proposal. Unless the proposed extension causes delay work should commence in the next financial year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I dealt with Shannon last week.  Deputy O'Sullivan wants to know why our workers are paid less than county council workers.  I presume the Deputy is referring to minor marine workers.  They are paid the same rate as county council workers in the area.  If the Deputy is referring to major marine works such as Castletownbere, workers are paid a higher rate than county council workers.  The Office of Public Works have a national rate for drainage workers; the county council rate varies.  In fact, our rate is higher than the lowest county council rate and lower than the highest, but approximately two-thirds of our drainage workers get incentive bonuses in addition to the flat rate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I wondered if Deputy O'Sullivan was anxious to have the rate of pay of Office of Public Works workers reduced to the level of county council workers, but I doubt if that was his aim.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputies are aware, a survey of small harbours on the western coast is being carried out.  The survey team are at present operating in County Cork. The survey team were set up by the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries <Col N="2255" /> in March, 1970 to investigate and report on fishing ports and landing places on the western seaboard.  The team consists of representatives from the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries, Roinn na Gaeltachta, the Office of Public Works, Cork County Council, Bord Iascaigh Mhara and Bord Fáilte.  Some inspections have been made, and it is expected a report will be ready in December, 1970.  It will be submitted with recommendations to the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton wanted to know exactly what was done under the heading of Economic Development Works included in the Estimate.  These would generally include other fishery harbour schemes including Kilmore Quay, County Wexford; Skerries, County Dublin; Killala, County Mayo; Darby's Point, County Mayo; Reen, County Cork, and a score of smaller projects. Works at Dingle, County Kerry will start as soon as some legal difficulties have been resolved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

      <P>I have not the actual figures but it was in the newspapers last night.  Preliminary boring surveys have been completed at Burtonport, which I have already referred to and Rossaveel, County Galway.  It is hoped to commence work at those centres next year and a number of others in the west coast counties including Moville and Tory Island, County Donegal; Portahaulia, County Mayo; Cleggan, Emlaghmore and Roundstone, County Galway and Cahirciveen, County Kerry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to deal with national monuments and some of the questions raised about them.  I realise that it is most important to step up the guide service, but certain skills in the provision of such services are essential. To provide a poor booklet, for example, would only lead to more complaints than if there were none at all. If the archaeological staff recently recruited have an aptitude for this work then the issue of booklets will be extended.  I think Deputies will find <Col N="2256" /> the recent booklet issued on Derrynane Abbey most satisfactory.  I think we now have the technical ability to bring out a book of this quality not only for that monument but for other monuments as well.  At the moment we are preparing a similar quality booklet on Dublin Castle; in the meantime we have issued a small hand-out for the tourist season in relation to the castle.</P>
    <P>Deputy Seán Moore was concerned about the provision of more toilets at national monuments.  A number of these monuments have been selected in consultation with Bord Fáilte and the National Monuments Advisory Council and these will get priority in the provision of amenities, including toilets. So far 20 such monuments are to receive attention.</P>
    <P>Deputy O.J. Flanagan referred to Clonmacnoise.  Many tributes have been paid to the work carried out there.  We have had discussions with Bord Fáilte and the county council with a view to the proper preservation of Clonmacnoise.  It is included as one of the 20 major national monuments selected by us in consultation with Bord Fáilte and the National Monuments Advisory Council for treatment. Not only does it merit distinction but we will maintain and develop it so that all our people can visit it with greater pride.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully raised the question of Tara.  The acquisition of the land is a matter which is <i>sub judice</i> and consequently I cannot comment beyond saying that the price will be settled by arbitration.  It is not a question of offering to pay enough and I doubt if it will cost as much as the £50,000 Deputy Bruton seemed to imply.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully also referred to the need for a café at Newgrange.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Parliamentary Secretary make some effort to try to have this place properly marked again &mdash; it used to be at one time &mdash; so that visitors can see where the various halls were?  There is a pretty bad statue of St. Patrick and it should, I think, be replaced by a decent one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as I recollect, the marking was carried out by moneys <Col N="2257" /> provided by Bord Fáilte.  I think the Deputy and I will be at one in saying that the thing to do is for the State to acquire the monument.  We can then proceed to make it presentable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I know.  I have been down there many a time.  As I said, the Deputy also referred to the need for a café at Newgrange and said the Office of Public Works was under an obligation to put a café there in view of the large number of visitors.  There was a meeting early this year between Bord Fáilte, the county council and the National Monuments Advisory Committee and agreement was reached on a suitable site for a restaurant and other tourist amenities.  The site will be a little bit away from the monument, but this is necessary to ensure that any such development will not adversely affect the attraction of this great monument having regard to the ultimate form of presentation proposed for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>When this was agreed two years ago the Office of Public Works was the only body to refuse to allow the café recommended by Bord Fáilte to be erected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It was a question of siting, having regard to the final presentation of the monument.  As the Deputy knows, stones were carried from various parts of the country. A cement foundation has now been put underneath.  It is felt that any building immediately within view of the monument itself would be undesirable and agreement has now been reached on a site a short distance away.  One will not see the two at the same time.</P>

      <P>Deputy Desmond and Deputy O.J. Flanagan referred to the publicising of national monuments.  We joined with Bord Fáilte in publishing a guide book and a new guide book was published recently.  Promotional work is the function of Bord Fáilte in the main.  We have been using our own publication, <i>Oibre,</i> and certain brochures and booklets to publicise national monuments also.  I hope to increase this work in the future.</P>
      <P>Deputy Burke was concerned about St. Patrick's Island off Skerries.  In the light of existing knowledge it does not seem as if there are likely to be archaeological remains there and we cannot, therefore, declare the whole island a national monument.  The church is, of course, a national monument. Perhaps the Deputy could arrange for himself and a few of his friends to do a &ldquo;dig&rdquo; and, if they find some archaeological remains, we will be glad to take the island over.</P>

      <P>Deputy Moore referred to the old walls of Dublin.  We asked Dublin Corporation if they would preserve the old wall brought to light in the excavations at Winetavern Street. They have not yet replied formally but I understand they intend to do so. It will be a feature of the new building and people will be able to go in and inspect it.  A similar job was done in, I think, Cologne.</P>
      <P>When works in progress at Mellifont Abbey are completed in a week or two conservation work will commence on St. John's Castle, Trim.  That will probably be next week or the week after.</P>

      <P>The question was raised of liaison with the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries and the Department of Lands to ensure ancient monuments will not be destroyed.  We have such a liaison.  The problem is more one of identification and getting people to accept the importance of preserving such monuments.  The archaeological survey will be speeded up when all monuments are recorded and graded.  This will help considerably in deciding on a policy of preservation. The commissioners have on their staff a special archaeologist to deal with these matters.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cooney referred to Clontuskert Abbey in Galway.  We took this monument into guardianship in 1964. Later the deed was found to be inoperative because the landowner's title was defective.  It turned out that Galway County Council owned the abbey and the burial ground in which it is situated.  The Office of Public Works are prepared to take the monument into their charge and they are in communication with the county council in regard to the matter.  They are not empowered to undertake any work on monuments that are not in their care.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to explain that the archaeological survey is in two parts: first, the inventory of all monuments and, secondly, a scientific survey of each monument.  We are covering all the monuments in part 1 but we have not been able to make much progress <Col N="2260" /> in part 2 in relation to post-1200 A.D. monuments.  Those are architectural monuments and there is reluctance on the part of architects to accept employment on work that would involve only surveying.  We are reorganising the work in an effort to remedy the situation.</P>
    <P>In relation to public parks, there has been some controversy about the closure of St. Enda's.  While there will be a considerable lapse of time before all the work is carried out, a general tidying-up of the grounds is in progress and we hope to open part of the grounds to the public next summer. This will be confined to part of the grounds for reasons of public safety.</P>
    <P>Deputy Oliver Flanagan inquired about the Garda station at Crinkle, Birr.  I should like to inform the Deputy that the station, apart from two small areas used by the Department of Defence for FCA purposes and the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, has been sold&mdash;following public advertisement.</P>
    <P>Deputy Moore considered that areas around Dublin and Wicklow should be designated as national parks.  We are very interested in this proposal and we have had correspondence with the regional tourist organisation on the subject.  It has been agreed to have discussion with them when we have made more progress in the Kilkenny national park area.  Our organisation in this sphere is new and needs to be built up to handle the large increase in activity in the field of recreational facilities, archaeology and conservation.  We should like to see a national park area in the regions around Dublin and would be happy if the State would acquire certain portions as national parks.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hogan suggested that the Shannon navigation should be the function of Bord Fáilte.  I should like to put it on the record that Bord Fáilte do not own, manage or develop property.  Their function is the promotion of tourist traffic and in this respect they give grants.  The Office of Public Works are a State organisation; their function is to hold, manage and develop property.  This is our function on the navigation of the River Shannon <Col N="2261" /> and I will say more on this subject later.</P>
    <P>The press have made the point that it is not clear which body should be responsible in the matter of conservation. I should like to put on record the division of responsibility in this regard, as I understand it.  First, there is the Department of Lands who are in charge of forestry, general woodlands, wild life and forest parks, and the Minister for Lands inaugurated Conservation Year, 1970, in this country. Next, we have the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries who are responsible for fresh water habitats.  Bord na Móna have responsibility for bogs; Foras Forbartha maintain habitats not covered by Bord Fáilte and Bord na Móna.  An Foras Talúntais have responsibility in relation to heaths, moors, items of geological interest and soil types.  The Office of Public Works are in charge of parks of scenic, historic or recreational value, the River Shannon navigation and the study of artistic, architectural and archaeological monuments.  CIE are responsible for the Grand and Royal Canals, and the Department of Local Government have general responsibility for planning control of amenities <i>et cetera</i> under the Planning Acts.</P>
    <P>There has been a suggestion that all matters relating to conservation should be the responsibility of one body but I suggest this might give rise to even greater problems.  Perhaps there could be some changes for the better but the present areas of responsibility are reasonably clear and I hope I have clarified the matter for those who might have been confused. To me, the Department of Local Government appear the appropriate Department to be concerned with the management of technological problems and with environmental resources in specific fields such as water, air, pesticides, transportation, noise and urban development.  By including pesticides in this list I have in mind water pollution.  Industrial and human waste are turning many of our rivers into open sewers.  Until the Dodder scheme commenced recently, no main sewerage scheme had been undertaken in Dublin since 1909.  In most towns of less than 10,000 inhabitants sewage <Col N="2262" /> is disposed of directly into rivers. There is a major task ahead and it seems to me that the Department of Local Government have the technical staff and expertise best suited to tackle this problem.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, a high level interdepartmental committee has been set up to examine and report on all aspects of water and air pollution, including co-ordination of activities, the adequacy of existing legislation and the need for new legislation.</P>
    <P>The Department of Lands are doing first-class work under the present Minister.  I am pleased to say that whatever differences of opinion have arisen about forest parks and national parks we have resolved at local level. We are setting up joint committees representing each Department at the local level.  I should like to give my interpretation of the difference between national and forest parks.  A forest park is an area acquired for the growing of, and commercial cropping of, timber.  Those areas have, as their secondary purpose, recreational facilities and as such play their part in the preservation of the quality of life.</P>
    <P>National parks are areas acquired by the State for the purpose of preservation and management because of their scenic, historic, scientific, archaeological or recreational importance. Many of those have large wooded areas but the woods are managed for their scenic and scientific value and are not cropped commercially.  It has been laid down internationally that in a national park neither the fauna nor the flora can be cropped for commercial purposes.</P>
    <P>With regard to CIE, the transfer of the Grand Canal to the Office of Public Works as an extension of Shannon navigation is logical.  I hope the Government will introduce legislation before long in order to give effect to this proposal and also to empower CIE to reclaim the Royal Canal, which does not serve a useful purpose as a navigable waterway.  By definition a national monument is man-made. There have not been any new proposals to erect a cable car at Killarney&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>That is what Deputy Hugh Byrne said.  In this instance I am more concerned about the matter of the cable cars in the Bourn Vincent Memorial Park and I should like to state that there are no such proposals before us.  Some very good suggestions were made by Deputy J. O'Leary and these will have to be considered very carefully.  We are aware that there are pockets of land adjacent to the Bourn Vincent Memorial Park and Derrynane which it would be desirable to acquire for public ownership in order to preserve the amenities of these parks.  Let me assure the House that we have development plans in mind for the Bourn Vincent Memorial Park which will involve opening up further scenic routes.  The question of speeding up the archaeological survey is under active consideration.</P>
      <P>Deputy T. O'Donnell raised the matter of a grant-in-aid for An Taisce.  This grant, borne on our vote, is for the purpose of a survey of great gardens, historic houses and provincial museums.  These premises are not in receipt of any other subvention from the State.</P>
      <P>I would like to come now to the Phoenix Park.  I do not know whether the Deputies are aware that the Dublin Golf Club, now the Royal Dublin Golf Club, had an 18-hole course in the Phoenix Park in 1885.</P>

      <P>I was dealing with national parks generally and I come now to deal with the Phoenix Park. I asked were Deputies aware that the Dublin Golf Club, now known as the Royal Dublin Golf Club, had an 18-hole course in the Phoenix Park in 1885.  At that time it was proposed to add a further 27 holes.  It is a fact that the British Army played golf in Phoenix Park at that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Noel Browne referred to the Inchicore North-Longmeadows Estate. <Col N="2264" /> It had been acquired as far back as 1905.  The Deputy seems to be critical of the fact that it has taken up to now to have it developed.  The area was acquired with the object of protecting it against undesirable development which would detract from the Phoenix Park itself.  It has undoubtedly served that purpose.  Is it not a good thing that it is now available for the purpose of development and to provide desirable modern amenities?  With a view to preparing a proper scheme for the development of this area, a firm of landscape architects have been engaged. They have made certain recommendations to my Department.  These are being considered in conjunction with Dublin Corporation and the landscape architects attached to the Office of Public Works with a view to presenting acceptable proposals to the Government.</P>
    <P>In addition to the public golf course which has been mentioned, Deputy Tunney made some reference to a charge.  There is no question of deciding a charge.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Someone mentioned the figure of 10s.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Even the decision to have a golf course has not been arrived at.  It is premature to decide what the charges will be.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Parliamentary Secretary was the one who mentioned the 10s charge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The standard charge at municipal courses in England is between 6s and 10s.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary mentioned 10s.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I did for 18 holes.  If the charge was 10s for 9 holes the Office of Public Works would make a nice little profit.  In addition to the public golf course outdoor recreation will be the dominant or primary purpose of the park.  The scenic merits of the area will not only be preserved but enhanced.  Among the activities which have been suggested for consideration are swimming and aquatic sports, children's pastimes, picnicking, <Col N="2265" /> handball, basketball, bowling, <i>et cetera,</i> and a 9-hole pitch and putt course. Some Deputies referred to the swimming pool.  This matter will be considered, but the cost will be very heavy. The swimming pool may be provided later.  It is not under immediate consideration. It would have to be of international standards and suitable for conversion to other uses.</P>
      <P>With reference to Deputy O.J. Flanagan's views on these proposals I hope that the people of Laois-Offaly will avail of the facilities of the golf course, if and when it is provided.  I hope that it will prove to be the first of many such courses throughout the country.  It will give me great pleasure to invite the Deputy and his friends to avail of this amenity on the first day on which the course is open.  The proposed amenities are not just for the citizens of Dublin.  The area could include an international camping site for the enjoyment of people from overseas.</P>
      <P>Deputy Tunney referred to the arrangements made about the manning of the gates in Phoenix Park.  Arrangements were made this summer to have all entrance gates manned between 7 a.m. and 6 p.m.  It is hoped to consider at a later stage the question of the employment of motor-cycle patrols.  The trade unions, the Department of Finance and the inter-departmental wages advisory council would all be involved in this matter.  The employment of motor-cycle patrols would affect the number of constables and gatekeepers in the Phoenix Park.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Horse riding is accepted as a desirable form of recreation in Phoenix Park.  It has grown considerably in recent years.  The question of exercising control over it has been receiving attention. We have had correspondence with the riding schools but it is becoming evident that an amendment of the bye-laws is necessary to enable proper control to be exercised.  This matter is in hands.  Deputy Eugene Timmons was concerned about the number of cattle grazing in the park.  I am glad to tell him that the number of cattle grazing in the park has been reduced from 900 to about 400 over the past two years. We are phasing out slowly and keeping a close watch on the effects on grass <Col N="2266" /> growth.  If we can phase out economically without a serious overgrowth of grass we will do so.</P>
    <P>Deputy Luke Belton asked if motorists are required to be covered by insurance while driving in the Park. Under the Phoenix Park Act, 1925, the Commissioners are bound to main tain the Park as a public park.  Under the Road Traffic Act, 1961, a public place means, <i>inter alia,</i> a place to which the public have access with vehicles whether as of right or by permission. The Phoenix Park is, therefore, such a public place.  Under section 56 of the said Road Traffic Act a person is forbidden to use in a public place a mechanically propelled vehicle unless, to quote the relevant portion, it is insured. The answer is, therefore, yes.</P>
    <P>The same Deputy asked who would be responsible if a child were hurt in the Phoenix Park by a horse from one of the riding schools.  It is understood that the riding schools display notices disclaiming liability.  In reply, the Phoenix Park is State property and is not vested in the Commissioners. The Phoenix Park Act of 1925 vests in them the control and management of the Park but they exercise it only as servants of the State.  That being the position and, in the present state of the law, the Commissioners would be entitled to plead the State's immunity in tort should any action be brought against them in the circumstances set out.</P>
    <P>It does not necessarily follow that any person would be liable.  Unless there is an absolute liability imposed on a person &mdash; for example, making by statute a motorist liable for an accident even though it is not his fault&mdash; a person is liable only if he is negligent or has assumed liability by agreement. In the case of a child, a greater degree of care towards the child would be required of a horseman than towards an adult.  <i>Prima facie,</i> if a ridden horse injured a person, the rider would be liable if he had been negligent and so caused the injury.  But other people's negligence might have contributed to the accident, for example, the person who had hired out a &ldquo;wicked&rdquo; horse without warning, the person who had negligently <Col N="2267" /> frightened the horse, and so on.  In other words, the ordinary law relating to accidents would obtain.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hugh Byrne raised the question of the condition of pitches in the Park.  I have received no complaints regarding the condition of the pitches. The areas around the goalposts are resurfaced regularly.  The same Deputy also asked about railings broken in the cricket plot.  The railings referred to are those which surround the Civil Service Cricket Club.  Maintenance of the railings is a matter for the club. At the request of the Commissioners, the club have arranged to erect a new railings and I understand this work is now completed.  The Commissioners have instructed the club to have the old railings, part of which are decayed, removed as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>When introducing my Estimate last year, I referred to the feasibility of a blind people's centre in one of the Dublin parks.  This has been investigated and a small centre in St. Stephen's Green Park has since been developed.  It is, I think, located probably not too far from the bandstand but beyond that I am not prepared to say where its location is.  If the centre proves popular with blind people, consideration will be given to providing a similar amenity in Phoenix Park. Before proceeding with this proposal, we obtained the views of the following bodies: the National Council for the Blind of Ireland; the National League of the Blind of Ireland; the Irish Association for the Blind; St. Mary's School for the Blind, Merrion, Dublin and Fr. Spillane, St. Joseph's School for Blind Boys, Drumcondra. A children's playground has been provided in St. Stephen's Green, as well, and it has been so successful that I hope to extend this type of facility to Phoenix Park before long.</P>
    <P>As I announced recently, the contract system for the supply of workmen for the maintenance of State buildings in Dublin came to an end in August.  The system has existed since before the turn of the century.  I should like to put on record my thanks to the firms who have held the contracts from time to time for the service and <Col N="2268" /> the co-operation they have given to the Commissioners.  On transfer, the men are eligible for improved sick leave concessions and improved superannuation benefits.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Will their service with the contractors doing this work count for pension purposes?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  In particular, they are eligible for the pension scheme mentioned by the Taoiseach in the Budget speech.  Approximately 350 men are involved.  I think it was Deputy Keating who was probably the most critical speaker here.  He suggested that the OPW was using old methods and were inefficient.  His implication is completely unjustified. About half a dozen years ago we employed management consultants and, as a result of the reorganisation carried out on their advice, we have a much more efficient service and we have effected a saving in the region of £50,000 a year.  We get an average of 750 requisitions for work each week involving as many as 13 different skills. These works have to be done in a variety of different sequences in about 500 buildings in Dublin.</P>
      <P>In order to demonstrate just how efficient we are, and to do away with the jibes such as those made by Deputy Kenny about the typical OPW job, I have decided to invite all Deputies in the Greater Dublin area and from any other place who wish to come along, to inspect the CEW in Inchicore.  I should like the Deputies to come to see the position for themselves before casting a reflection on the ability of the workers or management within the OPW.  I look forward to meeting them up there in the not too distant future.</P>

Other factors in the overall increase include the erection of a new fishery school at an estimated cost of £80,000, an increase of £50,000 in the Grant-in-Aid to An Bord Iascaigh Mhara for administration and current development, an increase of £25,000 for inland fisheries development and an increase of £20,000 in the Grant-in-Aid to the Inland Fisheries Trust Incorporated. As against those increases, there is a reduction of £63,000 in the Grant-in-Aid to be given to An Bord Iascaigh Mhara for capital development.</P>
      <P>The progress which has been evident in recent years in the development of our fishing industry is steadily continuing and there is a healthy air of optimism now running through the whole industry.  In the year 1969 the value of landings of sea-fish and shellfish was just short of £3 million and exceeded by almost £600,000 the 1968 figure of £2,400,000 which had been an all-time record.  A further assessment of the expansion achieved can be made against the corresponding figures of fish landing for 1960, 1961 and 1962 which were £1.6 million, £1.4 million and £1.5 million respectively.</P>
      <P>Side by side with the growth in landings, there has been a substantial increase in the value of exports of fish of all kinds.  During 1969 a record figure of over £3.5 million in exports was achieved representing an increase of 33 per cent on the previous year's figure and practically trebling the value of fishery exports in 1961.</P>
      <P>For a full assessment of the contribution of fisheries to the national economy, account must also be taken of the income from angling tourism which is estimated to have exceeded £4 million in 1969.  The total external income attributable to our fisheries, therefore, amounted to the sizeable figure of over £7.5 million during 1969.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The quantity of sea-fish, other than shellfish, landed rose from 836,000 cwt. in 1968 to the record figure of <Col N="2271" /> 1,075,000 cwt. in 1969.  The exclusion of shellfish from that figure is because shellfish landings are recorded partly by weight and partly by number.  The total value of landings, including shellfish, rose from £2,153,000 in 1967 by 11 per cent to £2,404,000 in 1968 and by a further 20 per cent to £2,996,000 in 1969.  In 1969 all categories contributed to the increase and it is most gratifying to record that the 1969 herring catch at £784,000 was an all-time record and exceeded by as much as 57 per cent the previous record figure of £499,280 in 1967.  Shellfish also once again contributed substantially to the fishermen's earnings and now account for 30 per cent of the value of our total landings of fish from the sea.  In addition to herrings the particular varieties which contributed most to the gross value of landings in 1969 were lobster, plaice, cod, whiting, Dublin Bay prawns, haddock, crawfish, ray/ skate and periwinkles in that order.</P>
    <P>As to trends in the current calendar year, I am pleased to say that for the first six months the quantity of sea fish, excluding shellfish, landed is over 30,000 cwt. greater than for the corresponding period of 1969 and the increase in value comes to over £140,000. The value of shellfish landings has also increased by over £100,000 in the same period.  If this trend continues, there is no doubt but that we are facing another record year.</P>
    <P>As I have mentioned, the value of our exports of fish in 1969 was over £3.5 million.  Shellfish at £1,261,000 was the best money earner, followed closely by freshwater fish at £1,259,000 and by other sea-fish at £1,038,000.  Of the latter figure herring exports alone accounted for £877,000.  Here also the statistics that are so far available for 1970 are very gratifying.  In the first seven months the value of exports of fish and fishery products at £2,474,000 is £329,600 or 15 per cent in excess of the figure for the corresponding period of 1969.</P>
    <P>While Britain is the best customer for our fishery exports, substantial quantities are exported to the Continent, particularly to France.  Germany and the Netherlands, and this augurs well for the future of the Irish sea-fishing <Col N="2272" /> industry when we become members of the EEC.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies have from time to time expressed their disapproval of the substantial quantities of fish and fishery products which are imported into this country each year.  I feel, however, that the criticism arises in large measure from a lack of appreciation of the full facts.  The imports of fishery products in 1969 were valued at £1,863,000 but tinned salmon, sardines, <i>et cetera</i>, accounted for £863,000 of the total value.  Fish preparations of various kinds accounted for £349,000 and smoked coley and tusk accounted for £185,000.</P>
    <P>It is debatable whether these consumer products are really in competition with the sale of Irish fish: they are a different kind of product which we do not produce ourselves and, if they were not available in the shops, we could not assume that the housewife would purchase fresh or frozen Irish fish instead.  Furthermore, there are stiff customs duties on the import of these products and at a time when the emphasis is so much on freeing of international trade it would be invidious for us to contemplate introducing additional import restrictions on these particular products.  The only imports that could really have a depressing effect on the sale of Irish fish are imports of fresh or frozen fish such as plaice, sole, cod, <i>et cetera,</i> and since 1938 such imports are permitted only under licence.  Licences for limited quantities are given only when home landings are insufficient to meet the market requirements.</P>
    <P>For example, when the vast bulk of our trawler fleet goes herring fishing, thereby leaving a serious shortage of white fish on the home market, the position is created in which a prohibition of imports of controlled quantities could not be justified as otherwise we would be merely depriving the Irish consumer of white fish without any corresponding benefit to our fishing industry.  On the contrary, it could seriously injure the industry because it would be unrealistic to expect that the home demand for white fish could be so <Col N="2273" /> flexible as to exist only when supplies are available: more likely the demand would suffer because of erratic supplies.  The total value of these imports in 1969 was £117,000.  At present the trawler fleet is herring fishing and because of this imports of white fish are permitted.</P>
    <P>This situation of a country being an exporter and importer of fishery products is by no means unique largely because there are so many different varieties of fish and fishery products which are not available from home landings and domestic processing.  All the leading European fish producing countries, with only one exception, are substantial importers as well as exporters of fish.  The one exception is Iceland whose economy is entirely dependent on its fishing industry and whose population &mdash; and therefore its total home consumption of fish &mdash; are, in any event, so small.</P>
    <P>It is the constant aim of my Department to strengthen considerably the facilities that exist for the training of personnel for the fishing industry.  The temporary fishery school which was opened at Moville in April, 1968, is giving good results.  With the assistance of local instructors and the co-operation of the Donegal Vocational Education Committee, two groups of some thirty boys from all parts of the country undergo each year at the school an intensive course of training in which they receive tuition in seamanship, navigation, netmending, cookery, woodwork, metalwork, first aid and general subjects.  These boys subsequently complete their training at sea aboard selected fishing vessels.  The boys are instructed and maintained free of charge while undergoing the course and receive an allowance which, I am glad to say, was increased from £3 to £4 per week with effect as from 1st July, 1970.  In the last five years 176 boys have undergone the Department's course of training as fishermen but, as I have just mentioned, the intake into the course is now greatly intensified.</P>
    <P>Organised training of this nature is, I feel, the only effective way of recruiting suitable personnel for the fishery industry and I am pressing ahead as quickly as possible with the <Col N="2274" /> provision of a permanent fishery school at Greencastle which will have facilities not only for training new recruits but also for the organisation of refresher and higher courses for qualified fishermen and potential skippers.  This new school, for which £80,000 is provided in the Estimates, is being built for the Department by the National Building Agency.  The work of designing the school has been completed and the agency is now to seek building tenders.  All concerned are pressing ahead to have the school completed as speedily as possible and I fully expect it will be in operation during 1971.  The facilities that will be available in the new school will be the best that can be found and I am confident that the school will prove worthy of the industry that it will serve.  As, however, the future of the fishing industry depends more than anything else on the calibre of the men engaged in it, I would like to appeal to our school leaving boys to consider fishing as a career and I would exhort those who would like a fine, manly, adventurous and rewarding way of life to apply to the Fisheries Division of my Department for acceptance under the boys training scheme.</P>
    <P>In addition to the scheme of training of young boys as fishermen, training courses to equip experienced fishermen to attain the standard necessary to qualify as skippers continue to be provided by my Department in co-operation with the Town of Galway Vocational Education Committee.  Further, to cater for suitable applicants who cannot attend these courses, An Bord Iascaigh Mhara organises port courses at which fishermen can study for their Certificates of Competency without having to interrupt their normal fishing activities.  In the last five years 172 fishermen were successful in obtaining Certificates of Competency under the Merchant Shipping Acts following on their participation in courses run by the Department and An Bord Iascaigh Mhara.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are aware, Fish Quality Regulations made by the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries became operative from 1st April, 1968.  I would like to compliment the vast majority of the fishermen and the fish merchants <Col N="2275" /> for their co-operation in implementing these regulations.  They have shown that they realise that proper methods of handling, storage and transport of demersal fish are necessary to maintain highest possible quality and that quality is the keynote in expanding markets at home and abroad.  However, the beneficial effects of their efforts will not be permitted to be negatived by the few people &mdash; and I am glad to say there are only a few&mdash; who do not yet appear to realise the importance of proper handling of fish. To the latter I would give a warning that they have now been given adequate time to adjust to the requirements of the new regulations and the full measure of the law is now being brought to bear on offenders.  These regulations apply to fresh demersal fish whether intended for the home or export markets.  I am at present examining the question of backing up these regulations with quality controls on exports of fish in processed form so that the quality image of our fish abroad&mdash; whether fresh or processed &mdash; will be further enhanced.  The proposed export controls were discussed with exporters some time ago and a further meeting to finalise the matter with them will be arranged shortly.</P>
    <P>Earlier I referred to increased landings of fish.  As the landings continue to grow, additional processing outlets will be essential to ensure that the fishermen will receive a reasonable return for their catch.  I am glad to say that considerable interest is being taken in the promotion of projects for the processing of fish.  Several such projects based mainly on herring, mackerel and shellfish have been approved for State assistance and more are under consideration.  A very satisfactory feature of a number of these proposals is the inclusion of substantial quantities of crabs in the raw material requirements. This is ensuring an increasingly good return to fishermen for a variety of shellfish which up to a year or two ago was not commercially exploited here except in a very small way.</P>
    <P>We have now two fishmeal factories &mdash; one in Killybegs, County Donegal, <Col N="2276" /> and the other in Mornington, County Meath.  The Killybegs factory has been in operation for many years and has proved its worth in the progress of the local fishing industry.  The Mornington factory has been in operation only for little over a year and I would urge the fishermen on the east coast to ensure that the factory, which could be of such tremendous benefit to them, is kept adequately supplied with industrial fish.  In particular, it provides a ready outlet for species such as sprats and sand eels for which the demand otherwise has been almost nonexistent. Investment by both private enterprise and the State in the various fish processing factories is an indication of confidence in an expanding industry and an assurance for fishermen that they can dispose of increased landings without difficulty.</P>
    <P>An essential feature of the development programme which has been undertaken for the expansion of our fishing industry is the scientific work that has constantly to be carried out. Even with the fisheries that appear to come along each year as a matter of course, such as the herring fishery in the winter months, the cod fishery in the spring, the salmon fishery in the summer, thorough investigations into the stocks and the extent of recruitment are necessary to ensure that overfishing, which could wipe out a fishery, is not taking place.  As we aim to expand our fisheries then we must also engage in exploratory fishing to locate new fishing grounds.  Also, in regard to the varieties that lend themselves to fish farming, such as oysters and mussels, the scientific officers must endeavour to assist nature in obtaining greater reproduction and protection of the stocks so that increasing yields can be obtained from them.  In this work our fishery scientists have at their disposal the two fishery research vessels &ldquo;Cú Feasa&rdquo; and &ldquo;Cú na Mara&rdquo;.  A modern fisheries research station and laboratory is planned to replace the existing more modest facilities so that scientific material obtained from the cruises of these vessels can be fully processed and assessed.</P>
    <P>The grant-in-aid to An Bord Iascaigh Mhara for 1970-71 for administration <Col N="2277" /> and current development amounts to £400,000 and the grant-in-aid for capital development amounts to £300,000.  The total of £700,000 is approximately at the level of the previous year's figure.  As well as these grants-in-aid, repayable advances are made to the board out of the Central Fund mainly to enable the board to give loans to fishermen to assist them in the purchase of boats and gear.  The total amount of these advances authorised for the current year is £390,000 which can be supplemented by the board ploughing back into the industry the sum of £110,000 from loan repayments by fishermen, thus enabling the board to utilise £500,000 for loan capital during 1970-71.  In addition, it will be observed from the Estimates that a provision of £396,100 is made for the repayment of advances by the board to the Central Fund.  This amount is required to wipe out the board's indebtedness to the Central Fund for the period up to 31st March, 1968, in relation to those cases where repayments of advances from the Central Fund were waived by the Minister for Finance following the writing-off in the board's accounts of similar amounts of bad debts.  The figure does not relate to bad debts of any one year but to the accumulated amount of bad debts covering a number of years.  The formal waiving of the repayments, which involves bringing the matter before the Dáil, is being effected at the request of the Comptroller and Auditor General so that a more realistic picture can be presented in the board's annual accounts.</P>
    <P>Lest there should be any misconception as to the services provided by the board with the moneys voted to them in the Fisheries Vote and advanced to it from the Central Fund, I think it would be appropriate for me to outline what the board's general functions are at present and to go into some detail on the various services they provide. The board were brought into existence by the Sea Fisheries Act, 1952 which sets out the board's general powers in very broad terms.  The primary reason for the board's establishment was to take over the functions of the former Sea Fisheries Association and to assist <Col N="2278" /> in the improvement of all facets of the sea fishing industry.  In their early years the board combined development work with some commercial operations by including active participation in fish marketing and fish processing with the provision of various advisory services and financial assistance.  As the years went by it gradually became clear that a change of emphasis was called for and that some of the board's activities were no longer necessary.  In April, 1962 a Government White Paper entitled &ldquo;Programme of Sea Fisheries Development&rdquo; set out the role that the board should have in the development of the industry in modern conditions. The White Paper recommended that the board should withdraw from marketing and processing of fish so as to enable them to concentrate more on their real role as a development body for the industry.  This was gradually achieved and now the board's functions include the administration of a marine credit plan under which grants and loans are given for the purchase of fishing boats and gear; the provision of an advisory service to fishermen to improve fishing techniques and promote co-operation among fishermen; the development of a speedy system of inspection and repair of fishing vessels; the development of markets at home and abroad for fish and fishery products; the encouragement of private investment in worthwhile fish processing undertakings; the operation of three boatyards for the building and repair of fishing boats; and in more recent times the operation of ice-making plants at some fishing ports where such facilities are not provided by private enterprise.</P>
    <P>In implementing the policy of achieving the development of all sectors of the industry, increasing emphasis had to be placed on encouraging enterprise in each sector and on the interdependence of the various sectors.  There would be no point in increasing fish landings if the marketing structure could not cope with the increased supplies while on the other hand there would be little sense in setting up a sophisticated marketing system and developing market outlets, if supplies of fish were not being landed in sufficient quantities. <Col N="2279" /> Similarly the establishment of fish processing factories involved some coordination of activities not only in the catching of fish for supply to the factories but in the marketing of the finished products.</P>
    <P>Taking the catching sector first, the board as I have already mentioned, provide, under the marine credit plan, grants and loans for the purchase of new fishing vessels and gear and loans for the purchase of secondhand vessels. The grants are usually 25 per cent of the cost price and the loans can be up to 70 per cent depending on the amount of the deposit that the purchaser of the vessel is able to put down.  The loans are repayable over a 15 year period with interest on a subsidised rate of 4 per cent per annum. In addition, an incentive grant on a sliding scale up to 10 per cent is payable if the loan is repaid before the full 15 years allowed, the maximum of 10 per cent applying where the loan is repaid in under ten years.  The demand for boats is still very buoyant and during the year ended 31st March, 1970 the board assisted Irish fishermen in acquiring 54 new and 24 secondhand vessels ranging in size from 26 feet to 100 feet in length.  As 18 of the 24 secondhand vessels had previously been operated by other Irish fishermen, there was a net addition of 60 new and secondhand vessels to the Irish fleet during the year, excluding of course the small losses that arise from time to time through normal wastage. The total number of our vessels engaged in sea fishing was 1,911 at the end of 1969 of which 19 were over 75 gross tons, 51 between 50 and 75 tons, 140 between 25 to 50 tons, 60 between 10 and 25 tons and 585 smaller vessels. An examination of the vessel statistics shows that for a number of years prior to 1967 there was a decrease in the overall number of boats but this is attributable primarily to the reduction in the number of small craft such as row boats.  The number of larger vessels of more than 50 tons, 70 feet and more, has increased almost five-fold in the past seven years.  A notable increase has also taken place in the number of motor vessels under 10 tons in the fleet, due primarily to the large <Col N="2280" /> number of the 26-foot lobster fishing boats issued since 1965 under the board's marine credit plan.  There is a steady stream of first-class applicants for boats and, as the figures I have quoted indicate, the tendency is for many of the experienced skippers to turn over to larger vessels.</P>
    <P>The board are continuing to provide advice to fishermen on improved fishing techniques.  Educational tours abroad are organised to enable fishermen to study the fishing methods of other countries and experts from abroad are also brought to this country so that now fishing skills can be demonstrated to our fishermen in their home ports and their existing methods perfected. The provision of technical advice and the employment of specialist fishing gear consultants are services which combine to increase the productivity of the fishermen.  The aim of all these services is, of course, to reduce costs in relation to earnings; to increase the average return on capital invested in boats and gear; to increase the average volume of fish landed per vessel per year; and to ensure that the vessel fishes for as high a proportion of the time as possible.  Special attention is given to the most efficient type of gear, and surveys of gear efficiency and comparative fishing gear trials are carried out particularly in relation to the catching of shellfish.  Included in the board's activities in this general sector is resource development &mdash; not to be confused with scientific research which is not a function of the board. Several projects in the field of resource development have led to fishery development opportunities for the industry in industrial fishing and in the location and proper exploitation of shellfish stocks.  It is in this general area that the closest possible co-operation must always exist between the board's advisory staff and the scientific and technical officers of my Department so that the fruits of scientific research conducted by the Department can be conveyed in practical terms to the working fisherman and that problems arising at that end of the chain can be communicated to the scientists for study with a view to their solution.</P>
    <P>In the sphere of marketing, the board's programme is orientated <Col N="2281" /> towards winning for Irish fish and fishery products a greater share of consumer expenditure at home and abroad. A suitable marketing &ldquo;mix&rdquo; has been devised in which the main elements are promotion, advertising, consumer education, rationalisation of distribution and public relations on the home market; and, in regard to the export market the finding of remunerative outlets and assistance to fishery co-operatives, fish processors and other exporters in organising supplies to the available markets.</P>
    <P>The substantial advertising and promotional campaign through the mass media costs £30,000 annually.  The board's fish cookery advisory activities include hotels, institutions and guesthouses. Educational and promotional programmes are arranged through the schools, the Irish Countrywomen's Association and the defence forces and fish cookery competitions are attracting record entries.  More than 130,000 schoolgirls have since 1962 gone through the National Fish Cookery Competition organised by the board in co-operation with a committee from the fishing industry.  The board have also a fish cookery advisory service for housewives and another service &mdash; the Banqueting Advisory Service &mdash; which is designed to encourage the greater use of the plentiful varieties of fish at a wide range of social occasions has been extremely successful.  All these efforts are playing their part in popularising fish as a regular item of diet now that the Friday abstinence has been abolished.</P>
    <P>The net effect of these schemes is that domestic fish consumption has risen from 7.5 lb. per head in 1963 to 10.7 lb. per head in 1969.  Although it is pleasing to be able to record this, it does not in any way call for complacency. There is still ample scope for further increases in fish consumption.  The board are also encouraging an improvement in fish distribution throughout the country by the opening up of new markets in the hinterland of the main fishing ports.  In this way developments have gone a long way towards remedying what had been a basic weakness in the marketing structure, namely, over-dependence on the Dublin <Col N="2282" /> market.  That market will, of course, continue to be of importance because of the large centre of population it must serve, but it is also most desirable to develop an effective system of distribution to inland towns and villages.</P>
    <P>The low level of fish consumption in inland areas, due to lack of proper fish distribution, presents a problem in any speedy effort to organise more effective distribution and the best that we can expect is that better distribution can be phased in line with gradual increases in fish consumption in those areas.  In any effective marketing arrangement for fresh fish, one of the principal factors is improved fish quality and the icing of fish at all stages of distribution from the point of catching until it reaches the consumer. I have already mentioned fish quality regulations and I repeat the reference now only to illustrate how one aspect of policy inevitably ties in with others.</P>
    <P>In the export field the board have initiated a market research programme to assist exporters in finding diversified market outlets, and an incentive grant scheme is in operation to encourage more visits abroad to tap export markets.  The board have also produced an export market information bulletin to provide information on prices and trends abroad.  As I have already mentioned, the results in the export field have been gratifying, the value of our exports of fish and fishery products being in excess of £3 million for the first time ever.</P>
    <P>Before I conclude my remarks in relation to fish distribution and exports, I should like to pay special tribute to the leading role being played by fishermen's co-operatives in promoting the more rational distribution and export of fish.  I am glad to say that with the assistance of the Irish Agricultural Organisation Society Ltd. they have organised themselves on a national basis and have adopted the rules of the Federation of Irish Fishing Co-operatives. This is an encouraging step and I look forward to seeing the formation of well-managed co-operative societies at all our principal landing places and their affiliation to the central body.  To this end provision has been made in <Col N="2283" /> the Grant-in-Aid to An Bord Iascaigh Mhara of a sum which will enable the board to assist the IAOS towards part of the cost of organisation and training of fishing co-operatives.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are aware, fishery harbour projects, whether they relate to new works or to improvement of existing facilities at fishing ports and fish landing places, are usually promoted and sponsored by my Department. State contributions towards the cost of carrying out those works, including the full cost of constructing the major fishery harbours, are not provided for in the Vote for Fisheries but are met from the capital funds provided for that purpose in the Vote for Public Works and Buildings and in the Vote for Roinn na Gaeltachta when the works in question are situated in Gaeltacht areas.  However, I should like to take this opportunity of explaining briefly how these works are arranged and of indicating how things are going at present.</P>
    <P>Proposals for new fishery harbour works and improvements to existing fish landing place facilities, which are dealt with in my Department, emanate from various sources, for example from the Department themselves arising from inspections and surveys of fishing centres by officers of the Department and the recommendations made by the special survey teams set up by the Minister to make an appraisal of the facilities required to meet the needs of the fishing industry. They also arise from the examination of representations made by fishermen's associations, An Bord Iascaigh Mhara, other fishery interests and, of course, by members of the Oireachtas and other public representatives.</P>
    <P>The various proposals are investigated to ascertain whether new works, repairs or improvements are warranted to maintain the existing level of fish landings and to meet potential expansion and development in local fishing activity.  In the course of these investigations, discussions and consultations take place with local fishermen and other fishery interests, the local authorities <Col N="2284" /> and An Bord Iascaigh Mhara. When a <i>prima facie</i> case for improvements or new works at any particular centre has been established, my Department obtain from the Office of Public Works an engineering report and estimate of costs, on the basis of which an assessment is made as to the feasibility of the proposed works and whether actual or potential fishing activity locally would justify the costs involved.</P>
    <P>To proceed with the works with the assistance of a State grant involves the approval of the Minister for Finance and the availability of funds in the capital programme.  The balance of the cost not met by a State grant is sought by way of contribution from the local authority which are also usually expected to take over the works when completed and to undertake responsibility for their future maintenance.  In the case of the major fishery harbours because of the magnitude of the cost involved, the costs are borne in full by Vote for Public Works and Buildings while ownership, management and future maintenance are vested in the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries under the Fishery Harbour Centres Act, 1968.</P>
    <P>Now, as to works in progress or recently completed or contemplated, I would like to say a few words.  First of all as to the major fishery harbours, the total estimated cost will be of the order of £4.5 million of which about £1 million has already been spent.  The works at Dunmore East are expected to be completed in 1971, at Castletownbere in 1973 and at Killybegs in 1974.  Major dredging work has been carried out at Howth and some preparatory work at Galway.  The harbour centres at Killybegs and Castletownbere have been taken over by orders made under the 1968 Act with effect as from 10th November, 1969, and 1st April, 1970, respectively and are now under my control and management.  As a result, the Commissioners of Public Works acting as my agent under the 1968 Act have set in motion the legal processes to acquire as a matter of urgency lands and rights which are vitally necessary to enable harbour construction and development works to be proceeded with <Col N="2285" /> at Castletownbere fishery harbour centre and are about to make similar arrangements in regard to Killybegs.  I had hoped that it would have been possible to reach agreement with all of the land owners as to the appropriate compensation but in some cases the Commissioners of Public Works have not been able to achieve voluntary sales at agreed prices.  It has been necessary, therefore, to invoke the powers of compulsory acquisition provided for in the Act so that the harbour works can be pushed ahead as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>As to improvement works at west coast ports and fish landing places the position is as follows:</P>
    <P>For the purpose of preparing a specific and comprehensive programme of general fishery harbour works&mdash; outside of the major fishery harbour projects &mdash; special survey teams were set up in 1966 to make up-to-date appraisals of fishery ports and landing facilities required to meet the present and expected needs of the fishing industry on the west coast.  Surveys have already been completed of the coasts of South Kerry, Galway, Mayo, Sligo, Leitrim and Donegal and, recently of County Clare.  A survey of the coast of County Cork is in progress and this will be followed by a survey of north Kerry.  The reports were examined and the Office of Public Works asked to furnish detailed engineering reports and estimates of costs of implementing the various improvement works recommended by the teams.  Some of the improvement works have since been completed or are in progress or are about to be commenced.  This work conforms to the Government's policy of western development under which special attention is being given to the provision of adequate fishery ports and landing facilities on the west coast.  As announced in Dáil Éireann in May, 1969, it was decided to embark on a programme of fishery harbour improvement works for the entire area of the west coast from County Donegal to County Cork.  The programme is in hands and as it develops it is estimated to involve an expenditure of some £200,000 per year for about five years.</P>
    <P>In specific terms the position is as follows arising either from the survey <Col N="2286" /> teams' reports or from separate decisions:</P>
    <P>Improvement works have been approved for Dingle, Cuas (Baile Mór Thoir) and Bealtra, County Kerry; Rossaveel, Cleggan, Emlaghmore, Roundstone, Furnais North, Coolacloy, Renvyle, Sruffaun, Sruthán Buí, Garafin and Glinsk, County Galway; Porturlin, Caladh Mhaghnuis, Blacksod Quay, Dooega and Portahaulia (Clare Island), County Mayo; and for Teelin, Port an Duin, Port an Ghlais, Scotnalinga, Ballysaggart, Magheraroarty, Moville, Ballyhoorisky and Portevlin (Fort Lenan), County Donegal. Harbour improvement works are at present in progress at Skerries and Dún Laoghaire, County Dublin; Kilmore Quay, County Wexford; Reen Pier, County Cork; Cromane, Fenit and Beale Strand, County Kerry; Kilronan, Béal Carra (Barrett's Quay), County Galway; Killala and Darby's Point, County Mayo; and at Poolawaddy and Rannagh, County Donegal.  Approval has also been given to the carrying out of boring surveys as a requisite preliminary to improvement works proposed for Reen (Ballinskelligs), Portmagee and Cahirciveen, County Kerry; and at Burtonport, County Donegal. In addition navigation lights are being erected at Tullaghan Bay and Achill Sound, County Mayo, and approval has been given for the erection of navigation lights at Cora Pointe, Aran, County Galway; Bone Rock, Killala, County Mayo; Poolacheeny, County Sligo and in Owey Sound, County Donegal.</P>
    <P>Improvements work in the fisheries interest were completed during the past year at Ballyoonan Quay, County Louth; Garnish, County Cork; Brandon Bay, Brandon Creek, Dooks, Counanna, Dooneen and Renard Point, County Kerry; Portach and Kilkieran, County Galway; Saleen and Portacloy, County Mayo; and at Burtonport (dredging), Portmore and Bunaniver, County Donegal.</P>
    <P>Deputies will welcome the decision to provide a Decca navigation chain for the south-west, west and north coasts.  I should explain that the Decca system is a very sophisticated navigation aid and has many special advantages <Col N="2287" /> for fishermen in the more accurate location of fishing grounds.  The use of this system is already available to east and south coast fishermen from existing Decca transmitting stations abroad and most of our progressive skippers in these areas have been availing themselves of it.  The extension of the system to the west and north coasts now proposed will ensure adequate coverage for the entire coastline and should result in a substantial increase in the earnings of our fishermen.  Arrangements for the installation of the chain are at present being made with the Decca Navigation Company Ltd.</P>
    <P>I should now like to refer to the implications for the fishing industry of Ireland's membership of an enlarged EEC.  Practically all of our exports of fish and fishery products go to the UK and to the present member states of the Community.  In an enlarged Community the conditions generally for the bulk of our fish export trade would be more favourable because we would be assured of free access and there would be valuable price supports.  While we could expect increased imports of some species such as plaice and cod, our trade in fish and fishery products should on the whole be improved by EEC membership provided our production can be increased.</P>
    <P>A common policy for fisheries for the present Community was agreed to by the EEC Council of Ministers last month and will come into force in February next.  There are two main regulations, one on market organisation and the other on structural aspects.</P>
    <P>The regulation on market organisation covers such aspects as the fixing of quality standards, the fixing of guide prices, market intervention or support purchases, the establishment of producer associations, the abolition of trade restrictions between member countries and provisions for a common customs tariff and other restrictions in the case of imports from non-member countries.  The producer associations will play a prominent part in the marketing arrangements which are envisaged. Member states will be empowered to give aids for the establishment of these associations and the cost <Col N="2288" /> of this will be recouped from Community funds.</P>
    <P>The regulation on structural aspects provides that each member State is to have free access to the fishery waters of all the members.  In exceptional cases, where the local population is mainly dependent on coastal fishing, fishery areas can be restricted in their favour but any restrictions are to be limited to fishery waters within a three-mile zone seaward from the baseline and to a period of five years from the entry into force of the Community regulations.  The common policy also provides that in the interests of conservation Community measures may be taken to restrict certain types of fishing in certain zones and at certain times. Provision is also made for Community financing of such projects as fisheries research, improvement of fishing fleets and the modernisation of storage and processing facilities.</P>
    <P>The policy of free access to fishery waters is a matter of some considerable concern to us.  Its adoption here would cause severe hardship for the inshore fishermen who depend almost entirely on landings from our own exclusive fishery waters.  In addition, as a result of overfishing there could be very adverse effects on fish stocks in those waters.</P>
    <P>This question of common access to fishery waters is being strongly pursued in the entry negotiations.  It was raised by the Irish delegation at the first ministerial meeting between Ireland and the European Communities in Brussels on 21st September and the Community delegation agreed to take careful note of the Irish views.  A comprehensive memorandum on the subject was subsequently submitted by the Irish delegation and the matter was further discussed at a meeting in Brussels on 20th October with the Communities.  The Irish side will continue to press the issue in the course of the negotiations and it will doubtless be raised also by some of the other applicant countries. I can assure the House that every effort is being made, and will continue to be made, to safeguard the interests of Irish fishermen in an enlarged EEC.</P>
    <P>Without attempting to minimise in <Col N="2289" /> any way the problem arising in regard to access to fishery waters in an enlarged Community, I should like to point out that this is only one aspect of the EEC common fisheries policy.  The common policy, as I have said, also provides for detailed organisation of the fish market, and the price support which this will involve and the organisational arrangements proposed especially the development of producer organisations and the functions proposed for them, should be of considerable benefit to our fishermen and enable them to make the most of the market opportunities available in an enlarged Community.</P>
    <P>I turn now to inland fisheries.  The overall catches for salmon in 1969 were slightly greater than for the previous year.  Thus the high runs of salmon which have occurred since 1962 are being maintained despite disease and other disturbing factors.  The market value in 1969 was maintained at a satisfactory level again somewhat higher than that in the preceeding year. The total weight of the catch for the year 1969 by all fishing methods was 30,391 cwts. valued at £1,107,788 as compared with 24,127 cwts. valued at £699,428 in 1968.  These figures do not include those for sea-trout which are of relatively minor importance.  The quantity of salmon exported was 20,101 cwts. valued at £1,172,694 as against 19,847 cwts. valued at £755,339 in 1968.  The higher value per cwt. as compared with landed value arises from the fact that some of the salmon is exported in processed form.  Officers of my Department continued to keep a check on the standard of salmon as exported.</P>
    <P>Conditions for angling were only moderately good for the season as a whole in 1969 largely because of the near drought conditions which prevailed in the summer and early autumn. The number of salmon rod licences issued at 10,756 showed an increase compared with 9,862 in 1968.  The weight of salmon taken by rod and line in 1969 was 182,248 lb as compared with 251,438 lb in 1968.</P>
    <P>As was announced last year the total ban on salmon drift netting has been relaxed in the sea areas off the coasts <Col N="2290" /> of Galway, Connemara and Ballinakill. In those areas drift net fishing for salmon is now permitted during the period 1st April to 21st July.  In 1969 drift netting in those areas was permitted from 9th June to 21st July.  The drift nets there must conform to certain standards, namely, that they must not exceed 800 yards in length and nets with a mesh smaller than 2½ inches from knot to knot are prohibited.  Drift netting for salmon continues, however, to be prohibited in the interests of conservation in certain reserved areas close in-shore.  These are: Killarey and Ballynakill harbours, Clifden, Betraghboy, Kilkieran, Greatman's and Cashla Bays and part of Galway Bay.</P>
    <P>The Commission on Inland Fisheries set up to examine the problems inherent in the development, conservation and utilisation of our inland fisheries had their first meeting on 22nd June. The terms of reference of the commission are of a very wide nature to enable them to investigate all aspects of inland fisheries.  It must be accepted that because of the complexity of the subject some considerable time must elapse before they will have completed their work and made recommendations.</P>
    <P>The suggestion that the inland fisheries of this country should be nationalised continues to receive much publicity.  This is a complex question and one which has been considered more than once.  The Commission on Inland Fisheries of 1933-35 examined it at the time.  I do not propose here to do more than make this passing reference to the question without commitment of any kind.  However, when the Commission on Inland Fisheries to which I have referred already have made their recommendations I hope that their findings may provide a fully informed basis for consideration of the policy issues involved.</P>
    <P>A joint International Working Group from the International Commission for the North-East Atlantic Fisheries and the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea have for some time been studying the implications of the high seas fishing for salmon which takes place in waters off Greenland and also in the north-east Atlantic.  The catches have continued at a high level <Col N="2291" /> in both regions.  Compared with other countries with substantial home water catches Ireland is less seriously affected by the Greenland fishery due to the fact that grilse forms the great bulk of our catches and these are not taken to any extent in Greenland waters.  The development of the fishery in north-east Atlantic waters could affect Irish stocks as there is evidence that some of the catch consists of fish in the grilse age-group.</P>
    <P>At a meeting of the North-East Atlantic Fisheries Commission in May, 1970, a recommendation was passed calling for restrictions by way of close season, <i>et cetera,</i> on fishing for salmon outside national fishery limits.  In the absence of objections it is an obligation of our membership of the commission to implement this recommendation by means of an order operative as from the 1971 season which will apply to Irish fishermen fishing for salmon outside national fishery limits.  It is to be understood however that the major part of our drift netting for salmon at sea takes place within national fishery limits.  The proposed restrictions are of course very much in our overall interest.</P>
    <P>The boards of conservators are keeping up the work of protecting and developing the fisheries in their areas. The protection staffs are endeavouring to prevent illegal fishing as far as possible.  The conservators deal also with other dangers to fish life such as pollution by sewage and by effluents from industrial and other sources, and the need for vigilance in this sphere was brought home in the abnormal conditions of low flows in 1969.</P>
    <P>On the development side, as distinct from protection, the conservators promote suitable work sometimes in collaboration with angling associations by arranging for the removal of obstructions to fish movement in rivers and clearing of spawning beds for better propagation.  For such situations river improvements works grants are readily available to cover most of the cost.  In any case in which technical advice is <Col N="2292" /> required the engineers of my Department give every assistance in the design and execution of the works.</P>
    <P>The boards of conservators continue to be faced with the problem whereby the income which they receive from the sale of licences and from fishery rates is not adequate to meet their expenditure which keeps rising from year to year, largely to meet salary and wage demands, and consequently they have to rely on administrative grants paid from the Salmon Conservancy Fund to keep solvent.  Payments are also made from the fund in respect of river improvement works such as referred to earlier.  The Exchequer grant to the fund is being increased to £73,000.</P>
    <P>The investigations conducted by the biological staff are directed towards the collection and assessment of fishery data with a view to the proper regulation of fisheries.  The investigations can be concerned with specific stocks such as those in the Rivers Erne and Lee where hydro-electric schemes have interfered with the fisheries, or the effects of drainage or other works on particular rivers.  The investigations can, on the other hand, be in the nature of basic research, the results of which can be applied to the global stocks.  In the latter category, a study was conducted in 1969 of standing crops in the River Owenea system, County Donegal which is in the possession of my Department. The purpose of this work is to compare the existing crops of juvenile salmon, brown trout and eels.  The &ldquo;carrying&rdquo; capacity of the system was also investigated by examination of the fauna, flora and water properties so that the capacity of the waters to sustain stocks might be ascertained.  Knowledge of this kind is necessary for proper management of fisheries.</P>
    <P>Investigations are being continued at the experimental station at Glenties into the application of electricity to fishery management and exploitation. These investigations include the development of electric fish counters, electrical fishing apparatus and the exploration of the effects of various kinds of electrical stimulti on different types of fish.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2293" /> UDN continues to affect stocks of salmon in many rivers throughout the country although generally to a less degree than previously.  In most waters other species of freshwater fish are virtually unaffected with the exception of an odd brown trout.</P>
    <P>The outbreak of the disease in trout stocks which occurred during the spawning season of 1968 in a tributary stream of Lough Corrib appeared again in the Corrib system during the last spawning season but whilst the situation was disturbing in December, 1969, a considerable improvement was evident in January, 1970, and only two diseased trout were reported during February, 1970.</P>
    <P>During the period February to September, 1970, the incidence of UDN was low throughout most of the country with the exception of the Rivers Blackwater, Lee and Bandon and the rivers in the Kerry area where the disease continued to be fairly serious.</P>
    <P>In June and July a total of 366 disease-affected fish was removed from the River Erne.  However, this showed a decrease of over 60 per cent when compared with the corresponding period last year.</P>
    <P>As happened in previous years with the advent of warmer weather conditions the disease tended to die out generally.</P>
    <P>The research into UDN continues to be done mainly at the Veterinary Research Laboratory of my Department at Abbotstown, Castleknock, County Dublin, where attempts are being made to isolate the causative organism. Although the work has not yet resulted in identifying the causative organism it has been possible to confirm that the organism is filterable, that is to say of very small size, probably a virus.  The investigations cover a wide range of topics embracing tissue culture, the study of the blood of salmon, transmission experiment and those relating to immunology.  Other aspects of the disease continue to be studied in the Zoology Department of University College, Cork, and in the Botany Department of University College, Dublin.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2294" /> Veterinarians of the Six Counties Ministry of Agriculture continue to work in close collaboration with the Abbotstown Laboratory and liaison is maintained between the research workers of both staffs as well as with those in Britain and other countries. Meetings of the Scientific and Coordinating Committees set up to coordinate research and information on the disease were held during the year. Regular Press releases are issued which give the latest information on the incidence of the disease in affected river systems.  All salmon and sea trout exported from this country are inspected to ensure that they are free from disease.</P>
    <P>In order to assess the full impact of UDN on fish stocks in a particular river system, arrangements have been made to carry out an intensive survey, including runs of fish, count of redds, <i>et cetera,</i> on the River Bandon in County Cork.  A fish counter has been installed at the Bandon fish pass as part of that project.</P>
    <P>In order to combat the effects of UDN in Irish rivers my Department has continued with a programme of restocking diseased rivers with supplies of salmon fry.  Approximately 650,000 ova was imported early in 1970 mainly from Iceland in order to augment supplies available from home sources for the purpose.  Small quantities of sea trout ova were also imported from Ireland and Poland.</P>
    <P>It is hoped to arrange for further imports of ova next season.  Because of the increased demand for salmon fry for restocking river systems affected by UDN disease and the inadequacy of the existing facilities to cope with anticipated imports of salmon ova in next and subsequent seasons, the Department has initiated proposals to extend Cong Hatchery operated by the Galway Board of Conservators to provide increased rearing facilities there.  A site suitable for development adjoins the existing hatchery premises at Cong and arrangements have been made for the transfer of the deeds of this site from the Department of Lands (Forestry Division) to trustees of the Galway Board of Conservators.  This <Col N="2295" /> site has been surveyed by the Department's engineers; site investigations have been carried out and plans for the work are completed.</P>
    <P>A survey initiated by my Department in June, 1966, was completed in 1969 and involved investigations into the effects of the various sources of pollution, mainly of an organic nature, on the water quality of the rivers Blackwater and Martin.</P>
    <P>The project was concerned with the changes of water quality caused by discharges from industrial undertakings based on milk, beet, sugar and food processing and from domestic sewers. Flora and fauna, including the fish populations, were studied.</P>
    <P>The survey indicated that pollution existed in the rivers Blackwater and Martin and, though localised, was of a severe degree in several cases but that under the normal conditions of river flow encountered during the survey, the capacity (i.e., dilution and natural purification) of the rivers to deal with the waste material appeared to be adequate.  That this conclusion would not hold good for conditions of abnormally low river flows is borne out by the fish kills between Mallow and Fermoy in the month of October, 1969, which appear to have been caused by deoxygenation of the river water.  The Meterological Office Report for 1969 comments on the unusually small rainfall in the country, particularly the south, during the summer and autumn of 1969.  The whole question of pollution is at present under examination. Obviously this is an issue which will have to be tackled on a national basis.</P>
    <P>In co-operation with Bord Fáilte, the Fisheries Division of the Department is undertaking an economic evaluation of inland fishery resources.  Bord Fáilte are financing and carrying out the work on brown trout, coarse fish and sea angling.  The Economic and Social Research Institute are undertaking the work on salmon fishing on behalf of Fisheries Division.</P>
    <P>This evaluation should provide useful information on the value of angling to the districts concerned and can be employed by the fishery authorities in <Col N="2296" /> determining the capacity for future development of our angling resources as well as in assessing the economic advantages of future investment both in the sporting and in the commercial fishing interest.</P>
    <P>Officers of Fisheries Division participated in the sixth session of the European Inland Fisheries Advisory Commission of FAO held in May, 1970, in Poland.  Most noteworthy in an agenda of very wide coverage were the parts of the proceedings relating to pollution of inland waters and to sanitary control of international movements of fish and fish eggs.  Pollution was under consideration in a two-day symposium on the nature and extent of pollution in the twenty member countries of the Commission and also in a session in the plenary meeting.  International control over movements of fish and fish eggs is of course highly important as a precaution against spread of fish diseases.  A consultant is to be commissioned to make a study of measures of import and export control in member countries and to draw up proposals including model regulations for control to serve as a basis for recommendations to Governments.</P>
    <P>The Grant-in-Aid sought for the Inland Fisheries Trust for 1970-71 is £220,000.  This is an increase of £20,000 on last year's Grant-in-Aid and the extra money will enable the trust to proceed with their present intensified programme of development work.  I am sure there is no necessity for me to remind the House of the valuable work that the trust is doing for the development of angling in this country. Indeed the fame of the trust has reached other lands and their success story has been the subject of admiration far outside this country.</P>
    <P>From a very modest beginning in the year 1951 the trust's operations now extend to some 150,000 acres of lakes and 1,000 miles of river being developed for trout fishing and a similar area of water for coarse fishing.  This means that a vast area of fishable water is available now for anglers both home and tourist and it is hoped to continue expanding the development and improvement work.  The economic value <Col N="2297" /> to the country is considerable and valuable employment is provided, particularly in the western and midland areas where the greater proportion of the trust's funds are spent.  We are happy to note also the continued steady increase in estimated receipts from angling tourism which fully justifies the work of the trust and Bord Fáilte on angling development and tourist angler promotion.</P>
    <P>In addition to their work on freshwater the trust is engaged on surveying and charting fishing grounds for sea angling and this has given a boost to this type of angling and attracted to it increasing numbers of home and visiting anglers.  The trust's annual reports give an impressive account of their operations and varied work.</P>
    <P>In the development of brown trout fishing on the large lakes much emphasis is placed on the reduction of predatory fish such as pike and perch and the improvement of trout spawning and nursery areas in the tributary streams, as it is considered that where very large lakes are involved this work gives better long-term results than artificial stocking.  Artificial stocking is normally done by the trust only where natural production is inadequate or where there has been a temporary upset caused by circumstances such as drainage or pollution.  An important part of the trust work now relates to biological investigations which is such an essential part of any fishery development programme.  Papers published by their biologists have attracted considerable interest all over the world.</P>
    <P>At their fish farms the trust produced in 1969 over four million brown trout ova: the bulk of the progeny from these was released into waters being developed by the trust and substantial numbers were sold to angling associations and others wishing to stock their own trout waters.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned only a few of the many useful projects operated by the trust.  I am aware of the co-operation and goodwill accorded to them by anglers, angling bodies and indeed all sections of our community.  I would like to take this opportunity to thank all, including the trust members, for <Col N="2298" /> this co-operation and help over the years and to appeal to those who stand to benefit from angling development work to give increased support.  I appeal particularly for increased membership as, apart from the monetary value to the trust's income, increased membership has an encouraging effect and is a tangible proof of the appreciation which we know all feel for the trust's good work.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I feel that Deputies will be satisfied that approval of the Estimate should lead to further expansion of our fisheries, both sea and inland and that the sum provided should be a worthwhile investment for the country as a whole.  I accordingly recommend this Estimate to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBegley" hpid="Mr. Begley Mr. Begley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Begley</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to compliment the Parliamentary Secretary on his statement.  However, in the 27-page document only two pages are devoted to the question of our entry into the Common Market.  At the moment we are negotiating with the EEC and it can be stated that fishermen throughout the country are extremely worried about our prospects.  They have every reason to be worried and it is proper that we should voice our protests in this House at the manner in which the EEC adopted their fishery policy.  The EEC countries were aware of the fact that the fishing industry is very important for Ireland, Norway and other countries but about six weeks ago they hastily drew up a Common Market fishery policy.</P>
      <P>During the debate in this House on our entry into the EEC I voiced certain misgivings about our fishing industry. However, we are told now that no definite steps were taken by the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries until the end of September.  That is disgraceful and the Department should be ashamed of themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The matter of the protection of our fishing industry was raised by both Opposition parties but the Government did nothing about it until 21st September. I am sure that nothing would have been done even then but for the fact that the EEC announced their policy.  As a result of this it appears <Col N="2299" /> that Common Market countries will have access to our territorial waters and have the right to fish there.  We cannot accept those terms.  For generations past fishermen in this country derived their livelihood from the sea and we must ensure that in the future our fishermen will be given the same opportunities.</P>
    <P>I know that the Minister for External Affairs went to Norway when that country protested about the EEC policy.  However, because of internal troubles in Fianna Fáil at that time the visit was cut short.  We have not since heard if the Minister has decided to return to Norway for further discussion on this matter.</P>
    <P>A couple of weeks ago we read in the papers that the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries had submitted a memorandum to the EEC countries on Ireland's fishery problems. Strange to relate, this document has never appeared in public.  The Press has not got it; the House has not got it; the library has not got it.  I do not know what is so secret about that document. For the last two days I have been in touch with the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries.  I went to the general office in Leinster House looking for a copy of this document and was told that it is so confidential that no one can see it except the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries and the EEC countries.</P>
    <P>I find this a very strange attitude.  It is narrow and bigoted.  Every Member of this House is entitled to know what is being done in a Department.  I must ask whether this document is a sell-out of the Irish fisherman?  Is that why members of the Opposition are being denied access to it?  What is so vitally important that we are not let read the document?  Let us contrast the situation with Norway.  Norway put the case forcibly within the last six months. They published their views in the international press.  The Department of Agriculture and Fisheries seem to have a new way of thinking, and it has something of the clock-and-dagger attitude. The misgiving I have about the document <Col N="2300" /> is that it is a complete sell-out of the Irish fisherman to the EEC countries.</P>
    <P>Bord Iascaigh Mhara seem to have made little headway in encouraging young men to enter the fishing industry. In 1960 the total number of full-time fishermen was 1,764.  The total number in 1969 was 1,821.  We have only about 60 extra men employed in the fishing industry now.  This is a dismal record.  Bord Iascaigh Mhara should have admitted that they have failed to encourage young men to take up fishing for their livelihood.  They have not got a proper public relations officer who should go around to the vocational, secondary and primary schools to point out to youths leaving school the opportunities available for them in the fishing industry.  If these young men are not employed they take the emigrant boat.  Most of the fishing is done around the west coast and the youths have no alternative but to emigrate unless they fish.  It should be pointed out to them that fishing could be a lucrative industry.</P>
    <P>It is refreshing to hear that Bord Iascaigh Mhara seem to have decided to open a school for the training of fishermen.  It is not enough to offer £4 pocket money to any young man in this day and age.  It is simply an insult to him.  These young lads are away from home.  If they have a few bottles of beer and a packet of cigarettes each day the £4 would be spent in three nights.  They have to have shoes, suits, shirts, ties and so on, and they have to pay for their own entertainment such as dances, pictures or the odd game of cards.  They might like to go to an odd dog race or to a race meeting.  Where would they go with £4?  Bord Iascaigh Mhara should be more realistic than to think that £4 pocket money is good enough for young lads of 17 or 18 years of age.  This sum should be increased to £8.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to look at this point and to make entry to the fishing industry more attractive.  When people are away from home they have many expenses.  It is even expensive to write a letter home.</P>
    <P>Last May permission was given by the Dáil to Bord Iascaigh Mhara to <Col N="2301" /> increase their borrowing powers. During that limited debate it was pointed out that our fishing grounds are getting little or no protection from foreign trawlers.  This state of affairs was not mentioned here today.  This is regrettable.  There is not even one vessel at the moment protecting our fishermen along the coast.  We have listened to 27 pages of a brief being read, and have heard all about the diseases of brown trout and about brown trout ova.  Many little harbours were mentioned but this question of protection was not mentioned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackieFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>These are not matters from my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBegley" hpid="Mr. Begley Mr. Begley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Begley</NameTxt>
      <P>Reference was made to many subjects which come under the care of the Office of Public Works. There was no mention of protecting the livelihood of our fishermen.  Bord Iascaigh Mhara should tell the Department of Defence and the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries that they are putting much money into the industry and that they expect their investment to be protected.  This is all taxpayers' money. The Department should take the necessary steps to keep the French trawlers which are cutting our fishermen's nets away from the Irish coast.  These Frenchmen are going free.  This state of affairs has lasted too long and will, I hope, be ended soon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regrettably, there was no mention in this 27-page document of the composition of Bord Iascaigh Mhara.  The fishermen have had no say about the men who control their destiny.  The fishermen should have a direct say in the appointment of representatives to Bord Iascaigh Mhara.  It is not good enough nowadays to appoint men to this board just because they are Fianna Fáil cumainn chairmen or ex-Fianna Fáil TDs.  The fishermen who know what it is like to go out at 5 a.m. and return at 10 p.m. should be consulted. They should have some say in Bord Iascaigh Mhara, whether by election or otherwise.  It is entirely wrong that this State body should be so politically unbalanced.  There are many fishermen who have now retired on reaching the age of 65 years or due to arthritis or <Col N="2302" /> rheumatics &mdash; which they get from the life they have led &mdash; who should be brought into Bord Iascaigh Mhara where their influence would make itself felt.  I trust that if any vacancies should occur on that board, the Parliamentary Secretary, in his period of office, will make sure to appoint men who know all about fishing, men who are not just theorists but fishermen who have spent their lives at fishing and who I am quite sure would make a valuable contribution.</P>
    <P>Strange to relate, the Parliamentary Secretary made no reference to the nine French-built trawlers purchased by Irish fishermen.  I addressed a Parliamentary Question to the Minister on this matter on 4th November, 1970.  He told me that BIM gave a grant of £137,550 towards the purchase of those trawlers and that the total cost was £550,000.  The fishermen were led up the garden path by BIM so far as the disgraceful story of these trawlers is concerned.  Just because it was easier to get credit in France at that time, BIM actually twisted the arms of the fishermen to buy those boats.  We now find that four of the boats are in a bad state of rot and that the other five are suspected.  It is a disgrace that £500,000 of taxpayers' money was thrown away by virtue of the mismanagement of this affair by a semi-State body and, yet, nobody has been brought to heel.  A number of years ago, CIE procured some sleepers in France and they had the very same experience.</P>
    <P>One would think that, when those boats were being built in France, one of BIM's surveyors would have taken a bit of the timber home and given it for examination to our Institute for Industrial Research and Standards.  The Minister should order an inquiry into the whole sordid affair of the disease in the timber used in those boats.</P>
    <P>In a supplementary question I asked if the Parliamentary Secretary could say what guarantee was given to the fishermen by the French company that built those boats but my question is still unanswered.  I asked if the Parliamentary Secretary would consider seeking compensation for the fishermen <Col N="2303" /> who invested their money in those boats which are now rotten.  These questions are being asked up and down the country by people who never spent a day fishing.  Now BIM are retreating. The whole thing is wrong.  An inquiry should be conducted and the man responsible should either be suspended by or dismissed from BIM.</P>
    <P>I understand that another gentleman in Donegal wants to back out although he has paid a deposit for one of those boats but BIM will not allow him to do so.  Would you blame an individual for looking for certain guarantees in view of the obvious mismanagement in the past in this connection?  This gentleman in Killybegs should not have his arm twisted by BIM if he wants to change his mind about the purchase of one of those boats in view of the fiasco in relation to the other nine.</P>
    <P>I consider that BIM should place the contract documents concerning those boats for inspection by Members of this House.  We vote money at the request of the Department but the snag is that when there is mismanagement we are not able to do anything about it.  There should be some procedure whereby there can be some redress when State money is mismanaged or misappropriated.  Every skipper receives&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Those boats should have been built in this country, but because of the secretive twisting of the arms of the fishermen, nicely and quietly, by BIM, our unfortunate fishermen had to go to France for the boats.  They had no alternative.  This type of cloak and dagger behaviour by BIM is wrong.  Their surveyors passed the boats and now the boats are rotten. Half a million pounds of the taxpayers' money is too much to waste and to let a Frenchman walk away with it.</P>
      <P>A skipper will get a grant of 25 per cent for a new boat.  That is a good thing but there is more than a skipper to a boat: there are the ordinary deckhands and those men should get a break also from BIM.  It is about time a charter was drawn up in respect of fisheries in general.  Something should be done in the near future for them of the kind that was done for the dockers by Mr. Con Murphy.  In my view the number of drop-outs in the fishing industry is far too high.  As one who has been very close to fishermen all his life, I may say it is about time we had this special inquiry into the whole composition of the fishing industry.</P>
      <P>These deckhands have a good week and a bad week.  There are too many valleys and too few peaks.  In their own way these people are playing a part in building up the fishing industry and they should get the necessary incentives to stay in the industry, which they are not getting at the moment.  I hope that Bord Iascaigh Mhara will look into this matter in more detail and perhaps produce a report like the report Mr. Con Murphy made about the dockers in Dublin.  I am quite sure this would be welcomed by every deckhand in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another aspect of the fishing industry is the question of insurance.  The insurance of these big trawlers, the 75-footers, costs something in the region of £600 per annum.  That is a colossal figure.  The powers-that-be <Col N="2305" /> should devise some method of reducing that insurance.  I know one man who was buying a launch in Dingle and, while he was purchasing it from Bord Iascaigh Mhara, he was paying insurance of something in the region of £88 per annum.  The moment he had purchased the launch he went to another insurance company and they insured it for £24.  The fisherman is being bled, and bled by the new time, when there can be a difference of £60 between insurance companies.  Bord Iascaigh Mhara should take note of that.  Where is the £600 going?  Bord Iascaigh Mhara should take a second look at the insurance side.</P>
    <P>The banks and other industrial concerns should play a part in the fishing industry.  A few years ago the banks offered grants to students if they wanted to do a course in the university. That scheme was welcomed by everyone. The banks should show the same interest in the man who wants to acquire a boat.  It is a fact that 75 per cent of the students who graduate from universities emigrate.  It would be a good thing if the banks or other industrial concerns such as the insurance companies gave loans to potential skippers who complete the course in the school which has been set up.  Three thousand pounds is a lot of money for a young man of 21, 22 or 23 years of age who has just completed his skipper's course, and where is he to get it?</P>
    <P>The tutors in these colleges will recognise the boys who have the art and the gift and who are genuinely interested in fishing and should recommend them for a loan to start them off. Why not give them the same break as the young man who is getting free university education?  There are many young men like that from Cork, Kerry, Clare, Galway, Mayo and Donegal and all up along the west coast and, if they thought that if they went to this school, studied hard, took the right interest in the subjects being taught and passed the examination and that at the end of it all there was a chance that they would own a boat of their own, there would be a rapid expansion of interest in fishing.  I could see young boys coming from all over Ireland and trying to get into this college.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2306" /> At the moment there are many boys doing the course and getting the skipper's ticket and they then have no money to put a deposit on a boat.  Bord Iascaigh Mhara should direct their attention to that aspect of the industry. I was told that in my own locality at one time there were somewhere in the region of 2,000 people associated directly or indirectly with fishing.  The tradition was there but regrettably it was let die.  I would ask Bord Iascaigh Mhara to think along these lines and to go around to business firms and point out to them what they could do and what it would mean to the fishery industry as a whole if such loans were made available to young skippers when they had completed the course. I am quite sure that we would not then be short of skippers.</P>
    <P>We are told in a report sent out by Bord Iascaigh Mhara, by Mr. Brendan Kelly, the famous gentleman, famous for confiscating boats more than developing fishing&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Begley</NameTxt>
      <P>How many are fishing now?  I will give the figures.  In 1960 we had something in the region of 1,760 and in 1970 we have only 60 more men fishing.  If the Deputy calls that success after ten years I do not know what success is.  The price has also gone up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are told in this report that he expects that there will be a shortage of skilled skippers and crew and that by 1974 we will have about 350 extra boats.  Every time these gentlemen open their mouths they speak in millions of pounds, but they are elusive millions. I cannot understand how these figures are arrived at.  I cannot understand how he will have 354 extra boats in three years time when he could get only <Col N="2307" /> 60 extra fishermen into the fishing industry from 1960 to 1969.</P>
    <P>It is about time these gentlemen were more realistic in their approach to the whole question of the fishing industry.  I said in this House before and I say it again that in 1966 a group of Dingle fishermen asked me to come to Dublin with them as their spokesman regarding the confiscation of boats due to arrears of payments.  Immediately Bord Iascaigh Mhara heard that I was to be their spokesman they decided not to meet us at all.  That is a true story.  It is on the record.  They refused to meet a deputation because of the fact that I was with them, and I was only a county councillor at the time.</P>

      <P>You are well in, Joe. You are on the right side of the House. It is about time this practice of taking decisions behind closed doors was finished.  Another complaint I have about Bord Iascaigh Mhara is their lack of communication with the ordinary fisherman.  They should have a little pamphlet or magazine which would cover their activities and which they should send to the skippers who are all registered fishermen.  It would not cost very much and it would tell the ordinary fisherman what is happening in the industry and what is being prepared for it in the future.  I would strongly urge Bord Iascaigh Mhara to prepare a little fortnightly or monthly magazine and send it to the fishermen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary told us today that there has been a certain amount of money written off down <Col N="2308" /> through the years.  I am quite sure that relates to the boats that were confiscated by Bord Iascaigh Mhara because some fishermen could not meet the hire purchase terms.  It would be interesting to be told how many boats were re-possessed. That was skipped over here today.  We were not told of the hardship re-possession of these boats caused.  It is about time this House was given the true facts.  In some cases of re-possession, Bord Iascaigh Mhara themselves were more or less responsible for the arrears that accumulated. It is well known &mdash; Deputy O'Connor and I do not very often agree but he will agree with me on this &mdash; that there are long delays while waiting for engine and boat parts.  It sometimes takes six months to get parts and I have been told that there is a boat in a certain part of the country which has been waiting three years for an engine. This is entirely wrong.  Arrears are accumulating all the time, the poor fisherman cannot pay the arrears and the boat is then taken over.  In the dark of night a couple of men paid by Bord Iascaigh Mhara will steal the boat out of the harbour.  They will do it at night for fear of being called blacklegs.  That is what is happening and that is what has happened in the past.  If Bord Iascaigh Mhara told this House what they paid for these boats originally and what they got for them when they were re-sold many Deputies would rise up in anger.  I remember one boat in Dingle not so long ago &mdash; the people in Bord Iascaigh Mhara remember it well too &mdash; which was re-possessed.  Nobody would touch it.  It was a &ldquo;black boat&rdquo; because there was a sad story attached to it.  The boat rotted away on the pier. The county sheriff sold it in the end for a very small figure after an advertisement had appeared in the newspaper for several weeks.  I would ask Bord Iascaigh Mhara, before they re-possess these boats, to put their own house in order first.  The arrears accumulated in this case because there were no maintenance men to repair the boat and the owners were waiting for a part of the engine which they did not get.  That whole question should be looked into.  How many of these boats are tied up at different piers around our coasts?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2309" /> The Parliamentary Secretary made no reference whatever to extending our boatyards.  According to the chairman of An Bord Iascaigh Mhara we are to have 354 extra boats in 1974.  Where will the 354 boats be built?  There is a very fine boatyard in Arklow, a fine one in Dingle, a fine one in Killybegs and one in Deputy Lenehan's area. Will all these boats be bought outside the country?</P>

      <P>Strangely enough the Parliamentary Secretary made no mention of the 354 boats but I shall quote from a report in the <i>Irish Times</i> of August 24th, 1970.  Under the heading: &ldquo;BIM sets target of £14m. for fishing industry by 1974&rdquo; we are told:</P>
      <P>BIM envisages the use of more than 350 extra boats by 1974.</P>
      <P>I am sure the men in Wicklow, the men in Mayo, the men in Dingle and the men in Donegal would be satisfied if we were told that 40 boats a year would be built in the different boatyards. That would satisfy us down to the ground.  This House should get an assurance that Irish boatyards will first be considered, especially as Bord Iascaigh Mhara own these boatyards, and that Irish craftsmen will get the opportunity of building these boats.  We have plenty of room for extensions in Dingle. There is a grand foreshore there.  I am sure the same can be said of all the other boatyards.  I see no reason why we should be sending our money out when we have the skilled technicians at home and there are many more young fellows who would be prepared to go in as apprentices and come out qualified boatbuilders.  That is how the west would be saved, by giving employment at home and not in France or in Norway.  I strongly urge Bord Iascaigh Mhara to reconsider the whole question of buying these boats outside and to keep the money at home and give work to our men.  That is the only way to save the West.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary said in regard to buying boats:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2310" /> The grants are usually 25 per cent of the cost price and the loans can be up to 70 per cent depending on the amount of the deposit that the purchaser of the vessel is able to put down.  The loans are repayable over a 15 year period.</P>
    <P>That is not so.  They are repayable over a ten year period.  It was 15 years but Bord Iascaigh Mhara have recently changed it to ten.  It is wrong that such a statement should be made in the House.  Ten years is the period.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. J. Lenehan Mr. J. Lenehan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Begley</NameTxt>
      <P>I read it also and that is why I am worried.  One other point I should like to raise concerns deep freeze facilities.  In my part of the country we are in the unique position whereby the fishermen's co-operative society must go to Midleton in County Cork to have fish stored in deep freeze so that if a man in, say, Mayo, wishes to buy the fish, it will be necessary for the fishermen to send two men from Dingle to Midleton to load a lorry to <Col N="2311" /> take the fish to Mayo.  This is a disgraceful state of affairs.  Bord Iascaigh Mhara are not prepared to give a grant to the Dingle fishermen to enable them to provide their own deep freeze plant. When the fish is landed it must be taken a distance of about 80 miles in order to be stored in deep freeze.</P>
      <P>As far as the Dingle port is concerned, Bord Iascaigh Mhara should hang their head in shame.  Down through the years they have done their best to close the port and this situation in relation to the deep freeze plant is the last straw.  It is not good enough in this day and age.  The fishermen have applied repeatedly in the past, as I am sure Deputy O'Connor is aware, to the board to provide a deep freeze plant but each time they make representations they are told the matter is under consideration.  In Dingle we have a tradition of fishing.  I would say that more boats were repossessed in Dingle than in any other harbour in Ireland. So far as landings are concerned we were always in the top five or six.  Yet, when the board decided to develop six ports, Dingle was omitted while ports whose landings were less than those of Dingle were developed.</P>
      <P>It seems to me there is a vendetta on the part of the board towards Dingle.  The fishermen were being afforded some facilities for deep freeze storing by a private company and I understand that Bord Iascaigh Mhara recommended that this company qualify for an IDA grant.  However, the company have now told the fishermen that they need the plant for their own use and, consequently, the fishermen can no longer be accommodated. This attitude of neglect is not good enough.  The board should have a very close look at the whole question in relation to Kerry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are told in this statement that the Parliamentary Secretary intends to carry out harbour improvements.  In Kerry there are only three harbours, but in Galway there are 12, in Mayo there are seven and in Donegal there are 12.  This is consistent with Bord Iascaigh Mhara's neglect of Kerry but they look after every other county.  The Kerry fishermen are as good as any <Col N="2312" /> others in the country and I believe it is wrong that only three harbours in the county should be developed.</P>
    <P>We are told also in this statement, page 16, that the Decca navigation system will shortly come into operation. This is very welcome news but we should be given a definite date for the coming into operation of the system. It has been on the mat for the past three years.  The fishermen cannot educate themselves, as it were, in the use of this new mechanism.  Some of them are ready for it but they should be given a definite date as to when it will be put into operation.  The Minister should be more explicit and give the Decca Navigation Company a deadline.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I should like to refer to one matter which concerns the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries.  I am sorry the Minister is not here today because I think he owes me an apology. During the course of the debate concerning extra borrowing powers for Bord Iascaigh Mhara I said that men who had no fishing background were now getting boats.  I made that allegation in all sincerity because I knew at the time that a certain individual in my home town who was chairman of the local Fianna Fáil cumann and who was also a national teacher, was being given a boat.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnLOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>He should be a good fisherman so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBegley" hpid="Mr. Begley Mr. Begley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Begley</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply the Minister more or less told me that I was under a misapprehension about the whole matter.  I now challenge the accuracy of what the Minister said.  It has been reported in the Press as well as on radio and television and this gentleman is getting a boat.  Therefore, the Minister should be good enough to come in and apologise to me since my statement was correct.  More power to him if he is getting a boat.  When I made the statement I thought fishermen should get first priority.  I will not say the Minister deliberately told a lie but I will say that he was probabely misinformed. I will quote what he said from Volume 247, No. 1, column 90 of the 26th May, 1970:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us contrast that attitude with <Col N="2313" /> that of his colleague Deputy Begley from Kerry.  His approach to the general problem was very depressing. He thinks boats are being given to people who are not fishermen at all and that people who are fishermen have to give up their boats.</P>
    <P>He went on further to say:</P>
    <P>Deputy Begley suggested that loans were given to people who never fished.  An Bord Iascaigh Mhara do not give grants or loans for boats except to people who have skippers' tickets.</P>
    <P>That is completely untrue.  This gentleman who got the boat is not a fisherman by trade of profession.  He is a schoolteacher.</P>
    <P>I want to make it quite clear when I made this statement I made it in all sincerity.  I would not mislead this House one way or the other and the man who gave that information to the Minister, whoever he was, told lies. The Minister said:</P>
    <P>An Bord Iascaigh Mhara do not give grants or loans for boats except to people who have skippers' tickets.</P>
    <P>That is completely wrong.  It is about time the people who are advising the Minister &mdash; I know the Minister made this statement in good faith &mdash; were called to heel if they are not prepared to give proper information to charges which are made in this House.  One is suspicious of An Bord Iascaigh Mhara straight away.  Will they go to any length to save their faces?  What kind of whitewashing is that?  Everybody in Dingle town, everybody in County Kerry who reads <i>The Kerryman</i> knows I told the truth.  Despite this the Minister had the cheek and the audacity to come in here and say that I was misleading the House.  I challenge him here today on this statement.  I am prepared to accept that he was misinformed and that he was not familiar with fishing, because he was not long enough in the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries.  At the same time it is very wrong of an official to give that type of information to the Minister and send him in here to make a fool of himself in the eyes of Kerry.</P>
    <P>The last point I should like to make is that An Bord Iascaigh Mhara now <Col N="2314" /> and again have receptions for cookery competitions and for skippers, especially when a skipper has successfully completed his ten years and is getting a bonus.  More power to the skippers. We are all delighted when we hear of a man making a success of his way of life.  Everybody is thrilled, no matter what walk of life he belongs to, but just because some of us come into this House and criticise people we feel should be criticised is no reason that we should be passed over when those receptions take place, especially when men are invited to them who have no connection whatever with the fishing industry.  But, because they are members of a particular political party, they are invited to them.  It is time the men in An Bord Iascaigh Mhara were big enough to stop this type of thing going on.  I am prepared to say outside this House what I am saying here now.  The men in An Bord Iascaigh Mhara should be big enough not to use those receptions, which might be down in Killorglin next week or Arklow the week after, in this way by not inviting public men who dare criticise the board.  We are not worried about it but we say that it is the taxpayers who are paying for this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am reminded, in speaking on this Estimate, that 40 years ago there was a separate Department of Fisheries.  Since then the Fisheries Branch has been part of the Department of Lands and now it is part of the Department of Agriculture. The net result of this has been that over the years there has been a decline in the fishing industry.</P>
      <P>We are a small island country and no part of the country is more than 100 miles from the seacoast.  Perhaps the decline in the fishing industry is a reflection on the make-up of the Dáil down the years.  It would be unusual to find a person who spent his time mainly at fishing elected to this Dáil, because the job is a very lonely one and he would not come in contact with many people.  I feel, as a result of that, that the emphasis on this industry has declined and the great wealth which surrounds this country has been ignored by successive Governments over those years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2315" /> The fact that the Fisheries Branch is now to all intents and purposes handed over to An Bord Iascaigh Mhara is a disappointing result of this lack of interest over the years.  There has always been great scope and there still is great scope for a huge expansion in exports through fishing.  It is only in recent years that we have begun to wake up to this fact but great damage has been done to the infrastructure on which this industry has been built.</P>
    <P>I hope, when speaking on this Estimate, to speak for the industry in all parts of the country.  The neglect which has taken place in the industry is more marked in the constituency of Wicklow than in any other part of the country.  The fishing port of Arklow was at one time famous throughout western Europe.  At the end of the last war there were 128 fishing boats operating from Arklow but now, unfortunately, there are less than a dozen operating on a fulltime basis from that port.  This decline can be seen in every coastal county, where harbour facilities have been allowed to decay and quaysides have fallen into the sea and into rivers.  The Minister has given a list of harbours which are due for improvement in the coming years.  Although my colleague from Kerry finds his county has been badly treated he will also find that no mention is made of any improvements for harbours on the Wicklow coast.  If this industry is to flourish and expand no part of the country can be ignored.  It has been the policy of the Department and Bord Iascaigh Mhara to create five major fishery harbours whilst allowing other areas to decline. This is not the right attitude.</P>
    <P>The figures for landings of demersal or white fish as I prefer to call them such as cod, plaice and haddock, and pelagic fish, such as herrings, have increased encouragingly over the last three years.  These increases have been achieved by almost the same number of men with the same fishing fleets.  In 1968 the total quantity of wet fish caught was 838,000 cwt. at a value of about £1,700,000, and if we add to that shell fish the value was £2,400,000.  The Minister has told us that the 1969 <Col N="2316" /> figure is up by over £½ million to almost £3 million.  A more accurate comparison could be made if we could compare the quantities landed as well as the value of the landing.</P>
    <P>The figures, though encouraging, fall short of the projected landings it was hoped to achieve in the Third Programme: Economic and Social Development produced by the Government in March, 1969.  A target of £5½ million worth of sea fish landings was set for 1972.  If we are to achieve this target landings will have to be increased in value by £2½ million in the next two years.  When one looks at the number of extra boats and trawlers coming into the industry one realises that this target is going to be very difficult to achieve.</P>
    <P>Exports in 1969 were up by one-third but we must remember that we are starting at a very low base, because £3.5 million worth of exports is a very low figure when compared with exports in other major industries such as the cattle industry.  We are a small island with a great tradition for seafaring. The figure for 1969 is miserable but the fact that we are expanding at the rate of one-third per year is encouraging. Imports of fish amounted to almost £2 million which again is a significant increase.  This means that net exports amounted to £1.6 million. A significant improvement will have to be made this year if we are to come anywhere near the £7 million target for 1972.  Everyone would be delighted if this target was achieved or exceeded but if it is even to be achieved there will have to be a great deal more activity in the fishing industry than we have had in the last three years.</P>
    <P>We can break down the fishing industry into three sections.  If we do this we find we have completely excluded ourselves from activity in the first section: the west Atlantic, Iceland and Greenland.  We have almost 200 boats operating in the second section, which is 60 miles from the coast to as far north as the Shetlands.</P>

      <P>The registration of nurses in England and Wales is a matter for the General Nursing Council of England and Wales.  This council may require those who apply for registration in England or Wales to undertake further training before qualifying for registration.  A critical factor in their consideration is the size of the hospital in which the nurse is trained.  The standard required in this respect is a total bed capacity of not less than 300 and a daily bed occupancy of not less than 240.  The requirements are general and do not refer specifically to Irish trained nurses.</P>
      <P>In 1968, the General Nursing Council informed An Bord Altranais of the changes in the registration requirements which they intended to impose and An Bord, in consultation with the council, have evolved a scheme of amalgamation and integration of training schools as a result of which nurses in this country in hospitals so amalgamated or integrated as to provide the requisite facilities are accepted for registration in England and Wales.  No problem has arisen in the case of nurses trained in Irish training hospitals meeting the requirement of not less than 300 beds and an average daily bed occupancy of 240.</P>

      <P>In addition to CIE, other Irish handling agencies are also involved and they too are endeavouring to secure some of the traffic for their companies. I have no doubt that between CIE and the other agencies involved there will be adequate handling facilities for the traffic in 1971.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Donnell's question is directed to the North American tourist business of Shannon Travel.  As I said, a special sales force of CIE have come into precisely that area of business and are doing the bookings to which Shannon Travel were committed.  That is what Deputy O'Donnell's question is about.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Colley)</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 10, 13 and 14 together.</P>
      <P>On 18th November I was asked a number of Parliamentary Questions about the Northern Ireland Relief Expenditure (Grant-in-Aid) and various associated transactions.  Replying to supplementary questions I expressed the view that Parliamentary questions and answers are not the appropriate way to inquire into transactions assoiated with the Grant-in-Aid.  I added that the House would be given an opportunity soon to decide on a more appropriate form of inquiry.</P>
      <P>There is a motion on the Order Paper&mdash;</P>
      <P>That the Committee of Public Accounts shall examine specially the expenditure of the Grant-in-Aid for Northern Ireland Relief issued from Subhead J, Vote 16 (Miscellaneous Expenses) for 1969-70 and shall furnish a separate report on this expenditure as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>If this motion is adopted the Committee of Public Accounts will be in a position to examine the various transactions connected with the Grant-in-Aid. While a detailed account is not, generally speaking, submitted to the committee in respect of expenditure from a Grant-in-Aid, my Department will, in this case, provide for the committee full details of the payments made, together with all other information available from its records or obtained from the gardaí.</P>
      <P>The three questions addressed to me today about the Grant-in-Aid can be more appropriately examined in detail by the committee who will be able to have full regard to the circumstances relevant to each transaction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having regard to the foregoing, I trust that the Deputy who tabled these questions will accept that it is better that the information sought should, in so far as it is available, be provided as part of a comprehensive statement <Col N="2327" /> to the committee rather than by way of replies to Parliamentary questions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy does not so accept.  I want to be clear: the Minister is refusing to disclose any more information about this before the by-elections.  It is to be kept hidden until afterwards.  These questions are not to have a reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">

      <P>These questions are in order.  That is accepted.  They are normal questions and the Minister refuses to answer them before next Wednesday.  May I ask what question No. 13 has to do with the £100,000 and why he is covering up on it?  That question relates to statements on oath by witnesses in reply to questions by counsel that public contributions were directed into this fund and used for the purchase of arms.  Why is the Minister refusing to answer that question? These funds were given to the Red Cross because the Minister for Finance at the time called on the people to give the money to the Red Cross in order to be assured that the money would not get into the wrong hands or be used for wrong purposes.</P>

      <P>In order to get at the truth about these transactions it is necessary to see all of them in perspective. By taking single aspects one does not get the truth.  Question No. 13 is, of course, involved in all the transactions relating to that Grant-in-Aid and a study of all the matters involved will reveal that that is so.  However, I also want to point out that the attitude now being adopted by Deputy FitzGerald makes it quite clear&mdash;I am sure the public will note it&mdash;that his protestations with regard to this House, its authority and its control over expenditure voted by it, are an absolute sham and he is concerned only with trying to secure political capital.

      <P>The external trade returns for the first ten months of 1970 show an improvement in the balance of trade of £3.6 million as compared with the corresponding period of 1969.  It is likely that the balance of trade for the year as a whole will also show an improvement as compared with the calendar year 1969.</P>
      <P>In regard to the balance of payments there is as yet no official estimate available of the trend of net invisible receipts in 1970.

In regard to the second part of the Deputy's question, the fact that exports improved does not eliminate the difficulty of inflation from which we are suffering, nor does it show that we would not have had greater exports if we had not an inflationary situation.

      <P>Because of the difficulty of evaluating factors such as site acquisition costs it is not possible to give a realistic reply to the Deputy's question.  It has been estimated that the ratio between the average rent of new office accommodation leased for Government Departments during the past three years and the estimated cost of constructing an equivalent amount of space would roughly be 1:8.  The estimate of construction cost does not include fees, etc., or site acquisition costs which could grossly affect the calculation of the ratio.</P>

I understand that the firm are members of the Irish Construction Industry Federation.  The demolition and excavation works were carried out by Irish firms.  Substantial portions of the contract will be handled by Irish firms who will carry out the work on structural beams, windows, electrical installations and other services.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I have gone very closely with the Commissioner into the question of providing a station in the northern part of Limerick city.</P>
      <P>Since 1st March last the strength of the force in Limerick city has been increased by 11 and there is a relatively high concentration of police cars and motor cycles, almost all equipped with two-way radios, now operating there.  The policing of the city is being examined by the research and planning Unit of the Garda Síochána with a view to providing additional resources in manpower and equipment.</P>
      <P>If a station were to be provided in the north city area, sufficient manpower would have to be made available for the indoor operations of the unit, with a consequent reduction in the number available for the more important outdoor duties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The assessment of police requirements in any area is a matter primarily for professional policemen and I accept the commissioner's advice that the <Col N="2342" /> police needs of the city as a whole are best served for the time being by the methods now in operation.</P>

      <P>A full examination of the law and practice of bankruptcy has been conducted by a Bankruptcy Law Committee, which was established in 1962.  This committee have prepared a draft Bankruptcy Bill and are at present engaged in drawing up their report and draft regulations.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I would agree that, on the face of it, it seems to have taken a long time.  Having met them and discussed the matter in detail with some members of the committee, I am aware that they have worked extremely hard. They held 98 plenary meetings and several hundred meetings of subcommittees. In addition, they sat on nine occasions to take evidence.  In the past few weeks they have provided me with a copy of the Bill.  It is an enormous Bill of great complexity.  In the circumstances of the complex and difficult branch of the law which they were <Col N="2343" /> investigating, I can understand that it would take that length of time.  They have done an excellent job in a very unrewarding branch of the law.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>A Bill, which will propose to give effect to all the <Col N="2344" /> changes in the law that are mentioned in the question, is at present in an advanced stage of drafting.  I should say that the Bill will be a very substantial piece of legislation.  It involves the consolidation with amendments of the Landlord and Tenant Acts of 1931, 1958 and 1967.  The Bill will implement the various recommendations made in the two Reports of the Landlord and Tenant Commission concerning the renewal of tenancies, in particular business tenancies, the extension to new classes of persons of the right to reversionary ground leases and of the right to purchase the fee simple, the renewal of the tenancies of sports organisations, and many other matters.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that there has been a problem in the County Dublin area for many years about private housing estates which have not been properly completed and which, because of this, have not yet been taken in charge by the county council.  Some of these estates were developed on the basis of permissions granted under the Planning Act of 1934 and I feel that the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, went as far as possible in enabling planning authorities to apply enforcement powers to these older estates.  Where it has become clear that these enforcement powers are not going to provide a solution &mdash; in cases where, for example, the terms of the original permission were vague or imprecise or where the developers have died or gone out of business &mdash; it is a matter for the county council to take such other measures as are open to them to deal with such cases.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if he will state in respect of the Dublin Corporation tenant purchase scheme whether any allowance is being made to prospective purchasers, consideration of whose applications was delayed for a period of one year or more, by the corporation's valuer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The corporation proposed and I agreed last July that there should be a reduction in the approved price for tenants who applied to purchase in the year ended 31st March, 1970, and who were not notified in that year of the price at which the corporation could sell.  This reduction enables the corporation to sell the houses at their market value at the date of valuation, or in the quarter in which the purchase application was made, whichever is the lower, provided the reduced price is within 10 per cent of the market value in the approved purchase scheme.</P>
      <P>In applying the 10 per cent, the corporation allow the full reduction where the application was received in the March-June quarter of 1969; 7½ per cent where it was received in the July-September quarter; 5 per cent in the case of the October-December quarter and 2½ per cent in the case of the January-March quarter of 1970. Tenants were notified of the net value after the deduction had been made.  I have now asked the corporation to quote the gross price and give the deductions separately.  Under the scheme, a tenant who applied in, say, March-June period to purchase a house valued in the scheme at £2,000 could have the price reduced by up to 10 per cent, to £1,800.  If he were entitled to the full tenancy discount he could get a further reduction of £600 bringing the net price of the house to him to £1,200.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs whether he has appointed any advisory committees or advisers under section 20 of the Broadcasting Authority Act, 1960 in relation to the Authority's functions on advertisements; and whether such committee or adviser has considered what constitutes an advertisement; or whether the Authority has power to include items of an advertising nature as an integral part of its general programmes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first part of the question is &ldquo;no&rdquo;, and the second part does not therefore arise.  As regards the third part, the Broadcasting Authority have wide powers in relation to advertisements and there is no express provision in the <Col N="2358" /> Broadcasting Authority Acts forbidding them from acting in the manner suggested. There is, however, a clear implication in section 20 of the Broadcasting Authority Act, 1960, that advertising matter be identifiable as such and I am assured that it is and has been the general policy of the Authority to separate advertisements from programme content.  On the sound broadcasting side, of course, there are still sponsored programmes, that is, programmes supplied for advertising purposes by or on behalf of an advertiser but these are clearly identified as advertising programmes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter has come up in the House on quite a few occasions on questions similar to this. Can the Minister say what is the criterion on which a kiosk is provided in some places and is not provided in what appear to be similar places?  Can the Minister outline what exactly are the regulations under which telephone kiosks are installed in different areas? I consider there certainly is a need for a public telephone at Kilcolgan Cross.</P>

      <P>I am afraid I cannot agree with the Deputy's suggestion that there is need for a telephone kiosk at Kilcolgan Cross.  It is a rural area with a population of about 30 people within a mile radius of the Cross.  There is no village, as such, there at all.  The nearest telephone kiosk, I understand, is in Ferbane, a little over a mile away.  If the Deputy is anxious to get a copy of the departmental policy on the provision of telephone kiosks I will be only too glad to send him a copy of it.

    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>Before Questions I was saying that the fishing industry of any nation can be divided into three parts: (1) fishing in distant waters &mdash; where Ireland is concerned this would be fishing in the west Atlantic or around Iceland or Greenland, (2) fishing in nearer waters, up to about 60 miles from the coast, and (3) inshore fishing.  We have about 200 boats capable of operating in the middle water and it is from this area the largest proportion of fish landings come.  Obviously it is in this area that the greatest expansion can be achieved.  The lucrative herring fishing grounds are found in this middle water and herring landings amounted to 682 cwt. in the past year, valued at £783,000.  The remainder of the fishing fleet operates close to the coast and in the shell-fishing beds in the inshore waters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2373" /> The herring fishing around our coasts could be further developed and exploited if a special herring fishing industry board were set up.  There is a need to promote the sale of herrings at home and abroad and to apply the benefits of technical progress to this industry.  A board such as this could apply their full energies, if they were staffed by the people who are close to that particular branch of the industry, to ensure that new methods of catching, processing and distribution of herrings are investigated and put into effect.  In this area vast strides could be made and could give a valuable return both in exports and home consumption.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary told us the number of fishing vessels at present operating and the number of fishermen working on the boats.  There is grave concern among people who are making repayments on boats and who hope to own boats in the future.  The recent &ldquo;Seven Days&rdquo; television exposé on the purchase of nine French fishing boats by Irish skippers brought to light the great blunder that was made by people who have been put in positions of power in the fishing industry.  The building of these boats in France was a great blow to the craftsmen, shipwrights and other workers in the boat-building industry here.  This is a blow to employment generally but the fact that £500,000 of the taxpayers' hard earned money has been spent on shoddy boats by An Bord Iascaigh Mhara on behalf of fishermen is a great blow to the confidence that is required in this industry if it is to prosper and expand.  It is to the credit of people like Muiris MacConghaill and the staff of &ldquo;Seven Days&rdquo; that in spite of the troubles they have had in the past year in dealing with topics like this they were able to bring this great scandal to light for the general public.  The fact that these boats could have been built here and the fact that taxpayers' money has been spent abroad is bad enough, but that people who should know better have spent this large amount of money without first going into every aspect of the purchase and having qualified people examine every piece of material that went into the building of these boats <Col N="2374" /> shows a great lack of interest in the whole fishing industry.  I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will see that this never happens again in the area under his control.</P>
    <P>We had a flourishing fishing port in Arklow.  We also had, and, indeed still have, a boat-building concern in Arklow but unfortunately many of the men connected with these two industries are finding it more lucrative to go into other areas of employment because the work is just not there. These men are craftsmen.  They know the business.  Their families have been connected with it for generations.  That craft is being allowed to die in a place like Arklow, and I am sure in other areas, while we spend £500,000 of public money abroad and put this money into the pockets of people who have no regard for their product or for the people whose lives are risked going to sea in these boats.</P>
    <P>In relation to manpower we are told here that a school is being set up at Greencastle for the purpose of training school leavers for the fishing industry.  This is to be lauded by us here although it may be a pity that only one school is being opened.  Nevertheless, it is a beginning and I hope that the response will be so good as to encourage the Parliamentary Secretary to open further establishments.</P>
    <P>It is gratifying that young people in their twenties are prepared to take boats that are worth many thousands of pounds.  If these people are trained they can make a very useful contribution to our general balance of payments by effecting increased fish landings. These young people can show tremendous example to other young people in the community by letting them see what can be done if the opportunity is available.</P>
    <P>It has been mentioned that 170 people were trained during the past five years.  If we are to achieve the figure set out in the Third Programme and if we are to keep pace with competition from abroad there is a need for many hundreds of full-time, fully trained fishermen.  I realise that the problem of recruiting young people for training is creating a bottleneck in the expansion of the industry and, consequently, in the expansion of the <Col N="2375" /> return to the country as a whole.  Perhaps the training could be broadened and varied a little more and that the existing schemes could be developed still further.</P>
    <P>As I have said, in one area of the fishing industry there was not even one Irish boat in operation.  If we had an ocean-going fishing boat for training purposes it would be possible to broaden the training.  I suggest to the Minister that a joint industrial council for the industry be set up to cover conditions of employment.  There are many improvements that could be made in relation to rates of pay and conditions of employment.  If such a council were established it would be to the betterment of the conditions of all those employed in the industry.</P>
    <P>Mention has been made at length about the conditions of harbours and I have already mentioned the harbour in my own constituency.  According to the brief, considerable improvements are being carried out to the smaller harbours which are under the jurisdiction of the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries.  Of course, the major ports are the responsibility of the Department of Transport and Power. Although fishing is carried on from some of these ports, such as Wicklow town and Arklow, which also is under the aegis of the Department of Transport and Power, there is a need for a coming together of each of the Departments that have an interest in the fishing industry so that work can be done not only in the five major fishery harbours but so that improvements can be made to any harbour or any port that would warrant such improvements. I know that, in so far as some of the smaller ports are concerned where the work is done mainly by part-time fishermen, landing facilities are very poor.  I am aware that in one instance a group of fishermen in Wicklow town wrote to the Wicklow Harbour Board requesting them to provide a shelter for fishing gear and for the bedding of lines during the cod fishing season.  The board got in touch with the Department of Transport and Power who told them that the Department had no function in the matter and therefore, were not in a position to come to the aid of the <Col N="2376" /> fishermen.  They suggested that the fishermen should seek the help of Bord Fáilte or some such other body.  Having approached bodies like Bord Fáilte and An Bord Iascaigh Mhara they have found that there are not available any grants that would improve the lot of this type of fisherman.</P>
    <P>This is an aspect which the Parliamentary Secretary should consider.  It would not be too expensive if there was provided a shed or boathouse or any small shelter in which men could store their gear near to the harbours, whereas the building of their own sheds would cut deep into the budget of part-time fishermen.  On the other hand, if they were to receive a grant towards the cost I am sure they would not be slow to provide the balance themselves.</P>
    <P>The question of marketing has been mentioned also by the Parliamentary Secretary.  He referred to the efforts of Bord Iascaigh Mhara in this direction and we are given some details of what is being done in relation to advertising and public relations both on the home market and abroad.  In my view, harsh comment can be made in this regard. As we all know, the price of meat has increased to such an extent that it is possible for the average household to provide meat only on one or two days of the week.  The obvious substitute for meat in a country like ours is fish. However the price of fish at the moment is nothing short of a national scandal.  There is a great difference between the price one would pay for fish at a pier and the price that would be paid for it in the shops.  We have now reached the stage where fish is costing as much as some of the more expensive cuts of meat.</P>
    <P>Those of us who live in fishing ports or near fishing harbours are aware that at certain times of the year there is a glut of fish on the market and that fishermen have almost to give the fish away.  At other times fish is scarce and following market trends the price is much higher, but at no stage is there any great variation in the price of fish in the shops.  Those of us who have to eat in restaurants in the city know that a fish which may cost 1s. in the port of Arklow will appear on the menu of <Col N="2377" /> the restaurant in the Dáil or some other restaurant as part of a meal costing 6s., 10s. or even a little more.</P>
    <P>The price of fish never varies whether there is a large or a small quantity available.  This is because certain private people have large freezing establishments and they are able to buy fish at a very low price when glut conditions prevail, store it up and when a shortage comes they sell the fish and keep the ceiling price all the year around.  An Bord Iascaigh Mhara, the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries, the Prices Section of the Department of Industry and Commerce and even the Fair Trade Commission would be well employed investigating the price of fish and ensuring that fish is made available at a reasonable price, giving everybody from the fishermen who land the fish, the people who transport it from the quays, the wholesaler and the shopkeeper, a reasonable return.  This is not the case at the moment and there is certainly a need for investigation.</P>
    <P>There is another area of our imports which comes under the heading of marketing&mdash;fish and fish preparations &mdash;and it showed an increase in the past year of £125,000 or over 50 per cent on the 1968 figure.  No details have been given by the Parliamentary Secretary of what is included in these imports but I think this is the importation of the preparation known as fish fingers.  We could turn our attention to this and reduce this amount almost to nil.  We have the fresh fish available and we could easily have plant set up to process this fish, reduce our balance of payments by that amount and give worthwhile employment in that particular section.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary said when fishermen turn from one type of fishing to another, say from white fishing to herring fishing, we have to import this type of fish.  If we had proper plants the processing of this type of fish could go on when glut conditions prevail and fish would be available to consumers when there is a shortage.  There are people who never set foot on a trawler, who do not have to risk their lives or those of <Col N="2378" /> their friends, and who are making big money in this industry.</P>
    <P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a minimum of private investment in this industry and there is a great proportion of public money spent on it.  The outlets for the sale of fish to the consumer are very few indeed.  Quite a large proportion of the profits made in this industry go to people who do not risk their own lives or those of their employees in catching or landing fish. An investigation into the marketing of fish is called for and I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to consider this in the very near future.</P>
      <P>The amount spent on advertising on TV, radio and the like, is given as £30,000.  Does the Parliamentary Secretary consider this to be a fairly reasonable sum for this type of sales promotion?  Most Irish people have simply got out of the habit of taking fish with their meals.  They have taken it more or less as a penal food in the past. I hope that the advertising and other promotional activities of the Department and of An Bord Iascaigh Mhara will educate people to the fact that fish is a delicious and delicate food and one which can compare favourably with any other food on the menu.</P>
      <P>There is not sufficient advertising of fish, particularly on television.  For a number of years now we have been treated to a television advertisement which I saw on British television years before that.  I cannot understand why we cannot use our own locations for this purpose.  I hope that that advertisement with local accents dubbed in will not be shown again, because it annoys me to think we cannot produce an advertisement for the fishing industry in this country for our own national station.  No mention was made in the Parliamentary Secretary's brief of the protection of the industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I realise that, but it is such an important part of the industry that without protection we are going to have no industry.  I am not sure now whether I can continue this line of argument, but our proposed entry into the EEC has perhaps put off the day of purchasing the boats which were promised to replace the old corvettes. I shall leave it at that, but it would have been pertinent to this debate that some mention would have been made by the Parliamentary Secretary of the protection of the fishing industry.</P>
      <P>I hope I am in order in referring to the lifeboat service.  The people who man this service are mainly people connected with the fishing industry and they are to be complimented.  They have given their time voluntarily and, as far as I know, almost for nothing. Until recently the institution was run through voluntary subscription.  If we look at a map of Ireland we can see that most of the boats are located along the east and south coasts.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately last night there was a very sad accident in which the well-known fishing trawler, the <i>Glenmalure,</i> sank off the Wexford coast with the loss of one life.  In trying to rescue the man on that boat lifeboats from Waterford and Wexford were put to sea.  The work these boats do is vital to the continuation of <Col N="2380" /> the fishing industry, and if they are not available certainly some other form of protection will have to be given to fishermen around our coasts.  The point I wanted to make was that there are not enough boats along the Donegal, Kerry and Mayo coasts.  There are, I think, only three boats from Kerry to Donegal.  I wanted to ask the Parliamentary Secretary if some vessel could be introduced to do the work that is normally done by these boats.</P>
      <P>The shell-fishing industry is one that is expanding rapidly in recent years, and it is an area in which a vast expansion of exports can take place. Recent investigations have brought to light very rich beds of shellfish such as scallops and queen scallops, particularly along the east coast.  An Bord Iascaigh Mhara have used their experts and their boats to investigate the extent of these beds, and with the help of outside experts valuable finds have been made.  Recently a large bed of queen scallops was discovered near the Kish Bank, as a result of the investigations of An Bord Iascaigh Mhara with the help of one or two shell fishermen from the Isle of Man.  Because of the encouraging results there, a number of small shell fishing industries have been set up not only in Wicklow but also in Wexford and in Dublin at Dún Laoghaire and Skerries.</P>
      <P>A number of boats have taken part in this work.  They are fishing for scallops and queen scallops and are keeping supplies going to these small industries.  There was, unfortunately, a month ago a complete change over from the normal fishing of herring and white fish by the Howth and Dún Laoghaire boats to scallop fishing.  The result of this was to overfish this deposit at the Kish Bank.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As most of these boats are provided through the efforts of An Bord Iascaigh Mhara one would think this body would be able to give details of craft which can fish in a particular area. The fact that over 20 boats descended on this particular bed and fished there intensively, almost ruining the long-term possibility of a lucrative export, leads one to believe that when finds of this kind are made they should be protected by An Bord Iascaigh Mhara <Col N="2381" /> and the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries.  I understand the catches which resulted from the fishing of this bed were loaded into sacks and sent to Scotland for processing.  If these landings had been processed in this country their value could have been increased threefold.  I hope An Bord Iascaigh Mhara and the Department will protect the small shellfish industries which are being started along the east coast.</P>
    <P>A good deal of the Parliamentary Secretary's speech related to inland fishing and, while believing it is important to expand this area of the fishing industry, it is more important to expand sea fishing.  The number of pages in the Parliamentary Secretary's brief which dealt with pollution and conservation leads one to believe that more stress is being laid on inland fishing than on the sea fishing.</P>
    <P>My own feeling about the fishing of lakes and rivers is that these rivers and lakes should be the property of the community as a whole.  This is one area where nationalisation would be welcomed by every section of the community. In many cases the fishing rights of rivers and lakes are owned by people who come here once or twice a year with a few friends.  They have no interest in the long-term development of rivers and lakes and they spend very little of their money in this regard. Nationalisation involves large sums of money but I hope it will be possible to achieve this over a period of years. Considerable sums of public money have already been voted to improve river and lake fishing.  The public are entitled to a greater involvement in the ownership of rivers and lakes. There are areas where fishing potential has been abandoned by these landlords. I hope their interests will be brought to an end in the future by some form of nationalisation.</P>
    <P>Every country in the world is faced with pollution.  Many of the fishing stocks in our rivers have been affected by pollution in the past few years. It is only by the determined efforts of people in the Department and interested people outside it that we are getting to grips with the disease which almost wiped out salmon fishing and <Col N="2382" /> trout fishing.  I hope this work is completely successful.  It highlights the need for more vigilance in this direction.  All pollution ends up in the sea and the sea surrounding this country is becoming more polluted every year.</P>
    <P>Two great tragedies involving oil tankers occurred recently off the British coast.  These highlight the problems which we would have to face not only in relation to the fishing industry but in relation to the tourist industry if such a tragedy were to occur off our coast.  We have a large oil terminal and we must ensure that the tankers coming in and out of this terminal exercise care so that no damage will be done to our natural resources in the sea.</P>
    <P>An eminent sea explorer, Commander Cousteau, has said that pollution of the ocean has increased by 50 times since the beginning of the century, and deposits of lead are expanding at an alarming rate.  It is difficult for a small country such as ours to handle this problem but the dangers which could result to this country should be made known in every place in which we have an influence, be it the Council of Europe or the United Nations.</P>
    <P>I have left to the end of my speech our involvement with the EEC.  The previous speaker has remarked on the lack of concern shown by the Government for the fishing industry when they applied for membership of the EEC.  In a recent publication, which was distributed to all Deputies, on the implications for our agriculture and fisheries in the EEC, this statement was made.  I quote from pages 138 and 139 of this book entitled <i> Irish Agriculture and Fisheries in the EEC:</i></P>
    <P>If, as proposed by the Commission, fishing vessels of a member State were given equal conditions of access to, and exploitation of, fishing grounds situated within the exclusive fishery limits of another member State and were allowed to land direct into any port in the Community, serious problems could arise for Ireland's fisheries.  The valuable in-shore shell fisheries and the herring fisheries off the south-east coast and Donegal already attract European <Col N="2383" /> boats and, if all member States had full freedom to fish within the Irish fishery limits, not only would serious competition be created for Irish fishermen but stocks would be irreparably damaged.</P>
    <P>This book was distributed last April. It is alarming to find that only in September was anything said to the commissioners about the damage that could result from our entry into the EEC if we have to adopt the rules of the EEC.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;to fisheries has given rise to a good deal of anxiety. We may negotiate on our entry to the EEC, but we cannot negotiate on what has been already agreed by the commissioners. We must accept that as part of our entry.  This is one of the reasons the Norwegians were so strenuous in their condemnation of the EEC arriving at a Community policy on fisheries since they, the Norwegians, were not allowed any say in that policy. The position is that there is a deficit of 500,000 tons in fishing requirements for the year and for the countries negotiating entry there is a surplus of 700,000 tons.  If rules are drawn up by people who know they will have to buy large quantities of fish, and they exclude from the drawing up of these rules those people who will sell that fish to them, they obviously will not fall over backwards to please those who are coming in.  The treatment Irish industry has got from the French already should be a warning to us what to expect when we get into this Community.  In a short space of five years our territorial waters will be laid bare to foreign fishermen and five years is not enough time for us to gear ourselves to compete with the huge fleets operating from Denmark, France and other Community countries.</P>
      <P>Norway has the biggest fishing industry in Europe relative to its population. The Norwegians are afraid of what will happen to them when they go into the Community.  Surely a weak industry like ours should be even more fearful of what will happen to our industry when we go in?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is only right that we, on this side of the House, should voice our anxiety over the way the fishing industry has been treated in negotiations up to now. I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will be able very soon to let us see the document which, up to now, has been kept very much in the background. Like Deputy Begley, I tried to get a copy.  Unlike him, I did not go to the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries; I went to the Department of External Affairs because I understood it was the Minister for External Affairs who was dealing with our application <Col N="2385" /> and, therefore, it was in that Department one would come by this document. They were not able to give me the document.  I hope it will be made available very shortly.  I hope that the results of the negotiations on the fishing industry will be made known so that the anxieties of those involved in the industry here will be allayed.  Considering how worried the Norwegians are I am afraid equally we have cause for worry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure the Deputy, the House and the people concerned that we are giving serious consideration to our fishermen in our negotiations.  The matter is not being dealt with lightly, as the Deputy would seem to indicate. There are, of course, advantages as well as disadvantages for the industry within the EEC and we will have to weigh the advantages with the disadvantages.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>What about the secret document?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I realise there may be a market.  I realise that certain industries could be set up here, but the actual fishing industry itself will be jeopardised if the fishing fleets of the Common Market countries are allowed to fish right up to our coast. That is what is so worrying, not the fact that there may be an extended market.  The industry has not yet got properly on its feet.  It is not geared to competition from these large countries. We will be going in with the biggest people in the industry.  This is where concern lies.  I hope the Parliamentary Secretary is right when he says the negotiations will prove both fruitful and advantageous for the industry here.  We would, however, be neglecting our duty if we did not voice our apprehension.  I can assure the Parliamentary Secretary that I will be very anxious about the fishing industry until such time as he comes in here and shows what advantages there are and proves that our fishing industry can expand and prosper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary, like me, is new to the job.  I was asked to look after the fishery industry for the Labour Party; the Parliamentary Secretary <Col N="2386" /> has accepted responsibility for this industry.  I wish him every success in his job and I trust that, as a result of his energies and his activities, the anxieties we have voiced will be allayed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyOConnor" hpid="Mr. O'Connor Mr. O'Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose we must be thankful that even a small attempt is being made to provide more money for the fishing industry.  One cannot help viewing with great concern the inept approach adopted towards an industry that should rank with out tourist industry.  If our fishing industry was properly developed we should have landings of fish with an export value of £100 million.  This is approximately the figure that Norway, a country similar to ours, has achieved.  It would give employment to at least 100,000 people in areas along the seacoast where it is most urgently required.</P>
      <P>It is incomprehensible that during the years governments have done nothing to develop this industry.  Some years ago An Bord Iascaigh Mhara, which was in charge of development at the time, took the retrograde step of getting rid of processing factories and installations.  This certainly did not help our fishing industry and it is responsible for the state of the industry today.</P>
      <P>It is remarkable to reflect that the Faroe Islands, with a population of only a few thousand, have landings of fish ten times the value of landings in Ireland.  The people who have been in charge of our fishing industry during the years have done nothing to keep pace with developments in other countries. When I first came into this House I stated that the efforts of An Bord Iascaigh Mhara were not being projected towards the development of the industry, and I was determined that they would make some positive efforts to help our fishermen.  I made an attack on the whole structure of the industry early this year and subsequently a statement was issued which attacked the critics&mdash;I think it was mainly directed at me.  That statement said that they hoped to have fish landings worth £15 million in three or four years' time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One fails to see how this can be <Col N="2387" /> achieved at the present rate of development. The major part of fish landings at the moment comprises salmon and shellfish.  This sector has expanded to such an extent that there is little scope for improvement but, by removing the figures for salmon and shellfish from the statistics we have been given, we can see that our wet fish landings reached a figure of only £1,300,000.  I do not know how it will be possible to increase this figure to the amount of £7 million in two years.  We have not got the processing plants and we have not developed our marketing service.</P>
    <P>The demand for fish products in the EEC this year is supposed to be in the region of £200 million.  We have not directed our efforts towards getting a small portion of that market.  For instance, we are not making any effort to try to supply the fish that is needed in Brittany.  A comparison between the amount of £1,300,000 for wet fish and our imports of £2,500,000 shows how hopelessly we are behind in development of this industry.  Neither have we made any effort to supply our home market.</P>
    <P>It is disturbing when we take into account the fact that in Europe the market was much better two years ago. What is striking is the fact that in Norway there are some 28,000 small boats &mdash;not equipped with engines&mdash;which comprises the major part of their fishing fleet.  They have some 8,000 larger boats.  Landings from small boats are much more substantial but our entire efforts in this country are directed towards the provision of large engined boats.</P>
    <P>Some years ago I, too, was under the impression that the larger the boat the better opportunity there was of getting big landings.  A Dingle fisherman said to me:&ldquo;If you are correct in this, why do we want a navy to keep out the big boats?  If the fish are there the big boats will have to come in.&rdquo; There has been much talk about protection vessels to keep the foreigners away.  The position of Norway, with its fleet of small boats, indicates that this is a much more profitable operation. It was proved during the two world wars that very heavy landings <Col N="2388" /> of fish could be obtained by using small boats quite near the coast&mdash; this was particularly so in County Kerry.</P>
    <P>The development of small harbours and landing facilities should go side by side with the development of the fishing industry.  At the moment such facilities are lacking.  This is, indeed, deplorable.  I remember about five years ago in Dingle seeing heavy landings of whiting.  There were four heavily-laden CIE lorries with trailers taking up to 15 tons each to a fish-processing plant at Galway.  The fishermen had to sell their fish at 5s a box, each box containing five stone of fish.  The Government paid CIE charges to Galway.  This pinpoints the lack of storage facilities and processing plants at the point of landing.  We should have two major processing plants which would enable our fishing fleets to be developed.  This would benefit the people in Kerry and the nation.  We could have a fishing industry in Kerry worth many millions annually which would give employment to seven or eight thousand people along the sea coast.  This is within the bounds of reason if sufficient money was directed towards the industry.  It was probably not fair on my part to have hit so often at An Bord Iascaigh Mhara.  I suppose they were trying to manage with a limited amount of money.  They were the body set up to develop fishing and this is what they should be doing.</P>
    <P>I am not particularly worried about the protection service because I believe that if we had a large number of boats along our coast they would be sufficient deterrent to keep the foreigners away. They know the limited amount of fishing which we are doing and they know the fishing grounds.  I attended committee meetings in Europe and I noticed that the tendency of the different fishing fleets was to comes less often to Ireland because the amount of fish they were getting was decreasing in any case.  I believe that the more boats we have out the less likely it is that foreigners will come.  The Government should set up the necessary body to examine this question in detail and to invest large amounts of money, perhaps £3 million a year, to try to get <Col N="2389" /> the boats required and to develop our harbours.</P>
    <P>Fish processing and packaging must be developed.  The fish are near the coast and we have a chance to get them in quickly after being caught. We have favourable weather for most of the year which is very important. Norway has only four months fishing in actual fishing days, whereas we have the whole year available to us for fishing.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned these points often since I came into this House.  Fishing is a great industry and our young people should be alive to the advantages and opportunities.  We should have a training school somewhere between Kerry and Cork.  I have said this in the House many times.  I have been told about the school in Donegal.</P>
    <P>I have always said that An Bord Iascaigh Mhara should have sufficient repair depots and sufficient parts available to keep our fleet seaworthy.  I know of a man who was one-and-a-half years waiting for a replacement of his boat.  He had wanted to get his own boat repaired, but the board thought it was not suitable for repair and offered him another boat which was somewhere on the coast.  He examined that boat and was prepared to take it, but for some reason they found it was not suitable.  They are now having second thoughts about the repair of his own boat.  This kind of thing hampers our industry.  I can never understand why such things are allowed at departmental or board level.  It does not take much imagination to see the necessity of providing repair services when there is so much money invested in boats.  The boats should be hired out.  A person should have a boat on trial for two or three years.  If he is making a success of it he should be offered the boat, and an allowance should be given to him for sums paid in rental.  He should also get the grant.</P>
    <P>An Bord Iascaigh Mhara should arrange for the necessary repair depots which could keep the boats afloat.  I know of a man who got his boat repaired and had to have the repair job repeated several times.  A man had a boat engine repaired and before he got to Portmagee it broke down.  He found <Col N="2390" /> in the engine some of the swabs used for cleaning it.  That man had the boat for three years and it was more often in dock for repair than at sea. Eventually he gave up fishing but he had genuinely tried to make a good job of it because he was rearing a young family who were mostly boys and who could follow in his footsteps.  The efforts to repair the boat were hopeless.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quoting from the OECD Report, 1969.  I shall give the comparative landings in this country as against the landings of other comparable countries.  Our total landings in the period in question were 64,434 tons, value, £2,995,550.  The total landings of fish in Iceland was 1,119,000 tons, value, approximately £38 million. The total landings in the Faroe Islands was 173,780 tons, value, £12,890,000.  The total landings in Norway over the same period was 805,000 tons, value, one billion, 639 million kroner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Great Britain imported 718,000 tons at a value of approximately £46½ million. We are making very little effort to capture this market or even a sizeable fraction of it.  The total value of the fish requirements of the six Common Market countries is in the region of £200 million.  We have a great opportunity of getting a reasonable share of that market but it will require more positive thinking and more positive effort on our part.  A heavier induction of cash is required if we are to develop our fishing industry to the level at which we shall be able to get a reasonable share of that huge market. Fishing is an industry that should get much more Government attention and finance than it has so far got in this country.  This is particularly so in the light of Common Market membership. We have the manpower, the energy and the intelligence to get a major share of the EEC fish requirements which now run at a value of over £200 million.  Government action is needed in this respect to give hope to our young men who would be prepared to <Col N="2391" /> enter the fishing industry as a career. The Government must formulate a development programme and the cash must be provided for this potentially very profitable industry.  I think there is still plenty of money in this country and some of that money could be devoted to provide the financial aids which this industry requires.</P>
    <P>We need quick development along the Kerry coast so far as our fishing industry is concerned.  Two years ago, we asked for an examination of the pier at Cahirciveen.  We were promised that a grant would be forthcoming when the OPW carried out a survey including a boring survey.  A few days ago, I again inquired about the progress which had been made in this matter and I was informed that the position was still the same and would remain so until the boring survey was carried out.  If we are seriously facing up to the importance of this industry, I cannot understand why it should take two years to have a boring survey undertaken.  If the OPW could not do it surely some other service in the country could be availed of for this exploration work?  There are two or three new boats coming into Cahirciveen and this docking area, so necessary <Col N="2392" /> for their protection, will not be developed, at the present rate of progress, for a long time.</P>
    <P>We have a fish plant in Renard which has been up for sale for some considerable time.  This should not pass out of the hands of the fishing industry but the latest reports are that it is likely to be purchased by an industrialist.  I only hope these reports are inaccurate.  The man who erected the plant has passed on to his eternal reward.  The assets have to be realised. The plant passed into hands not directly concerned with the fishing industry.  For that reason, the plant is more or less lying idle.  This could be a very big asset if it were taken up again and developed.  BIM might consider taking it over and finding the necessary money to purchase it.  It was offered recently to the fishermen of the area, according to what I have been told, for £25,000.  That is not a very big price for a plant that cost about £120,000 to erect.  It would be a pity if it were not developed for the benefit of the fishing industry.</P>
