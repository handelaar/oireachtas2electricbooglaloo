    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if, having regard to the undesirability of continuing to use British Ministers as the sole means of conveying the views of the Government and the citizens of this State to the authorities in Northern Ireland and having regard to the need to increase understanding and promote direct contact between all Irishmen without regard to political or religious beliefs, he will appoint a person in Belfast, on either an offical or an informal basis, to represent the Government; and, if not, why.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be happy to consider any useful means of improving existing communications with the north, but I believe that the appointment of a resident agent in Belfast would not be appropriate in present circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach not agree that there is always the possibility of misunderstandings and perhaps misrepresentations arising whenever a third party is used for communications? Having regard to the desirability of restarting the constructive approaches made in recent times, would the Taoiseach not now endeavour to ensure acceptance of the idea of an agent in Belfast who could communicate with the Government and all sections of the people in view of the danger that communication with one section could be misunderstood by other sections?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="484" />
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I recognise there would be a danger of misunderstanding when one has to rely on third party communication.  As the Deputy is aware, we have available to us first-hand information but, as I said in my direct reply, I would not rule out at all the possibility of establishing some communications medium as has been suggested.  However, I think the Deputy will agree that the time is not now appropriate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach consider asking the third party&mdash;at the moment the British Government&mdash;to have this matter seriously and sympathetically considered?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would, but not now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach not consider an application to the United Nations for an observer to act in the capacity as suggested by Deputy Ryan?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The position in relation to the United Nations is that the host country, which is the official term, must agree in relation to observers or other persons representing the United Nations visiting the country in question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>In his recent contacts with the British Government, can the Taoiseach report any progress in his request that areas other than the traditional anti-Unionist areas should be disarmed?  Has the Taoiseach any information for the House suggesting that an arms check will be under way in other parts of Northern Ireland&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a separate question.  It does not arise on Question No. 1.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would reply but the Ceann Comhairle has ruled it out of order.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <P>On the general lines of the question, has the Taoiseach any indication to give to the House about any tripartite talks being held before the Summer is over?  Has he any information from the Tory Government&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if direct representations have been made to the British Government concerning the suggestion that a new militia force might be established in Northern Ireland; and if he will state the result of any such representations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>While I am satisfied that there was no serious intention to consider the creation of a new militia force in the north, I nevertheless had our views on the subject made known in London.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Taoiseach say if the representations also included the suggestion that the RUC might be rearmed and our objections to that course?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>

      <P>As I stated recently in reply to similar questions in regard to married women, a change in the practice of excluding married women from permanent appointments in nursing and other posts under local health authorities could involve a major policy decision, since the same practice in regard to the employment of married women is followed in appointments to every class of office throughout the local authority service.  This practice will no doubt come under the scrutiny of the Commission on the Status of Women <Col N="493" /> that the Government have just established.</P>
      <P>Married nurses who take these temporary appointments in local authority hospitals are performing a useful public service.  Local authorities have been authorised to grant them increments on the salary scale for their previous nursing experience.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that there is a grave shortage of candidates for permanent nursing posts and local authorities find that a number of unmarried nurses are not apparently anxious to take up permanent posts in one particular hospital?  Since there appears to be a considerable number of married nurses who would qualify for those posts, would the Minister not agree that he could relieve the situation by allowing married nurses to be appointed if they are qualified? would he not agree also that there is a big difference between nurses who are in short supply and other local authority employees who appear to be in fairly plentiful supply?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>We have already granted increments on salary scales for previous nursing experience of married temporary nurses.  This is a reasonable contribution towards a problem which I dealt with at great length in this House.  A general survey is being made by An Bord Altranais in connection with the whole nursing service of the county.  We must wait until after we have examined the result of the survey to see what the position is.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that a more valid comparison to draw would be with married teachers because when a shortage of teachers arose, it was found necessary to breach the long-standing tradition and to admit married women to teaching posts? Having regard to the real danger of a breakdown in the whole nursing service pending the report of the commission to which the Minister has referred, will be not now accede to the demand from local authorities all over the country for the admission, without discrimination as to marital status, of married nurses?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to the Deputy the shortage of nurses is in certain areas <Col N="494" /> and not all over the country.  Deputies who live in the Dublin area are aware of the shortage of nurses in relation to geriatric cases.  We will be dealing with that in the next question.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>You have to be good to do that; it was one supplementary question.  Would the Minister not be aware that I county districts a substantial number of vacancies exist which can only be filled by married nurses since unmarried nurses are not available?  Surely he is not telling the House that it is only in Dublin a shortage occurs and will he check with the health authorities and find out for himself?  If married nurses, for any reason, decide not to serve it means, as Deputy Ryan said, a complete breakdown of the hospital service.  It is ridiculous for the Minister to make the statement he has made.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I have examined the situation and, as I said, I would have to take the unusual step of asking for a change in the status of married nurses as compared with female employment in other branches of the public service. I am aware married teachers are employed.  If occasion should arise on which I would have to go to the Government in advance of the findings of the Commission on the Status of Women and tell the Government the position was really serious&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he will arrange to receive a deputation from the Dublin Health Authority to discuss solutions to overcrowding in St.  Ita's and St. Brendan's Hospital and also to discuss the SEN grade in the authority hospitals.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>On 19th June, I received a request from the Dublin Health Authority for the reception of a deputation concerning the provision of 100 new beds at St. Ita's, Portrane, to replace the existing units 8A and 8B and 150 new geriatric beds in the health authority's area.  On 16th March last, I had conveyed my views to the authority about the undesirability of developing very large centres for the mentally handicapped and suggested that the immediate and urgent problem at St. Ita's could be met by the transfer of geriatric patients who do not need the services of a mental hospital. A report furnished by the health authority on the 29th May about hospital requirements in the area did not deal specifically with the suggestion and the health authority were asked on 11th June to consider the matter further.  When a full report is received I will consider the question of receiving a deputation to discuss the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the grade of state enrolled nurse, I have dealt with the question of establishing such a grade in my replies to questions by Deputy Ryan on 7th May, 1969, and 5th May, 1970.  My Department has recently written to the Dublin Health Authority on this question and on the general question of nurse staffing position <Col N="496" /> in the authority's institutions.  I understand that, following receipt of this letter, officers of the health authority have had discussions with representatives of An Board Altranais and that certain proposals resulting from these discussions will shortly be submitted to my Department.  The question of discussions with officers of my Department or of my receiving a deputation from the health authority can be considered when these proposals have been received and examined.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Having regard to the disclosures of the rather appalling conditions in St. Ita's and the immense difficulties which have to be overcome&mdash; which, I think, the Minister recognises &mdash;in remedying the position there, would the Minister not endeavour to reduce the amount of correspondence and red tape by agreeing to meet a deputation at an early date when it might be possible to find a more expeditious solution than can be found by months and years of correspondence?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I have asked the officers of my Department to see, as soon as possible, the officers of the health authority on these proposals.  As the Deputy may know, they relate to the training of student nurses in geriatric institutions.  That will result in Dublin Health Authority being able to staff in a better way St.  Mary's Hospital and the geriatric unit in Blanchardstown. That, in turn, will relieve the situation and, if all goes well, it will then be possible to go ahead in St. Ita's.</P>

      <P>I had a conversation with the British Foreign Secretary in relation to the situation in the north.  I expressed the Government's views to him on current events and the Foreign Secretary fully understands the Government's concern.  There have been and continue to be regular communications, through diplomatic channels, between the two Governments.  It is not intended, at present, to raise the matter with the United Nations Organisation but our permanent representative to the United Nations is kept fully informed of the situation.</P>

That was one of the matters <Col N="498" /> the Minister discussed and I am asking him now if he will state the attitude of the British Government in the matter. Is the Minister aware that of some 50 members of the British Parliament I interviewed recently not one was in favour of these parades and can the Minister say why it is the British Government will not act in this matter?</P>

My meeting was to set out our views as Irish people of the effect of various events in the north and I think I did make it clear that the British Foreign Secretary intended to pass this information on.  At that time I was not in a position to seek from him assurances and neither was he in a position to give any assurances. I have further meetings arranged.  The position of our Government in relation to parades and other events in the north has been made quite clear to the British Government.</P>

I agree it has been a factor in recent events that people feel they may not be treated with the full sympathy required by their situation.  I have already publicly stated that it would be very desirable, and actually essential, that it be proved to the minority in the north now that what Deputy O'Leary suggests and what they fear is not true, that they should have the assurances quickly and fully that they will have all the reforms promised and all the protection necessary.</P>

I explained to him that the House, because of our long links with his country, had certain anxieties about the situation.  He told me that the supplies in the areas about which we had heard complaints are adequate and are being distributed and that the local States are being given the function of distributing from the Red Cross.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take together the two Private Notice Questions addressed to me.</P>
      <P>As I have already stated on a number of occasions I have made our views known to the British Government on the matters raised by Deputy Cosgrave.</P>
      <P>Yesterday at my request the Minister for External Affairs visited the Falls Road area of Belfast, the intention being to reduce tension in the area by demonstrating the Government's interest in the welfare of the people of the area and also to obtain confirmation, at first hand, of the information we had already received, and to ascertain the feelings of the people.  They had been forcibly dispossessed of weapons that they held for their defence.  I do not condone the unauthorized possession of arms by anyone but the people of the Falls area know that weapons, probably more up-to-date, and greater in quantity, are held by militant Unionists.  So far no effective action seems to have been taken to disarm them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was fear, there was apprehension amongst the people of the Falls.  They felt isolated.  People of the will turn almost anywhere for help.  It is vitally important that this fear be not exploited by subversive elements for their own ends.  If a situation developed in which such people would turn to <Col N="523" /> subversive elements there would be a very grave threat to peace and security not only of the people in the Falls but in the Six Counties as a whole and possibly in the rest of the country.</P>
    <P>Yesterday's visit was an initiative for peace and while it may have been devoid of diplomatic niceties it was undertaken in full accord with our policy of seeking a peaceful solution of the whole problem, and this policy has not changed.</P>
    <P>The Government have also arranged to inform the Heads of Mission of all countries represented here of the Government's views on the present situation in the north.  The Minister for External Affairs will visit London tomorrow for further conversations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>First, has an undertaking been given by the British Government that the disarming of elements in the North of Ireland would be an impartial disarming and that both sides who have arms would be disarmed without any discrimination?  Secondly, has the Taoiseach received any information as to whether parades are to be prohibited over the weekend?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No undertaking has been given by the British Government about further disarming.  We are continuing to press vigorously our views in this respect.  We have had no indication as to whether parades will be cancelled or curbed in any way.  As the Deputy is aware, the British Home Secretary is meeting this afternoon representatives of the Orange Order, who are responsible for holding these parades. It may be that no announcement will be made in advance of the meeting.  As I have just indicated, the Minister for External Affairs will be visiting London tomorrow and he will no doubt raise this question again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach not agree that in view of the changed situation there is a necessity for a debate on the Northern Ireland situation in this House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That does not arise from the Deputy's question. That particular point was debated here last week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="524" />
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>It must be appreciated that one's views and the views of this House cannot be adequately expressed in a manner such as this by way of question and answer.  It is for this reason that I repeat my query to the Taoiseach as to whether or not he will allow time for a debate at least before the adjournment, whenever that might be, particularly in view of the fact that both Stormont and Westminster have discussed the matter and will be discussing it further.  Does the Taoiseach not agree that other voices should be heard in this Parliament on the Northern situation?  The Taoiseach speaks for the Government and he has a responsibility but it does not necessarily follow that he speaks for the majority of the people.  In view of the deep interest and the deep feeling which there is amongst the people of the 26 Counties would he not concede that a debate is necessary in order to inform and guide public opinion in this part of the country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I very strongly and very sincerely counselled forbearance from insistence on a debate at this stage.  As I indicated last week, if circumstances change, especially if circumstances change after next week-end, then consideration could be given as to whether or not we should hold a debate.  I have instructed the Parliamentary Secretary to suggest to the Opposition that the Adjournment Debate, as often happens, might be on the Taoiseach's Estimate, when this matter could be raised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Last week when the Taoiseach rejected the suggestion of an all-party committee he undertook to keep the Opposition informed on the changing situation in the North of Ireland, but except from my friends in the Press, radio and television I have received no communication from the Government on the matter since.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That was a matter of only five days ago.  As the Deputy is aware, I have been kept fairly busy since.  I have no desire at all to with-hold information from leaders of the two Opposition parties.  Later on this week I shall ask them to come and see <Col N="525" /> me and we can have a discussion on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach has indicated to the House that it might be necessary to have a debate after next week.  In order that passions might not be inflamed if the situation were to get worse over the weekend, it would be a good thing for people in the 26-Counties if we could appear to show a united front and inform and guide public opinion, because the people are confused and bewildered.  Goodness only knows how they may react to the situation we all hope will not occur over the week-end.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We had a protracted and useful debate earlier on when the views of all parties were put forward, and, I think, put forward in an objective and representative way.  I do not think the views of the parties have changed in the meantime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach and all his Ministers, particularly the Minister for External Affairs, have recognised that the situation has changed somewhat. In my view it has changed by reason of the change of Government in Great Britain.  I do not expect the Taoiseach to comment on that, but it has changed dramatically.  The evidence of that is the visit of the Minister for External Affairs to the Falls Road yesterday and his reactions as expressed last night on television and on radio.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">

      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that, while he has not closed the door on a debate, he has suggested in his first reply that there may be reactions in the south arising from events in the north?  Does the Taoiseach agree that the situation warrants a debate and that by being completely dogmatic in refusing to have a debate it amounts to a vote of no confidence in the competence of this House to discuss the issue at this time?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not suggesting that at all.

I sincerely believe that, especially next weekend with 12th and 13th July coming up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>One final question: is it not ludicrous that today the British Parliament are discussing the affairs of the North?  We have a far greater interest in the people in the Six Counties than the people of Great Britain.  Stormont is also discussing them today but they have a vital interest also.  They discussed it last week and I am sure it will come up in Stormont this week&mdash;&mdash;</P>

May I, again, say, with respect to the Taoiseach, that he represents a certain number of people in this country&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>When the debate was adjourned, I was dealing with the question of national sovereignty.  It was a problem to which other speakers had adverted and some of them were rather perturbed at the necessary abatement of our national sovereignty which would arise if we entered the EEC.  At the same time, I dealt with the type of national sovereignty we had and I traced chronologically the events which led up to the establishment of our 26 County administration pointing out, in passing, that in 1922 the British Parliament passed the Ireland Act which provided for two national Parliaments here and that was in direct contradiction of the spirit of the 1914 Home Rule Bill which was passed in the House of Commons and set aside on the same day by a Deferment Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also mentioned that following the 1920 Act the Stormont Parliament was opened by King George V in the summer of 1921.  Following his speech on that occasion the Truce was declared and negotiations began in October and the Treaty was signed in 1921 providing for the right of the Northern Parliament under section 12 to opt out within 12 months.  This right they subsequently exercised a year later when the Treaty was ratified by the Irish people.  They exercised their option to <Col N="531" /> get out within two days and apparently they have not changed their minds very much <i>vis-à-vis</i> the Administration here since then.</P>
    <P>We had a protected economy as regards trade, particularly in the earlier years of the State.  All during the war there was a sellers' market and it is only in recent times the crunch is being felt by our exporters.  That is becoming apparent now in a disimproving trading position.  Exports to Britain, for instance, have begun to fall from being three-quarters to about two-thirds and our imports from the same country have increased.  This has placed us in an increasingly difficult position, because it is necessary to try to balance our trade figures by invisible exports.</P>
    <P>Britain is in the same position as we are, having a traditional trading balance, but Britain, as the centre of the sterling area, has a big money market, is still a world power and has been a great empire.  It will be readily understood that Britain in the sphere of invisible exports would be in a different position from a country like this.  We have so far been unable to have anything like a money market, and our stock exchange is nothing more than a provincial stock exchange in any big town in Britain.</P>
    <P>All told, therefore, we must be careful as regards our exports.  There used to be a notion here that if the imbalance became any more than £100 million, we were moving into deep water.  Of course, that is a relative figure and must be correlated with both imports and exports.  However, it is a serious position.  In 1967 our trade imbalance was something over £100 million, in 1968 over £150 million and in 1969 over £200 million&mdash;in other words, a figure which has doubled in a couple of years is getting into the realms of being very serious.</P>
    <P>There are other disquesting features, too.  As regards the British market there has never been the possibility of equal competition.  Our farming community have been compelled since the foundation of the State to export their agricultural produce into what is virtually a world food dump.  The price they got was regulated by world prices and how <Col N="532" /> cheaply Britain could buy from anywhere else.  At the same time, Britain pursued a policy of producing cheap food for her people and subsidising her own farmers.  That enabled her to be a powerful nation industrially.  By being able to provide cheap food she was more competitive in the industrial sphere.  She imported about half her food from the four corners of the earth. Ireland had to complete with that and it has always been a difficult problem for the Irish farmer.  It was a market over which we never had and never will have any control.</P>
    <P>The Common Market provides us with an opportunity; some would call it a challenge; perhaps one could also call it Hobson's choice.  I do not think we have much opportunity of remaining outside the world of free trade as a small, protected island.  Other countries tried that back in the 30s.  In Britain, which has an economy completely different from ours, there was a movement in this direction, and the late Lord Beaverbrook spent half his life campaigning for what he called splendid isolation on the part of Britain.  He used the entire resources of his chain of newspapers to propagate the idea, but Britain never accepted the notion of splendid isolation.  If Britain could not do it I do not know how we could do it.  Possibly we could live at a very low subsistence level by putting a wall around the country and cutting ourselves off from everyone else.  We would put ourselves completely outside the stream of civilisation and our standard of living would become extremely low.  We would not starve but the other amenities of life would be sadly missing if we tried to remain outside the European trading bloc.</P>
    <P>If we enter the Common Market it will be the first occasion on which we shall be able to export on equal terms to a population of 250 million people. We have never enjoyed that before.  We got some concessions&mdash;and they were always regarded as concessions&mdash;from Britain.  Following the Dillon agreement, the price of our cattle was tied to the price of cattle in Britain, and that kept our store trade alive.  The fact that this country was free of foot-and-mouth disease also helped.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="533" /> Some of our agricultural products will benefit greatly in the Common Market.  This is a country with a temperate climate, pretty good grass, moderate, perhaps, sometimes more than moderate, rainfall, and it is possible to winter our cattle more cheaply than in Scandinavian countries like Denmark. Ireland has that advantage.  The health of our cattle has always been very good and the country has always been free of foot-and-mouth disease. We have virtually eradicated TB and brucellosis is being tackled.  We have made a mess of the warble fly business but further efforts will be made again now.  By and large, therefore, from the point of view of cattle health, we are in a pretty good position as a result of the work done and the considerable expenditure incurred down through the years.  Our transport circumstances may not be as good as they are in other countries.  This country has not the same access to the Common Market countries as the smaller European countries would have, but it is generally accepted that even after entry most of our exports will still be to Great Britain.</P>
    <P>One of the difficulties here particularly in recent years has been the question of dairy products.  It may be, indeed, that we have not been very businesslike in the past in that respect. Bord Bainne, however, have done an excellent job.  We are fighting a world glut in regard to butter because storage of butter on the Continent amounts to 100 million tons, which is a serious obstacle.  In our own community over the past decade our creamery intake has doubled to 500 million gallons and our dairy products have quadrupled.  In addition we have a cow population now of 1.6 million. Shortly we will be in the position that we will be utilising 200 million gallons for home consumption and 300 million gallons for export.  Our problem is to find an export market for that amount.  We had a basic butter quota in 1965 of 23,000 tons which was raised subsequently to 26,000 tons.  At one time the quota was only 18,000 tons.  At present Irish butter, particularly the &ldquo;Kerrygold&rdquo; brand, is very well received on the British market and <Col N="534" /> we could sell much more if we could get a higher quota.  The United Kingdom stocks are falling.  Irish Cheddar cheese has achieved quite a good reputation in Britain and is now commanding better prices than either the Australian or New Zealand product. This is a position we thought we could never achieve a few years ago and much credit must go to Bord Bainne for it.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, we must recognise that we are exporting a lot of our products at give-away prices.  At the moment we are exporting butter to 50 different countries and while we may be exporting it to the British market, which is one of the best markets, at 3s a lb we are selling it at a loss to places like Algiers and Morocco at 9d a lb.  One asks oneself if there is any possibility of improving that position in the Common Market.  Our butter quota has been advanced for 1970-71 to 30,000 tons and our quota for Cheddar cheese is 17,500 tons.  Here again we could sell more except for the fact that a gentleman's agreement has been sought and we have been asked to impose a voluntary restraint on our cheese exports.  The quota system, of course, and this voluntary restraint, would disappear under EEC arrangements because all quota systems would go.</P>
    <P>One also hopes, and indeed the general prognostications are, that the price of butter will improve on our entry into the Common Market. Ireland, of course, unlike the present position, would be open to imports from any other member country.  Indeed, if countries such as Denmark wanted to send in butter here they could do it under EEC conditions, whereas they cannot do so at present. The price of oats to farmers and particularly for the production of dairy products makes quite a demand on our economy.  In so far as exports go, about two-thirds of the money comes from Government sources and about one-third is levied on the farmers.  This whole question is tied up not alone with development and production trends in the future but also with the negotiating position which will obtain when Britain goes into the Common Market, as I presume she will.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="535" /> Britain imports a considerable amount of agricultural produce from the Commonwealth.  For instance, Australia and New Zealand export 250,000 tons of butter to the United Kingdom where the total consumption is 450,000 tons.  That, compared with our miserable 30,000 tons, is a massive figure.  It becomes incomprehensible when one considers that there is not that great difference in visible trade. Our purchases of food stuffs from Britain exceed those of New Zealand from Britain.  Such is the state of affairs that New Zealand and Australia have that large share of the British market and our share, is comparatively small.  We should have a much larger share of the British butter market if the position were to be fairer, if it was a question of give and take based on the value of our imports from Britain.</P>
    <P>The advance in the position of Irish cheese in Britain and its improved reputation largely derives from a grading system introduced by Bord Bainne.  Deputies will recall that some years ago when we were exporting butter from perhaps 150 different sources, when each creamery did its own exporting, the butter got as far as the quayside at Birkenhead where it was dumped and goodness knows what it was sold for.  It was a very unsophisticated approach to marketing.  It is amazing that only in the past six years have we moved towards standardised production and tried to maintain a standard.  We hear a lot about the Mansholt Plan but if we are competitive, despite the glut of dairy products on the world market, there is still room for the good product.  I have visited many milking sheds and have found an amazing difference between one farmer's shed and another.  In one farmer's shed you will find a few cows being milked by hand, under quite unhygienic conditions, while in another, as was the case in one which I visited recently, you will find self-washing, self-sterilising milking machines from which the milk is taken straight to refrigeration conditions and untouched by hand.  The outfit cost £1,000.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that that is an indication of the future.  We may argue <Col N="536" /> about whether the Mansholt Plan is socially desirable or not, but the inevitable trend of events would seem to show that if we are to produce high-quality milk&mdash;and milk is a necessary biological product of our cattle trade&mdash; we will have to have farming units of sufficient size to make that type of equipment a worthwhile investment. This trend has manifested itself as a normal evolutionary process in the USA and in Great Britain where approximately five per cent of the population are producing all the food necessary for those countries.  According to the views of those who have studied this matter, there would appear to be self-sufficiency of dairy products in the EEC countries over the next decade, but the advent of the four new applicants may alter the position.</P>
    <P>The behaviour of the EEC countries is important.  At present they are attempting to reduce the production of milk by their cow slaughter scheme and other measures, and they are attempting to reduce the amount of land being farmed.  I do not know what the position will be as regards the negotiations which Britain will undertake in the Commonwealth <i>vis-à-vis</i> New Zealand and Australia.  It is important from our point of view to know whether Britain will insist dogmatically on New Zealand and Australia being treated as if they were members of the EEC. France did that with regard to her African colonies and the sugar imports. Britain may insist on similar arrangements or may settle for a phasing-out process.  I doubt if Britain will just drop the imports from her colonies overnight. There may be a transitional phase.  There may be some hard bargaining. Britain naturally will be expected to try to defend her position as a big importer of Australian and New Zealand agricultural produce, particularly butter and lamb.</P>
    <P>The problem is one which only the future will unfold.  The position will become clear only over the next few years as negotiations proceed.  Deputy O'Donovan maintained here that Britain would not go into the Common Britain's third attempt to enter the Common Market.  Britain's negotiaMarket on this occasion.  This is <Col N="537" /> Britain exceed those of New Zealand question of a common agricultural policy.  Britain wanted to preserve her traditional position of providing cheap food for her people in order to strengthen her industrial arm.  If Britain could feed the people cheaper she would have to pay them less. Britain did not want to meet the higher cost of agricultural produce which obtained in the Common Market.  Since that time the position has altered.  Exports have moved away very drastically from the sterling area.  There is much export trade with European countries. That trend in trade is not lost on the British who have always been a nation of shopkeepers.  I do not know what the Australian trade figures are but in recent years people have said that Australian trade has veered towards Japan and other Asiatic countries.  This is something which one might expect. In so far as Japan is concerned, we have attempted to get a toe-hold in the cheese market.  It would be excellent if we could do so.  There are various by-products of milk which are on a very competitive market.  I am interested in a chocolate crumb factory which is situated outside Carrick-on-Suir. Chocolate crumb is sold in a competitive market.  That factory has a considerable amount of equity in the hands of a British combine.  That helps, because the combine have a large world market and are in a position to secure sale of the product.  If the factory was not so structured financially it might not be easy to obtain such markets for the product.  While the outlook at the present time as regards dairy products is a bit gloomy, I feel that if we are absolutely insistent on producing a high-class product, in the long term the outlook will be good.</P>
    <P>The general impression as regards beef is that the outlook for the production of beef is good and that we have an expanding market which we could profitably harness.  We have many advantages.  Our cattle population is relatively free from disease and is much better than that of other countries.  We have good natural feeding for the cattle and the necessary type of rainfall to give us the grass to produce cattle at a reasonable price.  Perhaps <Col N="538" /> some intensive methods of cattle production may evolve but on the whole the opportunities for the beef trade should be good.  The pattern of our exports may alter: the store trade, as we know it, may give way to carcase meat and boneless meat, particularly in view of modern forms of transport which are more tailored to the export of dead meat than to the export of live cattle.</P>
    <P>In 1968 we exported cattle to the value of £47 million and revenue from beef was £38.5 million.  It appears our store cattle trade is declining but I do not know if alternative markets are available on the Continent.  We have about 5,500,000 cattle in this country and it is probable that, given an attractive market, we could double that number.  I have heard it contended frequently that we are merely scratching the surface of agricultural production here and if we were given a proper pricing arrangement and sufficient incentives we could develop it much more extensively.</P>
    <P>As the continental market now operates, it is very precarious from our point of view.  We have not exported any beef to the Continent since 1961 and if we try to get into that market it does not matter what price we quote because an adjustable levy is raised against us which effectively prevents our entering the market.  It is only in cases where there is a special demand that we have been able to secure any worthwhile sale of cattle.  In view of our declining trade with Britain it is imperative that we seek markets elsewhere.</P>
    <P>Politicians have always said to whatever Government were in power that we should seek such alternative markets.  The first Government tried to do so but could not.  When Fianna Fáil came into power they were convinced that they would get those alternative markets but they encountered the same difficulties.  The hard facts of trade were there and no Government have succeeded in securing such markets except at give-away prices.  We have been forced to acknowledge during the years that Britain has remained our greatest market and, while it may be an unsatisfactory one, nevertheless it is still a market for our agricultural <Col N="539" /> produce.  We have been unable to sell beef on the continental market and the same position will probably obtain in the future for as long as we remain outside the Common Market. This is an opportunity we should not lightly set aside and here is one area in which we can, and will be, pre-eminent.</P>
    <P>Apart from securing an increased market for our beef exports, we will be able to obtain higher prices.  Any forecast about prices is a hazardous exercise as many imponderables come into operation.  Some people say we will probably get a 50 per cent higher price for beef in the Common Market than we would obtain at the present time.  Such a percentage would be a tremendous improvement and whether we export it to the EEC countries or to Britain is immaterial as the British consumer will have to pay an increased price for food.</P>
    <P>In this country our processing plants for agricultural produce are reasonably good.  The purchase by the Cork Marts of a large processing plant and their recent purchase of the Swift Distribution Group have set the cattle trade on the right lines and this will be of great benefit to our farmers.  In 1968 we exported more than one million cattle, comprising 315,000 carcase beef, 592,000 stores, the balance being frozen beef.</P>
    <P>It is impossible to say with any degree of finality how this form of export will phase-out during the years ahead but it is probable that the store cattle trade will decline sharply.  This is a traditional kind of trade and will probably resist being wiped out in a short period, but if consumer tastes change to boneless meat and if transport conditions make it more difficult to export cattle there may be a move-away from the store cattle trade.  One of the great attractions of this trade from the British point of view is that we are free of foot and mouth disease whereas continental trading does not have that advantage.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the future of our cattle trade lies as it always did in Britain, to an increasing extent in Europe and perhaps in the United States, but I do <Col N="540" /> not think it lies in the underdeveloped countries.  Again, the position here is one of economics.  The underdeveloped countries are not able to pay for protein foods and, in particular, such expensive protein food as high-grade beef.  I cannot see much future for agriculture and, in particular, for the cattle trade in any of these underdeveloped countries.</P>
    <P>Of course, as far as our agriculture is concerned, the trend of the past few years will continue.  Not very long ago 35 per cent of our people were engaged in agriculture but the figure has now fallen to about 29 per cent.  However, if we join the Common Market we shall be the country with the largest percentage of people engaged in agriculture of any of the ten.  Italy would be the next highest with 25 per cent. At any rate, almost one-third of our people are still engaged in agriculture.</P>
    <P>Certain changes are taking place within the Common Market in the sphere of agriculture.  I have already mentioned the Mansholt Plan.  These changes have happened as a result of steady evolution in other countries, particularly Britain and America. Mansholt suggested that by a planned or a phased system, the 10 million farmers in the EEC countries should be reduced to five million by 1980. Immediately, the social implications and social difficulties of such a plan come to mind.  One can imagine how unwelcome a politician would be if he were to stand on a public platform and say that half the farmers in this country should be put off the land.  That was Mansholt's original idea.  The plan has been considerably watered down since then but it is still regarded basically as something that should be aimed at.  Further to that development, it is proposed that some land be put out of agricultural production and used as tourist countryside or for afforestation. Such a suggestion seems almost sacriligious to us who have been talking down through the years about the millions of acres of land which Mr. Dillon, while he was Minister for Agriculture, brought back into production by his reclamation schemes and projects.</P>

      <Col N="541" /> Another scheme that may seem strange to an Irishman is the cow-slaughter scheme recently introduced on the Continent.  We have had some experience of this sort of scheme ourselves in that we had a calf-slaughter scheme here but this was under different circumstances.</P>
    <P>The cow-slaughter scheme that has been introduced on the Continent is intended to reduce the cow population. This has been found necessary because of a glut of milk and butter in continental countries.  In those countries there is movement towards the evolution of production units.  Mansholt has spoken about the larger units being economically more viable.  Basically, one cannot say anything against the Mansholt ideas or against any other ideas of that kind.  The only objection that a public representative or a politician might have to these ideas is the social one.  Because of traditional social obligations, none of us would wish to put people off the land.  Schemes on a very elaborate scale have been put into operation on the Continent for the retraining and rehabilitation of persons who are put off the land.  We have something less elaborate but on the same lines in that the Land Commission are empowered to make pension arrangements for those who give up land and who wish to retire.  This is a matter which we must take into consideration in relation to our circumstances if we join the Common Market.</P>
    <P>I would like to say a few words about our exports of sheep and in this regard I may be entitled to be a little critical.  In so far as sheep and mutton exports are concerned there is a potential rather than an established market. Mutton is not consumed to any great extent on the Continent.  In Germany, it is likely that <i>schweinefleisch</i> will be served on most occasions one sits down to eat.  One will not get mutton.  The French consume a little more mutton than the Germans or Italians but still much less than is consumed in these islands.  If we are to develop a market for mutton it will be necessary to do a great deal of advertising but this would be worthwhile as there is tremendous potential.  Continental farmers do not breed sheep.  We have had a small trade <Col N="542" /> with France at different times but it has been sporadic.  There is tremendous potential here by virtue of the fact that this is a type of activity in which continentals have not indulged.  Unfortunately, we have neglected the sheep industry.  Our sheep population has fallen from 5,000,000 in 1965 to 4,000,000 now.  According to one of the programmes on economic expansion it was estimated that we would have 8,000,000 or 9,000,000 sheep by now.  We have given nothing like the attention to sheep that we have to beef and to horses.  The sheep population in Germany is something like 9,000,000 head.  It would be worthwhile to do some research into sheep breeding with a view to producing a better product.</P>
    <P>There is one small question mark. We have a modest subsidy scheme for mountain sheep.  I do not know if subsidisation would be permissible in the Common Market but, from the point of view of regional development, there is provision which would entitle us to subsidise the industry; on a regional basis since it could be argued that this is an industry peculiarly suitable to development along the western sea-board. There is a potential market and the industry could be developed with a little bit of imagination and drive.  It might prove a better money spinner than beef.</P>
    <P>Some people are nervous about the Common Market.  I think they are frightened largely because of what happened under the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement.  That agreement has not worked to our satisfaction. Britain took unilateral action when it suited her.  She was quite prepared to make difficulties not alone for our exports but also in relation to British investment here.  The Common Market concept is totally different from that of the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement.  There is a common customs barrier.  In the case of the agreement each country had its own customs barrier, be it green or red. There was supposed to be liberalisation of trading between the two countries but the liberalisation did not work in our favour.</P>
    <P>Agriculture is protected here but we have always been free to export industrial <Col N="543" /> products to Britain, with the exception of manmade fibres.  Britain has not been free to send in agricultural produce here.  Before ever the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement evolved we had been reducing our customs barriers.  I think by 1st July this year they were down to 16 per cent.  From now on the pressure will be really felt.  That is why I have adverted to the position of our exports and the large trade gap.</P>
    <P>The Common Market envisages the free movement of men, money and materials.  As between ourselves and Britain, there is free movement of men and money but there is no such free movement of material.  The Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement is terminable.  The Common Market concept is not terminable.  The approach is politically orientated.  The ultimate object is to form a political union, whereas no political overtones were associated with the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement.  We have been somewhat shaken in our confidence by steps that have been taken against us under the latter but, as I have said, the concepts are fundamentally different.</P>
    <P>We export sugar.  The sugar industry is more complicated than other industries. I do not know what the outcome may be but the industry is important to us because large numbers are employed in our sugar factories and a great many farmers are engaged in the production of beet.  For them it is a cash crop.  The average small farmer is dependent to a great extent on the creamery cheque coming in the May or June.  He has a few good months during the year.  In the autumn he sells off his yearlings or any dry stock he has.  There is very little to be got from those farms in the winter.  Many of them are unsuitable for the production of wheat and even some of them are not good for the production of barley. Beet has been a cash crop and a source of ready money for a number of farmers so that the position of the sugar industry is, to my mind, a bit dubious.  I say that because France has already insisted on and secured that her colonies, who are producers of <Col N="544" /> sugar-cane, be treated as members of the Common Market.  Britain, if she insists, could obtain similar consideration for the Commonwealth countries from where she traditionally imports her raw sugar.  If during the negotiations she insists upon getting similar consideration to that given to France it will create a difficulty for our sugar industry.</P>
    <P>This matter requires comprehensive study.  I do not know what attention has been given to it.  Doubtless the sugar companies have gone into the matter fairly completely.  The position at the moment is that our farmers are getting a higher price for their raw beet delivered to the factories than the Continental farmers are but the sugar produced in our factories is cheaper than that produced in Continental countries.  That is something to be thankful for.  It would appear that in one field at least we are more efficient than the Continentals.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to reach conclusions on this matter.  The present position is that six member countries have overproduction of sugar.  When it becomes a ten-member unit it is stated that there will be a deficit of two million tons per year.  That deficit arises largely from Commonwealth imports to the United Kingdom under the Commonwealth Sugar Agreement, which is terminable in a few years time.  The amount of beet on the Continent is controlled.  There is a price up to a certain level, after which the price is lower.  Above that all sugar produced must be exported.  There is no subsidisation. There is a three-tier price system obtaining as regards sugar on the Continent but it is a market which would seem to me to have a doubtful future, taking into consideration the concessions given to France.  If Britain demands and insists on like concessions for her best providers of sugar, then I feel the outlook here could be more problematic.</P>
    <P>I have little to say about cereals. The Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries stated that the view of his Department was that there would be a move towards coarse grain, towards barley and oats and that the outlook <Col N="545" /> for wheat would probably be more problematic.</P>
    <P>World conditions would probably affect both wheat and rice.  There are the huge granaries of Canada and America.  In addition, there has been a tremendous upsurge in the production of wheat in Mexico brought about by the development of special breeds of seed.  There has also been a tremendous upsurge in rice in the Philippines, again through research largely carried out by the Rockefeller Foundation.  Rice production in India has increased tremendously as a result of research.  All these are factors which may have an impact in the future.  The matter is so complex and involved that I do not think anybody could reasonably try to read into the future.</P>
    <P>Agriculture is the first sector in which a common policy is financed through a central budget which now reaches 1.7 billion dollars.  It is interesting to note that while agricultural production has increased considerably in the Common Market over the last decade American imports into the Common Market have steadily increased also.  This has occurred despite the failure of the United States of America and other countries to extend the Kennedy round negotiations in agriculture to any material degree.  I do not know whether they will succeed in doing that in the future.  I doubt it because Europe insists on other countries which want those concessions putting their own house in order and raising their agricultural home prices to a more realistic figure to bring them more into conformity with conditions obtaining on the Continent.</P>
    <P>Since 1967 a single market stage has been evolved for beef, pigs, dairy produce, poultry, eggs and rice.  The EEC target prices have remained unchanged for the past three years but they are higher in terms of sterling because of depreciation in the exchange rate.  As each product has been communised&mdash; a Community problem&mdash;the cost of supporting prices by market intervention and export subsidies has been transferred from the individual Exchequers to the Community as a whole.  As a consequence, the Community expenditure <Col N="546" /> has mounted rapidly because (1) of greater Community coverage and (2) greater Community production.  Both occurred.  It was not to be unexpected that, as prices were made more attractive, production increased.  This increases the difficulty that anyone trying to foresee the future in respect of markets here has to contend with. There are so many inter-related and imponderable things to be considered that one would well-nigh have to have the gift of prophecy to be able to fore-tell what the trend will be in some aspects of this problem.</P>
    <P>We have been told in one of the Government papers that entry into the EEC would relieve us of some of the support we have to give from the Exchequer to the farming community. In the last Budget, £90 million was the figure for various aids to agriculture.  It was suggested that particular aids to agriculture would be reduced by £38 million but, as a counter to that, we would have an expenditure of £19 million that we would have to pay to the Community funds.  I do not know how that has been calculated but it is a figure that will not remain at £19 million because, since the beginning, it has been an expanding figure.</P>
    <P>Various methods of financing this Community fund have been devised over the past few years but they have finally been settled.  According to the British White Paper, from 1975 onwards all levies and customs duties will be handed over, less 10 per cent to cover collection costs and, instead of budgetary contributions, the balance will be met from contributions from Member States, at the most, of 1 per cent of added value tax.  This raises, of course, the very difficult and rather complex problem of taxation and how it will evolve under EEC conditions.  I understand from the Minister's speeches that they accept that we shall have to use the added value tax and that our own system of taxation&mdash;turnover tax, wholesale tax and retail tax&mdash;is readily adaptable and can easily be turned into an added value tax.</P>
    <P>The policy to hold agricultural prices at a fixed high level, which has been the kernel of the thinking in the Common Market, has meant that production <Col N="547" /> has increased and wheat, sugar, cheese and butter production has moved from a position of deficiency in the 1960s to one of surplus in the 1970s.  This trend has culminated in all the measures I have already mentioned to cut down agricultural production under the Mansholt Plan.  I need not reiterate those points.  However, it shows that here we have a market of opportunity.  We also have a market of great potential for competition.  It is not a feather-bed job.  This will be a highly competitive exercise.  Unless our people have that ability, grit and determination&mdash;we are, I think, inclined to be a lazy race&mdash;unless we improve our thinking in that respect, we are entering into an era of competition where there are great opportunities to advance and equally great opportunities to go to the wall.</P>
    <P>In general, therefore, it would appear that, as regards our future position here, there will be a considerable change in food prices for both producer and consumer.  The producer will get more for his product: the consumer will pay more.  Of course, that has been the rub; that has been the difficulty all along the line.  Our friends across the water could never face up to the idea of the British housewife having to pay 7s per pound of beef when she could get it for 3s, or of paying a higher price for her butter than that at which she can get it somewhere else.</P>
    <P>There are many other difficulties that one cannot foresee.  Despite the fact that production has increased in the Common Market over the past decade as a result of higher prices, it may be that production will deliberately and artificially be curtailed in the future as is occurring at the present time.  No one knows how long that will continue but the present tendency is to curtail agricultural production. The Common Market is not a closed community.  Despite the fact that there is a common tariff wall and an adjustable levy, it is still not a closed Community and the Community itself can make and has made trade agreements with many other countries.  Some of them are to the satisfaction of the countries and some are not.  I think they <Col N="548" /> made trade agreements with Greece and that they are in the process of making one with Spain.  They are quite free at any time to enter into new trade agreements in general or as regards a particular sector of the economy or as regards a specific commodity.</P>
    <P>We do not know what the position will be and&mdash;a very important matter to us&mdash;we do not know what the ultimate position will be as regards the British Commonwealth&mdash;the position of New Zealand lamb, New Zealand agricultural exports, New Zealand butter; we do not know what the position will be as regards sugar from parts of the British Commonwealth.</P>
    <P>Finally, we do not know what the level of the contribution to the agricultural fund will be.  It has not been spelled out exactly how the figure of £19 million was arrived at.  I do not know how that computation was made but I would hazard a guess that that is the opening gambit and that, with the passage of the years and the expansion of the Community, that contribution will be considerably upgraded.</P>
    <P>By and large at present it would appear that whatever contribution we may be called upon to make to the Community fund will be more than balanced by the savings which we will secure on the question of subsidisation of agriculture.  This has been an increasing burden on us&mdash;trying to subsidise agriculture and to sell our products sometimes in very unprofitable markets.  What we do not realise is that Britain is subsidising her farmers to a very substantial degree.  Down through the years, Britain being our only market, we have been forced to subsidise our farmers to enable them to sell on the British market, simply because Britain has subsidised her own farmers heavily.  I should like the Minister to tell us how this figure of £19 million was arrived at.  The Government's White Paper does not give any estimate of the levies, or customs duty, or value added tax, on which this computation was based.  It is on figures like that that such a computation of such an estimate must be made.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of the <Col N="549" /> Common Market which is of some agricultural interest, that is, the question of regional development.  One of the main aims in the Treaty of Rome is the development of backward regions in the Community.  I must admit that, as far as I know, as yet no common regional policy has been developed. Regional planning and development remains almost entirely in the hands of national Governments.  All countries have problems of regional development. We are not the only country with a problem like the problem of the west of Ireland.  Italy has her problem in south Italy.  There is a problem in the south-western part of France.  Holland has the problem of her northern region. Even West Germany has got a regional frontier.  These are problem areas in those countries just as we have problem areas chiefly on the western seaboard.</P>
    <P>A European investment bank was set up under the Rome Treaty with a capital of one million dollars to aid these backward areas and since the EEC came into operation help has been given in many areas, for example, for road construction in Italy.  There were some schemes in France and a scheme of railroad electrification in Germany.  While no specific regional development scheme has been worked out as yet in the Common Market, the principle is accepted that one of the purposes of the Rome Treaty is to help backward regions and backward communities.  This is something for which we should bargain strongly. When I mentioned the question of subsidy for mountain sheep I had in mind the question of regional development, the question of our being allowed to continue to subsidise and help the sheep industry in the poorer parts of our western seaboard.</P>
    <P>To those who say we should not go in I have already said it is a question of Hobson's choice.  There is an atmosphere in this country of ours of pseudo affluence.  Certainly, if you go around the singing pubs it is Bob's your uncle and they are all able to have a double this or a double that.  That affluence is not as real as it seems.  When we come to examine certain data in relation to our economy, the position does not look so good.  I want to say this in <Col N="550" /> defence of our move to join the Common Market because I feel we have not been doing well and I fear we will do less well.  If we fail to get into the Common Market we will have to seek some modification of the Anglo-Irish Trade Agreement.  I think everybody concedes that if Britain goes into the Common Market we must go in.</P>
    <P>Where would we get a ready market for two-thirds of our exports overnight, or even over a space of a few years? We have been trying to get an alternative market since the State was founded, when conditions were better than they are now, when there was no Common Market, when there was no common customs barrier against us, but we failed.  Whatever chance we had then we have less now because, as I mentioned already, we have not sold a beast into Europe since 1960.  In those circumstances if we cannot export to the Common Market as it exists at the moment, how can be export to Britain when she joins the Common Market?</P>

      <P>Housing units.  I have already adverted to our trade gap.  The OECD Report of last February stated that we have the largest import-export gap of any OECD member country. That applies to 1968 but the position has worsened since then.  In 1967 the trade gap was over £100 million, in 1968 it was over £150 million and in 1969 it was over £200 million.  According to the OECD Report, we have the great distinction of having the highest import-export trade gap of any member of the OECD in 1968.</P>
      <P>Emigration is an accepted fact of life here and it runs on average at about 18,000.  We have never been able to resolve that problem.  Our unemployment figure is one of the highest in Europe with the exception of certain areas of Italy.  We have a chronic unemployment problem here.  In reply to a Parliamentary question put down a month or so ago Deputy L'Estrange was told that from 1956 to April, 1970, the total number of people employed in the country had fallen.  That means there are fewer people employed now than when the Government came into power in 1956.  The figure has fallen by 59,000.</P>

      <P>A measure of a country's industrial activity is its consumption of energy, and I suppose a measure of energy consumption is electricity.  Our electricity consumption is the lowest in Europe. An important aspect of any economy is industrial relations.  I need not tell anybody about that.  We must have the worst industrial relations position of any country in Europe.  According to the International Labour Office figures, more working hours are lost here than in any other country in Europe.  That has been the case now for a number of years.  This is not very encouraging for any industrialists who might consider setting up an industry here.  Despite that gloomy picture the White Paper asserts that Ireland is a tremendously attractive centre for entrepreneurs.</P>
      <P>The country is full of motor cars.  It is thought that everybody here has a motor car yet, in spite of the fact that we are more sparsely populated than most countries, the number of cars per unit of population here is the lowest in Europe.  We hear much talk about free education and transport but public expenditure on education in this country is the lowest in Europe.  Travelling around towns and cities one sees television aerials everywhere but the number of television sets per unit of population is the lowest in Europe excluding Portugal, Greece and Turkey.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For a number of years our production costs were marginally lower than they were in Britain but now they are higher.  There is no need to say anything about our cost of living figure. Our balance of payments position is going seriously wrong.  Our economy is balanced on two things.  The first is something we should not be too proud of and the second is something we should be very careful of.  We are balancing our economy and we have not overdrawn our reserves because of the capital inflow, but we have been traditionally balancing our economy and keeping our balance of payments in some sort of control, although lately <Col N="554" /> they are getting out of control, by emigrants' remittances which are now running at £20 million a year.  It is a disgraceful situation that we arrogantly talk about our new-found affluence when we are nothing more than pensioners of the unfortunate emigrants to whom we could not give employment at home and on whose remittances we are now living.  We are doing absolutely nothing for them outside this country. Not one penny has ever been provided for our emigrants and we have the largest percentages of emigrants of any country in the world.  We are, in effect, the only dying white race in the world. That is the position.</P>
    <P>Deputy FitzGerald spoke a year or two ago about Britain being the sick man of Europe.  He should begin talking about Caitlín Ní Houlihan; she is a sick girl now.  She has been laid up for a good while and she is not improving. I think she needs a change of doctor.</P>

The second concerns the effect of membership of GATT on our application for EEC membership.  I should like clarification of these two points.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have exhibited these facts of our economic position at present because I think a false nation has been created that we are economically in a very strong position and actually an affluent society.  I believe the Americans are now calling us an affluent society: I heard that stated elsewhere.  The position is that we are a very poor people and we have suffered since the State was founded by having only one market and being unable to get an alternative.  Every Government, even Fianna Fáil whenever they worked, tried to get other markets and failed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>They did.  These were the days.  It is pointless to talk about our independence here if we are to remain, as we have been in the past, so largely dependent on one market and unable to break out of that stranglehold. I suppose it is inevitable that any small country in juxtaposition to a large powerful neighbour will always find it difficult not alone to maintain its identity but to avoid being absorbed and submerged.  That is in the nature of things.  For many years this fear has upset the people of Canada, and Mr. Coyne, who was governor of the Central Bank of Canada, gave most of his life struggling against a cheque book conquest of Canada by the almighty dollar.  It was understandable that America, the world's most powerful <Col N="556" /> economy so near at hand, should permeate the Canadian economy.  This was, and I suppose still is, a trouble to the minds of Canadian thinkers and Canadian people generally.</P>
      <P>I shall conclude by merely adverting to that aspect of our problem.  Most of us remember that for a long time in our endeavours to protect our economy we insisted upon 51 per cent native capital being provided for native industry. That was all right from the nationalist point of view but it inhibited investment.  We gained, perhaps, politically, but economically money did not move in.  Undeveloped countries in other parts of the world used precisely the same ratio but they moved away from it to more liberalised investment thinking.  We also did that in 1956 when, I think, the late Deputy Sweetman introduced his modification of that ratio.  Since then foreign and American investment has improved here but there is always a difficulty about money coming into a country. We all welcome money from abroad to develop our own country, improve exports and provide industries but nobody wants money coming in to buy up what little we have, our hotels and farms and so on.</P>
      <P>The Common Market envisages free movement of men, money and materials.  Apparently, the final word has not yet been said on these movements and this is an area where we would be very sensitive.  We all recall the feelings expressed here at times when aliens buy up land which local farmers are unable to buy.  This is resented and disliked.  We have endeavoured at different times to circumvent it.  The only major reservation I have in mind as regards entering the Common Market is this danger of our economy, through this free movement of men, money and materials, becoming too submerged in international movements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should not like to feel that if a farm down in Cork.  Tipperary or Kildare came on the market it would be virtually impossible for an Irishman to buy it, that it would be a well-heeled industrialist from the Common Market who would buy it.  If that situation developed to a degree then we would <Col N="557" /> have paid a very great price for our entry into the Common Market.  I understand there are certain controls such as period of residence and so on to circumvent too liberal a movement in that direction which might upset local circumstances.  I would urge the Taoiseach and the Minister for External Affairs to pay particular attention to this aspect of trade liberalisation. There is nothing wrong with the free movement of material&mdash;we must face up to competition&mdash;but one would be very hesitant about accepting <i>in toto</i> a degree of liberalisation which might in effect culminate in many of our assets passing into the hands of people from the Continent to the detriment of our own people.  If that situation arose we would be no better off&mdash; in fact we would be worse off than we are at the present time.  I should like whatever Minister is replying&mdash;I presume it will be the Minister for External Affairs, Deputy Dr. Hillery&mdash;to give us an assurance on this matter because these are questions about which our people are anxious: Can we hold on to what we have, and land values being what they are on the Continent, much higher than here, will there be a movement of capital in here for the large-scale purchase of land, and will membership of the Common Market facilitate that movement to the detriment of the Irish people?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not here for his speech.  Possibly Deputy FitzGerald had the same impression.  I have opted <Col N="558" /> not to do so because there is so much to be said on this subject that I would find it difficult to say it in the compass of the time available to someone summing up.  Therefore I have opted to come in earlier in the debate but with the realisation that everyone who rises to speak on it must have: that it is such a vast subject that it is entirely impossible, even with the rapidity of the delivery that Deputy FitzGerald effects, to say all the things one would wish to say.</P>
      <P>The subject is also extremely complex and therefore, for the benefit of myself in trying to keep my place as I go on, and possibly, if I might so express it, for the benefit of anyone subsequently reading it, I shall endeavour, by way of introduction, to indicate the structure of what I have to say and some of the conclusions I shall be reaching.  Let me say also that since it is such a vast subject I shall not be concerning myself with what one might call the small print of the situation, the small print in regard to agriculture, industry, taxation and so on.  We have a duty, when undertaking a debate on this subject, to give the nation certain opinions, certain conclusions, and so occasionally I shall say things in a way that seems dogmatic and unargued, but I do assure the House that were we to examine those conclusions they would be found to be based on research and on thought.  However, the small print would take an unwarranted time to read into the record and therefore I propose to be rather condensed and concise and not to argue in a detailed way the various conclusions I propose to enunciate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to start&mdash;because I have noticed an omission from the debate so far&mdash;with a brief discussion of the history of the idea of a united Europe. The supposition is that European unity is a post-war phenomenon, but if you trace the history of the idea it goes back 100 years.  I shall be arguing that the great impetus came not immediately post-war from Mollet or Schumann or people like that but in the course of Hitler's new order, when the economies of Germany, France and Italy were run in a centralised way, when the big industrialists of those <Col N="559" /> three countries and also of Holland, Belgium and Luxembourg were part of Hitler's new order and participated in a war economy which was profitable for the big industrialists and where those big industrialists, who are now the lords of the EEC, were happy to use slave labour and happy to make profits from the manufacture of poison gas with which to implement a &ldquo;final solution&rdquo;, that the origins of the EEC lie in Hitler's new order and in the contacts built up between the industrialists of Europe and the bankers of Europe at that time.</P>
    <P>I propose then to go on to look at the different aspects as set out in one of the most recent of the Government's documents, that issued in April of this year on the <i>Implications for Ireland of Membership of the EEC</i>, and to follow the sections in that, not with comments on all of them but with comments on the major ones, following in-fact the order set out in that Government publication.</P>
    <P>It seems to me therefore that both in the presentations by the Government and also in what I have read or heard of the debate so far, there have been some very striking omissions.  I have not heard a discussion of the overseas connections of either the European Community or Britain.  The countries of French Africa are now colonies of the European Community, and Britain retains very many colonies.  If we become part of the European Community, it is my contention that the European Community, which will develop into a single nation, will stand in a colonial relationship to a great deal of Africa and to some other parts of the world as well, and we shall then be participating in a metropolitan way in exploiting the blacks and other people in underdeveloped and depressed countries of the world, thus finding ourselves, as a traditionally anti-imperialist country, in a position of imperial exploitation.  It may well be we shall be glad to get our hands on the the &ldquo;lolly&rdquo; that will come to us in that way, but it is well that we should face what we are doing and discuss the implications of it.</P>
    <P>The other striking omission from the <Col N="560" /> major speeches which I have heard was the relationship of participation in the European Community to the question of national unity which seems to be a central objective of Irish political life and something very close to the heart of every Irish man and woman. It seems to me also that participation in the European Community will have a bearing of the most profound and fundamental sort on the question of the achievement of national unity.  It is fair and indeed essential, therefore, that we should&mdash;although I realise it is a sensitive time and I hope I will do so in a responsible way&mdash;introduce into this debate the importance of the struggle for national unity.  I propose then to discuss the way in which the enlarged Community will develop.  I propose to discuss the relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Community and to look a little at the arguments which now motivate, if not the population of Britain, at least the leadership of both major parties in Britain to urge membership strongly on their parties and on their country.  My contention is that the arguments for British participation are totally opposite to the argument, if any, for our participation and that what is good for Britain in this context is bad for us, and vice versa.</P>
    <P>I propose then to try to look at the Irish economy and the Irish nation in the context of the enlarged Six.  If we for a moment make the assumption that Ireland will, in fact, participate in the European Community then it is necessary if there is to be a valid discussion throughout the nation, to put the economy and the whole social and economic structure of Ireland into the context of an enlarged Europe in a factual way.  This has, in fact, been done in part by the last speaker and I will try not simply to repeat the points he has made.  I then propose to raise the question which has been very little touched upon, our relationship with the other applicants.  As I said, I believe that Britain's interests and ours are directly opposite in the context of negotiations but the interests of Norway and Denmark are much more like ours. Therefore I propose to ask questions about the extent to which a common bargaining position has been evolved <Col N="561" /> and to urge that such a common bargaining position should be evolved because either we are not being told and there is a great deal of joint activity between our three countries or else we are being told and there is none.  If there is a great deal of joint consultation between the Norwegians, the Danes and ourselves this Parliament is entitled to hear more about it.</P>
    <P>Then we come to the heart of the debate: the question of the alternatives which face us.  One alternative, which is the position of the Government, of the Fianna Fáil Party and of the Fine Gael Party, is that without any reservations that I can detect we go in accepting the Treaty of Rome in its entirety.  One is that we stay right out&mdash;which for reasons on which I will elaborate I do not think is a valid position either.  The third possibility is that we try to negotiate or at least make some very serious efforts at negotiating a position which would secure for us the advantages and yet which would protect us against what seem to me very awful dangers, dangers I am bound to say which are so great that I do not believe we have any future as a nation if we adhere to the EEC <i>in toto</i>, if we subscribe to this Treaty of Rome in its entirety.  We will, therefore, be looking at the alternative courses open to us because, again, a simplistic debate on the basis of right in or right out, total participation or severance of all relations, is an entirely false debate.  There are many examples inside Europe and outside Europe of other forms of relationship.</P>
    <P>I then propose to look, in a <i>seriatim</i> way, using the official Dáil record, at the speeches of the Taoiseach and of Deputy Cosgrave in regard to this matter and go on to a criticism of what I consider to be the basic position of Fine Gael in the matter and subsequently of the position of Fianna Fáil in the matter.  We have a duty also to tease out and consider the question of what will happen to us if negotiations fail.  We have seen them fail twice.  We have heard the British make much more hostile noises about the European Community than we have been making and if I were faced with the unpleasant task of having to make <Col N="562" /> a book on the probability of entry I would say that it is probably money on. There is a very real chance that we may not get in and surely it behoves us not to put all our planning, all our thinking and all our predicting on the basis that this third time we will be lucky and that it will work out.  In fact, it seems to me that we are in great danger of being caught in a rather difficult position if negotiations fail.</P>
    <P>Finally I propose to indicate the path that the Labour Party and the Labour movement should play in leading the struggle against the total, simplistic, uncritical acceptance of the Treaty of Rome, in leading the struggle for an intermediate position where we could secure the economic advantages without bartering away our sovereignty and without, as I view it, ending the possibility of our continued existence as a nation.  That will be the form of what I will have to say.</P>
    <P>I will go back then to the question of the origins of the European Community. We can, as I say, have very damning quotations from Bismarck which I have been coming across recently where as a realist in politics, a very successful unifier on the German scale, he had cynical things to say about the proponents of an all-European idea.  I have already said that it was under Hitler's new order that the big chemical companies, the steel and coal and financial institutions, the various big, dynamic firms of France and Italy, came to have relations with the more dominant big industries of Germany.  The steel and coal and engineering skills of the Belgians and Dutch, and the steel and coal producing population of Luxembourg, were all integrated, all got to know each other and to appreciate under the conditions of Nazism that it was nice to have a market larger than one's national market, that there was, in fact, increasing economic strength for the units, there was an increasing market and there was possibly increasing profitability.  They appreciated that notwithstanding the difficulties of language, notwithstanding in the case of Germany and France, the relationship of victor to vanquished, the big companies and financial institutions <Col N="563" /> could collaborate with each other, which in fact they did.  In passing, and as an example, the reason that the Renault company is now a State company is the collaboration with the Germans of the man who founded it and the subsequent appropriation of it by the State after the defeat of the Nazis. The contacts were built up then and the ideas of Monet and Schumann and the other ideologists from the late forties were a repetition of the economic ideas which had already been seen to exist under Hitler.</P>
    <P>My belief is that the basic morality of the large companies and the large financial institutions which are the real backbone of the EEC, is no different. In some cases they are the same persons, the same institutions, the same companies that as I said earlier were quite happy to make profits from slave labour, to make profits from producing weapons of war and gas for the destruction of a portion of mankind of whom they happened to disapprove on theoretical grounds.  These are the same people with the same morals.  Anyone who presents the European Community as an altruistic organisation concerned only with the greatest possible development of all the participating nations and of all parts of those nations is so quite extraordinarily naïve as to seem to me to have no claim to a place in public life and no right to be listened to as a person worthy of exerting any sort of national influence.</P>
    <P>The reality is that the EEC arose in the immediate post-war period from the economic needs of the big companies and big financial institutions of the Six in conditions of very considerable difficulty.  It is not difficult for some of us to recall the situation at that time.  Most people in this House will recall what Europe was like in those days.  Some of the reasons behind the setting up of the various Communities&mdash;the three Communities now merged into one&mdash;were perfectly valid. It would be as ridiculous for me to paint the European Community in colours that are all black as it seems to me ridiculous for other persons in this House to paint the Community all white.  The present merged Community <Col N="564" /> has some admirable qualities and some disgraceful ones.  The Community is neither all good nor all bad.  I am suggesting that on balance it is bad.  I recognise that it is something that exists, is very dynamic and is developing a history of its own.  My conviction is that the combined struggle of the united labour movements of the European Community will succeed in removing the adverse attributes and making it something much more generally good than it is at present.  I am pleading for people to look to its origins with a slightly cynical, realistic and practical eye.</P>
    <P>There was the threat in the late 1940s and the early 1950s, in the period of Stalin's paranoia, from Eastern Europe.  There was then considerable political American instigation for European unity.  This was not based on economic arguments at all.  This was based on having a strong and dynamic group able to satisfy its population which would be a barrier against the further expansion of the Soviet Union and their friends in Eastern Europe. The Americans have reared a hydra which is now an economic threat to them.  They did something for political reasons in the late 1940s and early 1950s which now, in the early 1970s, they may come, for economic reasons, to regret.  This was one valid reason.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to one other thing. We must have some realistic views about the way the European Community agricultural policy will go.  It seems to be thought of as Utopia. Some people seem to think it will solve all our problems.  No one would be happier than me if I thought this was true, knowing our agricultural history. The situation was that in the countries of Europe&mdash;in Germany a little, in France to a great extent, and in Italy to a considerable extent&mdash;there were small farmers, peasants, if one may use that term in a European context although it cannot be used in an Irish context.  The peasants of France and Italy suffered gravely during the Second World War.  They were undecided in regard to their political allegiance.  They were undecided whether they would side with the Christian Democratic Parties, who <Col N="565" /> were the majority of the Right Wing, or with the Communist parties.  If those people had sided with the Communist parties&mdash;and if one thinks back to the 1948 election in Italy, people will see the validity of what I am saying&mdash;there was real danger then that Italy and France might have undertaken Communist development as Poland and Czechoslovakia did. That was on the cards.  That caused the policy-makers to do something in regard to the price of agricultural produce which was in their interest then but which is not in their interest now. The price of the peasants' produce was set very high in the early European Community to increase their relative prosperity and to buy them over to the side of the existing parties in power and to keep them out of the embrace of the Communist Parties. This was the reason for the extraordinarily high prices which resulted in a butter surplus and other surpluses in Europe.  That reason no longer exists.  That is the reason why European agricultural policy will evolve and change to our detriment.  Had we gone in in the early 1960s we would have participated in the bonanza for small farmers over the last eight or nine years.  The 1970s will not be years of bonanza for the small farmers of Europe in the way the 1960s were.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>That is true.  I am suggesting that the high prices are transitory and directly in conflict with the interests of big industry.  They are, therefore, coming to an end now that the threat has receded.  I will put my reasons on the record and it is possible to disagree with me.  There was the question of neutralising and winning back to existing parties and policies <Col N="566" /> the disaffected peasants of southern France and Italy which I believe had a profound effect on the thinking which produced the extraordinary surpluses which have only recently come into existence in Europe.  They have produced a decade of great prosperity for the peasants and small farmers of Europe.</P>
      <P>The other pressures lay in the opposite direction.  They lay in the pressures from the United States because in the aftermath of war there was an economy in the United States which had gone on growing and which had not been damaged by direct attack but had been able to renew and modernise continuously.  It was effectively poised to take advantage of the demand in Europe and also to buy its way into Europe in terms of ownership and to sell to Europe, at very low cost, the sophisticated techniques which had developed during the war.  There was, therefore, the powerful argument for every European firm&mdash;whether industrial firm or financial institution&mdash; getting economies of scale and a size of operation which could afford a research and development programme so that it could be possible to deal with the huge, booming American economy on approximately equal terms.  That was a proper and natural reason.  The reasons for the genesis of the EEC are complex, but they are all relevant to our estimate of whether membership of the EEC would be good for us or not.  There were the circumstances that, quite distinct from the industrial sophistication and success of the US, most of the trade of the world was either in the hands of the old empire of Britain through sterling or of the new empire of the dollar, as I choose to look on America in the undeveloped world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was a battle, successful for the dollar and less successful for sterling, in which the growing industrial might of the Six had to take advantage of the financial institutions outside their control. From the point of view of trade in metals, or even in items such as furs, and insurance or trade in money, there was nothing like the city of New York and they had a reason to try to get for themselves a scale of operations that would produce a currency of their own, <Col N="567" /> comparable on a world scale with the dollar, the rouble or the £ sterling&mdash;the last now sinking fast.  There were some good reasons and some bad reasons but none of them was a simple altruistic reason of benevolence towards the poor people of Europe, regardless of class or background.  They were good economic reasons and were not very different from the economic reasons in the previous quarter of a century which had driven the French, British, the Germans and, to a lesser extent, the Italians and Dutch to carve up the world and for the British to build an empire on which the sun would never set.</P>
    <P>The reasons for building the European Community were basically capitalist reasons.  However, it is the capitalist community of a rather old-fashioned type&mdash;not the evolved, sophisticated, semi-State controlled capitalism of the United States or even of this country.  It is an old-fashioned <i>laissez faire</i> capitalism which has been the basic ideological position of the Six in regard to economics.  In fact, the motives were the same as the motives which caused the British to clobber us, and to clobber many Asians, Africans and other people.  The position was not that one day after two world wars the Germans, French, the Dutch and the Belgians suddenly said: &ldquo;We think capitalism is very wicked; we will now set up a tamed, civilised and benevolent system that will look after the best interests of all people in the participating countries, rich and poor alike.&rdquo; That has not happened and will never happen.  It is a dream that propagandists in Brussels are entitled to put out but we will be foolish if we believe it because the reality is more tough and ruthless than this kind of bland documentation would have people believe.</P>
    <P>The reasons for the common external tariff, which until recently had been the essential feature of the whole matter, were simple enough to find.  At that stage there was no need for political or financial unity; there was simply a need to have an area in which the rapid rate of growth could be protected. In passing, it is worth noting that no country in the world, except Britain which was the first capitalist <Col N="568" /> country, has ever developed a capitalist economy in conditions of free trade. We believe now that we are going to do it but it has never happened and it has always been necessary to set up protective conditions to get the initial accumulation and growth.</P>
    <P>The common external tariff was the obvious policy to pursue and it produced the obvious results.  In fact, the rate of growth has been very high; it has been remarkable and sustained.  It was something that the economists did not expect.  In 1945 nobody expected that there was going to be a quarter century of a pretty well uninterrupted boom in Western Europe.  There have been some minor down-turns but they have been shallow and have been quickly corrected.  They have responded to the techniques that have developed in the last 25 years for pulling economies out of recessions.  It has occurred in a remarkable way and it is well to refer to this in our judgment.</P>
    <P>A period of 25 years is all that most of us remember in our adult life and, therefore, we are disposed to think that the conditions obtaining will continue forever.  This year there are serious economic indicators which show that these conditions will not continue and we have more reason to be apprehensive about the ending of this boom at this time than we have had since the end of the war.  We would be wrong to judge Europe's prospects simply on the basis of this remarkably sustained growth.  It may be that the techniques for managing a capitalist economy are now so sophisticated that we can continue <i>ad infinitum</i> with growth rates of 5 per cent per annum.  However, I do not believe this and it would be extremely dangerous for us to plan in that way. We have to think of protective and defensive postures as well as expansionist ones, although I agree on the need for expansion.</P>
    <P>The free movement of goods, labour and capital were obvious policies to follow in the realisation of the hopes of the planners of the EEC.  This was no more than saying that in regard to our markets, to our labour force and the possibility of locating money for investment, the limits are now the common external boundary of the Six <Col N="569" /> and not the national boundary of any single country.</P>
    <P>The third essential feature of the early EEC was the policy of dear food &mdash;something that was in the interests of the small farmers, but not in the interests of industry or the working classes.  However, the latter obviously wanted to buy food as cheaply as possible and manufacturing industry was interested in the lowest possible cost of production.  Any industrial country in a competitive situation is concerned that its working class and the entire population will be able to buy food as cheaply as possible.  Whether it applies to the United States, or to Britain with the repeal of the Corn Laws, this is a generalisation in regard to industrial countries.  It is a valid generalisation but it is serious for us because I believe we are about to witness a change in the policy of cheap food.</P>
    <P>In considering the development of the EEC and the two other Communities into a unified Community and the relationship with Britain, I might comment on the basic thought behind Britain's previous applications and negotiating posture.  At the beginning of the sixties Britain enjoyed a special position in the world in regard to the Commonwealth.  To a great extent, even more than now, she was exploiting the Commonwealth in an imperialist or neo-colonialist way and also other parts of the world not part of the Commonwealth. Britain also was deriving great benefit from her position as the proprietor of sterling&mdash;an international currency.  In the early sixties, she was anxious to defend in negotiations the position of sterling and the special relationship with the Commonwealth.</P>
    <P>At that time Deputy O'Donovan, myself and various other people said that we need not worry because Britain would not enter into Europe; I said this on the basis that Britain was trying to bring too much in with her; she was trying to defend her special position in the world.  She was trying to defend her special relationship with the Commonwealth and the special benefits that came to her through sterling in a way that the Treaty of Rome did not envisage and other European countries would not permit.  It was obvious from their negotiations that they were on a <Col N="570" /> collision course and although the de Gaulle veto was blamed for Britain's failure last time, the failure was as much because of Britain's refusal to abandon her special position in the world as to anything that de Gaulle did.</P>
    <P>The situation is different now because a vast amount of the Commonwealth has been taken from Britain by various people; some of them have evolved and some have established trading relationships with Japan.  This may not take them off Britain's hands to any great extent but the position in regard to Australia and New Zealand is not anything as acute as it was in the early 1960s.</P>
    <P>I now come to the point where I disagree with the Deputy on my right in that Britain is serious this time and the chances are that she will get in but she may try to scramble too much in with her.  However, she is more realistic now and she is more attuned to her shrunken place in the world.  She is no longer the centre of a great empire.  Her negotiations will be carried out realistically. She is less tied to her commercial links with the Commonwealth and she has less to gain from sterling. But there are a couple of other reasons for her wanting to join.  One of these reasons is that the Community up to now has not developed a commercial centre comparable to the city of London.  Therefore, the City of London in regard to insurance, in regard to a trading centre and in regard to a centre for financial transactions, hopes, and with some possibility of success, that it will become the commercial centre of Europe&mdash;not the manufacturing centre but the financial and trading centre&mdash; in a way that it was once the trading centre of the British Empire.</P>
    <P>That seems to me to be the reason why the City of London is interested in the Common Market at this time.  They think they will do well out of it and I suppose they are right in so thinking. In regard to industry, Britain believes that she can make great progress within the enlarged Community.  The argument about the role of the City of London is a plus for them and the possibility of industrial greatness, with her sophisticated industry, is another plus for them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="571" /> Their point of view in regard to a system of agricultural prices was changed.  The British Tories now in power may have agreed to leave the situation as it was at least for the next while because they may have to change it altogether within the Community. Their Shadow Minister for Agriculture, Mr. Godber, who, incidentally, did not become a Minister when the crunch came, as recently as two years ago made explicit statements about the price support system to British farmers. This had evolved since the war and they maintained that it was costing too much in relation to the benefits accruing from it.  They were willing to move towards higher fruit prices and to the system that was so different from the system obtaining in the European Community. Therefore, many of the objections have been removed and Britain, having an industry which in terms of research, development and sophistication in a number of crucial areas like atomic engineering and computers, is more developed than any in Europe. Consequently, she could expect to dominate Europe.  It will be seen, then, that the British have very powerful arguments for going in at this time and they have a fair guarantee, in so far as anything can be guaranteed, that while they might not necessarily be the dominant force, they would probably end up, not quite as strong as Germany, but stronger than anybody else in the enlarged Community of ten, and consequently would have very real and very substantial advantages.</P>
    <P>Of course, the situation in regard to Ireland is totally different and I shall be elaborating later on why it is so totally different.  There are no comparisons. Because we have British newspapers, British television programmes and British radio and because at this moment the British are spewing out a general belief and euphoria that all will be great when she enters, we are inclined to accept that what is good for them is good for us.  It is said that it is traditional for us to argue but I am not arguing now for traditional reasons when I say that what is good for them is bad for us.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I turn now to an examination of the document produced by the Government and entitled <i>Membership of the European Communities: Implications for Ireland.</i>  Apparently, it does not matter to the Government or to Fine Gael as to our Constitution but this is a matter which has a profound interest for me.  It is appropriate that the first question with which I shall deal is that of the constitutional and legal implications.  In chapter 1, paragraph 5 of that document there is the statement that among the provisions of the Constitution which have to be changed in regard to our application for membership is Article 5 which states that Ireland is a sovereign, independent, democratic state.  Other Articles are also mentioned but I want to suggest in this context that it is not simply the three mentioned in the Government's document that will have to be changed because our participation in the European Community and our adherence to that Community would involve a violation of the very first Article of our Constitution as well as of Articles 5, 6 and 15.  Of course, it is not by accident that Article 1 is the most important Article and I would take a little time to indicate why I think our adherence to the Community would be at variance with that Article.  In my opinion, our adherence to the Community involves the total scrapping of our Constitution as it exists at present and in honour and truth we should present this fact to the Irish people.</P>
      <P>Article 1 says that:</P>
      <P>The Irish nation hereby affirms its inalienable, indefeasible, and sovereign right to choose its own form of Government, to determine its relations with other nations...</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not reading the whole of it, but I am particularly concerned with the second bit: &ldquo;to determine its relations with other nations&rdquo;.  The word &ldquo;indefeasible&rdquo; is a very interesting one because it is a word which occurs in the 1916 Proclamation and it is a word <Col N="573" /> which occurs in the application of that proclamation to the democratic programme of the First Dáil.  It is my conviction that the hand that wrote it into the 1916 Proclamation was the hand of the socialist republican, James Connolly, and we know from the records that it was a socialist republican who wrote the democratic programme of the First Dáil, a programme which was subsequently watered down and made more acceptable.  It is clear that these were the documents of socialist republicans because they declared the right of the people of Ireland to the ownership of Ireland and to the unfettered control of Irish destinies to be sovereign and indefeasible.  There, again, is the word &ldquo;indefeasible&rdquo; which occurs in Article 1 of our Constitution. I confess that, until I went and consulted a dictionary&mdash;there are honourable and historical precedents for consulting dictionaries in this House&mdash; I was not clear what the word &ldquo;indefeasible&rdquo; meant.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LukeBelton" hpid="Mr. L. Belton Mr. L. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is not a dictionary republican.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to inform the House now of the results of my consulting dictionaries on this.  Indefeasible, according to the <i>Oxford Dictionary</i>, means &ldquo;not liable to be made void or to be done away with&rdquo;. The second meaning is &ldquo;that cannot be forfeited&rdquo;; that which cannot be forfeited is indefeasible&rdquo;.  Let us come back now to Article 1 of the Constitution which affirms the indefeasible right of the Irish nation to determine its relations with other nations.  That means two things: first, it means that the Irish nation possesses the inalienable right to determine its relations with other nations and, secondly, it means that that right cannot be forfeited. That is what indefeasible means. Yet, participation in the European Economic Community and the signing of the Treaty of Rome do, in fact, forfeit that right and forfeit it totally. The Treaty of Rome violates, in my opinion, both the letter and the spirit of that part of Article 1 of the constitution that I have just quoted.  It also violates the spirit of the affirmation in Article 1 that the Irish nation affirms its inalienable, indefeasible and <Col N="574" /> sovereign right to develop its life politically, economically and culturally in accordance with its own genius and heritage.  That may not be at variance with the letter of the Treaty of Rome but it is, in my view, at variance with the spirit of it.  I cannot see how we can possibly retain Article 1 and, at the same time, contemplate entering the Community.  It cannot be denied that Article 1 is the most important article of the Constitution.  Adhering to the Treaty of Rome means scrapping totally our Constitution.  The Government's own document says we must scrap Articles 5, 6 and 15.  If we must also scrap Article 1, our Constitution will be shot through with so many holes as not to be valid any more.</P>
      <P>I want to emphasise that the nation has a perfect right to change its Constitution. I am simply saying it should do so in the full knowledge of what it is doing.  The issues must be honestly presented and honestly debated and, if the nation decides it wants to do this, it is quite entitled to do so.  But the issue must be presented first.  The Constitution sums up the thinking of someone who is now the President of this State and the founder of the Government party, someone who is revered very widely outside his own party.  The abandonment of the Constitution involves abandonment of a great deal of the thinking, motivation and outlook of the nation's President, the founder of the Government party.  Although the Government party are entitled to change their mind on such basic issues as this, it seems to me it is obligatory they should indicate where the changes of mind are occurring, where they think it was wrong in the past, why they think other outlooks are correct, when, and in what circumstances, they changed their opinion so fundamentally. That is all I propose to say about the first chapter of the Government's main document.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We cannot enter the European Economic Community and retain our Constitution.  The Constitution can be altered only by referendum.  In the case of some of the applicant countries adherence to the European Economic Community is so fundamental and involves such a break with <Col N="575" /> national tradition, national sovereignty and with the whole ethos of the nation that much more than a simple majority of Parliament is required.  Almost the only thing on which I agree with the Taoiseach is that this is the most important single issue in the life of this State.  A simple Parliamentary majority decision will not suffice.  Much more than a simple majority is required before any government would be entitled to hand away a nation's birthright, tradition and past.</P>
    <P>Turning to the political implications in Chapter 2, I want to refer to the last paragraph:</P>
    <P>It is recognised that, as the Communities evolve towards their political objectives, those participating in the new Europe thereby created must be prepared to assist, if necessary, in its defence.  As a member of the expanded Communities, Ireland would be playing her part in shaping their political development and, therefore, would have a voice in all the decisions to be taken in this field, as in other aspects of the Communities' activities.</P>
    <P>That seems to me to involve the acceptance of a military commitment as it now stands.  The phrase is &ldquo;as the Communities evolve&rdquo;.  Again, if the nation so decides, we are perfectly entitled to do so but those of us who oppose our acceptance of the Treaty of Rome and those of us who oppose our becoming a full member of the Community have to point out that this again is in violation of undertakings given in this House quite recently in regard to Irish neutrality.</P>
    <P>Our position of neutrality is extraordinarily valuable and it is one which should not lightly be thrown away.  If one undertakes what the Community involves in regard to this, one is entitled to ask the question, against whom?  That is a very simple and obvious question.  Of course, the answer is, against some of the eastern States of Europe.  That is the answer which immediately springs to mind.</P>
    <P>One can see that conflict can be caused in two ways.  It can be caused by use of hydrogen bombs and then what remains of Europe, whichever <Col N="576" /> powers remain, can become a holocaust. This can be caused by eastern Europe which is a long way from us. One is entitled to ask if this nation should lightly accept responsibilities which could result in the destruction, quite possibly, of this nation by nuclear weapons.  Many of us realise the reality of this.  The reality is that quite a small amount of those weapons could kill all of the people in this island.  We are too small to affect the outcome of the use of those weapons.  We are only 3,000,000 as against 250,000,000.  We are entitled to take up a position which could involve the death of every man, woman and child in this island, but we should not do it.  We should not do something which comes as part of a package.</P>

      <P>There are other possible conflicts because the European Economic Community will, in fact, become one of the super powers of the world, whether we are in it or not.  It will grow into a great super power, comparable to the super powers of the United States, Russia or China.  There will then be four super powers.  Each will try to calculate how to outdo the <Col N="577" /> other.  The EEC already possess the influence of the French and the Dutch and may possibly have the British influence as well.  We will then be part of a traditional economic super power. We have to accept the risks of this. We will get into an atmosphere, it seems to me, of a sort of jingoistic militarism which characterises some of the sections of the United States. Acceptance of this defence commitment merits the most searching discussion and analysis.  If we go in we may find ourselves in conflict not just with the east of Europe but with many of the other great powers as well.</P>

      <P>Deputy Bruton's point is an arguable one but it is one I do not propose to take up at this moment.  I will return to it later when I come to discuss Chapter 3.  The essence of Deputy Bruton's question was that if we became a member of the Common Market would we not be a force for peace?  However, as I said, I will discuss that later.  It seems to me what we do now will affect us for the next quarter of a century.  Most of the people who are in this country at the moment will be alive at the end of a quarter of a century.  The possibility of a conflict between the European Economic Community and the USA is a very real one. Economic conflict exists there already.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are lightheartedly, apparently, entering a Community which has the Outlook, morality, social system and economic system of nations which twice in this century have fought each other for the sake of hoped-for economic advantages to themselves.  There is no difference in the basic outlook, the morality, the social system, between <Col N="578" /> the Germany of 1914, the Germany of 1939 and the EEC of 1970.  We should be foolish to believe that, somehow, the leopard of European materialism had changed its spots and was suddenly tamed, civilised, well-behaved, concerned with human life and civilised human things.  The danger of conflict with the United States is a real danger in the long-term&mdash;let me emphasise in the long-term&mdash;not now.  The point is that participation in the EEC is irrevocable because we get to the stage where, even if we decide in this Parliament to do so, we cannot go back: things would have changed too much. Once you go a certain distance along a certain road, it is not possible to go back.  If we do it, we are stuck with it totally.  We are not keeping our options open.  I shall be arguing later on the desirability of keeping our options open.</P>
    <P>Let me turn now to representation in the institutions of Europe&mdash;the Council, the Commission, the Parliament, the sub-committees, and so on.  It has been argued both by Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael that this will give us an independence we never had; power to influence our destiny that we did not previously possess.  I am tempted to quote, as I am continuously tempted to quote in this debate, the Duke of Wellington's famous statement: &ldquo;If you believe that, you will believe anything&rdquo;.  This point of view seems extraordinarily fatuous, naïve, ill-considered.  For this reason, let us take the institutions of Europe, the institutions of the Community one by one.  The supreme body is the Commission.  There is a Council of Ministers, Parliament, permanent representatives, and so on.  The Commission is a body of international, very able civil servants.  Once they are appointed, they undertake quite solemnly and explicitly not to consider the interests of the nation from which they came and only to consider the interests of the Community as a whole.  The Commission was, until recently, 14: it has gone down to nine. It is considered that, with the expansion of the Six to Ten, if it takes place, the Commission will go up again to 14, of which one will be Irish.</P>
    <P>In the permanent civil service of the EEC we shall possess one representative <Col N="579" /> who will promise not to consider the special point of view or interest of this nation because (1) he is an international civil servant and (2) he is one-fourteenth of the whole and, in my book, to have one-fourteenth of the total voice is practically identical, in real terms of power, in real terms of negotiation, in real terms of the tug-of-war of supra-national politics, the equivalent of having nothing at all.</P>
    <P>If we turn to the Council of Ministers, the enlarged Council of Ministers, the number is 61, of whom three will be Irish: one in 20, that is&mdash;if you will allow me to round it off.  If we could not exert a major influence as one one-fourteenth on the Commission why can we exert a major influence as one in 20?  Of course, we cannot.  It is equivalent to the suggestion that if you have 5 per cent of the shares of a company you are able to have a significant influence on the decisions that are taken.</P>
    <P>In the European Parliament, not elected by direct suffrage, indirectly elected, with, therefore, a premium on the man, the tame, reliable person will get through to the European Parliament through his national parliament.  Is it seriously suggested to us that this one in 20 of the institutions will be able to exert the slightest influence on the long-term development of the Community? People who believe that would believe anything; that is cloud cuckooland; that is not the land of reality; that is make-believe; that is Tír na nOg; that is a fairytale.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Could that argument not be applied to every country because on its own, every country has small representation relative to the total number of countries represented?  Any individual country, alone, is bound to be small relative to the whole.  It is a matter of alliances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>We shall come to that point later.  I propose to discuss what one might call the economic geography of Ireland in the context of the Six.  If we do that we shall see how likely we are to have any validity.  Later, I shall quote from the speeches by the Taoiseach and by Deputy Cosgrave.  I have applied a lot of words of ridicule to <Col N="580" /> them but I have not the vocabulary of ridicule to indicate sufficiently to the House just how fatuous I find them.</P>
      <P>On the matter of representation in the institutions, I think we shall see a real future for Germany, the biggest and most dynamic in population, in GNP, and so on; a real future for Britain, a real future for France.  The ones that worry me are the Norwegians, the Danes and ourselves, the ones that are neither geographically central like Holland, Belgium and Luxembourg, or economically powerful like Germany and Britain.  The peripheral ones will be clobbered, in my view, in regard to power in the various institutions of the Community, in regard to their economic development, in regard to their national identity.  My conviction is that, if we adhere, our national identity will disappear altogether.  Therefore, I find the arguments in regard to representation in the various committees extraordinarily unconvincing, to put it mildly.</P>
      <P>Chapter IV deals with industry which, I suppose, is central.  The conception we are being given is that, in a market of 250 million people, give or take a few, our industry, which has grown vigorously in the past ten years particularly, will continue to develop, to expand, to find a place for itself.  In this prognostication by the Government, rather cheerful, rather benevolent things are said.  Near the end, it sums up how nice it will be.  I cannot at this moment give the exact quotation but the general prediction is that our industry will do rather well in the circumstances of the EEC.</P>
      <P>There are two things one might say in this respect.  One is a quotation from a man who is not now leading Britain's negotiations, Mr. Harold Wilson.  He is a professional economist and a professional politician and he knows a good deal about it.  Admittedly he was speaking in 1962, but I believe that what he said in 1962 is still true.  He said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The plain fact is that the whole conception of the Treaty of Rome is anti-planning or, at any rate, anti-national planning.  The title and chapter headings of Part I of the Treaty and the whole philosophy of <Col N="581" /> the relevant articles show a dedication to one principle and that is the principle of competition.  What planning is contemplated is supra-national not national, but is planning for the purpose of enhancing free competition.</P>
    <P>I am sure that is true.  That is my assessment of the philosophy of the Treaty of Rome&mdash;planning for the purpose of enhancing free competition.</P>
    <P>In this context before I go on to comment on the results of a <i>laissez faire</i> philosophy of designing everything inside the Community to ensure free competition.  I should like to quote from an article in the current issue of <i>Irish Industry.</i>  Michael Sweetman, in his capacity as director of business policy of the Confederation of Irish Industries, is the author.  It is about the EEC and Irish industry.  He says things that are rather similar to what Deputy Cosgrave said and I will quote some of them before going on to make a general comment.  He says:</P>
    <P>In the EEC the only key to survival will be the ability to market goods profitably.</P>
    <P>He then goes on to talk about the question of scale in industry and about the argument that since our industry is mostly small-scale it would be in grave danger and says:</P>
    <P>Experience in the United States is very encouraging.  There, in a market of comparable size, and with some of the largest corporations in the world there are, nevertheless, many thousands of manufacturing firms which are small to medium even by Irish standards.</P>
    <P>The arguments there is that if small to medium firms can survive in the climate of competition inside the United States they can also do so in the climate of competition in the European Community.  Then, finally, talking about Irish firms he says that our aim should not be competition in the mass production areas where cost effectiveness and scale of production are very important and where economies of scale are very important. Speaking for Irish firms he says they should seek out instead sections of the market where price and economies of <Col N="582" /> large-scale production count for less than uniqueness of product, high quality, special service or where special tastes are the important consideration. In other words, even though there is a possibility of survival for the small or medium firms, there is no possibility of survival for them in head-on competition with the big battalions, the great firms.  There is only a prospect of survival in peripheral areas where the specialist product is of importance.</P>
    <P>There are two opinions.  Harold Wilson said truly, I think&mdash;but it is nice to have it from his mouth rather than mine&mdash;that the whole concept of the EEC is <i>laissez faire</i> capitalism, the production of a market of 250 million people where free competition exists. We must counterpose to that, statements by the Taoiseach, statements by Deputy Cosgrave and statements in this document that, in fact, we will cope rather well with the very intense competition which we will meet inevitably in the European Community.</P>
    <P>In Mr. Sweetman's words, the crucial thing is the possibility of being able to produce at a profit.  Nobody will employ anybody any more or build a new factory or do anything else unless there is a profit in it.  Profit is the criterion in a competition milieu such as the EEC.  Profit is the god.  I think the profitability of Irish industry in this country will be very, very severely impaired.  I may at a later stage quote the relative scales of wages in the different European countries of the Ten; the Six and the African Four. Ours is the lowest.  There is, therefore, an advantage to a firm&mdash;apart from the various incentives in regard to tax holidays and so on&mdash;in regard to basic wages but, after a period, with free movement of labour, free movement of capital and unified social services, with a growing together of European nations, there will no longer be differentials in regard to wage costs between one part and another.  This is directly contrary to the ideals of the Treaty of Rome and it is a place where we might conceivably see the Treaty of Rome carried into actuality.  There will be a levelling.  We will not enjoy lower labour costs, if &ldquo;enjoy&rdquo; is the word.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="583" /> It is not the word for the workers getting the lesser pay, but, for the manufacturer, the word is &ldquo;enjoy&rdquo;.  That will end.</P>
    <P>Anybody who looks at the history of the motorcar business and the survival of a firm in it knows that it is not the quality of its product that is the deciding factor.  Of course, it is a factor. Some of the most important factors are financial strength, and how much hardship in times of retraction can you soak up before you go broke.  There is no question that the financial strength lies with the big battalions, the bigger firms.  The greater the financial expertise, the greater the power of raising money, the greater the skill in using the money are the deciding factors. Our firms are tiny in this context and in the whole context of economies of scale.  Where are those firms in the Irish economy?  What section of it?  Is it Irish textiles or Irish chemicals or Irish machinery or the Irish drink trade?  Where is the section of our economy that can produce, through vast throughputs, economies of scale comparable with the companies with which we have to compete?</P>
    <P>We buy two sorts of Danish lager all over Ireland in fair quantities but the two parent companies, both with world names in the production of lager, have already decided that they are too weak and they have amalgamated ahead of entry or supposed entry to the EEC.  I quoted this remark of Michael Sweetman's about a small or medium-sized firm having a future. Indeed it has a future but it must be a very special sort of small or medium-sized firm: a small or medium-sized firm with a fantastic degree of sophistication. Anyone who wants to see this in its extreme form should go to a thing called Route 128 around Boston in Massachusetts.  There small firms of fantastic technological sophistication, associated with MIT or with Harvard, have been set up along this highway. It is a highway of high technology industry.  These indeed are small firms with a future but small firms with a very extraordinary level of sophistication and with vast expenditures on research and development behind them. <Col N="584" /> These expenditures on research and development were not incurred by the firms but by universities or military contracts.  We have not got big military investment or a space programme so we have not got the spin-off of technology that would give validity to our little high technology firms.</P>
    <P>Would someone like to tell me where the basis is in an economy for small, technologically highly sophisticated firms which base themselves on the genius of a few engineers, computer designers or organic chemists?  I do not see this happening; I wish I did. I am not saying this in a carping attitude but I just do not see it happening.</P>
    <P>One of the conditions of entry to the Community is that there is a free movement of capital.  We have had a free movement of capital to Britain for a very long time.  It is something I have always deplored and will continue to do so.  The result is that the money goes and the people go after it.  I shall return to that later but I would like to deal with the question of how to develop some of the potential we now know we have.</P>
    <P>I suppose socialists have been saying throughout the life of the State that there were minerals in this country. As a young man I remember saying this to people and they would laugh at me and say, &ldquo;All the surveys have been done and there are no minerals&rdquo;. Suddenly we now have minerals.  They were there all the time.  The people who find the minerals are engineers and scientists on a payroll who will work for anyone able to pay them, but the State never paid them to go and look for minerals.  We give tax holidays to the people who bought the rights and now export the minerals but apart from giving work to workers, which is useful, they are of no other benefit to the country.  The same sort of thing will happen to everything we have in the circumstances of the EEC Germany is richer than Britain, France is richer than Britain.  There will be plenty of capital floating around and anything which is exploitable in the country may possibly be exploited. This will be good for providing jobs but it will mean we will not own the country; other people will.  In regard to any industrial development which <Col N="585" /> occurs we shall see the reconquest of this country by cheque-book&mdash;what there is left to reconquer&mdash;a great deal has been reconquered already.</P>
    <P>I have always had a special interest in the sea.  A fantastic piece of good luck for this country, after centuries of bad luck, is that we have a huge continental shelf which is now becoming exploitable from the mineral point of view.  It has not been referred to at all in the debate but it is one of the greatest potentials we might conceivably have.  Who is going to exploit it? It will be very, very expensive to do it. It will mean drilling at sea which is very expensive, requires high technology and is very chancy.  Just as in drilling for oil, one may have to drill many holes before getting a pay-off.  There is not the capital in this country to do this and because our universities are not training people for that sort of techniques we will not have the engineers or the geologists to do this work but we will have the labourers; we will be able to do the unskilled work.  The minerals will be Irish because they come from the Irish continental shelf but in terms of benefit, profit and the building up of skills in this island it will not be Irish.  It will be of no benefit to us but it will be of a great deal of benefit to the big, powerful, integrated, supranational companies which already exist and which are the driving force of the EEC.  It will be a great deal of good to the supranational banks which have now merged with the companies.  Industry and finance are now inextricably bound up together.  The only benefit to this country will be that of providing unskilled labour, if that is what we want.  It might be the destiny of the Irish to be the navvies of the European Community just as we have been the navvies of Britain, America and Australia.  If that is what we want, we should say so because that will be the end result of this policy.</P>
    <P>Some development here, more than in many European countries, has been on the basis of semi-State companies. We have been critics of the semi-State companies not for their intention but for the way that intention was carried out.  We want to see the public sector <Col N="586" /> of Irish industry stronger and not weaker.  In European terms it was already very strong; in fact it is much stronger than in most of the European Community countries.  We want to see it stronger but we want to see democratic companies who are good employers. We want to see a whole series of management changes which would make the companies not just semi-State in name but public companies in which there was real worker participation. Our criticism of public companies has always been the fact that they did not go far enough.  Our criticism was not that they existed in the first place.  Most of these companies are perfectly properly monopolies. I do not think any member of my party ever raised objection to that but how much homegrown industry would exist in this country without the semi-State companies?  When I say &ldquo;homegrown&rdquo; I do not mean the high technological companies which are being set up by foreign capital with a tax holiday.  Can we bring the semi-State companies intact into the European Community at all?  This is open to very grave doubt in my mind.  Things which have largely been built up by Fianna Fáil&mdash;in my view they have not been built up enough and are not sophisticated enough but I have always applauded the basic intention of them &mdash;will be put in jeopardy.</P>
    <P>If we want to end that strand in our national development and say it was all a mistake we are entitled so to say but we are not entitled to deceive the people by trying to put changes of policy under the carpet and pretend they did not happen.  There is a major change of policy here in regard to the whole public sector of industry because the whole philosophy, even the small print, of the European Community is hostile to such things.  Certainly such industries will not grow; many of them will wither.  We must accept a fundamental change of direction as indeed we are accepting in so many other ways but we are doing it without saying so and without discussing the implications either for national development or for the very many people employed in these industries.</P>
    <P>During much of the life of this State <Col N="587" /> we have had a protectionist strategy and after 1959 we had a strategy of saying to any company with an international reputation and sophisticated technology, &ldquo;Please come in and set up.  You can have a tax holiday until 1990 and a great many other incentives: sites, power extensions, training of workers, grants for premises and grants for machinery.&rdquo;  That was one way to develop the economy.  In my view, and I have expressed it before so I am not going to elaborate on it here, it was a very shortsighted way.  It sold off our capital.  The ownership of these assets passed out of our hands and in return jobs were created.  There was no other benefit to this country but it was a way of getting things going.  That must be totally abandoned in a European Community.  It is suggested to us benevolently in this document that in some way we can negotiate our special arrangements into the system.  Paragraph 4.29 of this Government document which I am continuously quoting says:</P>
    <P>Our system of industrial grants, as at present operated, is of national application with regional variations... On joining the European Communities our State aids would come under review by the Commission, with a view to determining their compatibility with the Common Market, and we would maintain that, having regard to the purpose of these incentives for industrial development and the circumstances of the Irish economy, they are in keeping with the objectives of the Treaty.</P>
    <P>I wrote: &ldquo;Oh yeah&rdquo; in the margin when I came to that part a few months ago because I do not think this is a fair, blunt or accurate representation of the situation.  I believe that those grants and those tax holidays will be negotiable into the European Community. In fact, we will not be able to negotiate these things into the Community.  That leads us to ask the question: why did the industries which came here since 1959 do so? Will they continue to do so under European Community conditions?  Particularly after the free trade agreement, <Col N="588" /> they came here because of low labour costs and because for an extremely small investment they got access to the British market.</P>
    <P>Under EEC conditions a firm wanting access to the 250 million people of the Community will be either inside it or outside it.  If it is outside, the arguments for locating in Ireland seem to me rather weak.  We will not be able to offer them the special incentives we previously offered.  We will not be able to offer them, after a very short time, lower labour costs.  We shall be able to do so for a while but this will fade away.  We will not be able to offer them short transport routes to the great centres of population in Germany, Holland, Belgium, France and south-east England.  In my view&mdash;and these people do their sums carefully&mdash;we will not be able to offer them powerful incentives to come here comparable with the quite real incentives they had in the past.  If they are inside the Community, they will want to be close to the centres of consumption; if they are outside, they will want to be close to the centres of consumption. In other words, inside the Community&mdash;and personally I take the regional policy as so much window dressing; I do not believe it in the least; I think it is hot air; it is strictly to deceive the mug&mdash;I do not think there is any value of protection for us in the regional policy.  What will happen is that industry will tend to be concentrated around centres that are already dynamic sucking the rest of the area dry.  This is the process that sucked dry the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, when it was united, emptied Scotland and the west of Ireland and built up Britain in certain parts, the south-east and midlands, into one of the most powerful nations of the world at our expense, and the expense of the Scots.</P>
    <P>Now in the EEC, industry will be sucked into the area of north-east Germany, Holland, Belgium, north-eastern France and down to Paris as one industrial region, from Marseilles over to the north of Italy, another industrial region, and the south-east of England with, perhaps, the midlands, already developed, as another industrial <Col N="589" /> region, and that will be it.  If your basic philosophy of industrial development is free competition and <i>laissez faire</i> capitalism, which it is in the European Community, how do we expect industry to grow in places where there are very strong arguments against it?</P>
    <P>I had a most interesting letter from someone who had the goodness to write to me recently relating to the big petrochemical combine, BASF.  Some Irish journalists recently went to visit them and they met the man who is now head of the world-wide development division of BASF, Professor Fleischmann.  He told those Irish journalists that BASF, which is an absolutely enormous, world-scale company, had no interest in setting up in Ireland inside the European Community because they were already established there but they would have an interest in setting up in Ireland provided they got an oil refinery along with their plant if Ireland was outside the Community because on that basis they could have a crack at the rest of the world.  I give this as a particular, factual instance, as the argument of BASF who do their homework carefully.  These big international combines do not give a damn about the hair colour or eye colour, national aspirations or traditions of the places where they set up their factories; they are simply concerned with maximising their profits.  They do sophisticated homework to decide on the spot where profit will be highest. Their arithmetic for BASF comes out as: Ireland outside EEC may be worth looking at; Ireland in the EEC, because we are already strong there, is not worth looking at.</P>
    <P>I believe that argument will apply to many different companies because in conditions of free competition, any special form of local incentive, any distortion of competition, as they put it, is prohibited.  What have we to offer? What we had to offer here between 1959 and 1970 with the Lemass policy, if I may so describe it in the shorthand of industrial terminology, was quite clear.  I do not think it was a good policy, but I could see that it worked.  I can see that it has created jobs.  I admit the jobs and I welcome them to the extent that they were better than <Col N="590" /> nothing although I do not think it was a good long-term policy.  Would somebody from the Government benches please explain to me what the economic arguments would be for big foreign industry to locate here if we are inside the EEC?  Is it in terms of labour costs, transport costs, the developed infrastructure we have, closeness to markets, the skill of our labour force, that our universities are so sophisticated in electronics or organic chemistry or something?  What is the reason?  Somebody somewhere must have some reason.  If they are so complacent as to say that we have a good industrial future in the European Community, there must be reasons but it would be nice to know them.</P>
    <P>The world will always want to drink Guinness but Guinness is now a British company and a Nigerian company and is established in various other parts of the world.  It is not an Irish company any more.  We shall always have some specialist products, specialist drink, but where are the other sections of Irish industry that by quality or their special nature, or their technological sophistication, or the fact that we alone in the world can do it and nobody else can, will command a market?  Where are the industries that will grow rapidly and have a great future when this real ruthless competition of 250 million people breaks out?  I think there is a great deal of whistling in the dark.  For instance, I think the statement that the adaptation of the period since the late fifties has made us fit for the unfettered and rough competition of some of the largest and most sophisticated companies in the world is just dreaming. If I were a small or middle sized Irish industrialist I should be profoundly alarmed.  Where is the Irish company that will stand up in the textile area to Courtaulds, to name a name?  We had quite a heartening growth in our textile industry.  What future has it now?  We could name the people, if we wanted to do so, who contributed to this growth as entepreneurs and entrepreneurs are welcome always in whatever social environment they find themselves. Their motivation is generally not money but the desire to change things and that sort of vigour and <Col N="591" /> attack is a welcome human quality that has existed as long as mankind has existed and will go on existing.  It is not a matter of how much you get paid but a matter of your basic psychology and make-up.</P>
    <P>These entrepreneurs are great people who changed the nature of our community, but why now should the people who have shown this great vigour, this socially valuable and rare quality in building up Irish industry in the last ten years, feel confident that their small, financially impoverished companies, lacking research and development, will be able to make dramatic progress in the conditions of competitive Europe?  I wish the people who say that would just poke around Europe a little, get the feel of it and get to know how tough and how effective it is, because this seems to me to be cloud cuckooland; it will be much more difficult than that.</P>
    <P>I have not tried, nor do I intend, to deal with specific sections of Irish industry.  There have been speeches that dealt with the small print, but I am saying that inside the EEC the advantages that caused our present progress in industry will disappear.  I admit the possibility that I may be wrong and I should like to be proven wrong, but I should like to hear the reasons why existing industries will grow dramatically, if there are any, and I should like to hear the reason why the big industrialist in the United States or in Japan or indeed in Frankfurt or London, would choose an Irish location for a new factory, a factory which after all would be inside the EEC and would therefore be in all its economic environment totally equivalent to a factory in Frankfurt or in Turin, Marseilles or anywhere else.  Why here?  I do not know.  There may be a reason and I would appreciate being told.</P>
    <P>I should like now to turn to agriculture and again, without going into the small print, to go through the chapter in the Government publication. Most of the speech of the Minister for Agriculture was a recapitulation of what is in the other slightly extended document, and this gives projections, economists' estimates about beef, milk, <Col N="592" /> eggs, pigmeat, wheat, sugar, vegetables and so on.  It is very nice.  Any economist can get a piece of paper, work away and produce estimates.  Somebody like myself who is not a professional economist can also get a sheet of paper and work away.  I do not intend to follow all the arguments, product by product, but it is important to look at some of the basic arguments behind the general opinions expressed.</P>
    <P>It is important to issue a warning to Irish agriculture.  I do not know whether the economists who work for the Department of Agriculture are a different group from those who work for other Departments or whether they are all the same people, but this is a place where, it seems to me, for reasons which I shall try to indicate, the projections are very seriously and widely wrong.  The prospects for our agriculture are nothing like as good as they are made out to be in both of these Government documents, the specialist one on agriculture and the general one. What is more serious in a sense is that they are nothing like as good as the agricultural community as a whole believe them to be.  People are planning investment and organising their farming with the conviction that it will be great.  Therefore I want gently to float off the idea that it will not be great, that it will be difficult, but I want to give the reasons why.</P>
    <P>We have suffered during the life of this State because of British agricultural policy and the British price support system.  This policy has been explained in various ways, but I think there are two essential parts to it. Britain is no longer the workshop of the world, but as a major industrial nation with an interest in exporting, Britain was concerned to have her prices for manufactured goods as low as possible and was therefore concerned, as I said earlier has been the case in respect of every industrialised country in the world, to have cheap food.  However, there was another motivation besides that.  I do not know if this has ever occurred consciously to anybody, and I am not suggesting that the people who make British economic policy are consciously very wicked, but when you are in the position of an <Col N="593" /> imperial power it works out wickedly because it oppresses and exploits other weaker people all over the world.</P>
    <P>The British wanted cheap food in order to keep down the price of their manufactured products, but they also wanted to keep their farmers reasonably happy and voting Tory.  The farmers were mostly big farmers, if you leave out places like bits of Wales and bits of Scotland.  They were mostly rich men, part of the ruling class who went to the right schools and universities, who were members of the right club and all the rest of it.  The policy that was worked out was that you sold food very cheaply at home, at a price that would bankrupt your own farmers, but you paid your own farmers subsidies running into hundreds of millions of pounds to keep them economically viable.</P>
    <P>The beauty of that system was that apart from getting cheap food, it exploited all the other suppliers, who, whether it was the Africans with tropical products or the Irish or the Danes, had to put their agricultural produce into their market without the benefit of subsidies, and therefore had to sell their products at a fantastically low price.  In Ireland, in order to give our rural community any kind of standard of living at all, we had to subsidise our farmers very heavily in terms of our total wealth and national economy. This was a permissible thing to do but what we were in fact doing with our farm subsidies was seeing that the British housewife got cheap eggs, cheap butter and cheap meat.  The effect of Britain as the biggest food importer in the world following a policy of price supports to her own farmers was that the other suppliers were exploited. In other words, just like black Africa with tropical products, with oils and things like that, just like the Danes, agriculturally we stood in a colonial relationship with Britain.  We were still Britain's colony, although we were formally independent, in regard to agriculture.  Even though the British were making benevolent noises they were down the years still exploiting us through their price support system, as indeed they were exploiting many other people.  That was the <Col N="594" /> beauty of having an empire: you got your cheap food; you got a whole lot of people all over the world to supply it and your own farmers did not do too badly.  It is a nice scheme if you happen to be imperial Britain.  This has damned us every step of the way in the whole life of the State.</P>
    <P>In the opening years of the EEC, for reasons that I gave earlier&mdash;in regard to neutralising the small farmers politically before you abolish them&mdash; the small farmers were given a high price for their products.  This high price did, in fact, neutralise them politically but it also called forth the surpluses that at the moment are threatening to disrupt the whole of the world market in dairy produce let alone the markets inside the European Community. Therefore, with the emergence of the butter mountain and lots of other mountains of surplus foods in the European Community, they set about a reversal of their policy.  In fact, it was not a reversal that presented them with any grief anyway because in the last decade they have halved the number of people on the land and in the next decade they plan to halve the number again so that at the end of the period small producers in the countryside will have ceased to exist pretty well as a class and even if they do exist they will have no political power.  The only people who will exist in the countryside will be the big farmers who are the natural allies, and, indeed, often the same people, of big industrialists, bankers and the rest.  You will get the growth of big capitalism in the countryside.  That is the policy of the European Community in regard to agriculture.</P>
    <P>We could talk about the price of butter or of any product until we were black in the face but in a nutshell the policy of the European Community towards the countryside is expressed in the Mansholt Plan.  We will see in a minute what the provisions of that plan are because there is a certain amount of amusement to be derived from my point of view from reading the presentation of the Mansholt Plan and the Government's two documents on it.  The objective of the plan is, first, to get cheap food which is what industrial <Col N="595" /> Europe, both the working classes and the factory owners want, to get high productivity in food and to abolish the small producers who are inefficient and who are high-cost producers. The Mansholt Plan is, in fact, the perfectly logical summing up of the European Community in regard to the countryside.  The Mansholt Plan far from being peripheral in this context is absolutely central.</P>
    <P>I want to derive my little bit of amusement, if I may, by talking about the way in which the plan is treated in the different publications.  Its importance is recognised in the document of last April.  In chapter 5, on agriculture and fisheries, they get down to what it is right away.  They say it is to increase agricultural productivity by promoting technical progress, <i>et cetera,</i> to ensure a fair standard of living by increasing individual earnings and to stabilise markets, guarantee regular supplies and ensure reasonable prices to consumers.  These are all admirable objectives to which every big-hearted, simple, direct punter could happily subscribe&mdash;nice level prices and high productivity so that the food will not be too dear and yet the farmers will not be too hard up and all the rest of it.  But paragraph 5.5 says, and this is a bit of a crunch for Ireland, for a reason to which I will come in a minute, that the recommendations comprised a number of measures for reducing the acreage of farmland in the Community, for increasing the size of holdings and agricultural enterprises and for facilitating the reduction in numbers engaged in agriculture. That looks a little different. Then if we turn to the other Government document <i>Irish Agriculture and Fisheries in the EEC</i> we find it says the same thing but it is set out in a slightly more ample form but in the same basically bland and natural way. However, in the June issue of this magazine <i>European Community,</i> a semi-official magazine one would think, the producers did not have the same political sensitivity as to what Mansholt meant.  They are a little more blunt and they spell out&mdash;as has been spelt out here&mdash;what Mansholt means in real terms.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="596" /> We have, of course, been told that the Mansholt Plan was only a plan; that it was only a suggestion to one of their commissioners, that it did not really represent European thinking at all, or that it would be vastly modified. But this magazine <i>European Community,</i> No. 6, June, 1970, on page 6 states that &ldquo;after 15 months of public debate on the Mansholt Plan the Commission has now submitted to the Council of Ministers its first draft legislation, aimed at putting some of these ideas into practice&rdquo;.  And it says quite bluntly, and this is still on page 6, that &ldquo;the basic premise was that there were too many inefficient small farmers in the Six&rdquo;.  That is the basic of the Mansholt Plan.</P>

      <P>I was indicating from this semi-official publication from the <Col N="597" /> European Community that, in fact, the Mansholt Plan represents the mainstream of European Community thought on the question of agriculture. It is relevant in this context to emphasise again to the farmers of Ireland the sort of guidelines which have been set as to what, in Mansholt's view and in the view of the European Commission, constitutes a viable farm.  The standards set are as follows: for grain or root crops, 200 to 300 acres; for dairy cows, 40 to 60 head per farm; for beef cattle, 150 to 200 head of cattle; for chickens for egg-laying purposes, 10,000; for poultry producing chickens for table use, 100,000 birds in one enterprise.  Mansholt says that numbers below these numbers are &ldquo;not viable&rdquo;.  If we turn to the dairy cows and dry stock there is mention of 40 to 60 dairy cows and 150 to 200 dry stock.  While ordinary supports of the type that presently exist in Britain and in Ireland will have to go under the EEC, nevertheless through advisory and other specialist services there will be benefits and subsidies for farmers under European Community conditions.  It has been seriously suggested in the European Commission that those benefits will be cut off to undertakings below the size mentioned.

    <P>The whole essence of the Mansholt Plan is that it gets the small farmers off the land quickly and holds the present prices but there is no promise of immediately lowering the prices. There is mention of holding the prices level and of letting 5 per cent to 6 per cent per annum of inflation erode them while other prices rise so that the real price is going to drop every year by uncompensated inflation.  It is perfectly permissible to decide to solve the problems of the countryside in this way.  It is also perfectly permissible for our Government to adhere without reservations to the Treaty of Rome. Perhaps I could quote the Minister for External Affairs on television because I heard him say, when he had just come back, that with us they were not dealing with someone who has some reservations.  If my understanding of the English language is correct that <Col N="598" /> means that they were dealing with somebody with no reservations.  I would like to ask the members of the Fianna Fáil Party who are in rural communities about this.  I heard Deputy Carter speaking on the Mansholt Plan and I suggest I should extend to him the courtesy of suggesting that he was not familiar with what is in it.</P>

      <P>Certain parts of Fianna Fáil policy are admirable.  I intend to analyse Fianna Fáil policy at length in regard to the EEC policy.  I will tell the Deputy the bits I like.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole point about the Mansholt Plan is that, as this magazine, the June issue of <i>European Community</i> shows, it represents the main stream thinking of the European Commission, which is an undemocratic body of international bureaucrats who are not amenable to governmental pressures. The long-term interest of both urban workers and employers of all sorts inside the Community is to produce cheap food.  Their long-term wish will prevail over the wish of the rural community for high food prices.  In real terms, I expect to see a steady erosion in real returns for what farmers have to sell over the next decade.  In 1961 had we gone in we would have had up to ten good years.  Our farmers can expect much less than they hoped they <Col N="600" /> would get.  We will lose subsidies for the countryside which will no longer be paid under the EEC.  We will lose subsidies to the tune of £40 million a year or so.  We will need much progress to compensate the countryside for such loss.  If one applies Mansholt criteria which I have quoted&mdash;figures like 40 to 60 dairy cows, 150 to 200 head of dry stock, and 100,000 broilers &mdash;what does this make of the west? The other consideration in the Mansholt Plan is that land is taken out of use.  All possible production must be got out of a small acreage and the less good land should be taken over for other purposes and not farmed.</P>
    <P>This is much too important for us to play any sort of party games with. It means the destruction of the west. My own constituency is one where the expectations under Mansholt-type farming are not bad at all in some respects.  The prospects for the glass-house owners in north County Dublin and for the vegetable growers, who have put a lot of money into glass, are not good even according to the optimistic statements of the Government document.  Some of the other agricultural producers in North County Dublin do quite well.  However, I would have thought the West of Ireland faces a really dire prospect. How many farms in that area have between 40 and 60 cows?  They will go out of production long before they can get into what Mansholt would consider an economic parameter.</P>
    <P>Let us turn to another aspect of the section of the Government document that makes predictions for output through this decade.  If we join the Common Market cultivated acreage in Ireland will fall, as is planned in the EEC, and we will replace small farms with larger ones.  Experience throughout the world has been that when farm size increases, while the output per enterprise may increase, output per acre generally diminishes.  Small farmers have the need to be more intensive per acre than big farmers.  We have two effects: first, diminishing acreage and, secondly, the tendency to diminished output per acre because of an increase in farm size.</P>
    <P>As against this we balance some <Col N="601" /> intensification; we get some higher production from that; but where will the extra output that the Government say we will have at the end of the decade come from?  I can see diminished total acreage and increased farm size tending to push production down. I can see intensification, provided it is profitable and if prices remain at the same level as they are now in real terms, pushing production upwards. However, I do not see these circumstances generating the dramatic increase in production we have been so casually promised in the White Paper. This appears to me to be the same kind of euphoria, the same kind of belief that it will be all right, as characterises the Government's lack of analysis and ruthlessness and their hope that things will somehow turn out all right.</P>
    <P>There are other interesting points that will not be tenable.  A farmer can opt not to pay tax but large farmers will be taxed in the EEC.  They are entitled to opt for tax but they are also entitled to be told that with the VAT they will be in a tax situation. We have had great play with the tier system of milk prices. Long before this was Government policy I called for such a system.  A benevolent Government are entitled to differentiate between large and small producers in the price of milk.  We have now a very complex tier-price system.  We have not got it for a very long time but with &ldquo;no reservations&rdquo; according to the Minister for External Affairs we accept participation in the EEC which will sweep it away.  The Government cannot have it both ways. Do they believe the tier-price system is right or do they believe that the EEC flat rate for milk is right?  If the Government believe that the tier-price system they recently introduced is the right one, how can they say they have no reservations about entering the Common Market?</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCarter" hpid="Mr. Carter Mr. Carter">

      <P>These remarks are so fatuous I am tempted not to answer <Col N="602" /> them.  I would have to extend my charity to suggest that Deputy Carter does not have any familiarity with the price arrangements for milk in the EEC.  The whole point of the price arrangements for creamery milk in the Common Market is that there will be no &ldquo;best market&rdquo;.  There will be a flat rate in every country for every milk producer everywhere&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The EEC target price&mdash; and I do not propose to enter into a discussion about the target price and the actual price&mdash;for milk at 3½ per cent butter fat is 3s 9d per gallon; it was 2s 4d per gallon in 1968.  For the Deputy's information, I am quoting from page 37 of the major document the Government put out on this question. Had he read that major document he would possess the answer.  I have tried to conduct this debate without going into the small print, assuming that Deputies had familiarised themselves with the contents of the documents put at their disposal.  Detailed answers to questions can be found by perusal of the table of contents and the general contents of the various Government documents.  Milk is also discussed in the separate document specifically regarding Irish agriculture and fisheries in the EEC, dated April, 1970, which the Government issued after the main document.

      <P>The point I was making is that the tier system for milk is permissible in our circumstances but it is contrary to the policy of the EEC and not even Fianna Fáil can have it both ways.  They must decide that they have no reservations about the European system or they must decide to uphold the present system and, therefore, have reservations.</P>
      <P>Apparently, the whole content of agricultural policy in the last 30 or 40 years is now considered to have been wrong.  I say &ldquo;apparently&rdquo; because it is only wrong on the basis that we accept the agricultural policy of the EEC without reservation.  The policy in regard to the Land Commission, to smallholdings, in regard to subsidies and price differentials, to special treatment for areas in the West of Ireland and other designated areas that require assistance, was wrong if we accept the Commission's policy.  Of course, at election times it can be said that it was wrong.  It is all magnificently confused and you can pull out any strand of your policy to suit any occasion because, apparently, it is not necessary when you change your policy to tell the public.  The objective apparently is to have a situation of maximum confusion where you can tell whatever they want to hear to whatever audience you happen to address.  Of course, a political party have the right to change their policy but, equally, they have a duty to honest debate, to say when the change occurred and not try to skate over the matter.</P>

      <P>Perhaps this is a matter of some detail which either Deputy Bruton or I could take up privately or which we could discuss on another occassion on the Estimate for Agriculture.  Because I have a lot more to say and I am not sure that my voice will hold out for all I want to say, I shall not enter into detail on the matter at this stage.</P>
      <P>I was making the general point that the basic agricultural attitude, outlook and philosophy of the European Community are totally at variance with those that have been followed in Ireland during the life of the State.  Therefore, we are faced&mdash;above all, the Government are faced&mdash;with telling the truth to the public about this and in not trying to skate over a total change of direction in regard to the countryside by pretending it did not happen. There is a lack of frankness here that will inevitably lead to confusion and to a lack of credibility.</P>
      <P>I shall not deal section by section with the predictions made in regard to agriculture.  For the reasons I have indicated, these predictions seem to me to be trivial and hardly worth serious consideration because they are based on assumptions that are totally unwarranted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to deal very briefly with the matter of fisheries.  It is public knowledge that I have been concerned for a long time and long before I came to <Col N="605" /> this House with the sea and fisheries. I also have the added personal incentive in that I represent a constituency that is important for Irish fishing.  This is also a matter of direct interest to the other Deputies representing my constituency. I quote from paragraph 5.22 of the section on fisheries, on page 46:</P>
    <P>...some difficulties could arise from any decision which might be adopted by the Community, within the framework of the proposed common policy for fisheries, in regard to access to fishing grounds within the exclusive fishery limits of the member States...</P>
    <P>There is no part of Europe for which the problem of fishery limits has greater relevance than Ireland.  Many of the Community states have no significant fisheries but, like anybody else, they have a need for fish in so far as they have a need for a varied diet.  On the other hand, we have vast fishing grounds.  We have an enormous coastline but we have a very underdeveloped fishing industry&mdash;an industry that is in need of protection.  We have an industry that would have been vastly bigger if it were not for the capital starvation that occurred because we have no control over the outflow of naturally accruing and accumulating wealth in Ireland. The underdeveloped state of the fishing industry is not due to any fault of the fishermen but it is due to the climate in regard to capital, a climate that was permitted to exist by successive Governments.</P>
    <P>The interesting remark I wish to make in relation to fishery limits is the reaction of another country among the applicants where fisheries are very important and whose fishing industry is much more developed than ours, namely, Norway.  The Norwegians have had the wit to say to the Commission prior to their serious negotiations that &ldquo;If you are settling things in regard to fishery limits and in regard to the access of other Members of the Community to fisheries, then, you must discuss it with the countries on whom it most bears&rdquo;.  The joke is that between our Government, as an EEC applicant, and the Norwegian Government, as an applicant with similar problems to ours&mdash;in this context, I <Col N="606" /> might make a clear paraenesis for the setting up of an embassy in Oslo&mdash; there is no liaison.  However, the Norwegians had the wit to try to get themselves involved in the discussions. They did not succeed but the die will be cast before entry is decided.  They might conceivably have succeeded had the approach been made from the Irish and the British Governments at the same time as theirs.</P>
    <P>In reply to this debate I should like to hear whether the Irish have raised this profoundly important issue in the negotiations or whether they accept the situation which the Norwegians have not accepted but have protested about.  That is that the major decisions in regard to access to fisheries will be taken before the discussions for admission of the four applicant countries are complete.  We will accept a <i>fait accompli</i> before our accession is discussed.</P>
    <P>If the Irish Government allow the matter of fishery limits to go unargued it would be a grave omission on their part because the big fleets of the British, the Danish, the Norwegians, the Germans and the French will scour our coasts under European Community circumstances and take the fish from under the noses of our fishermen. Such is the underdeveloped state of our industry that we will not be able to respond effectively to that.  There are complacent references to the benefits that will accrue and, of course, some benefits will accrue if we join the Community. Under EEC conditions, we will have bigger outlets, but in circumstances where there is not the capital strength to build, the gains will go to the vastly bigger, capital richer and more technologically sophisticated Norwegians and not to the Irish.  I see the Parliamentary Secretary is shaking his head.</P>

      <P>Chapter VI relates to the free movement of persons, services and capital.  No small nation has ever succeeded in industrialising itself under conditions of free trade.  The free movement of capital will be the same as <Col N="608" /> that which took place after the Act of Union in 1801.  It will be the same as that which took place in Scotland after its Act of Union.  Capital will be sucked out of this country into more profitable investment in the more dynamic high-profit industries of the European Community.  This trend will not be reversed by the regional policy, which I dismissed earlier on, and we will see the people, as they have done during the lifetime of this State, go after the capital.  We cannot industrialise with free export of capital. Without industrialising we cannot increase employment.  We will see the gap in terms of wealth, capital and economic power between England and Ireland over the last 150 years getting wider and wider as it has grown wider and wider all the time since the Act of Union.  To quote again those amazing words of the Minister for External Affairs, we are now accepting without any reservations the outflow of capital from this country.  Deputies on these benches have always deplored the lack of control of capital outflow in this State.  It is the primary cause of our lack of industrial development.  Unless capital is dammed up it flows away to where the return is highest.  We fondly think that somehow the accumulating capital will stay here under European Community circumstances.  It will not. It will go to the dynamic areas and the people will go after it.</P>
      <P>Initially, we were part of the sterling area with no currency control.  In a few years we will be part of an area which will be supra-European and we will suffer the same haemorrhage from which we have suffered over the last 150 years.  It will be the Act of Union all over again, but bigger and stronger.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have accepted that we must change our system of taxation to value added tax.  To the extent that such a tax can be made socially progressive by excluding from its operations certain ranges of goods it is something that can play a useful role as taxation mechanism.  It is something to which, <i>per se</i>, we are not opposed.  The added value tax is a more sophisticated tax than either the turnover or the wholesale tax.  It is certainly capable of being used in a more sophisticated way.  We <Col N="609" /> can establish social priorities and exclude certain areas from its scope.  I would be far from saying that a change to value added tax was necessarily a retrograde step, but it is again a question of whether taxation will be direct or indirect.  The philosophy of the European Economic Community is to diminish direct taxation and increase indirect taxation.</P>
    <P>As far as we are concerned, we advance the same arguments against dependence on indirect taxation as we advanced against the turnover tax in the last Budget.  We believe one of the objectives of taxation is to transfer wealth from rich to poor.  We believe this is best done through a graduated income tax, through direct taxation plus a capital gains tax and forms of company taxation.  We do not believe it is best done through an across-the-counter taxation of a turnover tax kind.  The poorer sections of the community usually spend on food half their income, vastly more than the richer sections for whom food expenditure may represent only 10 per cent of income.  One can see the argument for the present taxation system from the point of view of simplicity, but it is socially unjust and inequitable and it bears most heavily on those least able to pay.  We would advance the same criticism of a value added tax in the general political and economic climate obtaining in the EEC because there <i>laissez faire</i> is king, profit is king, competition is king and anything that facilitates more competition and effective production is king.</P>
    <P>From the point of view of genuine competition in industry value added tax is a reasonable tax, but it is one that bears most heavily on the poorest sections and, therefore, we consider it unjust, inequitable and retrograde.  We do not believe in the present prevailing climate in the EEC that it will be used in a progressive way with certain areas excluded.  We believe it will be used in an unsophisticated way as the turnover tax is used at the moment.  The future of the EEC will be decided upon the struggle of the ordinary people inside it.  It will be within the power of the ordinary people to civilise, humanise and avoid the unjust and socially <Col N="610" /> objectionable aspects of this tax as it operates at present.  We cannot give approval to it as it currently operates, as it would operate in the present environment in the circumstances of Irish accession.  There seems to be in this country a belief, not well grounded, that somehow or other the regional policy of the European Community would make things all right for us, that the problem of the west, the problem of the small farmer, could somehow be solved with the use of vast European funds under regional schemes.</P>
    <P>I looked four years ago now in some detail at the work of the regional schemes in Brittany.  I looked also in a less specifically clear-cut context of a designated area at regional development schemes of a rather grandiose sort in the south-west of France and I think again in this area we are cherishing illusions.  I want to give a quotation which seems to me a not unfair one about regional policy from an earlier Government document entitled <i>European Communities</i> which was laid before the Oireachtas in April, 1967.  It is made quite clear in all of the European Community statements about regional development that you will not have a long-term rescue operation; that you can have a short-term operation if your economists guarantee you that it will become economically viable within the understanding of the Community in a short time and, if that cannot be guaranteed, then by and large the aid is not forthcoming.  I quote now from a rather meticulous document which was written almost three years ago by an anonymous civil servant:</P>
    <P>In the large peripheral area of the EEC the first step, the Commission thinks, should be to promote the growth of industrial development poles where industrial activities and complementary services would be grouped together to form a cohesive whole capable after initial aid of self-sustained development.</P>
    <P>There is the crux of it.  The basic thought behind the regional policy of the EEC is to ask the question: &ldquo;Can you make it economically viable in terms of <i>laissez faire</i> free competition within a short period?  If you can, invest <Col N="611" /> in it, but if you cannot, then kiss it off and forget about it and let the people go somewhere else.&rdquo;  This is the impression given by this anonymous civil servant who prepared this three years ago.  This presumably was somebody doing a job who had no axe to grind.  I quoted it because it is a very fair summary of all I have read and all I have seen about the regional policy of the EEC.  The criteria are strictly the criteria of modern, second-half of the 20th century, capitalism.  The criteria are the criteria of profit: &ldquo;Can you make it profitable quickly? If you cannot, do not bother; if you can, do it.&rdquo;  This term &ldquo;development poles&rdquo; which keeps occurring in the European Community documentation is, in fact, extraordinarily reminiscent of the term &ldquo;growth centres&rdquo; which we heard about from other economic planners, again whose fundamental idea was based on arguments of profitability, arguments of modern capitalism: can you make it viable in capitalist terms within a reasonable space of time?</P>
    <P>The planning of socialists is of a totally different sort because we think the criteria should be human need and not rate of profit.  My conviction is that for human reasons, cultural reasons and historical reasons, we have an obligation to preserve the West of Ireland but my conviction is that by no yardsticks which could be worked out by European Commission economists could the community of the West of Ireland be made economically viable within any predictable or finite period of time.  I am therefore convinced by all the thinking I have seen by European Commission economists and by those who talk about regional planning that while they might be prepared to accept, let us say, the Shannon as a &ldquo;development pole&rdquo; or, if you prefer, &ldquo;a growth centre&rdquo;, they would not be prepared to accept the West of Ireland as such under their thinking.</P>
    <P>There might be some argument, of course, for the whole of Ireland.  Such are the conditions of the east relative to the real conditions in the EEC, there might be some argument for the whole of Ireland becoming a development area, but I think we would make a <Col N="612" /> terrible miscalculation with a vastly important national asset which cannot be replaced if we fumble it.  If we wreck the West in the next decade or the next quarter of a century then there is nothing you can do; it is gone. It seems to me we would be taking a terrible risk with it if we believed it would be saved and the problem would somehow be solved by the thinking which at present animates the Commission in regard to regional development. Their thinking is, in fact, <i>laissez faire</i> capitalist thinking.  I do not say this to score a political point &mdash;it is far more important than party football&mdash;but I believe we can only wreck the West once and there is no replacing it.  It is very nearly wrecked already.  If we put our faith in the present methods, in the present outlook, in the present techniques, in the present political and economic philosophy of the European Commission through its regional policy, then we will be putting our faith in something which is not worthy of that faith.  We will end by destroying something which I believe to be worth saving.</P>

      <P>I shall come to that. I am in fact at page 13 of my notes which extend to page 19.  I will be discussing the alternatives open to us, the benefits and the drawbacks of the different courses.  Any course obviously has benefits and drawbacks. There is no simple way out of a difficult dilemma and I am not suggesting there is.  I want to assure the Parliamentary Secretary that I shall try to offer constructive alternatives when I come to that part of my speech.  At present I am simply criticising the documents laid by the Government before the House.  This is only part of what I have to say.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I come now to the section on social policy.  Let us chalk up the good things about the Community as well as the bad.  Much of the social policy in the European Community is admirable, <Col N="613" /> long overdue in Ireland and wholly desirable.  But the whole point about it is that we do not have to be in the EEC to have this.  We could have it as of now if we could see a way to sustain economic growth in a socially useful manner.  But social policy cannot be a factor in deciding whether we stay out or go into the Community because social policy in large part has been forced on the Commission by the activities of the left wing parties and the trade unions, by the ordinary struggle of the working people of Europe to generate a milieu in which they could have some sort of an honourable and decent existence.  It has not been in the main stream of the Commission's thinking; it has been won largely by the united working class of the six countries.  There is no reason why a similar process could not win it in this country.</P>
    <P>I do not think good social services are ever given to working people by a ruling class as a charity.  Whatever the benevolence of the ruling class they obviously diminish their profits if they give something away in good social services.  Obviously, then, they have an interest in having the lowest possible labour costs for whatever they are producing.  They, therefore, have an interest in the long run&mdash;of course there is the exceptional honourable case &mdash;in having the worst possible social services, and of course somebody has to pay for them.</P>
    <P>But in many ways the social policy is admirable.  However, though it is admirable on paper, let us say that, like many other statements of intention, it is very far from realisation.  It is fair to say to the people of Ireland, to the women of Ireland in particular, that, though equal opportunities and equal pay for women for equal work is an Article of the Treaty of Rome, the Treaty of Rome is now more than a decade in operation.  One has only to look around Europe to see that equal pay for equal work for women certainly appears to be as far away inside the EEC as it is in Ireland.  I think there is a sort of tradition of paying lip-service to it as a desirable thing, on the condition that nobody asks you to do anything about it.  Of course, it is a difficult problem.  Nobody is <Col N="614" /> pretending it can be solved by a stroke of a pen.  Efforts to do so, as distinct from the intention in the Treaty, have been extraordinarily sparse.  One can say the same for other bits of the social policy.  There is nothing in Ireland, in my experience&mdash;though, by and large, statistically, we are far poorer than any of the present Six, <i>per capita</i>&mdash; to compare with the conditions under which the immigrant workers function in slums, in tintowns, on the suburbs of many Community cities.  With the social services, nobody seems to think it important if these people are Spanish, southern Italians, Turks, Algerians, and so on.  I have seen the exact same thing in the fruit-growing areas of southern France where Spanish migrant labour comes and where these migrants live under conditions of squalor, exploitation and degradation.  We should not be misled by the admirable aspirations of the social sections of the Treaty of Rome into believing that, in terms of social services, we would suddenly have a great improvement. That ends the section which involves a critique of the documents offered to us by the Government.</P>
    <P>I want to turn to a few issues which seem to me of vast importance in relation to our accession or otherwise to the EEC and which are not mentioned at all in what either Government spokesman or Government publications had to say.  I want to refer, in the first place, to what I call&mdash;I think correctly and justifiably&mdash;the empire of the EEC.  There are special agreements with 18 African nations, ex-French colonies under the Yahounde Agreements.  There are agreements with a number of other African countries. If Britain goes in, she will bring in with her what I choose to call her imperial connections.  Deputy Boland also uses the word &ldquo;imperialism&rdquo;: I am not quite sure if he uses it in exactly the same sense that I do.  I use the phrase in the old colonialism connotation, if you prefer it.  My conviction is that if we go into the EEC we shall find ourselves in the circumstances of exploiting the countries of black Africa.  We shall be doing it along with the British, the French, the Germans, and so on.</P>
    <P>I look on the conflict between black <Col N="615" /> and white in the present world as far more explosive, as far more dangerous and as far more a moral issue than almost any other conflict.  Speaking as an Irishman, a republican and a democrat, I should be deeply ashamed to be involved in a situation where I, or my country, participated in the exploitation of black Africans or the neo-colonial exploitation of anybody. The Irish are entitled to benefit from that neo-colonial exploitation if they so decide but, with our history, I do not think we would so decide.  The issue ought to be explained to them clearly.</P>
    <P>Let me indicate what I understand by the word &ldquo;neo-colonialism.&rdquo;  All over Africa and in parts of South America, Asia and, indeed, traditionally in Ireland, we had a circumstance where a more evolved and stronger industrial, financial and trading power established a special relationship.  There were a number of strands in this special relationship.  You exported capital from the rich metropolitan country and bought into certain crucial industries in the exploited countries. That happened in the hey-day of British imperialism in Ireland and all over the world.  It is also happening at this moment through vast American capital in a lot of countries.  It is not new, special or unique in the world.</P>
    <P>When a metropolitan colonialist country buys a significant section of the industry of a weaker country, it is able to buy the adherence of certain people in it.  It is able to modify the laws and the circumstances.  It is able to depress, as the British have done through their food subsidies, the price of raw materials produced by those countries.  Thus Britain has exploited Ireland and Africa.  It is often able to keep the agricultural produce of the country to a few crops with an unsophisticated soil and destroy the existing industries there, as happened in Ireland.  There is a whole pattern of the subverting of the government, of reducing agriculture to a mono-crop, of the buying of raw materials at low prices.</P>
    <P>There is a recognised pattern of neo-colonial exploitation.  It is happening to almost all of the southern hemisphere. <Col N="616" /> Europe is living off Africa.  It is living so well because it is exploiting Africa. North America is living so well because it is exploiting South America.  That is happening not because of foolishness or incompetence on the part of South America but because North American imperialism has them by the throat and will not let them develop.  This has relevance to the EEC.  As a matter of political honour, I hope the Irish people, with their anti-imperial traditions, will care.  Britain was the first capitalist nation.  We were the first colony in the world.  Our whole nation, practically since Cromwell, has been debauched and destroyed by imperialism over and over again.  If we come into the EEC, we shall inherit and participate in the exploitation of the remnants of the French, the British, the Dutch empires. We shall benefit from that in material terms.  I do not want it.  I should be ashamed and disgusted to benefit from the exploitation of an economically weaker Africa or Asia, but that is an inevitable part of it.</P>
    <P>The European Community has an empire and, if we participate in it, we will participate in the exploitation of that empire.  There is no escape from that.  We can like it or not and we can be damn glad, after all these centuries, to get our hands on somebody else and squeeze them.  If that is our decision, in my opinion a disgraceful one, we are entitled to make it.  It seems to me that we are not entitled to find ourselves, having hundreds of years of experience of being on the receiving end of neo-colonialism, suddenly by accession to the European Community in the position of dishing out neo-colonialism. We are not entitled to do this and to reverse every national tradition and every anti-imperialist tradition without explaining what we are doing to our people.</P>
    <P>As I said, the European Community is not a calm, neutral, benevolent philantropic organisation.  It is a capitalist organisation with the same drive towards profits and the same drive towards domination as drove Britain to occupy Africa and drove the Germans and the French and the British to fight each other twice in this century on this continent.  The leopard <Col N="617" /> has not changed its spots.  The European Community cannot be presented as a benevolent organisation.  I am not saying it is wholly malevolent either.  I am saying it is a classical capitalist structure with all the lack of morals and all the drive to exploitation that capitalist structures have.  In my opinion we will participate in the exploitation of the black people of this world, the oppressed of this world, at the most awful peril to all the national honour we possess.</P>
    <P>We are entitled so to decide as I have said, but we are entitled to be told and to know what we are doing or what is being done on our behalf by the Government.  We are not entitled to be scrambled into an imperial situation without anybody knowing anything about it.  I am very proud&mdash;and I think many Irish people are proud&mdash;that, although we are not as rich as some people we know, at least we are honourable and we do not exploit anybody. Britain can put £170 million a year, or whatever it is, into the North of Ireland out of exploitation of Africa. She is rich enough to buy off the North. She is rich enough to have better social services because of that exploitation.</P>
    <P>I would rather not have that wealth at the cost of oppressing the underprivileged people of this world.  I do not think extra wealth is a bargain any honourable Irishman would choose if he had to choose it on the condition of becoming a neo-colonialist.  I should like to hear from the Government benches how we can escape neo-colonialist exploitation of the under-developed countries standing in colonial relationship to Britain and France and some other European countries in circumstances where we have free movement of capital between those countries and ourselves.</P>
    <P>We will participate inevitably as the metropolitan exploiter.  We will participate on the wrong side&mdash;which Ireland was not usually on&mdash;of the greatest and most important conflict in the world at the moment, the conflict between the involved modern industrialised powers and the primary producers of the world, the under-developed economies.  We will find ourselves at last, at the culmination of our historical <Col N="618" /> evolution, in the position of exploiters, having denied and forsworn everything in our anti-imperialist traditions.  In those circumstances and for those reasons, if we do this I will be profoundly ashamed.</P>
    <P>I want to turn from neo-colonialism to another matter which is surely central, that is, the question of national unity.  I have said in fairly lengthy analysis of the constitutional position that, as far as I am concerned, participation in the EEC means that we lose our sovereignty and, in fact, after a period cease to be a nation.  I repeat that we are entitled to decide if we do not want to be a nation any more, but we are entitled to be offered a choice.  It seems to me that it is a pretence to suggest that we can have free movement of capital and labour and products, common taxation, common social services and common currency which will come before 1980, and retain our national identity.  I do not believe it.</P>
    <P>There is no previous historical evidence for it but there is a great deal of historical evidence to the contrary. We have it in Germany with its Zoil Verein, the amalgamation of a whole series of statelets into modern Germany. We have the same thing in Italy and in other parts of the world.  Whatever we may say in our discreet way when we are peddling it to the Irish people the June issue of the mazagine <i>European Community</i> is a little less discreet on its front cover because it gives there the pieces of the jigsaw: economic union, customs union, monetary union and political union.</P>
    <P>Of course, with accession to the European Community and with free movement of capital, goods and labour we cannot talk about nations.  President de Gaulle could talk about the Europe of the fatherlands but that is not &ldquo;on&rdquo; in real terms.  We will cease to exist as a nation so the argument about national unity and independence and all the hoo-ha and all the resignations and six dismissals over there become ridiculous.  How can you re-unify something that has ceased to exist?</P>
    <P>If we believe in the unity of Ireland it follows that we must believe in the persistence of Ireland, in the existence <Col N="619" /> and the continuance of Ireland as a nation.  The great criticism of the EEC is that it is the existence of Ireland precisely as a nation which will end. Therefore, all the hoo-ha about who is a pure republican and who is not, who will give aid and in what way, and who is the custodian of the true flame, coming from a party all of whom accept all of this without reservation, is ridiculous.  It is cloud-cuckoo-land. It is farce.  It is totally irrelevant.  As I say, etymologically you can only unify something that still exists and even with the constitutional amendments that even this document admits are necessary&mdash;I argue that others are necessary as well&mdash;Ireland will not exist as a nation.  It will be gone.</P>
    <P>Once Partition was set up, decade after decade went by and, because there were so few members of Parliament from the north in Westminster the issue was never raised in Westminster. Who raised it?  Gerry Fitt, after decades of silence.  In Westminster MPs from the north are <i>pro rata</i> part of a community of 50,000,000 people. In a European Parliament there would be Members of Parliament from the north and from the south <i>pro rata</i> in a community of 250 million people, that is, five times bigger.  If Partition could not be raised effectively, if it was swept under the carpet decade after decade in Westminster, with a dilution five times greater, with the north east of Ireland a tiny hardly serious minute peripheral issue on the very edge of Europe, does the House think that anybody in a European Parliament will give a damn about it?</P>
    <P>We will have free movement of labour between north and south, free movement of capital between north and south, and free movement of goods between north and south.  Many of the restrictions will go.  To the extent that the people in the north, the unionists, will not be able to hold up the implementation of uniform social services and civil rights throughout the whole of the community of 250 million people, they will be implemented in the north as well.  Will we then be satisfied, stop and say: &ldquo;We are all part <Col N="620" /> of the European Community anyway? We can move up and down freely and so can our money and our goods.  So that solves it and all the aspirations of the whole national movement for hundreds of years were all misguided, mistaken and ridiculous.  Now we have solved it by immersing both parts in a larger entity and by abolishing the Irish nation, and all the objectives of national unity and national independence&mdash;the two are always properly linked together&mdash;were all a mistake and all the struggling to attain them was either a mistake or it never hapened.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This is the inevitable result of saying that we must accept application to join the European Community as it exists with no reservations and that we accept the Treaty of Rome in full. There is no escaping that.  Far from participation in the European Community being a source of national unification it is a guarantee that national unification will never come and the pieces of this nation which we all profess to wish to reunify will cease to exist.  After all these centuries we are entitled to say that the whole thing is tiresome, let us ditch the lot and throw our hands in, but when we change direction on every central issue on which all the parties agree we should tell the public we have done so. We are not entitled to go on calling ourselves a Republican Party pretending that the policies of the twenties, thirties and forties are the policies of the seventies, because they are utterly different.</P>
    <P>I hope we shall hear before the debate ends from those who in the past few weeks have claimed to uphold the banner of true republicanism in this part of the country why they were Ministers in a Government which was able to say that they accepted the Treaty of Rome <i>in toto.</i>  I should like to hear them rationalise their republicanism. I would like to hear them say, &ldquo;Yes, we quarrelled about certain issues on policy on the north but we accepted what the Taoiseach said in 1967 that the only matters we would negotiate were the period of entry and the representations on the institutions&rdquo;. All these republicans sat there and saw <Col N="621" /> the Taoiseach endorse the extinction of Ireland.  There was not a little republican squeak out of one of them. After the events of the 6th May I should like to hear them explain how they could swallow the policy of the Taoiseach and the Minister for External Affairs on the EEC which jettisons Article 1 and Article 5 of the Constitution and swallows the policy which removes all the significant decisions about our economy from an elected Parliament in Dublin to an undemocratic, beaurocratic institution in Brussels.</P>
    <P>I know that in many ways it can be justified in economic terms, in terms of advantage, in terms of spending power, in terms of commodities, in terms of wealth but nowhere can it be justified in terms of republicanism, in terms of upholding Irish unity and independence because it involves the total jettisoning of every principle that the republican movement has been built on since it was founded.  There is no way out of that.  It is a ghoulish situation where they are all worked up over there about what is a less important issue, because, important as the north is at this moment, it is a lesser issue than the continuation of the nation, it is a lesser issue than the throwing away of our sovereignty.  If I may name names I should like to hear Deputy Boland explain to the House his acceptance or non-acceptance of the Government's attitude on this issue because true republicans are entitled to know what he thinks about that and what those who agree with him think about it.</P>
    <P>I want to say a word about the direction of the future evolution of the Community whether this country is a part or not.  I can see nothing to stop the European Community from evolving into a super-power comparable with the United States or the Soviet Union with all the advantages and all the drawbacks of a super-power.  It will be unified, it will have a single currency, it will have a single market, it may retain regional languages but by all the criteria that one can think of it will be one big, dynamic, aggressive, capitalist nation which will inevitably be in conflict <Col N="622" /> perhaps military&mdash;one hopes not because that will involve the destruction of vast numbers of mankind&mdash;but certainly economically and politically with the United States.</P>
    <P>It will possess an empire which it will strive to expand, just as America possesses an empire which she strives to expand.  It will come into conflict perhaps military, perhaps politically, but certainly economically with China and its empire, the Soviet Union and its empire and America and its empire. We shall be part of the metropolitan country of a big league elbowing the three other world powers of the same size, trying to grab bits of the world not in the sphere of influence of the other three and building an empire for ourselves.  As I see it, that is the way the European Community will evolve over the next decade.  I can think of forces which will counter that and I shall talk about them in a minute.  This sort of super-power posture in the world generates a great many things which do not currently exist in this country and which we are much the better for not possessing. If we do come to possess them they will take away from our honour and degrade us.</P>
    <P>Incidentally, we shall be entering a Community where there are a number of monarchies.  As far as I am concerned, I am not just an Irish republican, I am a republican.  I think the tradition of hereditary monarchy, the pomp which attends it and the brainwashing of children which goes on under monarchies, is a life-denying, humanly diminishing, disgusting spectacle. I do not want to be associated with monarchies in any circumstances if I can avoid it.  I despite monarchies and I despite nations who take their dear king or their dear queen seriously. I am a republican in general, not just in the Irish context.</P>
    <P>Once one has an empire, one has an army.  If one is a super-power competing with other super-powers there is an escalation in an effort to have the biggest army.  When one has an army one has the whole military set up, the whole jingoistic set up.  One then gets the atmosphere with regard <Col N="623" /> to armies and military might which exists in Britain at this time&mdash;disgusting and corrupting in my view&mdash;and which exists in America at this time: our boys here, there, everywhere knocking hell out of black people and yellow people.  The jingoism which exists in connection with an army of that imperial sort is profoundly corrupting for any nation.</P>
    <P>I would be deeply ashamed if this country were to participate through the European Community in that sort of fifthy, unmoral atmosphere because when one exploits people, and does them injustice, whether they are black people or yellow people, one eventually ends up hating them.  That is the basis of racism in the white Anglo-Saxon countries.  It is precisely those exploiting countries that came to despise, loathe and differentiate against those they injured.  We would be importing British jingoistic attitudes.  We would end up talking about the white man's burden, about our responsibility to improve the black races while we exploited them.  This is the sort of filth and militarism and monarchism and exploitation and racism that we will begin to let in to what is a reasonably honourable nation if we begin to become the metropolitan power of a great imperial complex, if we become part of a superpower.  We have an army but it is an army that is not used in an offensive way or a jingoistic, militaristic way.  We do not corrupt our young people with the glories of our arms or of our monarchy.  We do not have a Powell.  Think of the disgusting trends we would be admitting to our national life on the justification that we would be so much better off.</P>
    <P>When you come to look at the EEC and negotiate with it you find that the needs of Britain and the needs of Ireland are almost directly opposite to each other.  Britain is a nation of more than 50 million people and in the table of gross national product she is next after Germany.  She has the City of London and the financial institutions. She is the market place.  She has Lloyds Insurance and all the other insurances that have grown up there <Col N="624" /> and a great deal of financial and mercantile expertise as well as a great deal of industrial and technical expertise. Of course she will do well in this context. What she wants is to have sterling dismantled as little as possible so that what she loses through serving her special connection with the Commonwealth she will gain with the lolly she will get out of French West Africa and so on and to have a system by which in the end, if Europe agrees, she will have cheap food on the British platter.  This will suit her very well. She is big and strong and might hope, with Germany, to dominate this group. She is economically sophisticated.</P>
    <P>The exact opposite in every way applies to Ireland.  This is why any dependence on Britain in negotiations seems to me so insane.  I believe Britain feels rather towards us the way, perhaps, the Swedes feel towards the Norwegians, that we had the great good fortune to be part of the UK and were barbarous enough to spurn that, proving that we are basically a rather foolish people.  I do not think there is a great deal of hostility to us but just a difficulty in taking us seriously at this stage.  There is certainly not the least benevolence.  If we wanted to generate a position in which we could enter into some real negotiations with the EEC, first, we should be quite clear that our position was the opposite to Britain's and, secondly, we should find some allies whose real interests, apart from stated intentions of benevolence or diplomatic language, are similar to ours&mdash;obviously the Norwegians and Danes.  If we were serious about negotiation we would not endorse the thing totally without any reservation. What a ridiculous way to enter any sort of negotiations.  If you are buying a greyhound do you say: &ldquo;It is a magnificent greyhound.  I am determined to have it&rdquo;?  Even if it is a magnificent greyhound one would not begin to bargain in that way.  The EEC is a pretty ridiculous greyhound in some ways.  Every elementary principle of bargaining is violated by saying that <i>in toto</i> we will accept it; we will negotiate only the duration of our entry and the representation we shall have on the official bodies.  So said the Taoiseach in 1967.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="625" /> The Minister for External Affairs coming gaily back from Brussels says that in our case they are not dealing with someone who has some reservations. They are dealing with someone who has no reservations.  They are dealing with someone who wants &ldquo;in&rdquo; on his knees or flat on his face on any terms.  If you enter a bargain on any terms, of course you get in flat on your face with absolutely no concessions made.  We did not generate a bargaining position, first, by indicating reservations and, secondly, by joint activity with Norwegians and Danes and, possibly, with Swedes who do not want &ldquo;in&rdquo; but who have problems.  We did not seek out any of the people in Europe who might have had interests similar to ours: the Swiss, the Austrians, the Swedes, the Finns outside and the Danes and Norwegians inside.  We have expressed an attitude, which I shall come to later on, which effectively says: &ldquo;For God's sake somebody, take it off us and solve our problem&rdquo;.  We have expressed this sudden death wish and sudden hope that our burden somehow will be lifted from our backs.</P>
    <P>Speaking for the Labour movement we dissociate ourselves totally from that attitude which we think is an attitude of national capitulation.  We think that the conduct of these negotiations has been fantastically inept and at variance with what ordinary commonsense and prudence would indicate. There has been a total refusal to take advantage of whatever little strengths and benefits we have.</P>
    <P>I now come to the central question, the alternatives before us.  If you put them in simple and necessarily somewhat mechanical form, there are three. There is the posture of our Government and of the Fine Gael Party which, in effect, says: &ldquo;We want `in'.  We think the Treaty of Rome is great.  There is no bit of the European Community that does not appeal to us.  We love its social policy, its economic policy and everything about it.  We want to go all the way in now without reservations, please.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is one policy.  There are some small voices whose intentions I think are better than their analyses which are <Col N="626" /> saying: &ldquo;Totally out.  We want nothing to do with it.&rdquo;  The problem in real terms is that two-thirds of our trade is with the UK and if you take the proportion of our trade with the UK plus the present Six it goes up to four-fifths. It is presented to us that we would have to climb over an impossible tariff barrier and we would, therefore, have to re-route four-fifths of our trade if we stayed totally out.  In fact, through the whole of the life of the State we have been economically dependent on Britain.  Since the Free Trade Area Agreement, which will bite more with every month and which only our party opposed when it was before the Dáil&mdash;although I now think it is generally agreed that it has many more adverse than good aspects&mdash;the situation is developing now that not alone have we no economic independence but we are totally penetrated by foreign capital and foreign goods.  What little trade independence we might have possessed as well as our basic economic independence have gone.  It is argued by a small number of people, but by people who deserve to be taken seriously, that we should stay right outside and try to find a place for the four-fifths of our trade which would be in serious difficulty.  In my view this would result in a vast upheaval to our economy.  It would be much more likely to end in some sort of right-wing authoritarian régime than anything else.  It would defeat the objectives of the people who put forward the suggestion that we stay out.  It would have the opposite effect to what they wish for.</P>
    <P>The serious point is that those who present us with a simple choice, right in or right out are in fact doing violence to the truth and doing violence to the real complexity of the situation. There are general reductions in tariffs in the world, and the common external tariff for industrial goods in the EEC quite soon will be 7½ per cent, which is a small tariff compared with the tariffs we have been dealing with through most of the life of this State and lots of the tariffs we have to deal with at this time, for instance, those of the United States and some other countries. This is the first point, that the common external tariff would be low <Col N="627" /> for industrial products in the EEC.  The second point is, contrary to the impression given widely, that the EEC has shown itself perfectly willing to negotiate and to conclude agreements with different countries for a status which falls short of full membership.</P>
    <P>Somewhere in this welter of documents I have around me there is some documentation of the various countries which have concluded agreements with the EEC.  I cannot see at this time where my documentation is but I can quote some of it from memory.  One of the agreements, interestingly enough, relates to a matter of profound importance to us which is always quoted as being a major stumbling block.  The agreement has been concluded with a country which has very much less in common with EEC than we have traditionally, economically, socially and otherwise.  I refer to the agreement for Yugoslav beef.  We are always being told about beef and very recently an agreement has been concluded which admits Yugoslav beef to the European Community.  There is an agreement with Spain, an agreement with Israel. There are agreements with some of the Arab countries of north Africa: Tunis, Morocco and Algeria.  There is an agreement with Greece.  There is an agreement with the 18 countries of the Yahounde Agreement.  There is an agreement with some parts of East Africa, for instance, Tanzania.  There is an agreement with Nigeria and there are some others, but that is enough to be going on with.  That is from memory.  I cannot find the written down details.  In many cases such as the north African Arab countries, industrial products get in without quota and without tariff.</P>
    <P>If the EEC will conclude that sort of an agreement with North Africa and a beef agreement with Yugoslavia, why are we told <i>a priori</i> it is impossible for us to negotiate an agreement which would get our beef in, since this is one of the commodities they are short of, and which would get our industrial products in.  Anyone who, in an unbiased way, reads the whole history of the trading negotiations of the European Economic Community with Greece, Cyprus, Malta, Israel, Austria, <Col N="628" /> Switzerland and so on, will see that if there is any advantage for them in it the EEC are perfectly willing to negotiate bilateral agreements and that we could get the vast majority of what we want in regard to industrial exports and agricultural exports in by agreement.  We are entitled to say: &ldquo;sell everything, sell our sovereignty, sell our land to any foreigner that wants to buy it, sell our fishing rights, sell our industry to anyone with a cheque book to purchase it, sell every control over everything we possess to Brussels bureaucrats&rdquo; only if we exhaust every conceivable opportunity for negotiation and prove that we could not negotiate any form of agreement which would retain the advantages of independence and sovereignty and at the same time would give us the advantages of reasonable access to that, huge market.</P>
    <P>I agree with the benefits of access to the EEC, a dynamic market.  If Britain goes in the dangers of being cut off from British trade are obvious. What I do not agree with is that nothing short of total on-our-belly acquiescence in signing the Treaty of Rome is possible, when all the evividence from other countries is that various forms less than total entry are possible.  I suspect that our Government have a shrewd hunch that it could do very well in negotiations, that it would do so well that it is afraid to open them because they would end up with a bargain that would retain our identity and our sovereignty and retain our national existence and let us go on playing the individual role in the world we have opted to play for a long time and which is very precious to us, without denying us the economic advantages, without shutting us out of markets.  I do not want their empire.  I do not want their bureaucracy.  In fact I am ashamed of many of the features of the European Community.  I do not accept it unreservedly.  I realise the dangers of being shut out, but there is no justification for blanket acceptance of every aspect.  There are many aspects of the EEC which are rotten and corrupt.  I would associate my country with it only if there were no other path but no serious effort has <Col N="629" /> been made to demonstrate that there is no other path.  No serious investigations have been made in regard to an agreement which would admit our agricultural and industrial products.  We would accept a tariff of 2½ per cent or 5 per cent if we could retain our sovereignty.  We would not accept 50 per cent or 25 per cent, which would wreek us.  We would surely accept tiny tariffs.  Tariffs are getting low anyway. The common external tariff, even unnegotiated, is quite low and getting lower.  The tendency, if the United States do not reverse it in a burst of protectionism, is to reduce tariffs.  That is the intention of the Kennedy Round, and efforts at liberalising trade all over the world have been made for a decade. Therefore why have we this terror of being shut out of this precious market by this undefined, huge tariff barrier?  Nobody knows how high it is.  In fact it would not be so high, if it existed.  It is negotiable.  The effort is being made to present us with ridiculous alternatives, totally out or totally in, in which case, as I have said, everything that makes it precious to me to live here rather than some other country would disappear in a while.  I cannot believe the arguments that culture would flourish.  I shall come to that a little later when I look at the speeches of the Taoiseach and Deputy Cosgrave.</P>
    <P>As the Taoiseach pointed out recently, it behoves us, sovereign after what seemed an eternity of struggle, to look for possible pathways which would save that sovereignty and save the things which at least I find so admirable and honourable in this country.  We do not have a racist problem; we do not have a jingo military imperial setup; we do not have a monarchy; we do not have an empire that we exploit. I am proud of all these things.  We do not want to throw away our sovereignty and associate ourselves with them when we can find another way. That is what I find so depressing, this idea that it is simply a matter of totally in or totally out.  But it is negotiable, if you want to negotiate and I have listed about 20 other countries that did negotiate. I cannot believe that we would do worse than Morocco or Yugoslavia if we tried.  I believe the gains would <Col N="630" /> vastly outweigh the losses.  People, of course, do not believe it when I say we are in jeopardy as a national entity. I have tried to stay away from the small print and the fine detail and not to be too statistical but it is permissible in this context to try to put Ireland into the framework of the Ten, as it would then be, in regard to size, strength and wealth, because it is on these things that our viability depends. In doing this, I found things of which I was not aware.  When I started the exercise I was not aware that we were so weak and so tiny compared with the countries against whom we would be struggling to survive as a unit.</P>
    <P>If you take population, for instance, you find that we are the smallest, and the next smallest is more than one-third bigger.  If you take the rate of growth of population&mdash;I am talking about the Ten now and not the Six&mdash; we have the lowest rate of growth so that the present discrepancy in size based on the number of people would continue.</P>
    <P>We have the highest proportion of population in the agricultural sector, which is a measure of absence of in-Industrialisation. We have the lowest proportion in the industrial sector, which is the direct measure of industrialisation. We have the highest unemployment, for what it is worth, of the Ten, which shows again a weakness.  If you take gross national product in terms of pounds per person the next lowest is Italy which is one-third higher and the next lowest after that is the UK. Some of the others are more than twice as high in GNP per person.  Not alone are we much fewer but we are much poorer.</P>
    <P>Although we have heard a great deal about how dynamic our economy has been over the last decade&mdash;and I quote this not to denigrate what has happened but to show that some of the claims have been a bit ridiculous&mdash; if we look at the growth rate of the gross national product for the period 1958-67 Britain was slower but every other country of the Ten, and certainly those with whom we are now considering an alliance, was faster.  So we are fewer in number, number increasing more slowly, poorer per head, the economy growing slower, fixed investment <Col N="631" /> per person, lowest of the Ten&mdash; for example, in France it is three times as high, in Norway it is three times as high&mdash;and our consumption per capita is lowest, <i>et cetera, et cetera.</i> It is a depressing catalogue.  I have more of it but I will not go on with it.</P>
    <P>The picture that emerges is that of a tiny economy, the smallest of the applicants but also by European standards a very poor one, notwithstanding the claims that have been validly made, and of course the claims that have been improperly made and grossly inflated for propoganda reasons.  If you take the GNP of the applicants the next smallest is Norway and it is three times as big in terms of GNP, while Denmark is four times as big and of course the UK is more than 30 times as big. I do not propose to recite any more figures because they are readily available to people, but my purpose was not to read them into the record but to bring out the point that to compare our viability with the viability of Britain, with 30 times the GNP and a totally developed sophisticated industry, technological spin-off and know-how in areas that in fact none of the European countries now have, and to say that because she would be viable we will be viable, is ridiculous.</P>
    <P>We are the smallest, the poorest and the weakest, the least industrialised and the least sophisticated of the applicants. It is not a source of pride to recite that but surely also it is not something to be ignored in considering whether we have a future or not.  Only Luxembourg is smaller than us and I do not think you can bring Luxembourg into a serious discussion on this matter. When you look at Ireland in the context of this huge economy, one-quarter of an American billion people, how tiny and fragile we are.  When you look at Ireland in the context of one in 20 of the Parliament, one in 14 of the Commission and one in 20 of the Council, the question of continued survival as a nation is really and genuinely in danger and not in danger simply as a matter of political propaganda. It is a serious question for every Irishman all the time whether the nation can survive.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="632" /> I offer the proposition that if you are very rich or very strong then capitalism is very good for you.  Witness the United States.  It does very well out of capitalism.  If you are very small and very weak, which is what we are, it is very bad for you.  Ireland has suffered more from capitalism than any other country in the world because the British were the first to have it and we were the first place within reach that they &ldquo;clobbered&rdquo;. What we are doing now is entrusting our development to a much bigger capitalist grouping and in some ways a cruder and more raw group even than Britain which presently dominates us.  I feel that the alternatives, the real choices, are between a capitalist development as part of a European Community which will end, I am convinced, in our loss of all identity of every sort, or else an economy of the sort that Fianna Fáil tried to establish in the `thirties and then abandoned, which has a very major public sector and which protects itself against being purchased&mdash;either land or factories or anything else.  As I said, if we were very rich and very strong, this would not matter.  We are getting into a tank with much bigger fish and in my book they are sharks not because they are personally wicked, they are an ordinary statistical sample of mankind like anybody else, but because they are big capitalist countries with a drive to profits.</P>
    <P>I am deeply opposed to Britain but I am not opposed to the British in any personal sense or in any genetic or racist sense.  I do not think what they did to us was wickedness; I think that it was just a working out of the nature of their social system and we happened to be in the way.  The social system which did us such terrible damage is exactly the social system, writ large, to which we now, extraordinarily light-heartedly and without exploring the alternatives, are attaching ourselves and therefore, we are permitting ourselves to make an enormous national error.</P>
    <P>I ask myself why this should be at this time.  In times of much greater adversity in the past we have been distingushed by an extraordinary will to survive.  Now&mdash;and this attitude to the <Col N="633" /> EEC is not the only example I see of it&mdash;psychologically and politically we seem to be seized with a death wish. We have lost the courage, after all these centuries, to go on guarding our separate identity.  We have almost come to the stage of saying that the bureaucrats at Brussels and in the European Parliament will solve our problems for us and that their regional policy will pump in the money we cannot put in ourselves.  We feel that somehow Ireland in terms of rocks, rivers and mountains will not go away and in that sense we have a future.  We are reaching a stage where we do not worry.  I do not know how else to interpret the speeches, presumably carefully thought out, of the Taoiseach and of Deputy Cosgrave who made the first speech after the Taoiseach.  I do not propose to go through all the Deputies' speeches to try to indicate where I think the arguments are wrong.  If the procedure in this Parliament is that we debate things and not simply make statements without taking cognisance of what anybody else says, then some of the things which have been said are worthy of debate. I do not wish to indicate what I consider to be the weaknesses of the prepared documents which we have had but I would like to talk about what I think was missing, inadequate and wrong in some of the speeches which were made.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach spoke about sovereignty. He said that some concern exists as to the effects which membership of the EEC in its present form and as it may evolve in the future may have on our national sovereignty.  The Taoiseach also said that since our sovereignty was won so recently and at such great cost it was only proper that the issues affecting it should be fully explained and debated here.  It is fair that this point should be made early.  The Minister for External Affairs, Dr. Hillery, said that any negotiations with any external power are of the same basic sort as negotiations with the EEC.  It is perfectly true that when one forms an alliance or an agreement with any other power one thereby limits one's total freedom. Total freedom for persons or nations <Col N="634" /> is a myth.  Every valuable relationship with another human being limits freedom. We accept these limitations with pleasure at times.  The same argument goes for the relationship between nations or States.  An agreement is a proper thing for a sovereign State to enter into.  It imposes limits on sovereignty. Both of these propositions are true.</P>
    <P>It seems to me to be false and misleading, so false that I am surprised to see it advanced as a serious argument, to equate any agreement or any limitation of sovereignty with the sort of limitation of sovereignty which entry to the EEC entails.  The Taoiseach said that it is only proper that issues affecting our sovereignty should be fully debated.  The Taoiseach talked about limitation of sovereignty. What is involved with the EEC is a totally different sort of thing.  It is fair to admit that it is different.  It is not limitation of sovereignty when two States have some sort of agreement with each other.  What is involved is the abolition of sovereignty.  In any sort of logical, reasonable discussion, abolition and limitation are recognised as being totally different things.  There is the marvellous and ridiculous observation attributed to Sir Boyle Roche and it is applicable in this context.  He is reputed to have said:</P>
    <P>It is worthwhile sacrificing part or even the whole of the Constitution that the rest may be preserved.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that the Taoiseach is willing to say, and is saying, that it is worthwhile sacrificing part or even the whole of our sovereignty in order that the rest may be preserved.  It is, in fact, an Irish &ldquo;bull.&rdquo;  The two things are generally and totally different and it is less than fair to suggest that there is an anology between agreements, and even disastrous agreements like the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement, on the one hand, and entry to the EEC on the other hand.  They are different in kind for the most awful reason of all: that when the European Community is entered certain events are set in train which are irreversible. Once we are in and participating for a period the position is <Col N="635" /> irreversible.  Even if we assembled here in this House and said that we repudiated the Treaty of Rome, economically or socially, we could not go back.  The die would be cast.  We would have passed the point of no return.</P>
    <P>The central argument of the Taoiseach about sovereignty is a specious one.  It seems to me there is confusion of mind.  The Taoiseach said, on 23rd June&mdash;column 1648, Volume 247, of the Dáil Debates:</P>
    <P>It should be recognised that EEC membership will lead to a greater degree of co-ordination and interdependence of economic policies among the members than would be entailed under a simple trade agreement.</P>
    <P>I can only say that the whole intention is not co-ordination, but fusion. That talk about interdependence and co-ordination is semantically false, if not worse.  One can only co-ordinate things which are separate.  One can only have interdependence between two distinct things.  We are told explicitly in regard to the EEC that we want a single market and a single currency and, ultimately, monetary union, customs union and political union.  The word is &ldquo;union&rdquo;.  So far as I am concerned that means &ldquo;making one&rdquo;.  If one has union there cannot be interdependence between bits of the one. One cannot co-ordinate the parts of something which is one.</P>
    <P>I was amazed at the various statements made.  I do not wish to be uncharitable or inaccurate.  That would be irresponsible.  The statements seem lacking in depth of analysis, naïve and shallow and seem to accept the version of the European Community which is peddled by the very powerful publicity machine which the Community possess.</P>
    <P>I have spoken at some length about the power of the one-fourteenth or the one-twentieth part in the governing bodies of the Community.  Yet the Taoiseach is able to say:</P>
    <P>Membership of these Communities could result in our having a far greater influence and scope for the <Col N="636" /> exercise of economic policies because as a member we would participate in the formulation of common codes of action for member states.</P>
    <P>This point has been made repeatedly and it is reiterated by Deputy Cosgrave in his contribution, to which I shall refer later.  It is assumed that in some mysterious way, by being the tiny tail &mdash;either a one-fourteenth or a one-twentieth part&mdash;we would succeed in wagging the dog.  Let us not forget the other 19/20ths: they are tough, vigorous and commercially ruthless because competition is the very lifeblood of the Community and the principle on which the Community is built.  It is naïve, or even worse, to think that by assimilating our population of 3,000,000 odd into the Community we would somehow have accession to economic influence.  The opposite is true: we would have no influence at all.</P>
    <P>In his speech the Taoiseach refers to possible cultural implications of membership.  At column 1650, volume 247 of the Official Report, he states:</P>
    <P>For my part I can see no reason why such effects need be anything but good.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach sees no drawbacks.  A balance is not drawn between any possible good and adverse effects; everything is seen as perfect.  Deputy Childers also made a speech in the same vein.</P>
    <P>I have indicated my view, which is shared by people with greater expertise and knowledge than I, that the Mansholt Plan will result in the probable destruction of the social fabric of the west and it is my opinion that this destruction will have the most profound cultural reprecussions on this island.  If the Taoiseach is not aware of this connection between culture and the social fabric, if he is not aware of the importance of the west in our culture, if he does not perceive the threat to the west in the Mansholt Plan and in the thinking of the Community, either he is naïve or is less serious about his responsibilities as Taoiseach than he ought to be.  There is displayed this sense of naïveté, of believing everything that is promised, at a time when there is an urgent need to look <Col N="637" /> through the public relations job and to see the reality&mdash;which is partly good and partly bad.</P>
    <P>The one statement made by the Taoiseach with which I am in full agreement is that this is the most momentous step to be taken by the Irish people since the foundation of the State.  It is a step I hope the people will never take because we can have all the advantages and none of the drawbacks if we undertake sufficiently serious negotiations for less than total membership.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach again displays this astonishing naïveté when he states:</P>
    <P>We also wish to participate in the contribution made by the member states to the less developed countries.</P>
    <P>In my opinion the objective of the European Development Fund is to build the infrastructure that will enable the metropolitan countries of Europe, separate at present but soon to fuse, to exploit Africa all the more readily. It is more profitable if some other source builds the railways, the jetties and the schools to make the people literate enough to work the factories. The relationship between the Community and what the Taoiseach elegantly calls &ldquo;the less developed countries&rdquo; is the relationship of exploiter and exploited.  I do not wish to participate in the contribution being made by the Community to the less developed countries: it will be participation in exploitation of the black people by the whites.  It will be participation in a new form of imperialism and I have already made clear this is something I oppose in the most vehement way.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach made a brief speech on this vitally important matter&mdash;it was more remarkable for what it omitted to say than for its contents.  Perhaps this was done in the hope that the issue might be scrambled past the gaze of the Irish people and that there might be a successful referendum without anyone realising the vast implications that were involved for the existence of Ireland as a nation.  The speech did not reflect the seriousness of the issues involved or his responsibilities as Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="638" /> What I say is political and in no way personal, but when I turn to the contribution made by Deputy Cosgrave I find he displays the same sense of naïveté, he believes all the propaganda of Brussels, he is not shrewd or tough enough.  Perhaps if the Deputy would read about Bismarck or Lloyd George he would see how major statesmen and world powers really operate&mdash;they do not adopt his gentle, benevolent attitude.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave says that the objective of the EEC is an objective we as a nation share and want to play our full part in achieving.  However, those objectives are necessarily extremely diverse; some are good, and I have tried to indicate them, but others are bad. There was mention earlier in this debate about &ldquo;buying a pig in a poke&rdquo;: surely it behoves us to look at what we are buying in a more analytical and sophisticated manner.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave speaks about the ideals and traditions common to all of us in the EEC.  Some of the ideals and traditions in the Community are monarchist, some are imperial traditions, some are &ldquo;bash the Wog&rdquo; traditions. In that diverse gathering of nations there are racist traditions and militarist traditions.  The EEC contains countries that until very recently-were fascist, where a large part of the population did not object to undertaking &ldquo;the final solution&rdquo;.  I do not for one moment subscribe to all the traditions and ideals of the EEC without differentiating between what is good and what is rotten.  To do otherwise would be naïve.</P>

      <P>Deputy Oliver J. Flanagan has given notice of his intention to raise the subject matter of Question No. 48 on the Order Paper of the 21st May, 1970.  The text is already on record.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I sincerely regret having to detain the House beyond the normal sitting hours but this is a matter about which I am <Col N="639" /> deeply concerned.  This is the third occasion on which I have had to draw public attention to the very dangerous bridge over the Grand Canal near the town of Edenderry.  On the last occasion on which I raised the question, I pointed out that there would be further serious accidents if the bridge were not made safe.</P>
      <P>On the 21st May last, I asked the Minister for Local Government, as reported at column 2188 of the Official Report for that day:</P>
      <P>...what urgent steps he proposes to take in conjunction with the Offaly County Council in regard to the dangerous Canal Bridge at Killane, Edenderry, County Offaly; if a grant has been made available to the council for this work; if so, when work is likely to commence; if his Department have any record of fatal and other serious accidents at this bridge in recent years; if the Council will have this work undertaken as a matter of urgency; the dates on which he received proposals from Offaly County Council in relation to the bridge; and the date of his approval in respect of making the bridge safe for public use.</P>
      <P>The Minister replied:</P>
      <P>It is a matter for Offaly County Council, who are the responsible road authority, to prepare a scheme for any work necessary at this bridge.  No proposal in the matter has yet been received in my Department from the council.</P>
      <P>Particulars of accidents at this bridge are not available in my Department.</P>
      <P>Of course, the Minister for Local Government is the person responsible for public safety on the roads.  He is responsible for the making of regulations to ensure reasonable public safety on the roads.  However, no action has been taken either by the Minister or by the Offaly County Council in relation to this bridge at Edenberry since I last raised the matter here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been a series of accidents at this bridge.  Among the more recent was one on the 6th January last when a heavily laden lorry, the property of <Col N="640" /> Mr. Liam Mallin, went over the bridge and plunged into the canal.  If it had not been for the skill with which the driver acted, he would have been drowned.  Quite recently, a honeymoon couple approached the bridge in haste and finished up in the canal.  Luckily, they were rescued.  Public opinion in Edenderry is very uneasy about the failure of the Department of Local Government to take the appropriate steps to make the bridge safe or to have the bridge closed so that people will not be in danger of losing their lives.</P>
    <P>Last weekend, a young mother, Mrs. Canton of Mount Lucas, got a lift in a car as she was on her way to visit her child who was ill in hospital.  Also travelling in the car was a seven year old boy, Martin Nolan.  Although the car was being driven with skill and care it went over the bridge and there was nothing to prevent it from going into the canal.  The result was that that young mother and the seven year old boy lost their lives.  We extend our sincere sympathy to those who are left to mourn as a result of this tragic event.</P>
    <P>I presume that this bridge is still in a very dangerous condition.  On Sunday last there were empty tar barrels along the bridge where there should have been a parapet.  These barrels were intended to prevent vehicles from going into the canal.  When this was brought to the attention of the local public representatives the barrels were filled with water so as to make them a little more effective but, as everybody knows, barrels, whether they be full or empty, are no substitute for a proper form of protection.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister for Local Government if he has received any proposal on this matter from the local authority because the information I received yesterday from a source I am not prepared to disclose is that a letter, dated the 3rd July, 1970, was sent by Offaly County Council to the Minister's Department, was posted on the 5th July which was Sunday and arrived at the Department on Monday.  I do not know if that is so but I want the Minister to kindly explain to the <Col N="641" /> House what was the nature of the proposal submitted by Offaly County Council asking for his approval for the appointment of a consultant to deal with this bridge.  I put it to the Minister that it was only after two people had lost their lives that a letter was posted to him from the county council. If a letter, dated the 3rd July but not posted until the 5th was received by the Minister, I say that the date, the 3rd, was deliberately put on the letter as a camouflage to suggest that the local authority were taking some action on this matter.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister also why no action was taken in this matter since I last raised it on 21st May?  No move was made either by Offaly County Council or by the Department. If the letter to which I have referred was received by the Minister, is he prepared to authorise a Department inspector to hold a public inquiry into the circumstances surrounding the failure of Offaly County Council to take appropriate steps to render safe this bridge?</P>
    <P>I do not wish to embarrass the Minister.  He will, I know, do what he can, remembering the grief and sorrow in the homes bereft of those who lost their lives in this tragic accident.  The local authority must be made to face up to their responsibilities.  The situation is a deplorable one.  If the county council engineer endeavoured to camouflage correspondence to the Minister's Department by dating that correspondence prior to the fatal accident at this bridge for the purpose of covering up failure and neglect that is something the Minister should investigate and I ask the Minister to investigate.  If there is a proposal to appoint a consultant, will the Minister make it a condition precedent that the road will not be open to traffic pending the completion of the necessary work?  There are no parapets on this bridge.  A little inconvenience to traffic is preferable to further loss of life. The road must be closed to traffic or else barriers must be erected to prevent lorries and cars going into the canal at this point.  There is a deep fall into the deepest part of the Grand Canal <Col N="642" /> just here.  I urge the Minister to send an inspector to the scene of this accident and to consult with the appropriate authorities to see what can be done to prevent further tragedies.</P>
    <P>Offaly County Council and the engineering staff have slipped up somewhere.  One man, Mr. Mallin, was told he would have to pay for damage to the parapet when his lorry went into the canal at this bridge.  No matter how skilful the driver, it is impossible to negotiate this bridge and there is now absolutely nothing to protect a lorry driver or motorist from going into the canal.</P>
    <P>The Minister should hold an inquiry. There has been neglect on somebody's part.  The Minister must take drastic action.  All those familiar with the area agree that no traffic should be permitted to use this bridge in its present condition.  I know the Minister's courageous approach to public safety on land and in the water and I appeal to him now to take action which will prevent further loss of life.  The bridge is a hazard and it will claim more lives if nothing is done.  I have here a letter I addressed to the Minister:</P>
    <P>On the 20th May last I raised the Parliamentary Question in regard to the dangerous Canal Bridge at Killane, Edenderry, Co. Offaly.  I explained that this bridge was to my knowledge the most dangerous in Ireland and a death trap for the public.  The Offaly County Council have to date taken no action in the matter and you replied that you had no proposals in your Department from the Council in connection with this bridge.  I explained that there were several serious accidents where a number of people drove into the canal.  I also explained to all concerned that a lorry plunged into the canal and only for the skill and good care of the driver, the result would have been another death.</P>
    <P>Last week-end another fatal accident took place on the bridge. Two people lost their lives and the third is still in great danger and despite all this no action is taken to remedy these grave dangers, well <Col N="643" /> known to the public.  In the town of Edenderry feeling is very high and public opinion very strong in relation to this vital matter and I would ask you as Minister for Local Government to make an Order immediately closing down this bridge and cutting off this road until such time as this bridge is made safe.  I will be deeply grateful if an Inspector from your Department will visit the bridge at once, and make a report to you with a view to closing same in order to prevent a further loss of life which is most certain if the bridge is left in its present condition.</P>
    <P>Barrels containing water and some empty barrels will not prevent the public from plunging into the canal at this point.</P>
    <P>If action had been taken after I had raised this matter in the Dáil last May the lives lost last week-end might have been saved but no one seems to worry or take drastic action in relation to these dangers.</P>
    <P>I strongly object and I deplore the manner in which this matter has been handled and I am appealing to you in the interests of public safety to take action this week and to have something done to guarantee public safety at this danger point and in its present condition I can only suggest that you make an Order compelling the Council to have this bridge closed to all traffic forthwith in the interests of public safety.  I await your immediate action and early reply.</P>
    <P>I would be grateful if the Minister would give the date of any proposal received by his Department from the consulting engineer.</P>

      <P>Deputy Flanagan, in raising this matter on the Adjournment, brings to our notice the very sad tragedy which occurred over the weekend.  Our sympathy goes out to the families of those involved in the accident.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Minister for Local Government I am, as the Deputy said, greatly concerned with road safety and safety in <Col N="644" /> the water.  I got notice that this matter would be raised on the Adjournment, after five o'clock this evening when my Department was about to close down.</P>
    <P>In reply to the Deputy's question on 21st May I said there were no proposals before the Department and, as Offaly County Council are the responsible road authority, it is their responsibility to put forward proposals for improvements and, when that is done, we will deal with them as expeditiously as possible.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flanagan has asked me to mention dates.  As far as the Department is concerned, we received a letter yesterday, 6th July, from Offaly County Council.  This letter was dated the 3rd July.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The letter forwarded an extract from the acting county engineer's report on the condition of the bridge.  I believe this report was dated the 10th March.  They also forwarded with the letter applications received in response to an advertisement published on the 3rd April from 13 firms for appointment as consultant engineers for the construction work which it is proposed to carry out on the Killane Bridge at Edenderry.  I would like to put on record that the engineer's report on the structural stability of this bridge and on the question of load limitation might have to be considered.</P>
      <P>The position at present as far as the Department are concerned is that there is a proposal before us, which we received yesterday, to sanction the appointment of a consultant to prepare working drawings for the reconstruction of this bridge.  I do not honestly think we could be asked to have dealt with this matter more expeditiously as it has only been brought to our notice by the council within the last 48 hours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not propose to hold a public inquiry.  I do not feel the matter would justify such expense.  There is a clear indication that the Offaly County Council are now aware of the need to improve <Col N="645" /> this bridge and, as they are prepared to go ahead with proposals to improve it, I cannot see what I can do at this stage to expedite the matter. I will be in touch with the council tomorrow and will ask them to take whatever precautions they can to ensure until such time as work is carried out on this bridge that it is properly signposted in order that persons travelling on this road will have a clear indication of the dangers which seem to exist there.  I do not really see, outside of that, what the Deputy can expect me to do.  I promise I will keep <Col N="646" /> an eye on this matter and as far as my Department are concerned we will very shortly sanction the proposal to appoint a consultant engineer for the job.  I want to assure the House that any proposals brought before my Department in this matter will be dealt with with as little delay as possible.</P>
