      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he is aware of the high incidence of unemployment among the male section of the labour force in Wicklow town area; and what steps he intends to take to relieve unemployment in this area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed that the recent rise in male unemployment in Wicklow was due, to a large extent, to the effect of the trade dispute in the cement industry.  Following settlement of that dispute, opportunities for work in the area should become increasingly available.</P>
      <P>The Government provide generous incentives for the promotion of industrial development.  They have resulted in the establishment of a number of new industries in Wicklow town in recent years, and, in line with the Government's Third Programme of Economic and Social Development, the area will, no doubt, continue to attract sound industrial proposals.</P>

We sold them £41 million worth of goods and we have bought more than £90 million worth from them.  How is it that we are incapable of formulating a selling policy that will ensure that we trade on a par?  Surely the adverse balance is harmful to our economy?</P>

      <P>The Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries indicated that DDT is used only to a very limited extent on agricultural and horticultural crops and on livestock in this country and that he was advised that there is no evidence to suggest that the extent of its usage for these purposes would present a hazard to human or animal life or to the environment.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Health referred to an examination of the position regarding DDT by the Food Advisory Committee. The committee are giving the matter priority and are now engaged in making a pilot survey of the principal foods consumed in this country to determine the degree of pesticide residues, including residues of DDT, in the foods.</P>

      <P>Accurate figures of the incidence of this condition in the country are not available.</P>
      <P>I have no reliable information indicating that the prevalence of arthritis is on the increase here but as the number of persons in the older age groups is increasing in this country it would be expected that there would be an increasing number suffering from osteoarthritis. I have no reason to assume that the number suffering from rheumatoid-arthritis is increasing to any great extent.  Treatment facilities are available throughout the country with the more specialised treatment at the larger centres of population.  I am not aware that these facilities are inadequate, but I am having some aspects of the matter examined in connection with new hospital developments.</P>

      <P>As I said in the reply, there are no accurate figures of the incidence of this condition.  It is rather difficult to accept the accuracy of the statement made by the Deputy that the incidence of arthritis is increasing in younger people.  As I said in the reply, there is an increase but the incidence in the older age groups is increasing also.  It does not follow that it is particularly applicable to young people.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>The number of national schools at 30th June, 1969 was 4,260. The number of national schools visited under the school medical service in 1969 was 1,582.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister give an explanation as to why the figures for the carrying out of these school medical examinations are falling rather than rising?  This figure is about 30 per cent of the number of schools.  Could the Minister say why, since the scheme has been established for so long, the number of schools examined is still so very low?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>While the number of schools visited in 1969 decreased, the downward trend in the percentage of <Col N="655" /> schools visited was halted.  I know there is no great consolation in that.  Even if the number of schools visited was fewer, the number of children examined was up considerably.  It was in the region of 7,000 children examined.  In recent years these medical examinations of the children were more exhaustive than heretofore, so the number of medical examinations conducted is greater and they are more exhaustive than had been the case.  The Minister is arranging that there will be annual visits in all national schools with 50 or more pupils.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister or his Department take steps to ensure that children suffering from defects which are diagnosed by private practitioners have the same right to treatment as children with defects diagnosed at school medical examinations, particularly having regard to the fact that the school medical examinations are carried out so infrequently?  This is a big question.  At the moment the treatment of defects diagnosed privately has to be paid for.  I should like a statement from the Minister on that point since it is accepted that school medical examinations are falling down and are held, to put it mildly, infrequently in most districts.</P>

      <P>The expansion of freight traffic is a matter which is under continuous review by the air companies.</P>
      <P>The annual report of the companies for the year ended 31st March, 1969 says: &ldquo;Cargo traffic has developed at a very satisfactory rate in recent years. In 1968-69 cargo carried on Aer Lingus services exceeded 33,600 tons and was 23 per cent higher than the 1967-68 level.  We expect further increases and to cater for this we will introduce specialised Boeing 737 quick change aircraft later in 1969-70... Aerlinte cargo traffic increased by almost two-thirds in 1968-69 to reach 8,100 tons.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. J. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is assumed that the Deputy's question relates to unemployment benefit. <Col N="660" /> Persons over 65 who have 156 employment contributions paid in respect of them since entry into insurance enjoy a valuable concession inasmuch as they can draw unemployment benefit without interruption up to age 70 without having to requalify therefor.  Otherwise they are, as regards the normal statutory conditions, in exactly the same position as any other person claiming unemployment benefit.</P>
      <P>In order to be entitled to unemployment benefit in respect of any day the claimant must be unemployed, capable of and available for employment and ready to accept any suitable work that offers.  In addition, he must be making reasonable efforts to secure employment.</P>
      <P>Payment of unemployment benefit for periods of absence abroad on holidays would be clearly inconsistent with these standard requirements of unemployment benefit schemes.  Accordingly, I am satisfied that there is no justification for the course suggested by the Deputy, which, I might mention, would in any event require amendment of the basic legislation.</P>
      <P>This problem should, however, be largely resolved by the introduction of the scheme of retirement pensions at age 65 which is included in the Social Welfare Bill, 1970, and which it is intended to bring into operation on the 1st October next.</P>

Persons who lose their employment because of involvement in a trade dispute may be granted credits for periods of proved unemployment. In fact, when notification of loss of employment because of a trade dispute is received, officials of the local offices of the Department of Labour advise the trade unions concerned regarding the provisions for the granting of such credits.  In the circumstances, cases of the type mentioned by the Deputy should not arise.  However, if the Deputy furnishes particulars of any case or cases he has in mind, I shall have the matter examined.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education (Mr. O'Kennedy) Michael O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 32 to 35 together.</P>
      <P>Prior to April, 1969, the provision for school transport appeared under subhead C.3 of Vote No. 28 for primary education and subhead M of Vote 29 for post primary education. As from April, 1969, the complete cost of school transport has been provided for under subhead D.3 of Vote No. 27 for the Office of the Minister for Education.</P>
      <P>The subsidy was calculated on the basis of the revenue lost to CIE because schoolchildren's fares were held at the level obtaining prior to the general fares increase of December, 1968.</P>
      <P>CIE were informed on 24th April, 1970, that the subsidy would be discontinued as from 1st May, 1970, and found it necessary to make up the loss of revenue in the general fares increase announced on 17th June, 1970.</P>
      <P>The information sought by the Deputy in Question No. 33 is not available nor does any question of compiling it arise.  The reason for this is the fact that the general scheme of free transport relates only to pupils who reside more than three miles from the nearest suitable school.  The fact that parents may elect to send their children to a school more than three miles distance from their homes is a matter for the parents.  It does not carry with it any claim or any entitlement to financial assistance from the State where a suitable school is available within three miles.</P>
      <P>The annual cost of the subsidy was £135,930 and for the reasons explained in my reply of 30th June, 1970, I do not propose to reintroduce the subsidy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Do I understand from the Parliamentary Secretary's reply that the figure in this year's Estimate for the Department of Education, which is already passed, includes a figure for the transport which was previously provided in Dublin on a subsidised basis?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>In so far as it was possible to ascertain what the cost of <Col N="667" /> this would be, I did take account of the fares operating up to that time. However, as I explained to the Deputy the last day, the increased costs of CIE would be in excess of the figure I have mentioned now.  I should also tell the Deputy that it has always been held by CIE&mdash;this is not a matter that concerns me&mdash;that even at the present subsidised rate of one-half, they are losing substantially on the rates being applied for children.  The Estimate to which the Deputy referred has taken account of the cost but that was the total cost for the country as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>But the present Estimate which came before this House, which was passed by this House without any indication from the Minister of his intention to withdraw the £135,000, in fact, included the £135,000 and, therefore, it is not necessary to have legislation to continue the subsidy which was previously given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, it is. The Deputy will appreciate that the total amount is £3 million and this applies on the basis of distance and age qualification not just to Dublin but to the whole country.  The same criteria apply all over.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>They do not apply in Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>To effect an increase on that would, of course, involve legislation, and that total sum is being expended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary now suggesting that it is possible for all children in Dublin to attend a school within three miles of their home?  Is that what the Parliamentary Secretary is suggesting, because that is the assumption on which £135,000 is being taken out of the pockets of parents in Dublin whose children are obliged to travel three miles or more to go to school because they cannot get into schools within the three-mile radius?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is no such thing, as the Deputy well knows.  In so far as it can be ascertained over 80 per <Col N="668" /> cent of the children who benefited from this subsidy attended schools which were not the nearest school which it is the responsibility of the Department to provide under the scheme.  Therefore, the Deputy had better check his facts in that regard.</P>

      <P>The soft fruit crop is sold mainly to jam manufacturers. Some growers have written contracts with a particular firm, others have a verbal or traditional sale arrangement with a firm and some have no arrangement but sell to best buyer.  The price for each season's crop is negotiated between representatives of the growers and of the Irish Jam Manufacturers' Association.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to assist home production of soft fruits imports of fruit pulp of soft fruits are prohibited except under licence and licences are not being <Col N="678" /> issued.  Manufactured jam is also subject to import duty at the rate of 1s 6d per lb, full, 4d per lb, preferential in Britain and Six Counties.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that there is no market for gooseberries&mdash; it was found last year and this year that people did not want to buy them. This is an unfortunate fact but it is true.  The price negotiations that have taken place in the matter of other fruits are between the jam manufacturers and the growers or their representatives. In the case of blackcurrants, last year and this year both in this country and in Britain there has been an over-supply.  However, the prices for some soft fruits have increased marginally on last year's prices.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>

Will the Minister say whether it is true that Hartleys are importing under another name a substantial amount of readymade jam into this country, with the result that Irish fruit is not required for jam manufacturing?  I have asked this question three times.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister not consider that is partly the reason the Irish fruit-growers cannot sell their fruit?  The Minister speaks about contract prices as if there were a written contract which must be adhered to. Apparently the Minister is not aware of the position that in 99 per cent of the cases verbal contracts are made and the plants are supplied by the manufacturers? They contract with the people verbally to sell the produce to them.  At the moment the fruit is not being brought.  This year the growers will be broke and nobody gives a damn for them.</P>

      <P>I am not aware of general dissatisfaction in this regard, though no doubt suppliers would <Col N="681" /> always like a better price.  In fact, additional price support for milk has already been provided by the Government in the present financial year at an extra cost of some £1.6 million per annum.  Total State support for milk now costs £31½ million per annum and the provision of this very large sum demonstrates clearly the Government's recognition of the importance of the dairying industry and their concern for its welfare.</P>

Where increases in prices of these commodities have taken place they were necessary to compensate for unavoidable increases in costs.</P>
      <P>We must be prepared to face up to the fact that price stability cannot be achieved so long as costs, particularly costs of wages and of raw materials, continue to escalate.  Manufacturers can only go a certain distance in absorbing costs; after that they must increase prices or close down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Increases in labour costs attributable to wage increases during 1970 in excess of 30s a week per worker, or 7 per cent, whichever is the greater, are still being disallowed when assessing the amount of compensatory price increases allowable.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Last night I was analysing the speeches of the major spokesman of the two major parties, namely, the Taoiseach and Deputy Cosgrave, on Ireland's application to join the European Economic Community. My pupose in dealing with the two major spokesmen in this way will emerge shortly.  As reported in the Official Report of 23rd June last, at column 1663, Deputy Cosgrave said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must try to avoid appearing obsessed with our own detailed problems which are in many respects <Col N="685" /> large in our own estimation but which are small compared with the problems of certain other European countries.</P>
    <P>This statement seems to me to be in line with the general policy of the two major parties of avoiding discussion and of trying to sweep problems under the carpet.  It is with the problems of a nation that a national parliament is concerned.  The problems in Ireland for the small farmers, for the small industrialists and for the small fishermen may appear relatively unimportant in Brussels but here in Dublin they are very important indeed and it is quite irresponsible to say that we should avoid appearing obsessed with our own detailed problems.  With what else should we be obsessed?  Deputy Cosgrage goes on to say:</P>
    <P>We should rid ourselves of the mentality of thinking that the EEC is an antagonist we should try to outsmart in negotiations.</P>
    <P>The idea of our outsmarting the technocrats in Brussels in these negotiations seems to me similar to the rabbit endeavouring to outsmart the boa constrictor getting ready to swallow him. We are in no position to outsmart the negotiators in the European Community. What we have to do by serious negotiation is not to sell our country at more than its prie but toobtain at least something approximating to its price instead of throwing it awayfor some pathetic gain.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave says that these negotiations are not bilateral trade negotiations in which each side is higgling and haggling to get the best bargain.  He seems to endorse the throwing away of our negotiating position, which is what our Government are doing.  Later, he says that we will be entering into a partnership with friends.  What naivety?  Do we seriously think the governments of Germany, France and Britain are our friends who will look after us if we have not got the wit to look after ourselves? These are effective national governments looking out, perfectly correctly, for their own interests.  To approve of negotiating posture in regard to a partnership between friends, with no higgling and haggling, <Col N="686" /> seems to me to betray a complete lack of responsibility on the part of the Fine Gael Party and on the part of the Government in the particular context.</P>
    <P>The suggestion emerges that we should not try to fix things before we go in; going in is, of course, irrevocable; but we should not try to fix the small details before we go in.  These may appear trivial in Brussels but they are by nomeans trivial here at home At coloumn 1665, Deputy Cosgrave is recorded as saying:</P>
    <P>The strongest possible argument for not bogging down the negotiations with detailed lists of problems is that these problems can be more effectively dealt with once we are inside rather than trying to get in.</P>
    <P>Once we are inside, with one-twentieth of the Parliament and one-Fourteenth of the Commission, the negotiations are over and our commissioner is pledged to serve the Commission and not the interests of the nation.  And the argument is that, once the die is cast and we cannot go back, we can then solve our problems better than we could solve them at the negotiating table.  How irresponsible can we be? This is a very extraordinary approach from the Fine Gael Party.  It seems to me to arise from a certain naivety and an almost childish belief in the propaganda emanating from the Brussels PRO.</P>
    <P>The prime aim of the EEC isto get the fullest possible development of all the member states and all regions and areas within the member countries.</P>
    <P>This is Deputy Cosgrave's summing up of the price aim of the EEC.  I can only repeat the famour remark by the Duke ofWellington: if you believe that, you will believe anything.  They do not even claim&mdash;in the highest flights of their public relations oratory and churning our documentations&mdash;that this is the fullest possible development of all regions and all areas.  What would be the point ofall their discussions on regional policy where they differentiate beween areas?  All the documentation about regional policy is aimed at misleading people.  It is ridiculous for anybody to believe that <Col N="687" /> about the EEC.  It is the same extraordinary, lighthearted, naïve approach to what the Taoiseach has rightly said is the most serious decision in the history of this nation.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to pursue further the speeches of Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil Deputies on this issue except very briefly to refer to what Deputy FitzGerald said at very great length. It was articulate.  At times, it was amusing.  Always, it was movingly expressed.  However, it seems to me to contain the same basic error, which is to look on the EEC as in some way a philanthropic body and not a ruthless capitalist super-power with an empire and a nuclear capability jostling and barging and contending with other super-powers for an increased place in the sun.  With capitalism, they produced two world wars.  Capitalism has desecrated the whole of the undeveloped world through imperialism. The leopard of capitalism has not changed its spots; it has not suddenly become benevolent, altruistic.  People who believe that are two naïve to be given the leadership of any nation, particularly the leadership of a weak nation such as this which is in desperate peril of its future and of its very existence.</P>
    <P>Thus, you see, from the speeches of both parties, that they are identical; that the position of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael on this issue is identical; that there is not a whit of difference between one side and the other.  They are exactly the same.</P>
    <P>Just to illustrate what an extraordinary act of submission has been committed on behalf of the Irish nation, I propose to quote some excerpts from the speech of our Minister for External Affairs, Deputy Dr. Hillery, at Luxembourg on 30th June because, in this, in what are to me quite nauseatingly fulsome terms, we endorse every semi-colon, every implication, every suggestion, without reservation, of the very essence of the Treaty of Rome.  We have no doubt. We have no reservations.  We love it all.</P>

      <P>I was about to quote some of the, what are to me, extraordinarily naïve and fulsome endorsements at the beginning of a session of negotiation.  I should like to quote from page 2 of this circulated document:</P>
      <P>When applying for membership of the EEC in 1967, the Irish Government affirmed without qualification that they shared the ideals which inspire the parties.  They accept the aims of the Community as well as the action proposed to achieve those ends&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;including Mansholt, I suppose. They reiterate what the Taoiseach said in 1967.</P>
      <P>I now reaffirm on behalf of the Irish Government our full acceptance of the Treaties of Rome and Paris...</P>
      <P>5.  My Government accept the political objectives.</P>
      <P>6.  My Government welcome the declaration of the Member States at the Hague Meeting of their readiness to promote the development of the Community as an economic unit and monetary union.  The Irish Government accept equally the economic obligations arising from the provisions of the Treaty and the actions and decisions taken&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>There are no reservations with regard to agriculture.  The Irish Government accept the economic obligations as set out in the Treaty of Rome and fully support the action taken by the Community to implement the policy&mdash;including the suggestions, apparently, sent by Mansholt this month, in regard to getting people off the land.  The Irish Government fully support the action taken by the Community to implement their policy.  There are no reservations.</P>
      <P>14.  Irish industry looks forward to membership of the EEC.</P>
      <P>Finally, in regard to negotiations, where we hope to be able to extract from them something useful and protective for us, our negotiators say:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="689" /> For the sake of Europe and its peoples, for the sake of peace and prosperity in the world, these negotiations must not fail.</P>
    <P>That is a totally abject approach to negotiation.  We are not just on our knees but on our bellies: Please let us in on any conditions whatsoever.  We have no worries, no reservations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>When we look at the postures of the two parties, they are identical.  So far as Fine Gael are concerned, I am bound to say I find this not surprising.  This attitude to the Common Market seems to me the logical culmination of the attitude and policy of Fine Gael and the parties which preceded it since the foundation of the State.  This is a logical culmination of an attitude to the effect that we were right to look for some autonomy but that real independence is impossible; that it is unreal in the circumstances of the modern world; that we should never in fact have undertaken it; that the efforts made in the history of the State, particularly by Fianna Fáil, to establish a general economic independence and to establish a native industrial arm behind tariff walls were mistaken efforts.</P>
      <P>This has been consistent Fine Gael policy for a long time.  It seems to me that they are perfectly consistent and therefore, to the extent that they are consistent, they are free of reproach in this context.  They have not changed their posture and entering into Europe, it seems to me, is the logical extension of things in which they have always believed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is totally otherwise with the Fianna Fáil Party.  I suggest absolutely seriously that this decision by the Fianna Fáil Party represents a complete abandonment and jettisoning of every principle, not alone of the republican <Col N="690" /> movement as a whole, but also, specifically, of the party which call themselves the republican party.  It represents a total abandonment of every policy point on which they sought the support of the Irish electorate and on which they governed for a considerable number of years.  Every single policy point I can think of has been abandoned, deserted, and retreated from.</P>
    <P>This, of course, is absolutely permissible. One is entitled to do so.  One is entitled to change one's mind.  One is entitled to say: &ldquo;That policy was wrong.  That policy was not possible. We will stop trying to carry it out and we will do something else.&rdquo;  In fact, all parties evolve their policies and change the emphasis.  In the history of the State the Fine Gael Party and their predecessors have been reasonably consistent. The Labour Party have been reasonably consistent.  The Fianna Fáil Party have been totally inconsistent. While they have utterly reversed their policies on every basic issue, they tried to conceal from the electorate the fact that they had done so.</P>
    <P>In validation of this charge I want to quote the aims, as set out in the constitution of the Fianna Fáil Party, which were approved at the 24th Ard-Fheis in 1953.  This is relevant to this nation's application to join the European Community in the most fundamental and essential way.  I am not picking the twenties or the thirties or the forties.  I am taking 1953, a fairly recent time. Every single point of the seven points has been abandoned as an objective.</P>
    <P>Point 1 is to secure the unity and independence of Ireland as a republic. Last night I dealt at some length with the question of securing national reunification as participants with Britain in the European Community.  Anyone who believes that to be possible in the circumstances of European Community membership, is either very stupid, or very dishonest, or possibly both.  As for independence, the whole point about our entering a community of 250 million people is that we lose our independence. Of course we do.</P>
    <P>It may be correct&mdash;it may be argued honourably&mdash;that we should lose our independence but it has to be pointed <Col N="691" /> out that the objectives of the unity and the independence of Ireland are totally abandoned if we accept the EEC and the Treaty of Rome.  That was point 1 in the constitution of the Fianna Fáil Party in 1953.  Admittedly it may have been changed since.  It is stated by the Minister for External Affairs, in the extraordinary document which I quoted, that we have no reservations. This is a total reversal and a total betrayal.</P>
    <P>Point 2 is to restore the Irish language as the spoken language of the people and to develop a distinctive national life in accordance with Irish traditions and ideals.  I talked last night about what the implementation of Mansholt ideas would do to the Gaeltacht.  It would destroy the Gaeltacht. This is the party that say on the one hand&mdash;and I suppose we can take it that the order of the points indicates their importance&mdash;that point 2 is to restore the Irish language as the spoken language but on the other hand that they have no reservations.  They accept totally the implications of the agricultural policy in the Community which will destroy the social framework on which that bit of the Gaeltacht which still exists is based.</P>
    <P>As I say, they are either very stupid or very dishonest or both.  This is a profound change, a total change.  You are entitled to change but you must tell the people.  We do not like to degrade a national population by doing one thing and saying another, and by pretending that the policies of 20 years ago are still believed in while exactly the reverse policies are being carried out.  That makes for confusion.  That makes for the trivialisation of politics. That makes for the contempt of Parliament of which we already see too much in existence.  Change if you wish; change if it is correct to change&mdash;we all have to change and develop our policies&mdash;but do not conceal the change.  Do not pretend there is no change and do not pretend that there is no threat to the whole core of the Irish republican tradition in what you are now doing because you are utterly abandoning that core.</P>
    <P>Point 3 is to make the resources and <Col N="692" /> wealth of Ireland subservient to the needs and welfare of all the people of Ireland.  There is a nice socialist ring about that to my ear.  It must have been smuggled in out of the republican programme of the First Dáil.  When there is free movement of capital which we accept from all over the EEC, and when all restrictions on industry or land purchase have to be swept away&mdash; we may keep them going for a little while in a transitional period&mdash;where is there any honour or truth or justice in saying that the aim is to make the resources and wealth of Ireland subservient to the welfare of all the people of Ireland?  It becomes hypocritical.  It becomes hollow.  It becomes totally dishonest.</P>
    <P>Point 4 is to make Ireland as far as possible economically self-contained and self-sufficing.  Is there a single shred of expression of opinion anywhere in any document ever produced by the Commission of the EEC which does not have the exact opposite intention for all of the constituent countries of the Six or the expanded Ten?  There is not.  The whole intention is the exact opposite.</P>
    <P>That is a total reversal.  You are entitled to say that to make Ireland economically self-contained and self-sufficing was an objective impossible of attainment and that you have abandoned it.  You are entitled to say that, but then you must say: &ldquo;We sought the support of the Irish people on the basis of a policy of the development of the national economy which we have now utterly abandoned.&rdquo;  Truth and honour require you to admit that and not to sweep it under the carpet in a tiny speech skating around every serious subject like that made by the Taoiseach introducing the motion.</P>
    <P>This document gets funnier as it goes on because point 5 is to establish as many families as practicable on the land.  &ldquo;To establish&rdquo; suggests to increase the number.  I quoted what the Minister said in Luxembourg the other day.  He approves without reservation, and totally, of the agricultural policy of the Community.  It is stated in <i>European Community</i>, No. 6, June, 1970, that the basic premise of Mansholt <Col N="693" /> was that there were too many inefficient small farms in the Six.  It is also stated in the same magazine that to further reduce the number of farmers the Commission proposes paying at least 1,000 dollars a year and so on.  That is a total reversal of the policy of the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
    <P>Of seven points we have now gone through five.  All of them have been I totally abandoned or reversed.  As I say, as we go on they get funnier.  Point 6 is by suitable distribution of power to promote the ruralisation of industries essential to the lives of the people as opposed to their concentration in the cities.  We approve totally of the industrial policy of the Commission but, in 1967, an earlier Government document on this quoted the Commission's regional development plans.  This was written by a neutral civil servant three years ago, a man who was simply doing his job and giving a fair representation of what the Commission meant and intended.  On page 149 under &ldquo;Regional Development&rdquo; it says:</P>
    <P>The Commission suggests that regional programmes should be prepared based on a detailed study of economic and demographic trends... They should be designed to co-ordinate private and public efforts concentrating on a few well chosen areas.</P>
    <P>In the next paragraph, paragraph 437, says:</P>
    <P>The first steps, the Commission thinks, should be to promote the growth of industrial development poles....</P>
    <P>rather like the growth centres of a recent document which caused great heart searchings among rural Deputies</P>
    <P>...capable after initial aid of sustained development.</P>
    <P>But what has that concept of growth centres and industrial poles, which is the way the European Commission see industry developed, to do with the ruralisation of industry?  It is exactly the opposite; not a little different but totally opposite.  Of the seven skittles, six are now down.  The seventh one is to carry out the democratic programme <Col N="694" /> of the First Dáil.  That democratic programme began as a socialist document but was watered down, although not completely: it is still a magnificent blueprint for what we might do with this country if we had the courage, but the centre, the core of the democratic programme of the First Dáil, is a reiteration and amplification of the sentence that occurs in the Proclamation of 1916.  It is, in fact, a carrying-forward of that Proclamation.</P>
    <P>The 1916 Proclamation sentence is: &ldquo;We declare the right of the people of Ireland to the ownership of Ireland and to the unfettered control of Irish destinies to be sovereign and indefeasible.&rdquo; That is the core of the democratic programme of the First Dáil, the amplification of the Proclamation of 1916.  You see that participation in the European Community is a total reversal of that objective.  I repeat in this context the central thought of what the words &ldquo;indefeasible&rdquo; means: not liable to be made void or done away with, that which cannot be forfeited. So says the Proclamation and so says the democratic programme of the First Dáil.  The right of the people of Ireland to the ownership of Ireland and to the unfettered control of Irish destinies cannot be done away with. That is point 7 of the Fianna Fáil constitution of 1953: this sovereign control cannot be done away with, if you are to implement the democratic programme of the First Dáil.</P>
    <P>But what else does the jettisoning of Article 5 of the Constitution and, indeed, as I demonstrated last night, of Article 1 of the Constitution, do?  What else does moving the powers of decision to Brussels do, even assuming that the decisions are there made liable to democratic processes by an elected parliament which they are not now? What else does the existence of a European Union mean, apart from monetary and economic union, but a political union, and that again is made absolutely clear in intention by this European Community document to which I have referred, customs union, monetary union, economic union and political union, total union of the expanded Ten if we go in?  What else is that by any possible exercise in semantics but an utter reversal of the <Col N="695" /> statement that the right of the people of Ireland to the ownership of Ireland and to the unfettered control of Irish destinies is sovereign and indefeasible? It is a total reversal, utter and inescapable.</P>
    <P>That is the end of the seven points. That is the whole of the constituttion of Fianna Fáil as approved by the 24th Ard-Fheis in 1953.  Of the seven skittles in it not one is left standing, not even a little bit of one.  We have a total jettisoning of the whole tradition, the whole policy, the whole programme on which the nation gave Fianna Fáil more support than it gave to any other party during the thirties.  It is all gone, even to the last little bit, without anybody saying so.  Yes, we tore it all up, we threw is overboard but we do not tell anybody; they might stop voting for us.  This is national hypocrisy on a vast scale,national sharp practice.  Fine Gael have been consistent and Fianna Fáil have ended up by accepting the Fine Gael position, total betrayal of all their republicanism, an absolute betrayal. There is not a scrap of it left. This is why we have all this to-ing and fro-int, this farcical stuff about who is the better republican over there.  it is so famned ridiculous.  None of them is a republican.  They do not come within an ass's roar of being republicans.  The have not been republicans for a long time.  It is impossible and unrealistic in in their book.  They should stop the pretence.</P>

      <P>After a few years, assuming that we are successful by the efforts of both sides of this House, in getting into the European Community, as revealed on every major aspect of national policy in this debate, think ahead a few years and ask the question in imagination in 1974; what distinquishes Fianna Fáil from Fine Gael?  The head cases are gone now or in the process of going.  With the haters gone from both sides and with the desperate bitterness of the Civil War fading from both sides, what distinquishes them in policy, aspirations, outlook, social objectives?  Not a single thing.  They are identical.  In their discussion on this the most important topic, to use the Taoiseach's phrase, that this Parliament has had to debate, not the tiniest scrap of difference was revealed between Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is great that the hatreds of the Civil War are fading away.  I would wish these two parties to do now one important thing for Ireland.  It is not to coalesce but to fuse, amalgamate, unify.  Apparently, they believe in unions of one sort or another.  There is the union that would make sense of Irish politics, that would make sense of Irish politics, that would bury the Civil War and give us a real Right and Left, both saying what they believe, with the possibility of real dialogue without hatred or rancour, the beginning of real politics in Ireland without confusion, without the need to say one thing and do another, without the need for pretence.  That is a very great service that both parties could do.  Think of the big majority that would ensue. Think what a courageous possibility <Col N="697" /> there is of carrying through unpopular but possibly necessary legislation. There is no difference any more.  To go through a process of shadow boxing or sham fighting is degrading for Parliament and for the Irish people.  This debate has revealed no difference, and, giving some years for the animosities and differences&mdash;not political but personal differences&mdash;to fade away, by 1975 there would not be a whit of difference.  It would be the great step forward for Ireland.  It would be a great healing of old sores, a great burying of the past.</P>
    <P>We in the Labour Party find ourselves in a different situation, with a different outlook.  What seems to be happening to Fianna Fáil and Find Gael&mdash;perhaps a death wish is too strong a phrase&mdash;is that they have a yearning for Utopia.  In some national mythologies you look back to a golden age and in some you look forward to a time when all you problems will fall from your shoulders and life will be simple.  The only way I can explain the extraordinarily optimistic and naïve attitude of both parties to the European Community is that they see it as a Utopia which will make all our problems go away, which will lift the conditions sustaining this fragile nation as a nation off our shoulders, so that we can abandon the effort to keep it as a nation and say to the people in Brussels: &ldquo;Take it.  Try to do a little better with it than we have been able to do.&rdquo;  This is a confession of defeat and of failure, of unwillingness and unability to rule any more, because the two things are correleated.</P>
    <P>I do not wish at this stage to introduce something I had intended to discuss now, the possibility of association, because I said last night that the simplistic alternatives of totally in or totally out were bogus alternatives which did violence to the real situation. I was preparing to document at some length details of the countries in Europe and outside Europe which had negotiated successfully what the Taoiseach suggested in his opening speech was impossible, that is, agreements of association or even agreements which were not of association but lesser agreements which solved the problem of their <Col N="698" /> industrial and agricultural access to the European Community.</P>
    <P>I do not propose at this time&mdash;I have been speaking for long enough now&mdash; to enter into the documentation of that except to say I believe the Taoiseach's presentation of the possibilities of association in his opening speech are misleading, that we have made no serious effort as an nation to examine and explore the possibilities of association. The possibilities are vast.  Association and sub-association arrangements, stretching not just into Africa but even into South America as well as to Turkey, Israel and a whole host of European countries, have been made. Anyone who wants to familiarise himself with them to convince himself of the truth of what I am saying has only to go down to the Dáil Library to validate it.  The possibilities of subarrangements short of total membership have ample documentation through the whole of this decade.</P>
    <P>We can choose to opt for full membership and not for association, for some smaller status.  It may be possible to justify that but it is not permissible to pretend that the choice does not exist. In fact it is not honest to pretend the choice does not exist.  Those who say we must opt for total membership culminating in a five-year transition period and total membership before 1980, must explain why the sort of agreement the Greeks were able to negotiate is not available to Ireland and that it would be refused to us.  With those observations I propose to leave the matter of the alternative of association, a matter on which one could speak at great length and on which information is readily available to anyone who wants to look for it.</P>
    <P>We are seeing in this debate the emergence of a new line-up, in my view long overdue, in Irish politics: Fianna Fáil Fine Gael on the one side and the Labour movement on the other side. It is a welcome emergence as far as I am concerned.  On the Fianna Fáil-Fine Gael side there will be the effort to carry through successfully the policy that, by the quite extraordinarily obsequious posture which our Minister for External Affairs has adopted in Luxemboiurg, we shall be totally accepted <Col N="699" /> into the European Community in the shortest possible time and without any reservations or conditions or any special protection.</P>
    <P>On the other side there is the posture of the Labour movement led by the Labour Party who will resist this total entry with all our strength.  We shall seek forms of association with the European Community which will secure for Ireland industrial and agricultural advantages of association at the same tiem as we preserve our national sovereignty, our national indentity and the possibility of a future evolution as a nation, which will secure the continuance of the Irish nation.  That is the line-up which has emerged in this debate.  That is surely why it is an important debate.</P>
    <P>We shall also be endeavouring to examine the question, which has been very strikingly ignored, of what happens if the negotiations fail.  They failed twice before.  If you had to make a book, as I said, the chances of Britain getting in are probably money on, but it is far from a certainty.  Those who doubt that have only to read the articles in this week's <i>Economist</i> on the atmosphere and the prospects which accompanied the opening of the British negotiations during the past week. They are far from rosy; there are real clouds on the horizon.  Do we sail along with the bite of the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement getting deeper every week, saying:&ldquo;It will be all right because we are getting into the European Community&rdquo;, without developing alternative policies, without facing the most concrete planning of every aspect of our national life? What do we do if the very real alternative emerges that Britain does not get it? If we are discussing entry we are discussing it as a probability but not as a certainty, and when the Minister for External Affairs says in Luxembourg at the end of his speech that the negotiations must not fail he is expressing a wish; he is not necessarily expressing a truth.  They may very well fail, and I can see singularly little effort on the part of the Government to prepare us for that alternative or to discuss the alternative in any serious terms.  This of <Col N="700" /> course fits in with my thesis that it is a death wish, that it is a desire for a Utopia, that it is the shuffling off of responsibilities, where at last big daddy somewhere else will take over our troubles from us and it will be all right.</P>
    <P>I have referred to the division between the other two parties and the Labour Party on this issue.  If we try to look into the future of course it may be, and it is even probable, that on this occasion those sections of the community under the leadership of the Labour Party and the Labour movement will fail in their struggle to keep us from full membership.  However, I can only promise that if we do fail we will carry on inside the European Community the struggle to humanise it, the struggle to abolish its empire, the struggle for social justice, the struggle to tame the ruthless free competition and <i>laissez faire</i> ideology which now animates it and to make it into a place where all the brutalities of capitalism will be abolished.  We will carry on the struggle together with out brothers of the Labour movement and of the oppressed people of the other countries of the Ten.</P>
    <P>Though we are opposed to an enlarged European Community we are not opposed in the very least to the closest fraternal contacts between nations, provided they are equal.  We are a party with contacts through the Socialist International with our brother parties all over the world. We are the upholders of the idea of internationalism.  We have contacts which neither of the other parties possess through the world and we are far from being ashamed of them&mdash;we are very proud of them&mdash;but our internationalism, in the words of Connolly,, is based on our nationalism.  We see no conflict between a genuine nationalism and a genuine internationalism.  You cannot have one without the other.  In repudiating a European Community and its basic ideologies and its basic outlook we do not for a moment repudiate the brotherhood of man and, more especially, the brotherhood of the oppressed peoples all over the world.</P>
    <P>This is not an internal or a negative or pessimistic attitude to the countries <Col N="701" /> of Europe; this is a genuinely international outlook and we welcome the greatest possible exchange of culture and the making of contacts in trade and industry&mdash;all sorts of contacts with the single condition that they be entered into by us as sovereign people and on the basis of equality.  There can be no real contacts without these conditions of a just nature between nations; there can be no real internationalism, there only be dominance and subservience. Two paths and two policies are emerging.  Far from being afraid, as Deputies from other benches have suggested, of the dangers of Europe, we in this party are not afraid of the struggle to sustain Irish independence, Irish sovereignty, the entity, the future of the nation.  We are not afraid of this.  We are not looking to civil servants in Brussels to take the responsibilities from a national Parliament or a sovereign people.  We in the Labour movement and in the Labour Party accept these responsibilities.  We have reached the moment, belatedly, in the evolution of Irish republicanism when the other parties have finally and totally thrown away the slogans and the banners of national sovereignty and national independence.  We in the socialist republican party of James Connolly, and in the socialist republican tradition of our founder, will continue to uphold, to sustain, to carry forward against the European Community, against its intentions, the banner of Irish sovereignty and of Irish unity and independence.</P>

      <P>Never in our history has such an important issue come before the people as this mostion on our entry into the European Economic Community.  Geographically and historical facts cannot be ignored. When darkness andignorance existed in Europe Ireland was the one beacon of light, knowledge and hope for the Continent.  Europe does not and cannot ignore the stupendous contribution to its culture, to its character and indeed to its very philosophy made by the Irish.  This is so particularly in the case of men of the calibre of Columbanus.  It can be said that <Col N="702" /> Europe is more aware of its debt to Ireland than we are aware that in Europe we are creditors.</P>

    <P>Circumstances beyond human control have decreed that chronologically we are now seeking entrance to the Common Market after the Six but, whether we here like it or not, before the Six ever banded together they were Europeans and we also were Europeans.  If the Six ever mentally contemplated a united Europe without any of the others, their plans were doomed to failure.  This however, is not the case.  as I see it, Europe seeks us and we also seek Europe.  In these days of polarisation of power in the east and in the west a strong unified Europe is a necessity.  We cannot afford to disassociate ourselves from the wonderful venture of making Europe into one.  In my opinion it should always have been one in regard to trading, <i>et cetera.</i> Europe cannot have us an inactive spectator.  We should get in there in the true apostolic Irish spirit and be positive contributors to the effort, the thought and even the goods that Irishmen can produce.  Let no one say that there are goods which we produce which any other country could produce as well as we do.  We have a lot to give and  Europe has a lot to learn from us and a lot to gain from our knowledge, crafts, <i>et cetera.</i>  There must, of course, be difficulties in amalgamating independent bodies and this quite obviously is the case in the formation of united Europe.  In one case what might be an attarctive proposition for country A might not be so attractive for country B which might require a period for adaptation.  In another case the position could be reversed, and so on.  These are the inevitable and expected growing pains among the member of a united and growing European body and it is only natural to assume that we should have them. Anything which is worthwhile cannot be achieved without some effort and some pain.  Instead of wilting away the sight of the difficulties confronting us we should shape up to solving our own difficulties.  Perhaps at present we have some economic difficulties but, instead of withdrawing like cowards into a protective cocoon or being idle spectators, we should see our entry <Col N="703" /> into Europe as the greatest challenge ever confronting our people.</P>
    <P>Irish agriculture, industry, diplomacy and culture will be strengthened in the bracing atmosphere of the Common Market and to think otherwise would be to display an inferiority complex.  It comes as a surprise to most of our people that there are Members of the Dáil who want no part in the European Community, but the fact is that we have applied and that we shall probably be joining that Community.</P>
    <P>We had a choice about whether we should apply for membership of the EEC.  If we did not join and if the Common Market eventually failed our only comment could be the hateful one &ldquo;I told you so&rdquo;.  Again, if we did not join the Community and if the Common Market venture proved successful, ultimately we would have to come to the Community, cap in hand. However, if we make our application to join the EEC, even if the venture partially fails, we will always be able to vindicate ourselves as a vital, eager nation because we played our part in the effort to form the Common Market.</P>
    <P>I believe we will join and that the Common Market will succeed and this should be our thought in the difficult negotiations that face our Government. The Fianna Fáil Government sincerely believe in the future of the Common Market.  They will do their utmost to work for the benefit of the people of this country and this should satisfy the Leader of Fine Gael and those of his party who seem to want reassurance. One point should be stressed, namely, that the Government are setting about the negotiations in a positive and practical manner and they will face any difficulties that arise.</P>
    <P>In the formation of a united Europe, the attitude of Fianna Fáil is that we are givers as well as takers, that Ireland has much to give for which Europe will be grateful.  I listened to part of Deputy Keating's speech last night and I have never heard a Deputy paid such a gloomy picture in regard to our entry into Europe.  The Deputy <Col N="704" /> criticised the Irish industtrialist and said he would make no headway if we gained entry into Europe.  Although he did not put it into words, in my opinion, he criticised the Irish worker and implied that the Irish are incapable of competing with European countries.  I think the Deputy forgets the grit and determination of Irish men and women when they are faced with a challaenge, and we all recognise that our entry into Europe is a real challenge. I believe the Irish people will work together and thereby ensure that Ireland can stand on a par with any European country and I include the industrialist, the worker, the farmer, the farm labourer, the professional man and the tradesman in this.</P>
    <P>Deputy Keating suggested that the future of Irish agriculture in the Common Market was anything but rosy.  An examination of the agricultural industry shows that the cattle trade represents 70 to 75 per ent of the income of this industry.  There is a bouyant trade in this country for both store cattle and beef.  If we were in to the Common Market store cattle would be be worth £4 to £5 per cwt liveweight and beef would be increased by at least 1s per lb.  How Deputy Keating could paint such a gloomy picture in regard to agriculture in the context of our entry into the EEC defeats me.  It is my firm conviction that this challenge will be squarely met by Irish men and women.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LukeBelton" hpid="Mr. L. Belton Mr. L. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>As did the previous speaker, I too listened to Deputy Keating for a long time lst night and also today.  I am not as conversant with farming as the last speaker and cannot go into the pros and cons of our prospects for the agricultural sector in the Common Market.  However, I was interested to listen to his assessment of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael and, while I do not agree with his assessment ofour party, I thank him for the compliment that we have been consistent.  He does not seem to regard Fianna Fáil in quite the same light.  He read our the resolutions passed at the Ard-Fheis in 1953 in proof of this.  I do not think he was making any great discovery., He said Fianna Fáil had abandoned the republican tradition. <Col N="705" /> This re-echoes the words of a former Fianna Fáil Party member who is now an Independent.</P>
      <P>To get down to the more serious aspect, entering the European Economic Community is one of the most important, which as faced this country since the foundation of the State.  It is only proper, therefore, that all the facts as ascertainable should be clearly laid before the people and the people should be made fully aware of their responsible public opinion that there is a very strong case for this country participating in the European Economic Community, not along because, as so many maintain, we have no alternative but also because the European Economic Community hs the same objectives as ourselves and it is only right that we should share in these objectives.</P>
      <P>Since this nation won its independence we have been largely overshadowed by Britain because of our geographical position and because the greater part of our trade is with Britain.  Only last year, Deputy Colley, as Minister for Industry and Commerce, said that 70 per cent of our trade was with Britain.  When we enter the European Economic Community we should have about 75 per cent of our trade with the EEC countries.  Britain has acted as a barrier to our nationhood. Those who argue that we should not enter, we will lose our national identity.  I think the opposite will be the case: when we enter as a sovereign, independent nation other countries will be aware of our nationhood.  Many of them regard us, unfortunately, as part of Britain; when we enter they will realise that we have a separate national identity.  We will have an opportunity of taking our place with the other nations in the Community and we will realise that we have a separate national identity.  We will have an opportunity of taking our place with the other nations in the Community and we will have an opportunity of playing our part in shaping the Community, founded on traditions and ideals common to all of us.  At the same time, we will preserve our national identity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In all negotiations it is vitally important that our Government should be in from the start and participate <Col N="706" /> fully.  Our Government should be fully aware of each step taken by Britain in her application.  It is obvious that many of the difficulties Britain may try to iron out will in one way or another affect us.  We should be very careful to ensure that Ireland is Ireland and not just the Twenty-six Counties.  Ireland will have to be considered as a unit. We must ensure that this will be the evolution.  Britain may try to get special concessions or some special privileges for the six north-eastern counties.  It will be our duty to ensure that the Community looks upon Ireland as a whole and that concessions are granted to the whole of Ireland and not just to one part.</P>
    <P>There is a European Investment Bank for the relief of certain undeveloped areas.  Italy hs benefited in road construction.  Germany has benefited in railroad development.  A strong case can be made for the granting special concessions to certain parts of this country.</P>
    <P>There will be free competition in the Community.  Big nations will have an advantage over small nations.  Small nations of themselves have no effective means of ensuring that their interests are respected by others.  In the European Economic Community the obligations of both large and small nations are clearly defined and small nations have the means of securing their rights. For a long time we have been practically totally dependent on Britain for our trading.  We have made different agreements.  We have had to provide food, particularly butter, for Britain at subsidised price.  Britain has not hesitated, when internal difficulties arose, to impose levies against Irish imports.  Britain has not honoured agreements when it has suited her.</P>
    <P>The EEC will open the way for us to the larger markets of Europe, markets in which we will be able to sell anything we produce or manufacture here.  We will face very keen competition. It will be up to us to surmount that competition successfully.  If, by any chance, we fail then we will only have ourselves to blame for not making the effort we should.  Negotiating entry to the EEC is not similar to <Col N="707" /> negotiating a trade agreement with another nation in which each side seeks the best bargain it can get for itself.  This is an association or a partnership. What is done in those negotiations is done together and with the idea of improving conditions for all nations. Some people say that if we join the Common Market the contract is binding forever.  I think Deputy Keating scoffed at the idea that we could hope to improve conditions.  At the end of his statement he at least said that if we go into the EEC his party will continue to fight to improve conditions inside and to make it a better Community. Therefore, I think he at least conceded that there is a possibility of improving it.  There are opportunities to promote changes in it.</P>
    <P>Since the Community was first established, quite a considerable time has been spent in reconciling the problems of the member nations.  At present, those who are members of the EEC agree that none of their vital interests has been damaged.  They also agree that they have derived very many benefits from membership of the Community.  As regards this country's entry into EEC, as Deputy Cowen pointed out, there seems to be a bright future for agriculture.  The agricultural price level in the Community seems to be higher than it is here.  There seems every likelihood that this country can gain considerable advantage by entry into EEC.</P>
    <P>As regards industry, a lot of people are apprehensive of our entry into the EEC and afraid of how we may fare in the industrial end of it.  Many of the main industrial organisations say that there is no serious risk but that rather it offers a chance of expansion. America, with its vast population&mdash; about 250 million&mdash;and its huge markets has been making vast profits. America will utilise those profits to improve production and to improve technology.  It has invested profits accrued abroad to establish a firm foothold in different industries in Europe.  I cite the car trade, particularly, and the amount of the European market which has been captured by America.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="708" /> If we are to have no EEC or no get-together of the European nations, it is not unlikely that, in the not too distant future, America will gain even greater control of the European market. Britain sees this.  The British realise that a small island like Britain would not have a chance of competing successfully against the United States of America with their vast resources.  Britain does not think well of the idea of forming a Commonwealth market because of the difficulties due to the fact that so many parts of the British Commonwealth are so far flung.  If we had not this concept of the EEC and if Britain were to join America, could Britain successfully continue as an independent nation or would she end up as a subsidiary or another State of the United States of America?</P>
    <P>If Europe is to progress and to maintain its position in trade, the greatest hope is the formation of some sort of European Community like the United States of America where different countries will be bound together, will work together and will have access to the markets of Europe.  They will have at least as large a market as America &mdash;or larger: I think the population of Europe is roughly 300 million.</P>
    <P>People who object to our going into the EEC seem to fear for the future of industries.  Overall, I suppose there is a certain amount to be said for this fear for some of our smaller industries.  Our industry will have to gear itself and to bring itself up to modern standards.  It will have to make the effort to compete successfully with industry in other countries.</P>
    <P>Let us look at the position if England enters the EEC and Ireland does not.  What is the position for Ireland then?  At the moment, we have an emigration figure of about 18,000 per annum.  We have a fairly high amount of unemployment and a lot of our unemployed people emigrate to Britain. If Britain were in EEC and we were not in it then sanctions would be imposed by Britain against Irish workers going into Britain.  I wonder what would happen to our people who have to emigrate, then?</P>
    <P>We should not, however, face this <Col N="709" /> challenge of entering the European Community as if we were going in as suppliants or beggars.  This nation has a great deal to offer, a great deal to offer in agriculture and something, though not quite so much, to offer in fisheries.  The Government have unfortunately been neglectful of our fisheries.  According to the White Paper issued on our entry into the EEC there are guaranteed prices for agricultural products and the indications would seem to be that we have much to gain at the agricultural end but may find it rather tough going at the industrial end.</P>
    <P>The Government have not been specific enough about which industries are likely to find the going hard when we enter Europe and which are most likely to succeed.  I do not want them to give the names of firms.  That would be wrong but they could give a general indication as to the type of industries they believe likely to succeed or details of how different industries are likely to be affected.  It seems to me that they are not being frank enough in letting people know what type of industry runs the greatest risk from our entry into Europe.</P>
    <P>We should also examine carefully what effect it will have financially and on employment.  We are a very small nation in comparison with other nations.  We have a small population. It is true to say that we have very little capital.  We have a home market which is limited by our small population. We have had a reasonable export market but that export market was built up, in the main, as a result of the export tax relief schemes.  There is no guarantee that our exports will continue to be as successful in the future as they have been in the past.  I should like now to quote from <i>Challenge</i> which is published by the Federation of Irish Industries.  They deal with the export markets, present exports and competitiveness and they say:</P>
    <P>It was becoming obvious that Ireland, with an insignificant home market, could not hope to produce economically the vast range of modern industrial goods against the large-scale industries in Britain, <Col N="710" /> America, the Continent and Japan. Therefore, a two-pronged policy was adopted by the Government.  Firstly, new industrial concerns, most of them foreign backed and producing mainly for export, were established with generous Government assistance. In addition, existing enterprises which had been established to supply the home market under the self-sufficiency policy were encouraged to undertake some exports.  An attractive tax relief scheme was introduced which made it profitable for many of them to do so.</P>
    <P>Over the last ten years, and largely as a result of these measures, there has been a very substantial increase in the volume of our industrial exports.  Free trade with the EEC will completely change the environment in which this has been achieved.  One cannot assume, therefore, that industrial policies which were profitable in the old circumstances will remain so in the new.  On the contrary, looking at the basis on which our export trade was developed over the past ten years, one finds no reassurance that it will necessarily survive in the new conditions.</P>
    <P>It is clear from that that, while we may have had a reasonably high export market, the conditions which led to this will disappear in the main in the EEC and industry will become very competitive indeed.  However, there seems to be some hope of advantages from entering this market.</P>
    <P>First, we will have opened to us a market of approximately 300 million customers and, secondly, members of the EEC will impose tariffs against non-member countries.  Thirdly, British industrialists and British industry in general will look to Europe rather than concentrate on Ireland as they have been doing.  Britain seems to be already concentrating on the European market in preparation for entry.</P>
    <P>I suppose if there are advantages it is only right to say that there will probably be some disadvantages as well. There will be disadvantages inasmuch as the other members of the EEC will compete on the same terms in the Irish and the British markets, so we will be <Col N="711" /> open to more competition from the other member states of the EEC.  We will also suffer inasmuch as we depend a great deal on the import of raw materials for our industries.  Whereas up to now certain raw materials which were vital to our industries could be imported from countries outside the EEC without the payment of duty, we will now have to pay EEC duty an any raw materials coming in.  This, in turn, will mean dearer raw material and, therefore, higher production costs in industry.  However, when we weigh up the question of whether we should seek entry into the EEC or decide to remain outside it, we must consider all the advantages that are to be gained by going in and the grave disadvantages we would suffer if we remained outside.</P>
    <P>In this context the Government should seek&mdash;whether they could succeed in getting it or not I do not know &mdash;immediate entry into the agricultural section of the market and a transitional period at the industrial end.  This would suit this country.  The opposite might be more suitable to Britain.  It is, at least, worth seeking, though we may not be able to gain it.  We should at least make every effort to gain that goal.  It is vitally necessary that we should have the best possible negotiating team.  The Government should ensure that those who negotiate on our behalf are the best that can be obtained.  It is also vital that we should be established in the eyes of other nations as a responsible and respected negotiator.  Unfortunately, in this regard some recent events may, to a degree, undermine us.</P>
    <P>We should not imagine that when we go into the EEC everything in the garden will be rosy or that everybody will be much better off.  In fact, we may find we shall not be as well off as we are at present.  It is not really a question of whether we can afford to go into the EEC or not but rather, due to our trading and geographical position in regard to Britain, whether, if Britain goes into the EEC, we can afford to remain out of it.</P>

      <P>It has been said <Col N="712" /> rather flippantly but nevertheless with a substantial amount of truth that the Common Market in the context of this Dáil debate is rather like sex.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I await the return of the Minister for External Affairs from his visit to Sir Alec.  May I suggest that rather than the kind of euphoric, spiritualistic, almost Christian crusading veneer that the Fianna Fáil Party have put upon the Common Market application of this State it is much better, more constructive and fruitful that we should be understandably rather cautious in our approach, as the Labour Party have been.  We should not be unduly conservative about this application but we should analyse the effect of it on our political, economic and cultural life.  I suggest that the Government Ministers, apart from their routine Civil Service contributions to this debate, have not so far made any particular attempt at that.  Equally, there is a direct obligation devolving on the Opposition parties to state&mdash;so far it has devolved on the Labour Party&mdash;whatever reservations there <Col N="713" /> may be in the minds of the people, to state these in no uncertain terms and also to outline the safeguards we must have in any negotiations in Brussels and to approach the whole question in a cold and, as the Americans say, cool, general manner, not in any negative or anti-European sense.  I propose in my contribution to attempt this.</P>
      <P>It would be an act of intellectual dishonesty on the part of this House, an act of political naivety, if we were not prepared at the outset to admit as a hard reality that in many respects, by virtue of our historical and current economic position in these islands, to a considerable degree, but not to the extent that the Fianna Fáil Party accept, the decision may well be out of our hands.  Even if I sound repetitive I must say that it has been said that if Britain makes a decision we tend to do likewise.  I would stress that we do not take the view advanced by the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste.  We do not accept for one moment that whatever the circumstances or conditions we should enter, no more than we would accept that whatever the circumstances or conditions we should stay out of the Common Market.</P>
      <P>We in the Labour Party feel it is a matter for judgment, for not going overboard, as Fianna Fáil have gone in seeking to get into the Common Market.  It is a question of cool, political judgment of the situation as it evolves over the next 18 months.  There will be 18 months of negotiations but, to listen to the Taoiseach or the Minister for External Affairs, one would think it was all over and done with. I suggest the approach must not be on an emotional basis or on the basis that once again we will start a holy crusade, as Deputy Cowen said.  He even brought in St. Columbanus this afternoon. He went to his reward centuries ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then Deputy Timmins of the Fine Gael Party suggested rather oddly that Ireland's entry into the Common Market would be the greatest thing since the Holy Roman Empire.  I fáil to see that the hard-headed technocrats, the 5,000 civil servants in Brussels in their steel structured building will be <Col N="714" /> influenced by this crusading approach by the Fianna Fáil Party and by some of the Fine Gael Deputies.</P>
    <P>The application of the Government to go into the Common Market should not be and cannot be, if we have any sense of Christianity, on the basis of being in favour of one particular bloc, of being pro-west or anti-Communist. It should be on the basis of the facts as the Irish people see them and as we attempt to interpret them.  It is all very well to have the Minister for Transport and Power, Deputy Brian Lenihan, as usual magnificently dressed, in fact looking like a Commissioner of the Common Market, saying across the floor to Deputy Keating: &ldquo;You should go to Peking or Moscow.&rdquo;  This superficial approach which typifies the Fianna Fáil attitude&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely a remark about a Minister's clothing is one of the most superficial remarks ever made in this House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that.  It is probably envy.  It appears that negotiations will continue for the best part of two years, and the Labour Party are performing a valuable public function in stating their reservations in regard to entry.  I wish to quote a statement by a Deputy who is not particularly revered by the Fianna Fáil Party but for whom respect is growing even though they find it difficult to admit it.  I refer to Deputy Dr. Cruise-O'Brien who said: &ldquo;The Labour Party is not against closer association with Europe.&rdquo;  That is an elementary statement.  It is important to point out that, although we may be on the periphery of Europe and we may be a small island of 4 million people&mdash;assuming we include our brethren in Northern Ireland, although they have been completely excluded from any reference in the Fianna Fáil documentation, but I shall come to that later&mdash;this country is part of Europe not in any crusading sense but as a geographical fact.  We in the Labour Party, or any other Members of this House, do not bear any particular hostility towards the many different peoples of Europe, be they from eastern Europe or western Europe, bearing in mind the division which the <Col N="715" /> cold war strategists thought up in 1945. Our regard and respect for the peoples &mdash;not necessarily the governments&mdash;of the whole of Europe are as strong for one sector as for the other.  We in the Labour Party do not suffer from any illusions about Christian grandeur in relation to the peoples of the various nations of Europe.  We do not regard the people of the Six or the people of the Ten to be or the Nine to be as being any less or any more Christian or as any less or more rapacious than the peoples of many other nations.</P>
      <P>Seeing that the Minister for Health, Deputy Childers, went verbally berserk in his attempt to drag the Irish people into Europe, it is well to remind him of the holy and unholy wars in which the nations of the Six and other nations of Europe, with honourable exceptions like the Scandinavian countries, were involved.  Their record for rapaciousness, for materialism, for unchristian attitudes, is there.  Whether we are talking about eastern Europe or western Europe, America or Latin America, the Far East, the Middle East, Asia or any other part of the world, let us put this Common Market spiritualistic approach into perspective, because Fianna Fáil people and particularly the Minister, Deputy Childers, have got to read their European history.  I therefore fully accept the statement by Deputy Dr. Cruise-O'Brien in this House on 24th June&mdash;I quote:</P>
      <P>It seems to me that a rational line might entertain both hope and fear as to the possibilities, the opportunities, the dangers and the difficulties arising out of a possible future association with Europe or a commitment to Europe.</P>
      <P>This is an objective and rational statement by comparison with the euphoric nonsense we have heard in relation to this proposition.  Deputy Dr. FitzGerald's speech was not a particularly good one.  I have read much better speeches by him, but I do agree with him when he said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It must be a policy compounded of hope and fears, a realistic policy and a realistic outlook, a hard-headed <Col N="716" /> assessment of the situation, noting our strength and noting our weaknesses and preparing on our strength with confidence and mitigating our weaknesses with intelligence.</P>
    <P>Although I agree with the Deputy there, I thought that in many other parts of the speech he was excessively emotional and somewhat at variance with the facts of the situation.  However, the statements by Deputy Dr. Cruise-O'Brien and Deputy Dr. FitzGerald contrast very sharply with Deputy Cowen's comment about St. Columbanus or with the traditional approach of Fianna Fáil regarding the Common Market.</P>
    <P>The first approach to the Common Market was made with a sense of humour.  It was started in 1962 by the then Taoiseach, Mr. Seán Lemass, when at the Fianna Fáil Ard Feis, to the hurrahs of the assembled gathering of the 2,000 cumann members, he said in relation to European integration:</P>
    <P>We in Ireland welcome this movement of the Christian peoples of western Europe towards their closer unity and we want to march with them.</P>
    <P>If I may say so, the words &ldquo;Christian&rdquo;, and &ldquo;march&rdquo; might be applied with greater relevance to this island than to Europe.  Indeed in regard to the work done by Mr. Seán Lemass there is still a great deal of leeway to be made up in our approach to national and international unity. I have attempted to put in some perspective, perhaps harshly but necessarily so, in this debate what the mythical European concept is.  We have to approach the Common Market therefore on a more realistic basis.  The rich industrial countries in western Europe have, from a limited point of view, been highly successful.  Admittedly the countries of Western Europe have created a society of very advanced technology and have accelerated an almost explosive scientific development and their economies are in many respects extremely efficient and very effectively managed.  They have achieved much in terms of production, living standards <Col N="717" /> and the evolution of parliamentary democracy.</P>
    <P>I would be the last to deny that in many parts of western Europe and throughout the world there is a sense of frustration, of catastrophe and of crisis which is not evident among many of the peoples within the Common Market.  One has only to read the statement by U Thant today, or listen to statements of his Holiness the Pope in relation to arms or racial conflict&mdash;and very often I feel that perhaps he overstates the position in some other aspects&mdash;or aid to underdeveloped countries to know that these statements have a profound significance and are worthy of support by any Christian people.  The seventies&mdash;during which we are supposedly going on this magnificent crusade&mdash;are the decade of possible total destruction of the people of Europe and of the world.  That is why we in the Labour Party ask our people to look around the world, beyond Ireland and beyond the Six, because at this time&mdash;and this is relevant to the possible defence commitments this country could be asked to enter into in the context of the European defence policy, so-called&mdash;the stock of nuclear weapons is big enough to exterminate all human life and everything man has made on this earth, and the biological and chemical weapons available to European countries and to the Six are even cheaper to produce and are even more efficient than any stock of nuclear weapons possessed by NATO or some western European countries.  This is a fact which must be mentioned for the consideration of the people.</P>
    <P>It is also true that this will become the Common Market crusade of Fianna Fáil in the seventies&mdash;as it probably will become because at the next Ard-Fheis they will have to have some diversion if they are to get away from their current internal problems. This is becoming, and in many respects is already, a decade of violence in many parts of Europe, between nations and between people in nations and there is no indication of any decline in this tendency.</P>
    <P>It is also the decade of starvation, ironically enough.  We talk about milk <Col N="718" /> surpluses and sugar surpluses and very high agricultural prices and Deputy Cowen gets very excited about the magnificent prices we are going to get for beef in the Common Market while the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries talks about getting 3s 9d a gallon for milk, but if we want to take the Christian approach let us accept the fact that there are now more hungry mouths to feed in the world than at any time previously.  In 1975 India alone will need 20 per cent more food than it did in 1965 with no population increase whatever, if not one extra child is born in that country.</P>
    <P>Of course I do not hear any holy hurrahs in the Common Market about that situation, or see any attempt to export the half million tons of surplus butter to any underdeveloped country. If any Deputy has not seen the film &ldquo;Calcutta&rdquo; or any of the starving millions of people in many parts of Africa, India, Latin America, the Far East or the Near East, then a couple of hours viewing of this film will bring home to him the irrelevance in the international, world sense of this magnificent Common Market spiritualistic campaign in which Fianna Fáil would love all of us suddenly to become immersed.</P>
    <P>I would also point out that in many respects the seventies are the decade of environmental destruction.  There is the exploitation of our natural resources in Europe, pollution of the air and of the water, which is occurring at an everincreasing pace in western Europe, and by all accounts very little of the GNP of any country has been devoted to containing that problem.  Therefore do not let us be too smug and above all do not let us go overboard in our pro-European approach because we have a great deal to learn about the Common Market.  In regard to our culture may I say that there has been, if I may use the expression, some constipated nonsense given to this House about the effect of EEC entry on Irish culture.</P>

      <P>While at the moment this country is being somewhat swamped by the all-pervasive Anglo-American type of culture, which in many respects has had a profound effect on this nation, nevertheless our entry into the Common Market is not likely to change that overnight.  It is about time that the Minister for Health, Deputy Childers, began to appreciate this point.  A visit to many of the capitals of Europe, to Amsterdam or to the high spots of Frankfurt might place this matter in its proper setting.</P>
      <P>In regard to the background of the Common Market, set up in anxiety and in tension and at times in political hysteria, after the world war and during the cold war, it is very important to point out that Europe has changed very considerably since then.  The architects of what we in the Labour Party would call the little Europe of the Six, because it is very much a little Europe in that regard, were extremely conscious of the decline in their political, military and economic power.  They saw the emergence of the American continent in terms of production and military might and there was also the growth of Russian influence and power.  As a result, the Common Marketeers decided to set up their own &ldquo;little Europe&rdquo; power bloc and this has been the motivation behind the setting up of the Community. It was a consolidating of neo-colonial traditions within Europe and if it had the word &ldquo;Rome&rdquo; attached to the Treaty that did not give it any particular significance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irish application must be seen primarily as an assessment of the economic disadvantages of being excluded from a customs union which would include Britain, assuming Britain goes into Europe, and an assessment of the advantages of membership mainly for agriculture.  On such a complex question, about which there are many imponderables, there seems to be an amazing certitude on all sides as to the precise advantages and disadvantages. <Col N="720" /> It does not do any disservice to this Parliament, or to the debate itself which will continue for the next 18 months, to say that many of the advantages and disadvantages are not precisely ascertainable at this point. Therefore, we should approach entry of our country to the Community on that basis, not because of lack of knowledge in regard to many aspects of our application but largely because the facts relating to the negotiations have not been disclosed.</P>
    <P>However, we know a number of facts about our application.  We know that in this country there are a number of key factors which must be taken into account in relation to our application. The first point is the relatively small size of the home market.  I do not want to stress that fact unduly but it is a major factor in regard to our application. The second point, which is of major importance, is in regard to the population structure of this country, a matter which many Deputies have not referred to in the debate.  The pattern of emigration allied to the high proportion of our nation who are in the dependent age group are unique features.  Because of the ratio of dependency within the population, this will require a careful approach in relation to social welfare and social security aspects and this factor has not been adverted to in the Government's initial statement to this House.</P>
    <P>It is important to point out that, while many European countries and other countries throughout the world have a uniform system of tariff protection, we have evolved here a rather random protectionist policy.  We have adopted a policy of allowing elements of risk into the protective policies of some industries, of cushioning other industries against the effects of poor-risk decisions and, as a result, we have had a rather unbalanced industrial and economic development.</P>
    <P>Equally, it is important to point out in the economic sphere that, as against virtually any other European country, there is a vulnerability in relation to trade in this country because of the exceptionally high ratio of physical imports and exports relative to our GNP. <Col N="721" /> As we know, 65 per cent of our GNP is involved in the import/export sphere and if we ally to that the close relationship of our trade with that of Britain we begin to accept that the openness of the Irish economy creates a situation of extreme vulnerability in relation to our application to join the EEC.  It is not an admission of impotence nor is it a product of inferiority, as Deputy FitzGerald at times seems to infer.  If one states a hard, cold fact one often gets the reaction from Deputy FitzGerald that one is being unduly pessimistic and negative and has an inferiority complex.  I do not see any reason for such a bizarre attitude.</P>
    <P>Another factor of major difficulty regarding entry is that our educational examination system has involved during the decade an extreme form of cultural standardisation.  There has been this tremendous emphasis in the Irish educational system, which is far removed from what is happening in Europe, on scholarship attainment rather than on the development and the use of individual talents.  Had those talents been developed we would be in a far better position to join the Common Market.</P>
    <P>Another disturbing feature in our economic infrastructure is the low level of research and development in Irish companies.  There has been very little investment in research and industrial development and, as a result, there are many inbuilt inhibitions in the Irish economy towards the growth of a more dynamic, technological policy. While I accept with our small economy that it would be difficult to develop a more dynamic policy in relation to research and industrial development, nevertheless the need for such a policy has been glaringly evident.  It is only recently that the work of the Institute of Industrial Research and Standards is tending to develop its activities.  In respect of the meat processing industry in this country, in relation to the light engineering industry, the food processing industry and industries connected with chemicals and fertilisers, much more work could have been done on research and development. This we failed to do and this creates <Col N="722" /> another sector of vulnerability in relation to the EEC.</P>
    <P>There is the other fact&mdash;a very obvious one which does not require to be stressed by me&mdash;that many Irish companies are extremely small.  Their borrowing capacity, their level of marketing skill, the extent to which they have funds available for investment, the general lack of finance&mdash;all these have acted as a tremendous brake on economic development here. These facts are well known.  A chief negotiator who, as Deputy Dr. Hillery did&mdash;I am not quite sure what he regards as his function at the moment&mdash;behaves smugly and complacently about these facts, is abdicating his responsibility.  The Minister for External Affairs went to Luxembourg on 30th June with, I am sure, a rather nervous smile, but he was almost effusive in his anxiety to state the case for Irish entry.  He said, and I quote from the official communiqué issued to Deputies:</P>
    <P>I now re-affirm on behalf of the Irish Government our full acceptance of the Treaties of Rome and Paris, their political, social and economic objectives and the decisions taken to implement them.</P>
    <P>One can honestly describe that negotiating tactic adopted by our chief negotiator as total abdication. Indeed, I do not think the Minister for External Affairs deserves the title of negotiator.  I have learned from trade union experience that one does not put all one's cards on the table in the first ten minutes and I think we can only assume charitably&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>As far as I am concerned, I believe the words and actions of the Minister for External Affairs in Brussels should be debated here.  We are the Irish people.  The Government appointed him our chief negotiator. We are entitled to analyse, without reproof from any Member of the Government, the statements made by the Minister for External Affairs.  Out of charity for the Minister for External Affairs, I draw a very simple comparison. I quote from a statement made by the former Taoiseach, Mr. Seán Lemass, in January, 1963, in the <i>Times Supplement:</i></P>
      <P>Such terms as we have found it necessary to propose to the Community relate to the process of free trade and do not conflict with the basic principles of the Common Market.  The most important concession sought by the Irish Government relates to the rhythm of reductions to be applied to industrial tariffs... Because of the limited home market Irish industry is particularly vulnerable to dumping and we have found it necessary also to seek some arrangements which would enable us to take effective counter measures against dumping or the threat of dumping.</P>
      <P>That is the proper comment of a negotiator who knows what he is talking about.  It is a different attitude from the attitude adopted by the Minister for External Affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, the attitude of the British negotiator, Mr. Anthony Barber, was very different from that of our Minister for External Affairs.  He pressed quite strongly for a long transitional period and he made several reservations with regard to the common farm policy.  He was opposed to many of the interests both long-term and short-term of the French spokesman President Pompidou and lost very little time in stating, quite plainly, that as far as he was concerned, the French statement was by and large just not on.  There was no reservation on the part of our chief negotiator.  I was reminded of the British Labour Party annual conference in 1968-69.  I remember a very clear statement from Mr. Harold Wilson <Col N="724" /> about British conditions and British safeguards in the Common Market.  The conditions were five in number.  They are of major importance to us:</P>
    <P>firstly, strong and binding safeguards for the trade and other interests of our friends and partners in the Commonwealth; secondly, freedom, as at present, to pursue our own foreign policy; thirdly, freedom for fulfilment of the Government's pledge towards associates in the European free trade area; fourthly, the right to plan our own economy; fifthly, guarantees to safeguard the position of British agriculture.</P>
    <P>These conditions were reiterated on 30th March, 1970, when Mr. Wilson addressed a conference of the British Labour Party.  There were explicit reservations.  There should be a similar approach on our part if the intention is to get involved with Europe.  Instead of that, we had an almost parochial approach.  Deputy Timmins at column 85 of the Official Report of 30th June said:</P>
    <P>It is the greatest European movement since the Roman Empire or it is nothing.  We are now asking to play our part in that movement.</P>
    <P>Comment is unnecessary.  Deputy Tunney stated quite clearly that he saw in the EEC an opportunity never offered before for the advancement of the Irish language.  Therefore, he is going into the Common Market although he is quite well aware that there is very little foundation and very little support for the idea that the cause of our language would be helped simply because it was taken out of the context of a British islands environment and put into a European environment.  That, therefore, is the summing-up of the Fianna Fáil Party's approach to date in relation to this debate.</P>
    <P>I shall conclude with aspects of the Government's approach.  I think worth placing very briefly on the record some of the amazing nonsense of Deputy Childers, the Tánaiste.  Listen to this:</P>
    <P>I was thinking about the monks who sat in the court of Charlemagne, <Col N="725" /> which was, perhaps, the first international European society.</P>
    <P>That certainly takes a bit of pondering upon in relation to the Common Market.  He continued:</P>
    <P>I was also thinking of our missionary work in Europe and our Christianising of a great part of Germany and the journeys of St. Columbanus through Germany, France and down to Bobbio in Italy.</P>
    <P>Fair enough.  All I can say is &ldquo;poor Saint Columbus&rdquo; so far as the effect he had on the Germans and the Italians is concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not &ldquo;Columbus&rdquo;: it is Saint Columbanus.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The effect has not proved to be particularly edifying in relation to the amazing political developments of the 1900s in Germany and in Italy.  Just imagine that Deputy Childers is in a ferocious rush to get back into that kind of situation.  I certainly do not see Deputy Childers or Deputy Dr. Hillery or the Taoiseach donning the garb of the European monks and once again chasing off down to Bobbio in Italy or to the court of Charlemagne.  Notwithstanding the great missionary period of Irish Christianity and its contribution to Europe, it is rather inappropriate and out of context that we have to go back that far for justification for our entry into the Common Market. The 5,000 bureaucrats in Brussels might be described as one of the most aspiritual, amoral groups one could meet.  I say that advisedly.  I do not see any particular Cross displayed within the precincts of the magnificient 5,000-personnel building which is equivalent to a major Liberty Hall.  I do not see any great delving back into the contribution of a young Irish monk called Virgilius at the court of Charlemagne who said that the earth was round and that it went round the sun long before that became a matter of controversy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fair enough.  I do not dispute any of the historical facts given to us by Deputy Childers but I certainly dispute their relevance to the negotiations <Col N="726" /> facing the Irish nation in regard to entry to the Common Market.  I equally feel that Deputy Childer's sense of being European is slightly out of plumb when he says that our connection with those nations of the EEC who speak the Latin tongue will be magnificent for the Irish personality. Consider that statement in the context of the slightly perverse sense of humour of &ldquo;Backbencher&rdquo; in the <i>Irish Times</i> when he is at his most perspicacious.  Certainly, the relevance of that contribution is rather remote. This contribution from that speech is amazing:</P>
    <P>...we shall have to learn to understand the personality of the French and Italian peoples, to learn their weaknesses and their strength, will be of immense value in strengthening that part of the Irish personality that has not been overlaid with the English influence.</P>
    <P>Then he said:</P>
    <P>There is some Celtic quality in our people that will help us to understand and respond to the people on the Continent.</P>
    <P>I do not know what particular pedigree my family has but certainly the Desmonds of Munster, I still think, would not possess such intellectual arrogance as to presume to have that particular empathy with the people of continental Europe.  I cannot resist the temptation to give a final quotation from Deputy Childers's peech:</P>
    <P>If one reads the description by Caesar of the character of the Gauls one can read there some of the characteristics&mdash;the most magnificent and also the most dangerous&mdash; of the Irish personality.</P>
    <P>That takes some beating in terms of contribution to the cultural, evolutionary, demographic aspects of the Irish personality in the EEC.  My regard for Deputy Childers is very high.  He is the finest Minister for Health we have had for decades with due regard to Deputy Dr. Browne.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Present company excepted in many respects.  I consider Deputy Childers a magnificent Minister for Health.  In relation to his attitudes towards the EEC and his contribution to this debate, I think he suffered some rather peculiar cultural aberrations which are beyond my comprehension.</P>
      <P>I want to deal with the constitutional aspects which are of major importance. In such an historic debate as this, which is likely to affect the future of the Irish nation, I very strongly feel that the Taoiseach was guilty of the sin of omission in not informing the Irish people of the full constitutional implications of entry into the EEC. There is very little indication in the Taoiseach's speech of the precise terms of the constitutional amendments which we are facing in relation to Common Market negotiations.  They have been glossed over in quite a disgraceful manner.  All we had from the Taoiseach was that, on the question of the constitutional and legal implications, the Government accepted the view of the Attorney General's committee that an amendment of the Constitution would be necessary to enable this State to undertake the obligations which membership would entail.  He said that, in the final analysis, the Irish people would decide on the question by referendum. Also, rather amazingly, he states on a one-sentence basis that membership of the Community would involve a limited transfer of sovereignty.  The ears of the President of this country must have become rather red on reading that particular sentence of the Dáil debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If anybody comes before this House and suggests an amendment of the Constitution of this State such person has at least to have the clarity and purpose to state what the precise amendment will be.  Will we be faced with a global Bill under which the Constitution will be amended to the extent that all other amendments of the Constitution will <Col N="728" /> be subject to the overriding provisions of the Common Market Treaty?  If that is the position, at least we would know but there is no indication in the Constitution.</P>
    <P>I would remind the Taoiseach that there are declarations in our Constitution that Ireland is a sovereign, independent, democratic State.  It provides that the legislative, executive and judicial powers of the Government &ldquo;are exercisable only by or on the authority of the organs of the State established by this Constitution&rdquo;.  I would further remind the Taoiseach that article 15 (2) vests in this Oireachtas the sole and exclusive authority of the organs of the State and provides that no other legislative authority has power to make laws for the State.  This would appear to be incompatible with the Treaty.</P>
    <P>The Government's White Paper, which was laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas in April, 1970, is inexplicit, incomplete and most unsatisfactory in terms of the precise areas of our Constitution which are to be amended because all it says is that among the provisions of the Constitution which have to be considered in this regard are article 5, article 6 (2) and article 15 (2).  There is no reference, for example, to the rights of the people as contained in article 6 (2). Therefore, I feel that in relation to the amendment of the Constitution there is a very substantial need for the Taoiseach to be much more explicit in a statement on the referendum to be placed before the Irish people.  I am willing to be quite charitable and suspend judgment on the attitude I would adopt to the amendments of the Constitution pending the receipt of that information from the Taoiseach when he is replying to this debate.</P>
    <P>That is one aspect we have to consider. Another aspect which I feel should be considered by this House is the internal institutional framework of the Community.  I do not think I could quote anything better to the House than the Common Market bulletin, the monthly review of European integration and economic development.  In the August/September, 1969, issue, <Col N="729" /> volume 9, Richard Maine was very explicit about the many deficiencies within the institutional framework of the Common Market.  As it is a Common Market publication, I do not think I am being unduly unfair in quoting from it.</P>
    <P>Collectively the Community's existing institutions suffer from a number of weaknesses, some of them serious and most of them remedial. The one which is probably not remedial at least at present is less serious than it seems.  This is the lack of central machinery for the enforcement of Community decisions.</P>
    <P>A second collective weakness is the ambiguity of the Community's representation <i>vis-á-vis</i> non-member countries.  Is it one entity or is it six?  In the GATT, for example, for tariff purposes, it is one entity.  For other purposes and in other international organisations its member States are separately represented.</P>
    <P>The third weakness, despite the institutional merger of the European Coal and Steel Community, the Common Market and Euratom, the three Community treaties remain anonymously separate and the institutions themselves remain scattered in Brussels, in Luxembourg and in Strasbourg.  None of these collective weaknesses, however, is as grave as the two remaining problems: the Community's lack of its own budgetary resources which condemns it to living on national handouts, sometimes grudgingly given and sometimes withheld, and the disproportion between the size of its member states and their relative representation within the system.</P>
    <P>I would urge anyone who regards this institutional framework of the Common Market as being a complete, fused, irrevocable and absolute entity of a defined nature should take a strong, cold, cool look at the institutions of the Common Market and he will find that, in many respects, they are as yet in a very undeveloped state after being many years in existence.</P>
    <P>I would submit that in the course of <Col N="730" /> his contribution to this debate Deputy FitzGerald went a little bit berserk, if I may use an extreme term.  With the reservations one must have, particularly about the European Parliament, the very undemocratic and ineffectual nature of the European Parliament and, taking into account the oligarchical tendencies and the authoritarian tendencies one might even say internally in the European Commission, particularly in the regulatory sense and the decisions handed down, I fail to see how he could arrive at the extreme assumption that what the EEC gives us, as he said as reported at column 1935 of the Official Report of 25th June, 1970, is a massive extension of our sovereignty.</P>
    <P>On the one hand, the Taoiseach said constitutional amendments will be necessary because we must have a limitation of our sovereignty and, on the other hand, Deputy FitzGerald goes overboard and talks about a massive extension of our sovereignty.  He also said, in an overstatement as far as I am concerned:</P>
    <P>It gives us the power to prevent any further exploitation of our people by a former colonial power, using economic policies to pursue aims detrimental to the interests of this country.  It gives us a right to a voice in decisions about the future, a voice five times larger than that warranted by our population, for we will have one Minister in ten exercising a voting strength representing 5 per cent of the voting strength in the Council of Ministers for a country that has barely 1 per cent of the population of the Community.  We will have one Commissioner in 14, one-seventh of the voting strength for 1 per cent of the population of the Community.  We will have 30 parliamentarians out of 624, again 5 per cent&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>That is the icing on the cake offered to us, but Deputy FitzGerald has not examined the ingredients of the cake. I am not terribly interested in 30 Irish Parliamentarians&mdash;for the sake of argument three or four from the Labour Party, four or five from Fine Gael and the rest from the Government&mdash;going <Col N="731" /> cantering off to the European Parliament in Brussels.  I am much more interested in finding out what precise powers that Parliament has.  At this point in time it is generally accepted that it has no powers.  All it can do is tell the Commission that they are acting in a rather naughty manner in respect of regulations.  It has no power whatever to dismiss the Commission. Deputy FitzGerald reaches a rather amazing conclusion when he says:</P>
    <P>Personally, I regard it as so generous from the point of view of the institutions that I believe we should sign quickly, before they have second thoughts about it!</P>
    <P>I confess to being an admirer in many respects of Deputy FitzGerald's approach to economic, political and social matters.  I find myself very much in tune with a great deal of what he says.  I think this is rather history catching up with his own emotions in relation to the Common Market.  He has gone overboard on the institutional set-up of the Common Market.  As I have said in this House before, my father was a founder member of Fianna Fáil, although he left it in 1937 because the Fianna Fáil Party sold out on the economic and social policies at that time.  He joined the Labour Party.  I always tried to follow his advice and he often said to me down through the years: &ldquo;Always believe in your own principles but don't swallow your own propaganda in doing so.&rdquo;  This is what Deputy FitzGerald is doing in many respects in his approach to the Common Market.</P>
    <P>At least he admitted rather grudgingly and with his tongue in his cheek in column 1966 of the same volume:</P>
    <P>These institutions are not adequately democratic.  There is a Parliament whose only power is to dismiss the entire Commission, a power so great that it has never been exercised and, perhaps, never will be.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the kind of general approach that I find rather amazing in terms of the general deficiencies <Col N="732" /> of the EEC.  There is one significant element missing in the structure of the Common Market and I would strongly urge the Irish negotiator, the Minister for External Affairs, to point out to the technocrats in Brussels during these negotiations that there is great need for greater democracy and greater parliamentary control, for the introduction of the missing element in the whole structure of the EEC because at this point of time, by and large, it is not very democratic.</P>
      <P>The Community Parliament of 142 members in the EEC is almost purely advisory.  I would underline that.  In absurd theory it can sack the Commission and the whole edifice of the Common Market would collapse and its thousands of civil servants would qualify for international redundancy pay.  I think that it is not practically possible and, certainly, in the Treaty of Rome it is not taken very seriously. The members are elected by national majorities.  In the 1969 agreement in relation to the Parliament it is envisaged that the Parliament would have the last word but I would stress that the Governments generally have shown almost no enthusiasm for the idea that the European Parliament should in many respects be the deciding arena for the budget of the Common Market itself.  The basic parliamentary institutions and framework of the Common Market are in many respects quite unbalanced and, if you like, distorted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In <i>The Economist</i> which had a very fine series of articles, it is pointed out in the issue of May 16th, 1970 that the constitution of the Common Market rests on a tripod which itself rests on thin air.  There is a Commission of European civil servants to propose measures and a Council of Ministers to dispose of them and there is a European Parliament to discuss things <i>in vacuo.</i>  In so far as they have power anywhere in the Common Market it straddles between the Commission and the Council of Ministers rather more usually resting upon the latter.  The Commission is not responsible to anybody but itself.  I do not think I am being unduly discursive in referring to one of the most critical comments <Col N="733" /> made, that of Anthony Sampson, in relation to the position of the Strasbourg minutes.  He says that in theory they can sack the Commission by a two-thirds majority but since they cannot appoint a new Commission this power is meaningless.  They cannot confront the Government of any Common Market country because they do not have a Government.  Their real opponents are the Council of Ministers and the Council of Ministers is the body to which the Commission ultimately makes its proposals.  The Council of Ministers are responsible not to the European Parliament but to their own national Parliaments.  The Parliament is constantly confronted by people responsible to somebody else.</P>
    <P>I think this is a fair analysis of the European Parliament.  I think everybody who has been to Strasbourg&mdash; and many Labour Deputies have been there&mdash;will agree that there is a frantic effort to put Deputies on some kind of party basis instead of on the basis of their countries, an effort to try to transform the Parliament, one might say, into a conservative party and a socialist democratic party.  I think the set-up within the EEC in relation to the European Parliament is a bit fanciful and if you carry it to its logical conclusion you will end up with a President of Europe.  I do not suggest that the Taoiseach would be a candidate in a European Presidential election.  His future may be decided on a more parochial level in another Presidential campaign but we might find ourselves in the position of supporting Mr. Ted Heath for election as President of Europe.  That would be a rather excruciating exercise, perhaps, with the Opposition demanding implementation of PR and others demanding the straight vote system.</P>
    <P>While I appear to be cynical and sceptical it is because I do not see the evolution of a European Parliament of the kind envisaged in the Treaty of Rome.  I think the politicians of the early fifties indulged in a little Parliamentary drafting of a fanciful nature and put forward some fanciful approaches.  While I was not sorry to see the end of the introverted patriotism of General De Gaulle in relation to the Common Market I subscribe to <Col N="734" /> one of his more famous attacks on the structure of the Common Market when he described the European Commission as being nothing more than an embryonic technocracy, for the most part foreign.  While I have no particular antipathy to foreigners as such I think this description was otherwise quite appropriate.</P>
    <P>I have dealt with the Parliament and the Community and I am not terribly hopeful about the reform thereof unless Deputy FitzGerald, who has been in Brussels for the past week, manages to convince them of the need for it.  I do not think even his persuasive powers will extend that far.  I think it is necessary now to examine the role of the Commission itself.  I believe this represents the greatest difficulty for the Irish people.  Too many people in my opinion have concentrated excessively on the constitutional aspects of the Treaty without dealing with the situation as it now exists in the Common Market and the statutory, mandatory and regulatory powers of the Commission itself.  This is where we must be very careful.  Thousands of directions and regulations have emanated from the Commission and many of them are now sacrosanct and would not be changed even for Britain or Ireland or any of the applicant countries.  It is true that the very nature of the Commission itself is quite undemocratic.  I say this advisedly because in these days we are all talking of political rights, justice, democracy and so on.</P>
    <P>I think it is quite fair to suggest that the Commission has a number of vices. It has the inbuilt stultifying effect of 5,000 civil servants, not necessarily a body of fresh European pioneers.  Many of them have been in the ranks of the Commission for well over a decade.  I heard one of them recently in Dublin speaking about Irish agriculture and his adamant and inflexible views sent a shiver down my spine.  I felt that no Dáil Éireann would change his mind in relation to the changes he envisaged in the grand review of the economic structure of Europe.  We must point out to the other European negotiators that as far as we are concerned the Commission was not democratically <Col N="735" /> elected and that we shall view it with reservations when it comes to final acceptance.  Time does not permit me to develop my comments any further in relation to the institutional aspects of the Common Market.</P>
    <P>Another aspect with which I should like to deal is foreign policy.  I do not propose to deal with this at length because it has been covered admirably by Dr. Cruise-O'Brien.  However, it is necessary to point out to Deputy Dr. FitzGerald some of the inconsistencies of his reaction or over-reaction in relation to Ireland's foreign policy within the Common Market.  At column 1933, volume 247, of the Official Report of 25th June, 1970, Deputy Dr. FitzGerald said:</P>
    <P>It should be made clear to everybody&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>I love that utter confidence of Deputy FitzGerald, the total act of faith.  I wish I had such total fervour, but then I suppose there are none so fanatical as those who are newly converted, and he is a convert since the middle 1950s. Let me continue the quotation:</P>
    <P>&mdash;the Government have done this in a shaky sort of way&mdash;that if we go into the Community, we are accepting an obligation to move towards a common foreign policy, and it must be clear that that is a moral obligation that would be imposed on us.</P>
    <P>Then he says at column 1947:</P>
    <P>The Treaty of Rome concerns itself with very important areas, certainly, of economic and social life.  It does not concern itself with foreign policy, with political union, with cultural affairs.  All these aspects are left over.  They are matters to be settled by other means.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask Deputy FitzGerald what does he mean.  On the one hand, at column 1933 he says we shall have foreign policy of a completely undefined nature imposed on us, and on the other hand, at column 1947 he says the Treaty of Rome does not concern itself with foreign policy.  There is an inherent contradiction there.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="736" /> There is also an appalling double shuffling going on within the Government in relation to our policy of neutrality, and this approach is disturbing many of our people.  There is a peculiar kind of perversion of the concept of neutrality on the part of the Government. Down through the years, even as an adolescent interested in politics, I admired the attitude on neutrality of the then Taoiseach, Mr. Éamon de Valera.  His policy did not in any way imply that the Irish nation was wholly uncommitted in the event of a conflict breaking out in any part of the world, east or west, any more than it implied we were totally committed to neutrality. It was a very admirable determination to ensure that through this Parliament the Irish people would avoid involvement in the conflicts or confrontations between nations in Europe or in any other part of the world.  Swedish neutrality and Irish neutrality are in many respects quite similar because they are not based on any treaty obligations like that of the Austrians or like that of the Finnish Government who are bound by a neutrality treaty with the USSR.</P>
    <P>I find it very disturbing and I regard it as an abdication of Irish independence that the Minister for External Affairs, Deputy Dr. Hillery, should so blandly state that Irish neutrality is an <i>ad hoc</i> affair.  Whether it is <i>ad hoc</i> or not, it is now part of the political tradition of the Irish people, one which came under the most extreme pressure up to the commencement and during the second world war, when to his everlasting credit and with the respect of the Irish people, the then Taoiseach and Leader of the Fianna Fáil Party stood out against all those pressures which were much greater in their intensity than any pressure from the Common Market or any outmoded NATO pressure group would be.  With the support of the then political Leaders of the Opposition he established that fundamental principle of Irish neutrality. That policy has stood the test of time and should remain our strategy <i>vis-à-vis</i> a united nations of Europe. <i>vis-á-vis</i> the east or the west and particularly in the context of our influence in the United Nations.  Our policy can contribute towards stabilisation which <Col N="737" /> is very necessary in Europe and in the United Nations today.</P>
    <P>Therefore we in the Labour Party have devolving on us in this House the prime responsibility of ensuring that that policy of neutrality will be preserved and will once again command the respect of other countries and create confidence among our own people and among the other nations as well.  I bitterly resent the snide allegations of many Members of the Fianna Fáil Party, some of whom have made very little contribution to the debate, that a policy of neutrality implies a policy of isolation or a policy of non-commitment in relation to any conflict which might break out in the world.  As far as I am concerned it implies a challenge, an opportunity that in the event of international tension at least we can work on an open basis towards bringing about a solution.  There are possibilities, on a wider international level, over and above our entry to the Common Market, which are very great indeed.</P>
    <P>I accept that we are not by any means a great power and that we are not in a position decisively to influence the fate of the world at any given time.  I also accept that any contribution we can make unilaterally or bilaterally within the United Nations, of a military or a peace-keeping nature, must of necessity be modest and limited.  Ireland having accepted the position that we will work within the framework of the United Nations, then in relation to disarmament, the proliferation of arms in any part of the world, or in this country, in relation to human environmental problems and more particularly in relation to peace-keeping operations, these are all problems of assisting the developing nations on an international basis.  I would go so far as to say that it is a question of assisting the liberation of suppressed people in many parts of the world.  Ireland may yet be called through the United Nations to make a contribution in this direction.  These are problems in regard to which we can exert very considerable influence and adopt a consistent line of peaceful action.  If we are to participate in the creation of international public <Col N="738" /> opinion, and to elevate our people from mundane political routine then a policy of normal neutrality is a policy of profound importance.</P>
    <P>If Ireland enters the Common Market and if we become deeply involved in the machinations of NATO &mdash;which I regard in many respects as being militarily obsolete&mdash;then in our relations with the many millions of people in the African states our prospects of exerting influence will be considerably mitigated.</P>
    <P>I do not share the kind of apologia offered by Deputy FitzGerald when he made this kind of blanket proposal in relation to Irish relations or EEC relations with countries in eastern Europe.  He said that it is made clear that the political objective of the community should be the creation of a democratic united states of Europe embracing all of Europe, including eastern Europe, and that this enlarged community should remain open to any other European country sharing its objectives.  I think Deputy FitzGerald is alone in the Fine Gael Party in that view.  Although, perhaps, Deputy Fitzpatrick now in the front bench, would probably share his views, certainly Deputy Cosgrave would not. Deputy Cosgrave has no conception of an enlarged EEC or an enlarged Europe as Deputy FitzGerald stated, including eastern Europe and that this enlarged community should remain open to any other European country sharing its objectives.  Certainly that is not in the mind of the Government or in the minds of the majority of the Fine Gael Deputies nor is it in the minds of the politicians within the EEC.  It is important to put this on record because otherwise we in the Labour Party feel that it would be ignored by the Minister for External Affairs when he returns to Brussels at a later date.</P>
    <P>I was concerned to note a comment made by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education, Deputy O'Kennedy, in relation to the very fine contribution made by Deputy Cruise-O'Brien. He made the carping comment that Deputy Cruise-O'Brien had treated the House to a dissertation of lengthy nonsense, a reference to Deputy <Col N="739" /> Cruise-O'Brien's fears regarding our international involvement within the EEC in the context of NATO.  I certainly refute that comment because Deputy Cruise-O'Brien was not present at the time it was made.  I suggest that in the international sense the alternative to the EEC is a Europe which is united and which in many respects is united with the whole world.</P>
    <P>I should like to advise the Chair that the remarks I am now about to make are not intended to be unduly partisan.  I want to refer to the North of Ireland in relation to the Common Market negotiations.  The Minister for Health, Deputy Childers, stated that Ireland's entry into the Common Market would bring about a fusion of thought between Irishmen in Northern Ireland and Irishmen in the Republic. It is a matter of great concern that in the Taoiseach's opening statement and in the statement made by the Minister for External Affairs in Luxembourg on the 30th June there was no reference to the British application inevitably involving Northern Ireland.  I find the omission quite extraordinary.  There does devolve on the Minister for External Affairs and on Dáil Éireann the duty to be mindful of the position of Northern Ireland in relation to the Common Market particularly because of its constitutional position and its immense economic integration with Britain.  There is a moral and a political obligation on us to bring to the negotiating table a sense of identity of interests, and an appreciation of the difficulties which would undoubtedly arise for many sectors of the Northern Ireland economy, particularly for industry and, for that matter, for farmers, in the event of this island entering the Common Market.  There is a profound obligation devolving on our negotiators to speak for the farmers and workers of Northern Ireland and to protect their interests on entry into the Common Market.  We should keep a watchful eye on the negotiations to ensure that the special problems of that area of our country are not overlooked in the setting up of an enlarged Community. I consider the omission in this regard in the Taoiseach's statement as amazing because it is essential that we <Col N="740" /> should extend that elementary aspect of support to our fellow-Irishmen in the north.</P>
    <P>Irrespective of EEC entry, one would hope to see the removal of all restrictions of trade between Northern Ireland and the Republic.  This is a basic pre-condition to the evolution of a normal political society and I consider it has a direct relevance to Ireland and the EEC.  There has been much nonsense spoken in this House about the unilateral entry of the Irish Republic into the Common Market and the assumption has been that overnight the problem of Partition would be resolved.</P>
    <P>In the matter of removal of restrictions of trade, progress has been disappointingly slow.  While some progress was made in the early sixties to eliminate or reduce protection on certain manufactured industrial products between the north and the south, and there was an interchange of commerce between the two areas, this was not continued throughout the sixties.  It is not without significance that the Irish manufacturers in the Republic who would be profoundly concerned about any loss of protection or any lowering of their economic well-being in relation to entry into the Common Market, would be equally vociferous if we eliminated protection between the north and the south on mutual entry into the Common Market.  The concessions we were willing to give to Europe in 1963 were not willingly extended to our fellow-brethren in the North of Ireland and this is an aspect we should examine closely in the context of ultimate normal relations in this country.</P>
    <P>I would hope to see an end to the lip service we have paid quite frequently in the Republic to the integration of the economies of Northern Ireland and the Republic in relation to the Common Market.  It is not enough to merely talk about this development unless we are prepared to pay the price. We should have regard to the industrial arm of the north and the impact of the Common Market on the linen industry, the massive textiles industries, the engineering industry, the ship-building industry and on the tremendous <Col N="741" /> infrastructure of industry that exists in the North of Ireland.  It is important to bear in mind that Mr. Barber probably could not care less about what will happen to Northern Ireland in the context of Britain representing that part of our island in the EEC negotiations.  So far as I am concerned, the Minister for External Affairs will have my support if, at least during that aspect of our negotiations, he places particular emphasis on this feature.</P>
    <P>In relation to agriculture, our negotiators should bear in mind the relationship that exists between the farming community in the north and in the Republic and the direct repercussions any agricultural decisions will have on the standard of life of the farming community in the north.  In any negotiations for membership, I hope the Republic will not sacrifice Northern Ireland on any altar of pan-Europeanism.  We should bear in mind the difficulties facing farmers in Northern Ireland in relation to the British deficiency payments system and we should ensure that consultations take place if only through the NFA and the Ulster Farmers' Union.</P>
    <P>In his contribution yesterday, Deputy Keating dwelt at length on one point but, perhaps due to the whirl of events, the daily newspapers were unable to take the full statement.  I suggest to this House that in relation to Ireland's membership of the United Nations and the constant reference to that organisation when it suited us, we should not be unduly introverted in relation to our EEC application.  It is of importance to point out that the future of world trade and the profound impact there will be on EEC trade depends not so much on whether there is an enlarged Community but on the pressing problems of Asia, Africa, Latin America, or the pressing problems of Italy, particularly Sicily and Southern Italy, of Spain, Portugal and Greece.</P>
    <P>It is important to bear in mind that a 5 per cent reduction of tariffs throughout the world would achieve far more for the benefit of mankind. <Col N="742" /> It would bring a far greater improvement in international trade than all the tariffs within the Six, or EFTA, or the enlarged Community.  We should place our political horizon in its proper setting and we should be very careful from the point of view of the reactions of other countries.  I will quote the reaction of a senior Indian diplomat who has not changed his views down through the years.  His reaction is the classical reaction of undeveloped countries.</P>
    <P>It seems likely that any western European grouping of powers on the basis of a closed community will produce similar groupings in other parts of the world.  Already there is such a grouping on the military plane.  That may or may not be justified, but such an extension of the closed shop in the political and economic fields is neither necessary nor is it good in the long-term for the world especially when it is based on the comparative wealth and colonial background of countries like the members of the EEC.  They have made no secret of their desire to keep the fundamental character of the Community western European. The only outsiders likely to be associated with it are their former colonies and even these are confined to the economically undeveloped continent of Africa and the West Indies.  Asia has not even been admitted as an associate lest &ldquo;hordes&rdquo; might swamp this exclusive club. The situation, therefore, would appear equally uncompromising to the newly emerging nations of Africa.  Even if some of these countries get associate status and thus enjoy some access to the European Common Market they will have to face difficulties in developing local industries in face of competition from the highly developed countries of the EEC itself.</P>
    <P>This brings me to the nonsense talked by the Minister for External Affairs about EEC aid to the African nations.  I questioned him about this on 25th June and he said that, as regards assistance to the less developed countries, the Community's record <Col N="743" /> compares very favourably with that of other industrial countries; the Community has an associate arrangement with 18 African states and a special European Development Fund has been set up to provide finance for measures aimed at promoting the social and economic development of these countries.  I assured him the African states were somewhat unimpressed by this form of aid.</P>
    <P>My reaction is essentially pragmatic because I am conscious of the involvement. Lest the House be under any illusions, let us take the attitude of the EEC towards South Africa.  Trading with Africa, exports in 1969 amounted to £242.4 million and imports to £434 million.  As far as I am concerned, there seems to be a good deal of double thinking, which has made the sanctions policy within the EEC so much rubbish.  It simply does not work. The prospect of short-term gains on the economic front for the EEC has wiped out any ideology or racialist sympathy with the oppressed peoples of South Africa.  I am always amused by the pontifications of alleged statesmen, or churchmen, for that matter, who profess to abhor racialism and who, by their policies and actions in the international sphere, sustain racist governments in power.</P>
    <P>The alleged aid given to African countries pales into insignificance in the light of the massive capital investment of the Six and of the Ten, particularly Britain.  There is literally utter exploitation of many millions of people in South Africa and in other African states.  We tend to forget the massive volume of investment by Britain in that part of the world.  The principal creditor of South Africa is the United Kingdom.  In 1966 it held almost three-fifths of all foreign investment in South Africa.  The United States held 13 per cent of all foreign investment in South Africa.  France has substantial investments there.  So have the Federal Republic of Germany and other European countries.  The value of direct private investment by Britain, excluding oil, insurance and banking, amounts to 1,097 million United States dollars or 9 per cent of total British investment overseas.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="744" /> At the end of 1966 direct investment by the United States in South Africa had a value of 600 million United States dollars, or over 2 per cent of the total foreign investment.  One should be very careful about the reaction of the African states.  I speak of an area of 470,000 square miles with a population of 18.7 million people, 80 per cent of whom are non-white, to use the offensive term, ruled and exploited by 3.6 million people who want to get into the Common Market.  South Africa is to have entry into the Common Market.  That was made clear recently. We should not be under any illusions about the substantial involvement with a racist government.  We should not be under any illusions about the reaction from African states.  There is a real possibility that any residue of sympathy on the part of African states towards Ireland in the United Nations will gradually disappear since they are excluded from entry because of the neo-colonial character of EEC investment in the Common Market itself.</P>
    <P>There is a wealth of literature available to any Member of this House who might care to be concerned about that development.  I am not giving any propagandist approach.  I have quoted from the United Nations' publications on Apartheid&mdash;two particular publications published, by Irish contribution, by the United Nations.  Indeed, the plaintive expression of opinion of U Thant that economic aid given by European countries bolstering up the economies of South Africa and Rhodesia should be withdrawn rings very hollow when these countries have not paid the slightest attention to that approach.</P>
    <P>I wish to turn now to the Social Fund, to redundancy, to food prices and, finally, to agriculture and industry. In relation to the Social Fund, it would be snide of me not to accept that articles 1, 2 and 3 of this Treaty of Rome did contain the germ of social content which would give financial assistance for the promotion, within the Community, of employment facilities and assist the mobility of labour.  I have in mind now the retraining of workers and the wage levels of workers.  We should not have any false hopes in that regard.  The fund can be <Col N="745" /> criticised on a number of fronts.  It may be objected that the definition of &ldquo;employment&rdquo; under the Social Fund is extremely rigid.  I would point this progress and the work done by the out particularly to the EEC negotiators. It might not be possible to ensure that retraining facilities will be effective throughout the enlarged Ten.</P>
    <P>The retraining of workers in our retraining centres and its effect on the economy of a country is extremely complex.  I do not think the fund is in a position to administer effectively retraining facilities of that nature. Equally, when recession occurs or when a closure occurs in a particular industry or when there is massive re-deployment one gets rather scant notice generally and by the time the machinery of the Social Fund would be put into operation on an Irish-EEC integrated basis, even with enlarged notices on re-deployment, I am rather sceptical about immediate response in that regard from the Social Fund for Irish problems that might arise.  Deputy FitzGerald said he was not convinced that the overall cartel and merger policy of the EEC had a sufficient social content.  He said it seemed to be exceptionally industrially oriented: too much towards industrial efficiency; too much towards the growth of large units; not sufficiently taking into account all social factors.</P>
    <P>I strongly urge the team of negotiators we are sending over to Brussels to comb the regulations made to date under the EEC Commission in regard to the Social Fund to ensure that they will evolve more satisfactorily towards Irish industry problems.  I said earlier it was rather difficult to quantify the effects, particularly effects of an industrial nature.  I shall not attempt to do so.  To those who would globally state a figure of, say, 100,000 unemployed, I would reply that one does not precisely know. Global figures are dangerous.  They highlight the necessary safeguards. They certainly highlight the tremendous dangers involved in entry into the EEC.  We have 200,000 workers engaged in industry.  Consider the impact of competition.  If we take a figure in the region of 15,000, then I think one is talking in terms of greater reality in respect of the Common Market so far as the impact of redundancy <Col N="746" /> is concerned.</P>
    <P>I was involved for a number of years in the annual reviews of Irish industrial progress and the work done by the Committee on Industrial Progress.  I was not a member of the committee but, as industrial officer of the ICTU, I was involved in making trade union comments on behalf of the trade unions in response to the draft reports of the CIO and subsequently, each year, in the annual reviews.  I do not accept figures that are thrown around&mdash; 30,000; 40,000; 100,000.  I expect an economic dislocation in the region of 20,000, scaling down to 15,000.  This figure is certainly not outside the realm of informed speculation or informed guess-estimates of the overall impact of immediate freeing of trade.  I would strongly underline the subjectiveness of a figure of that nature.</P>
    <P>In the original comprehensive CIO surveys on Irish industry in the period 1961 to 1964 there was a global figure of around 11,000 on the freeing of trade by 1970.  If one takes the figure of 20,000 on the freeing of trade by, say, 1976, 1978 or 1980, and a figure of 20,000, say, over a transitional perod, such a figure is by no means of such magnitude that it cannot be faced with some sense of reality.  I do not accept Deputy FitzGerald's attempt to play it down.  It is much better that all the Irish people should be fully aware of the implications of that particular involvement.</P>
    <P>In that regard, I come to the social security aspects of the Common Market.  They are not very satisfactory. They are certainly very embryonic.  In many respects they are quite contradictory. Only a few years ago, in late 1967, an economist stated that the social security systems of member countries were as far apart as ever. While there are common trends in the extension of the area of social security, it is hardly possible to accept these developments as the outcome of the evolvement of the Common Market since they would probably have taken place in any event.  I think it is true that within Europe, irrespective of the Common Market, there has developed.</P>
    <P>The other point I want to make in <Col N="747" /> a tremendous harmonisation of social security systems.  I very much doubt if the social security laws and practices of the European States, particularly of the Six, have been harmonised to the extent that the so-called EEC Social Security Fund bureaucrats tend to suggest.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I submit to the House that there is a general uncertainty regarding the impact of the EEC on the development of a social security system on a global basis within the Common Market.  This uncertainty springs from a very serious omission from the Treaty of Rome.  There is nothing of a specific nature in the Treaty of Rome in relation to the introduction of a single system of social security throughout the EEC.  There are general aspirations in Articles 117 and 118, the kind of aspirations with which we are all familiar: talk about conformity and harmonisation of practices relating to employment, labour legislation, working conditions, social security, protection against occupational accidents, industrial hygiene, trade union law, and so on. There are vague general aspirations in Articles 117 and 118.</P>
    <P>I do not think that, by and large, it can be contended that the Economic and Social Committee of the EEC has brought about a great deal of uniformity within the social security systems of different countries.  I want to point out very emphatically to the Government, to Irish employers and to Irish trade unionists, that there are some extremely important differences between the Irish and the British and the EEC social security systems.  As we are quite well aware, the Irish system is operated through the Department of Social Welfare except for medical care, whereas in the Common Market a number of schemes are administered by semi-independent bodies within each country, with the result that centralised Government control over the social security systems in the Common Market is extremely limited.</P>
    <P>That is the first major difference between the two systems.  The second major difference is of profound importance to Irish employers and trade <Col N="748" /> unionists in the context of Irish labour costs and so on.  It is that employers have a far greater role&mdash;I do not like the word &ldquo;role&rdquo;&mdash;a far greater involvement and responsibility in respect of social security than they have in this country.  This is some disturbing news to be given to Irish employers and I propose to spell it out later on.</P>
    <P>In this country there is a single social security stamp in respect of benefits provided through the national social security insurance scheme, but in the EEC different charges are made for different things and they are collected separately and given separately to the various bodies by each employer.  In this country the social insurance contributions by Irish workers are on a flat rate contributory basis.  For example, earning £2,500 a year, I pay 10s 10d a week as a voluntary contribution to widows and orphans and, if you like, that is my State social insurance contribution on that particular matter.  On the Continent on the basis of £2,500 a year, more than likely I would be paying vastly more in a wage related system.</P>
    <P>There is a very urgent need for the Government to bring in a wage system of social security, irrespective of whether we go into the Common Market.  If we do happen to find ourselves in it, it will be as well if we have gone through this exercise.  I consider it to be quite wrong and quite unfair that an Irish industrial worker working, say, in Bolands in Deansgrange or in an industrial estate in Pottery Road in the constituency I represent, earning £18 or £19 a week in Albright and Wilson, should have to pay 12s 10d a week.  The employer pays 15s 6d. Within the next few months we can add another 2s 6d on to that amount of money and the worker will be paying 15s a week out of those earnings.  Another worker with £2 under £1,200 a year pays the same amount on a flat basis.  It is quite unfair to have a flat rate, social insurance contribution system in operation.  It is to the credit of the continental countries that, by and large, they have introduced a wage related system of contribution and benefit.  This is of considerable importance.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="749" /> here and I shall point out some of the relation to the social security system is that, on the Continent, a very substantial proportion of the cost of social security is met by the employers.  This, I am sure, is cheerful news for Irish employers.  As the House is aware, in this country towards the financing of the social security system, the employers pay 16 per cent roughly. The employees pay 15 per cent and the State, from general taxation, pays 68 per cent.  There is roughly 2 per cent coming from other sources.</P>
    <P>In Belgium, the employers pay 48 per cent.  In France, the employers pay 65 per cent.  In Germany, they pay 37 per cent.  In Italy, they pay 63 per cent. In the Netherlands, they pay 39 per cent.  In the United Kingdom, the employers pay 27 per cent of the cost of social security.  In Ireland, the figure is 16 per cent.  I am afraid the Minister will have more than just a harmonisation problem on his hands if he talks about accepting the EEC lock, stock and barrel with no reservations and no question of any realignment of the Irish social security system.</P>
    <P>There is a vast gulf between what we operate here and what is operated on the Continent.  It is about time the Irish Cabinet sat down and, instead of chasing its own ideological and republican hares around the Cabinet table, took a cold look at the kind of problems likely to be facing it.  In this country employees pay 15 per cent towards the cost of social security.  In Belgium they pay 24 per cent.  In Germany they pay 37 per cent.  In the Netherlands they pay 47 per cent.  In Britain they pay 5 per cent more than they pay here, making a total of 20 per cent.</P>
    <P>If we are to have harmonisation between the Common Market countries and if we are to have, as seems to be implied in the Government's approach, continental employers coming to this country&mdash;I very much doubt that they will be coming but, on the assumption that they might be coming, and if they come here on that basis without the Irish Government readjusting the Irish social security system rapidly&mdash;as far as I am concerned there are many sins of omission to be faced on the part of the <Col N="750" /> Government.</P>
    <P>That is one problem.  I do not believe that acceptance of implications and regulations will present us with any utterly insurmountable or insuperable obstacles even though massive changes are necessary and should now be introduced in the social security system apart from the fact that, in my opinion, employers should be paying far more towards occupational health, occupation welfare, industrial hygiene, occupational pensions and general social insurance contributions.  I see no reason why there should be this tremendous disparity between Britain and Ireland and the Continent and, I might add, American employers, who pay far more in their terms of contribution.  I suppose that will not make me very popular with some members of the Federated Union of Employers.  This is an aspect of the matter that urgently needs consideration.</P>
    <P>Another aspect that we should consider is the free movement of workers in the Common Market and the internal involvement of the social security system.  There seems to be some peculiar myth operating in the Fianna Fáil Party that all one does is sign a treaty and from then on things tend to fall into pattern.  I want to point out that the obligations which this country would have to accept on the admission of Common Market concerns here would be very considerable. Migrant workers coming here could not, under any circumstances, generally be dealt with less favourably than Irish nationals in respect of social security and regulations enforced here, irrespective of what member state they came from.</P>
    <P>We should also appreciate that we would be accepting liability in respect of migrant workers or any aliens getting employment here to pay appropriate family allowances and social security benefits for their dependants and themselves similar to what they would get in their home countries. This would extend also to medical and health costs.  Let us have no illusions about that commitment which we would face.  I shall deal later with the number of aliens currently working <Col N="751" /> implications in that regard.</P>
    <P>There is a sharp need for the Minister and the Department of Social Welfare, whoever the Minister may be, to face up to the implications in respect of reciprocal arrangements existing with the EEC and which we would be required to observe.  These reciprocal arrangements would go far beyond the arrangements we have at present with Britain in regard to disability benefit, marriage or maternity benefit, unemployment benefit, contributory widows' and orphans' pensions, old age pensions or workman's compensation.  We have certain reciprocal arrangements with Britain at present but what would be done in respect of Britain would have to apply also with more massive implications in respect of people moving from other countries to this country.</P>
    <P>In fairness, I should point out that Irish nationals would have the benefit of reciprocity in the other countries.  It does not end there.  Under Articles 19 and 23 if a Belgian worker came to Ireland to work and fell ill on a temporary return to Belgium he would receive medical attention in Belgium and the Irish Government would have to meet the cost.  Let us chew on these implications which we shall face.  Under Article 22 and Article 23 if a German pensioner retires to live in Germany, having lived in Ireland, he draws his pension from the Irish Government and he also receives free medical treatment and that medical treatment is paid for by the Irish Government.  If the family of an Italian worker coming to work in Ireland fall ill in Italy they will receive medical treatment there as long as is necessary.  They will pay nothing: the Italian Government will pay 25 per cent of the cost and the Irish Government will pay the other 75 per cent.  These are just a few of the EEC regulations but they are quite substantial and we should be under no illusion as to what is involved administratively in terms of the EEC and of parity of social security.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect which should be brought to the attention of the House and these are the particular <Col N="752" /> obligations of a social security nature devolving on the Minister for Labour. At present our industrial workers here enjoy between 16 and 21 days annual leave and public holidays, a rather sparse concession of leisure in the European context.  I should hope that if the Irish Government are serious about their application they would indicate their views now to Irish workers.  Looking for support in the referendum I could imagine the Minister for Social Welfare using this as a great ploy: vote &ldquo;yes&rdquo; and you will get 21 days holiday, 22 in the Netherlands, 25 in Belgium, 25-28 as they get in Germany or 29 as they get in France or Italy.  As regards annual leave and public holidays Article 120 of the Treaty of Rome says that member states shall endeavour to maintain the existing equivalent of paid holiday schemes in the member states.</P>
    <P>In France, for example, where there is a total of 29 days because there is also a service agreement operating generally on a national basis giving extended holidays in addition to the 25, a full month's holidays is regarded as a normal feature of collective bargaining. If the Government are so adamant about going into the Common Market they should give us the benefits as well as the difficulties.  It is quite dishonest on the part of the Government not to point out to the employers and the nation as a whole the changes in the social structure, relating to the Social Fund and the social situation which will be involved.  The Government are not very explicit on these points in the White Paper itself.</P>
    <P>There is also the matter of children's allowances.  We should be rather careful in our analysis of that situation in relation to the Common Market because I think there is far more opposition to and there are far more reservations in people's minds about children's allowances than they are prepared to admit.  In Britain family allowances is a difficult political topic.  At the moment there are 4.1 million families in Britain who receive family allowances and there are 3.8 million families who do not receive them. Therefore there is an immediate clash in regard to social policy in that country <Col N="753" /> and there is the same clash in this country.  If we are to enjoy the level of family allowances operating in the EEC countries there will have to be a massive payment which I would estimate at between £10 million and £15 million.  We would have to do two things: to bring family allowances, first of all, up to the level in Britain, where we are very far behind, and secondly, up to the level operating in the EEC.</P>
    <P>Take one Common Market country, France, to illustrate the tremendous gulf that exists in this regard.  Let me compare the different rates.  In Britain a family of two children gets 18s; in Ireland 10s per week; in France 29s per week.  In Britain a family of three gets 38s a week; in ireland 20s per week; in France 75s per week.  In Britain a family of four gets 58s; in Ireland 30s; and in France £6.  In Britain a family of five gets 78s; in Ireland £2; and in France £8 3s per week.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil Party are in a frightful dilemma because some Minister will suggest levelling up all the children's allowances if we go into the EEC.  The Government are so desperate at times to take the heat off themselves that they must certainly pass that, and this levelling up would cause a social problem here.  Those who will not qualify in the future for the extra payment which must come about in family allowances will not be remarkably altruistic and they are likely to join the childless families in opposition to the whole idea of a massive upward adjustment of family allowances.  We should not underestimate the effect of that.  If family allowances are increased to the level in France of £8 3 per week for a family of five children, there must be a social reaction even from such a Catholic country as this.  People will allege that allowances are a kind of reward for excessive breeding of families rather than, as it should be, a recognition of the responsibilities undertaken in parenthood.  There will be a great deal of controversy in the event of a massive levelling up of children's allowances.</P>
    <P>I want to stress another aspect of the Common Market which is of concern to Irish workers.  It is a very <Col N="754" /> proud fact of life here that there is a tremendous disparity between the trade union organisations of this island and in Britain and those on the Continent. I do not accept for one moment that we have anything to learn from the Continent about the organisation of workers in trade unions.  The reverse is the case.  I remember, as educational officer of the Irish Congress of Trade Unons, spending a fortnight in Brussels and then spending three weeks in Paris as part of the training which I was given under the old OECD.  I was appalled at the sectarianism of the Catholic Federation of Belgium, the Protestant Federation of Belgium, the Social Federation of Belgium; then there was the Communist Federation, to crown it all&mdash;a splintered trade union movement.  Take one look at France.  Take one look at Italy.  Take one look at the industrial protest parades which take place in France where you have national massive one-day political strikes.  Those in Fianna Fáil who are deeply preoccupied at the moment with introducing trade union legislation in this country would want to take a look at what happens in the industrial cities of Northern Italy when the industrial workers get the bit between their teeth and decide to react sharply towards employers.  That is the kind of Community we are going into. It has a lot of warts as well as a lot of alleged advantages.</P>
    <P>It is a matter of profound regret that of the 60 million or 70 million workers in the Common Market, outside of agriculture, there are only about 12 million of them organised in the trade union movement.  While admittedly in Germany there is a strong trade union sector, the DGB which organises 30 per cent of all industrial and commercial workers, a powerful trade union organisation, there are hundreds of thousand of workers in the Common Market, in the transport sector, in the retail and wholesale distributive sector, in the vast range of small industries, in the agricultural sector, who are not organised in any trade union.  It is nonsense for Deputy FitzGerald to say here that the trade unions in the Common Market exert a dramatic and dynamic influence over the proceedings <Col N="755" /> of the EEC.  That is not my experience. In many of those countries trade union organisations are divided into three or four different federations.  Certainly they are not organised on the basis which we would like to see in this country.</P>
    <P>I should like to say that we will have a rather peculiar and anomalous situation. At the moment in Cork the Irish Trade Union Congress is meeting.  It represent 500,000 industrial workers in this island and you would have negotiations going on in which the Irish Government would represent some of them and the British Government would represent more of them.  As far as I am concerned, one of the most tremendous bulwarks we have in these islands and which is not evident on the Continent is this body of organised workers of 240,000 in the Republic and 180,000 in the North of Ireland, composed of Protestants and Catholics of different political views, all united in the trade union movement.</P>
    <P>I only wish that other sections in industry, in trade and in social life and so on would have this elementary common loyalty on an occupational, social or political basis.  This is one of the more hopeful and more beneficial aspects in relation to Ireland and the EEC.</P>
    <P>I should like to point out that Article 48 and 51 of the Treaty of Rome envisage the development of a community wide labour market.  It is important that we should appreciate what precisely is involved in the abolition of any discrimination based on nationality between workers of member states as far as employment is concerned. We should be aware that under the Treaty of Rome&mdash;I am not suggesting that we should accept it&mdash;subject to certain limitations workers will be free to accept offers of employment and they will be free to remain in a member country to engage in that employment. There is here a clear cut involvement of the movement of workers in and out of this country within the Common Market.  The word &ldquo;worker&rdquo; should be interpreted very broadly because according to the Common Market regulations it includes everybody who is the <Col N="756" /> subject of a contract of employment. It does not matter whether the worker is an Italian or a psychiatric doctor or a trade union official from the Continent, or any other form of worker, there is that right to work in this country if we enter the Common Market. The actual working of the treaty is confined to the freedon of the worker to accept an offer of employment which is actually made.  No Italian, French or German worker can come here merely in the hope of obtaining work, as some people seem to think.  An offer of employment has to be made to him and the provisions state that very clearly.</P>
    <P>It is important to point out the implications of this because a number of illusions exist in regard to it.  We should not, however, overstress the problem.  It is an inescapable fact of life that the major difficulties which restrict the international movement of workers are related to problems of language, of customs or of customs duty and of administrative and occupation procedures as between one country and another.  Therefore these difficulties exist as between Ireland and the EEC already, irrespective of whether or not we enter the Common Market.  It is important that we should appreciate that with the current employment situation here it is not likely that Irish employers will be offering very many employment opportunities to foreign workers provided the trade union movement are in a position to ensure that foreign workers coming in would not be exploited.</P>
    <P>As industrial officer of Congress I have seen this exploitation in the hair-dressing trade, in the hotels and rstaurants trade and in the tourist trade.  I have seen Italian workers being exploited and I have seen other European workers being exploited, but generally speaking it is not likely that there would be a massive influx of foreign workers in the event of our entering the EEC.  I would also point out that the position is not perhaps as certain as I have stated because at present employment permits are normally granted for a maximum period of 12 months and their renewal depends on the availability of nationals at the time the renewal application is made.  It is <Col N="757" /> quite obvious that these aliens regulations, which operate jointly between the Department of Justice and the Department of Labour, in consultation with the trade union movement, will have to be relaxed substantially if we enter the Common Market and this could give rise to substantial fears among Irish workers that there would be a very large number of foreign workers taking up employment.  It is an aspect to which we should pay particular attention.</P>
    <P>It is essential that we should bear in mind the difficulties which could arise in this regard.  I should like to point out that there will devolve on the negotiators during the course of negotiations, and particularly on the Irish Government, an obligation to point out in no uncertain terms to the EEC countries what the employment situation is in this country and that, as the NIEC have pointed out, it will be well after 1980 before there will be any surplus employment opportunities, on the basis of current calculations.  While undoubtedly employers would continue to give preferential treatment to nationals it is important that the EEC countries should be under no illusions in that regard.  I am very concerned that the Irish job forecasting and manpower services could not even hazard a guess as to what is likely to happen between 1975 and 1980, nor indeed does it seem likely that the EEC will at all times have up-to-date information about the state of the Irish labour market.</P>
    <P>I would also point out that note should be taken of the large number of aliens resident in Ireland.  I used the statutory term  &ldquo;alien&rdquo; although I dislike this wold; we hear it used very frequently by Fianna Fáil in regard to the &ldquo;alien traditions&rdquo; and &ldquo;alien ideology&rdquo; of the Labour Party and we all know that it is a pet word of Fianna Fáil.  I would point out to the House that the Department of Labour in reply to a recent questionaire from the International Labour Organisation in Geneva stated that on the 31st December, 1968 approximately 4,435 aliens were registered as resident in this country&mdash;citizens of the British Commonwealth countries are not registered as aliens.  As we are so <Col N="758" /> preoccupied about what is happening in Europe, it might be of interest to note the number of Europeans in Ireland.</P>
    <P>In this country there 937 Germans; 17 Greeks; 13 Hungarians; 13 Iranians; 17 Iraqis; 11 Israelis; 691 Italians; 35 Japanese; 49 Stateless persons; 43 Austrians; 12 persons from the Baltic States; 81 Belgians; 50 Chinese; 24 Czechs; 79 Danish; 421 Dutch; 232 French and 20 Mexicans. In addition to this, there are 16 people from Thailand; 11 from Uganda; 36 from the UAR; 758 from the United States; 18 from the USSR; 19 others; 108 Norwegians; 18 from the Philippines; 45 Polish; 23 Portuguese; 417 Spanish; 59 Swedish; and 90 Swiss nationals.  Having regard to the number of non-nationals living in Ireland I do not think that the Fianna Fáil members who are so preoccupied about being Europeanised need be unduly perturbed.</P>
    <P>Another illusion of the Fianna Fáil Party is that we can join the Common Market and get all the gains but none of the disadvantages.  While I do not regard equal pay as being in any way a disadvantage, I would point out to the Fianna Fáil Party&mdash;who are so anti-feminist and who are unprogressive in getting rid of the marriage bar&mdash; that such a restriction would not be tolerated in a European community. We all know about the impossibility of a married nurse obtaining full-time employment here, yet the Minister for Health was the person who spokes in the Dáil about Charlemagne, about Saint Columbanus and the monks in Bobbio centuries ago and the wonderful advantages of being associated with the European countries.  In the Common Market countries a married nurse would have no difficulty in obtaining full-time employment in any hospital but one has only to visit any of the hospitals in this country to see the discrimination that exists here.  Whenever I raised this matter in the House I was told on each occasion by the Minister for Health that the matter was before the Commission on the Status of Women.  It is important to point out to the Government that they cannot merely pass matters over to a commission for investigation, that they will <Col N="759" /> have to implement in the Treaty of Rome.</P>
    <P>I would point out that Article 119 of the Common Market Charter imposes the obligation that the principle of equal pay should be ensured by the end of the first stage of the transition period.  That has long since passed in the EEC and there has been an evolution towards giving women parity of remuneration that does not exist in Ireland.</P>
    <P>I would point out to the Minister for Labour that hourly earnings of female industrial workers in this country average only 53 per cent of the earnings of male workers compared with 58 per cent in the United Kingdom, 61 per cent in the Netherlands, 68 per cent in Belgium, 70 per cent in Germany, 72 per cent in Italy and 77 per cent in France.  When I asked the Minister for Labour if he would state his intentions to take action to redress this imbalance in the matter of earnings in Ireland as compared with Britain and other European countries, he told me that this matter had been referred to the Commission on the Status of Women.</P>
    <P>The women of Ireland are well aware that in the factories and workshops and even in the public service they are getting 53 per cent of what men earn and they know that if they were working in continental countries they would get much more wages.  I will not suggest to the Irish women workers that they should emigrate in order to get decent wages but there is an obvious lesson here to be learned in terms of our entry into the Common Market.  If we are entering that Community we had better do something pretty quickly about the question of equal pay.</P>
    <P>I would point out that particular difficulties arise in respect of the interpretation of &ldquo;same work&rdquo; being performed by men and women.  The EEC Commission have had eight or nine years experience of dealing with recalcitrant governments and some of the major international cartels who have resisted the introduction of equal pay for their own economic ends.  The following practices are completely incompatible with the principle of equal <Col N="760" /> pay: First of all, the systematic downgrading of women workers is out as far as the EEC is concerned.  Secondly, the adoption of different qualification rules as between men and women is out.  Thirdly, the use of job evaluation criteria not related to the real conditions under which the work is done is also out.  These are fairly stringent conditions of a direct industrial character facing Ireland in the event of entry into the Common Market.</P>
    <P>I would also draw the attention of the House to the fact that Ireland has no as yet implemented the ILO Convention No. 100 for equal pay.  That Convention is much broader than the EEC provision.  It lays down that each member shall, by means appropriate to the methods in operation for determining rates of remuneration, promote and, in so far as it is consistent with such methods, ensure the application to all workers of the principle of equal remuneration for men and women for work of equal value.  This Convention has been ratified by Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Denmark, Norway, Austria, Finland, Iceland and Sweden, but not as yet by the Republic of Ireland, by this island republic which is alleged to cherish all the children of the nation equally under its Constitution.  If we are genuine about our application to the EEC&mdash; I do not believe the Government are&mdash; we have got to implement the Convention not only of the ILO but also that under the Common Market itself. In France, the law rather stringently covers collective bargaining.  Male adults workers and female adult workers must get the same starting pay.  In Germany there is equality in starting rates of pay and on differentials.  As a result, while men earn more, women earn around 80 per cent of what men earn.  The Italian constitution provides for equal pay.  Deputy Keating lauded our Constitution.  The only comment I have to make is that there should be introduced into that Constitution a provision for equal pay.  I know my colleague, Deputy Keating, thinks the Constitution should be preserved intact but the introduction of such a provision would show clearly that we are not a male dominated society, an anti-feminist discriminatory society.  This is <Col N="761" /> not special pleading.  Any socialist recognises that as an elementary principle of social justice.  It is regrettable that obscurantism has prevented that evolution here.</P>
    <P>If we introduce equal pay, industries vulnerable to free trade conditions will find themselves in a dire situation.  Male and female rates of pay in the footwear industry are separate and distinct. If equal pay were introduced overnight, without a five-year transitional period, not alone would the industry not be able to face competition from Northern Ireland and Britain but it would be virtually wiped out.  There are sectors of the textile industry in which there is an enormous disparity between the rates of pay for male and female workers.  That, too, is involved in the EEC tariff transitional arrangements. The food processing industry is equally vulnerable.  There are other industries in which there is an enormous disparity between the pay of male and female workers: the bakery and confectionery trade, the catering trade, the hotel trade, the drapery trade the grocery trade.  Introducing equal pay for men and women in the clerical sphere would not, I think, provide an insuperable problem.  If we are genuine, if we want the benefits of the EEC, we must face up to the realities.  If we go in, the Government will have to face amending certain sections of the 1946 Industrial Relations Act, particularly Part III.  They will also have to put a provision in the regulations relating to joint industrial councils to ensure equal pay for men and women for the same work.  That is a job for the Labour Court.  With all their current problems I am sure it is not one they will welcome.</P>
    <P>I do not think the Government were being honest in not stating these problems more emphatically.  There is no point in running away from the massive involvements from the point of view of prices in the light of the taxation changes within the Common Market.  Deputy O'Donovan referred to the impact of the value added tax. A number of countries have rather sharply refused to implement as yet the value added tax because of the traumatic impact it would have on their own interest price structures and <Col N="762" /> on consumer indices.  It is noteworthy that the EEC Council of Ministers granted Italy permission to postpone the introduction of the value added tax until October, 1971.  Belgium has also obtained permission to postpone its introduction until 1971.  This shows the magnitude of the problem affecting the member states in the EEC in the event of the value added tax system coming into general operation.</P>
    <P>For Ireland, it will be an extremely difficult problem.  The impact on the consumer price index will be very substantial. I think the Government front bench is so obsessed at the moment with a false air of political gaiety that they do not seem able to concentrate on the economic implications of the value added taxation system.  If such a tax is introduced, there will be a substantial consequential increase in food prices, well above the 11 per cent to 16 per cent projected.  The Government have not faced up to all the implications. I do not regard, strange as it may seem, an increase of from 3 per cent to 4½ per cent in the consumer price index as very substantial.  One must bear in mind that, in the past 18 months alone, the price of food in this country, to our eternal desgrace&mdash;leaving aside wage impact and the impact of taxation&mdash;has quite disproportionately gone up by 16.3 per cent.  It is quite a fantastic increase in 18 months. It is the equivalent of entry into the Common Market.</P>
    <P>The proposed impact of food prices put forward by the Government in that context certainly is not all that substantial. I suggest to the Government that extreme care must be exercised in this country in relation, particularly, to price surveillance and effective price supervision.  Otherwise price will spiral out of all proportion in the event of accession coming in the middle of 1973 or thereabouts.  I would bring the attention of the Government to the 1970 OECD report on Ireland.  In the prices section of that report we are informed that about two-fifths of the increase in consumer prices can be accounted for by the higher indirect tax rates introduced at the retail level in November, 1968, and May, 1969, and at the wholesale level in January <Col N="763" /> and July, 1969.  The impact of taxation increases in this country together with the recent increase in turnover tax of 2½ per cent has distorted beyond all recognition the current price structure in the Irish economy.  If we are to be faced with a very substantial further increase, on entry into the Common Market, the matter could get completely out of hand.</P>
    <P>Taking the OECD index at the moment and looking around the world one sees what has happened to Irish prices.  Talking 1963 as base 100, Ireland is 139 on the price index; Canada, 125&mdash;substantially lower. This is for the first quarter of 1970. For all its inflation, the United States is only 124. Austria, 126; Belgium, 127; Luxembourg, 122; France, 129; Germany, 119; Greece, 115; Sweden, 132; Switzerland, 124 and the United Kingdom, 122.  Ireland is miles ahead at 139.  This is an indication of the explosive increase in prices in this country in the past four or five years especiall, I think, due to excessive conservativism and undue reliance by successive Ministers for Finance on indirect taxation, and the milking of the buoyancy of consumer demand to the extent that would let things go completely out of gear.</P>
    <P>I am expressing, on behalf of the Labour Party, very considerable concern about the situation in relation to prices and the effect that that will have on the overall economic situation.  It does not amaze me to any degree that we are having a bad tourist season.  It does not surprise me that we are having a rather difficult emigrant situation. With the price of food here, apart altogether from the cost of hotel accommodation and the current prices of drink and tobacco, it is obvious that tourists do not find this country financially attractive</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The next aspect I particularly want to refer to is the peculiar parallel between the impact of the tariff reductions under the Free <Col N="764" /> Trade Area Agreement and the simultaneous seeking by the Irish Government of entry into the Common Market. It is of considerable importance to remind ourselves that a situation has developed of very considerable imbalance in relation to the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement and EEC developments.  For many goods, the critical tariff level will be between 10 per cent and 5 per cent; there will be tariff reductions down as far as 10 per cent.  There is a further 10 per cent reduction under the Free Trade Area Agreement now, in July.  For any industrial product, it does not have any major general impact but, once one gets to the 10 per cent level&mdash;and we are now getting to it very shortly under the Free Trade Area Agreement&mdash;a very critical situation will arise in the Irish economy.  We had a very high level of tariffs which were designed largely against dumping.  Once they are gone, a very peculiar situation arises because the particular Irish tariff was in the region of 60 per cent basic and 40 per cent preferential and, within a very short space of time, it will be down to 10 per cent.</P>
      <P>Between the middle of 1971 and the middle of 1973, in my assessment, we will have to bear the main brunt of the Free Trade Area Agreement.  The freeing of trade under that agreement will have a major impact.  This creates a problem for Irish industry.  It is now accepted that we will not go into the Common Market until 1973 at the very earliest.  If there is to be a five-year transitional period up to 1978, which is now generally accepted as being the optimum, we will have a full five years operation of the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement within which a great deal could happen to the Irish economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is disturbing to find that, although the freeing of trade has not yet reached a very critical level, erosion of the Irish home market with imports has already begun.  That reflects the impact of the agreement and a decline in competitiveness as a result of increased production costs here and abroad.  This brings us to a point which is worthy of being stressed.  The Irish negotiators <Col N="765" /> must place the Free Trade Area Agreement on the table and must make some attempt to harmonise and integrate the two agreements on a more coherent and more effective basis. Otherwise the ground will be cut from under us before we have the opportunity of gaining any advantage to be gained from EEC membership.</P>
    <P>There is a superficiality in much of the discussion in the Dáil.  We are told that there is a population of 250 million on the Continent and all we have to do is put all the goods into one huge container, package it, call it &ldquo;Europe&rdquo; and consign it to the Continent and, hey presto, magnificent export opportunities for Irish industry. For some industries, for the textile industry, for some sectors of the engineering industry, for some sectors of the food processing industry and some of the speciality industries like Irish Ropes, Waterford Glass and so on, there are prospects undoubtedly, and benefits to be gained.  A subjective analysis is beyond the competence of any of us in this House.  Certainly I would prefer to listen to the trade advisers of CTT rather than speculate in this House as to what the total effect will be.  We do not know, because we do not know the terms of entry and we will not know the precise regulations until about the middle of 1973.</P>
    <P>It is worth reminding the House that, while it is certainly true that there are many industries which will tend to benefit to some extent from accession to continental markets, it is equally true that with the freeing of trade between Ireland and Britain, with the tremendous build-up of industrial expertise and competitiveness in Britain, with all the facilities of a common language between this country and Britain, a common system of weights and measures and a common legal and monetary system already in operation, with the facilities for the importation of British goods into Ireland given under the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement, compounded by entry into the Common Market, with the pressure of British advertising through British newspapers, supplements and magazines, and through Independent Television and the BBC on the east coast, we have as much to fear from competition <Col N="766" /> from British firms as from EEC firms.</P>
    <P>The Irish nation in the sixties, to the eternal credit of Irish manufacturers and Irish industrial workers, made a breakthrough and we now export very substantially to Britain which is the main country to which we export and is likely to remain so, whatever reservatioins we may have, and whatever reservations I may have about the British Conservative Government.  It is very important to appreciate that, for a considerable length of time, many continental firms will find it worth while to launch a major advertising campaign in the Republic of Ireland, provided they are fully aware that we are a separate Republic.  Some of them, at least, have been given the impression by the Minister for External Affairs that ours is almost part of the British application.</P>
    <P>Aer Lingus were able to stand on their own feet and take on the whole of Europe successfully in air passenger transport.  The continental airlines did not bother very much with Ireland because the extent to which they could benefit from launching a major sales drive in Ireland was limited.  We in the Labour Party welcome the fact and are delighted to see that there is to be a diversification of Irish industrial exports.  We now send to Britain about 65 per cent of our manufactured products as against 70 per cent or 75 per cent a decade ago.  Nevertheless, the odds are that we will be sending a substantial amount of our exports to Britain in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>I come now to the second part of my approach to the Minister's industrial propositions.  I do not want to be too hard on him.  I do not know whether he suffers from a native cunning or is inarticulate in a way peculiar to Clare although I never found Claremen to be inarticulate.  Ther is a peculiar ambivalence, a peculiar lack of clarity, in his attitude and his statements in Luxembourg on 30th June and in this House.  Off he trotted to Lumembourg where he said that there was a very small number of sensitive industries for which these arrangements might not be adequate and that this was a matter which we would want <Col N="767" /> to discuss in the course of the negotiations.</P>
    <P>That is all he said about the sensitivity of Irish industry to EEC competition except&mdash;and this is why I would support the Fine Gael motion that there should be adequate safeguards; that is a sensible and basic comment to make on the White Paper&mdash;that the small size of the Irish market and of our industrial units leaves the Irish economy particularly vulnerable to dumping and that we would hope a satisfactory solution to this difficulty would also be found in the negotiations. Apart from that, four lines on dumping and three lines in regard to the sensitive industries in Ireland and EEC competition, there was no general comment.  I find that to be a rather prostrate position for any Minister to put himself in respect of the overall need for a rather careful attitude towards the Common Market situation.</P>
    <P>There are many points open to the Government for negotiation.  In particular there has been a great deal of comment on the need to have effective dumping regulations operated here, but so far I see no evidence of them. We have had a heap of conventional wisdom from the Department of Industry and Commerce written probably by somebody in the industrial reorganisation branch.  I do not know where it came from but it did not point out very many problems facing Irish industry apart from the usual platitudes one tends to get.  In relation to platitudes may I refer particularly to the kind of Civil Service jargon that is produced. The Department of Finance jargon is very different from the jargon of the Department of Industry and Commerce, to the credit of the Department of Finance.  In this connection there is a paragraph in the EEC White Paper which, as far as I can see, does little more than separate one paragraph from another.  Here we have a statement in relation to the problems facing individual firms in paragraph 4.44 on page 29.  Can any Member of the House divine what function this paragraph has?</P>
    <P>It is necessary to face up to the fact that membership of the EEC <Col N="768" /> would pose problems, possibly of a serious nature, for some sectors of industry as well as for individual firms.  Nothing must be left undone. either at the appropriate levels in industry, or by the State agencies concerned, to solve or at least mitigate these difficulties.  But it would be an unbalanced reaction to become obsessed with the difficulties and not attempt to view the situation in wider perspective.</P>
    <P>I know I am guilty of using, by virtue of my background, trade union jargon but as far as I can gather the only function of that paragraph is to separate paragraph 4.43 from 4.45, the sort of thing that should not arise in a White Paper.  Not only do we face competition from EEC countries themselves, and more particularly from Britain, but we also face competition from a form of international development which is vastly bigger than the Common Market. In fact the Common Market in the context of international, multinational companies is a rather old-fashioned economic bloc.  I stress this strongly. The gross national produce of this country runs well over £1,300 million a year.  General Motors, which is not just an American but an international company, has a gross income of £9,481 million.  It is a rather sobering thought that General Motors, which have very little time for the Common Market&mdash; they regard it as one of those peculiar European institutions which they will take on in due course&mdash;have an income as large as 25 per cent of the whole of the wealth of the United Kingdom.  That puts it in international perspective.</P>
    <P>The Ford Company, operating on an international basis, are not terribly worried about the Common Market. A decision in relation to Cork for example, will not be taken in relation to the Common Market nor in relation to the plants in Liverpool or anything like that but in relation to the fact that Ford have a world-wide income of £6,000 million annually, four times the wealth of Ireland.  The Ford Company are greater in many respects than many an individual State in many parts of the world and such a company will have an entirely different approach to <Col N="769" /> such bodies as the Common Market, so much so that the Common Market may be considered in some respects as rather irrelevant.</P>
    <P>I drive what I suppose is a Common Market car, a Volkswagen.  The income of the Volkswagen company annually is £1,300 million.  It is as big as the gross national income of Ireland. We are negotiating with the Common Market but if we wanted to negotiate on an equal level we could meet the directors of Volkswagen.  The Philips company, a multinational European-oriented company, have an annual income as large as the whole of the gross national product of Ireland, approximately £1,200 million.  I am quoting these figures from the excellent reports at the seminar we had in the Irish Transport and General Workers Union. Recently we had Daniel Benedict, Assistant General Secretary of the International Metal Workers Federation, over in Ireland and he spoke about multinational companies and their conglomerates and the problems of trade unions on an international basis.  There is the problem, for example, of a trade union taking on a company such as EI, Ford, or Volkswagen, not just on a Common Market basis but on a general international basis, because that is what one does when one is faced with a certain situation, the kind of situation which faced Irish workers in relation to Cement Ltd., intertwined with the monopolies that are on the British side or on the general company side.</P>
    <P>Very emphatically I want to make the point that the importance of the major world of giants in the financial field is accompanied not only by the tremendous concentration they possess in capital investment and annual income but also by the massive concentration of manpower they employ.  As was pointed out to us in no uncertain terms, there are 12 motor assembly companies in the world and they employ almost the equivalent of our population, a total of 2.3 million people.  Another 3.5 million workers in the world are employed by only 27 companies producing the whole of the world's production of lamps, radios, television sets, washing machines <Col N="770" /> and computers, just that range of electronics and electrical engineering industry, a total of 27 companies employing 3,500,000 workers.  While admittedly our control over such companies is extremely limited, our accession to the EEC does not mitigate the major problems facing us in respect of these companies.  Therefore, I would ask the Government to take another look at the function of that body with the rather odd title of An Coimisiún Dumpála.  Whoever foisted that weird title on the Irish nation deserves to be sent to Rossnowlagh for a couple of weeks holidays to march with the Orangemen.  An Coimisiún Dumpála should investigate the activities of such companies on the Irish scene.  In saying that I do not subscribe to the view of Deputy Dr. FitzGerald when he says that in his four years in both Houses he has never heard such consistently conservative sentiments as have come from these benches on the EEC question.  I suppose the Labour Party can be classified as conservative when it comes to conditions of employment and accession problems relating to the EEC. Again there is an obligation devolving on us to outline these employment problems.  In relation to employment it may be said that, ironically, more jobs have been lost over the past three or four years through industrial fires than through the impact of free trade.</P>
    <P>In regard to the dumping situation there are certain remedies I would urge strongly on the House.  The first remedy I would urge is to support the Minister for Industry and Commerce on the need for more effective adaptation. There is considerable room for improved standardisation, specialisation and the development of more competitive products.  In many companies there is a great deal of leeway to be made up in this regard.  With all due respect to Deputy Lalor, I do not regard the Minister for Industry and Commerce as being competent to carry out this task.  I have always been greatly disappointed at the complete failure of successive Ministers for Industry and Commerce in this field; I thought Deputy Colley had the capacity to do this at one time but, having seen him in action for 12 or 15 months <Col N="771" /> in his Department, I changed my mind. Ministers could use their imagination in encouraging more mergers to strengthen Irish companies, the kind of specialised development by, for example, Carrols, United Distillers of Ireland, Waterford Glass, Irish Glass Bottle Company and so on.  One wonders what the Minister for Industry and Commerce would be doing other than involving himself in such development.  He is not always involved in opening factories.  Certainly he looks after Laois-Offaly with particular care, but this is a function on which the Minister could exercise his talents, not only encouraging mergers but also encouraging co-operation on a group or industry-basis where desirable.</P>
    <P>I am sure Deputy Gallagher, as an industrialist, will agree with me that in many respects the various services consider themselves to be immune from the effects of the EEC.  They too could shake a leg.  I refer to services such as those operated by the Department of Local Government and the services provided by the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  There is nothing more frustrating for an Irish exporter in the West of Ireland than to be trying for half a day to get a call through quickly to his customers, particularly coming up to the week-end, or trying to arrange quickly for containerisation out of Ireland, when the telephone and telex system of communication is not as effective as it should be.</P>
    <P>The Department of Local Government should provide the necessary services expeditiously in relation to planning permission and water supplies, which are urgently needed for a new industry siting itself in a particular area.  These services to Irish industry could do with a sharp toning up by the Government.  But whether the Fianna Fáil Party can do this is another matter.  There seems to be a certain weariness, a degree of political apathy: &ldquo;We are here for so long that no one else is likely to come along, and things will be all the same whether we are in or out of the Common Market.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>As a trade unionist, I would point out that there is a great need for the <Col N="772" /> trade unions to display a more intense involvement in the Common Market. It seems to me the trade union general secretaries who have even bothered to read the White Paper published by the Government could be counted on the fingers of one hand.  There are 140 fulltime trade union officers in the country.  If there are problems relating to unemployment, to retraining, to transitional tariff charges or to planning prior to EEC entry, it is their job to acquaint themselves with such matters.  At the moment they do not convey to me the impression that they are <i>au fait</i> with this work.</P>
    <P>I accept that the vast bulk of trade union officials, spending as they do 10 per cent of their time collecting membership fees and 80 per cent dealing with day to day problems and trade union negotiations, have little opportunity of specialising in such topics.  As far as I am concerned if the major trade unions had to spend a couple of thousand pounds a year employing research or statistical officers, thus making a wealth of information available for executives, it would be a very valuable exercise in facing up to the tremendous implications of entering the Common Market.</P>
    <P>The Irish Management Institute&mdash; about which some Labour Deputies have &ldquo;a thing&rdquo; which I do not particularly share&mdash;have endeavoured to shake off the lethargy inherent in many sectors of management and make them more competitive-minded and more adaptation-minded.  The Irish Management Institute have shown that 68 per cent of our privately-owned firms, family firms, employ less than 20 people, which is a very disturbing figure.  In addition, you have a complete lack of skill in many industries as well as a lack of training.  You also have the rather frightening fact that almost 70 per cent of managers in industry have no formal qualifications.  I do not place any particular regard on formal qualifications because this country would never have got off the ground politically or economically if it had to depend on people with formal qualifications.  However, with the growing complexity of management it is a matter of concern that seven out of every ten managers have no formal <Col N="773" /> qualifications for the posts they occupy. Apart from the usual nepotism and the fact that if you go to the right school or the right college you will get the right job or the right opening in management, it is important to point out that the vast bulk of managers have had no education beyond the age of 20 years.  Again I do not particularly hold that those who have had education beyond the age of 20 are any better or any the more capable than those who have not but nevertheless these are indications which are of major concern.  Indeed, if one goes to the age of 18 instead of 20 it makes the position even more disturbing. While those who have got their skills in industry by hit or by miss, or by the unique combination of cunning and skulduggery or, as in most cases, through a personal enterpreneurial ability, are very rare and very valuable the fact is that this must be done on a planned economic basis.  The Irish Management Institute is one area in which we have to keep this in mind.</P>
    <P>It is quite appalling that there is complete lack of co-ordination between the work done by the NIEC, the work done by the industrial reorganisation branch of the Department of Industry and Commerce, by the industries branch of the Industrial Development Authority and also the foreign trade section of Córas Tráchtála.  We are not such a big nation; we only have 47 firms employing more than 500 people.  There is not sufficient co-ordination within the Departments&mdash;and I am always very loath to say whether it should be the Department of Industry and Commerce or the Department of Finance but certainly it should not be the Department of External Affairs.  There is urgent need to get rid of the state of affairs in which you have the Department of External Affairs leading the negotiations with a Minister who has no real, intimate economic briefing.  You have the IDA going along, doing quite well in many respects, involved in solving the power struggle at the top&mdash;solved by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Colley, in his own fashion, with guarantees written all around&mdash;and on that basis it is a pity to have the industries branch of the IDA and CTT and the development <Col N="774" /> division of the Department of Finance not acting on a more unified and co-ordinated basis.  I have spent sufficient time being involved with the various Government Departments to appreciate as much as any Deputy the empire-building and the empire-destroying and the internal power structures. These are unknown to other Deputies who are very much preoccupied with what goes on here but not so much with what goes on within Departments of State.  There is, therefore, a need for greater co-ordination on a central planning basis.</P>
    <P>A proposition which evoked my disapproval was one contained in the Devlin Report in relation to CTT. CTT in relation to the European market and to the expansion of existing exports to the British market are playing a very valuable role and no doubt will continue to do so in the years ahead.  This was never more important than in the context of negotiations in regard to free trade.  Greater liaison should exist between CTT and the Department of External Affairs without CTT being absorbed as a kind of trade sector of the Department of External Affairs.  Through no fault of their own the staff of the industrial development branch of the Department of Industry and Commerce may lack sufficient industrial experience, but you have in it a number of men of considerable competence and ability and who are now working on the committee of industrial progress reports.</P>
    <P>However, there is still an absence of incentive or of a cross-fertilisation of ideas.  I should like to see an infusion into the Department of Industry and Commerce and into the Department of External Affairs&mdash;as was done by the British Labour Government with tremendous results, so much so that the Conservatives dare not dismantle it&mdash; of outside industrialists and public servants from the State-sponsored bodies, such as CTT and the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards, on a short term, seconded basis and on a high paid basis, to cross-fertilise the work being done.  I do not think it would upset the internal promotional arrangements or the staffing position.  Needless to say, this would have to be done <Col N="775" /> in consultation with the executive officers and other senior officers of the Government Departments.  However, I consider it could and should be done because there is an enormous amount of work to be done in the Department of Industry and Commerce in this regard.</P>
    <P>There are 3,000 firms in this country and the Minister for Industry and Commerce cannot possibly keep an eye on the entire industrial sector.  There are 47 firms employing more than 500 people; they are self-operating in many respects in the sensitive industrial areas and should be under the special care of the Minister.  There are 256 firms employing between 100 and 500 people and many of these concerns are in a vulnerable position.  There are 946 businesses employing between 20 and 100 people and these firms can develop or go to the wall depending on a change of tariff or a particular aspect of Government policy.  Those firms deserve and must have the special care and attention of the Minister for Industry and Commerce in relation to the freeing of trade.  I would suggest to the Minister that for the next couple of years he might leave the opening of new factories to his Parliamentary Secretary and concentrate on running his Department.  The stature of the Department of Industry and Commerce has declined sharply in the last three or four years.</P>
    <P>Another area for strengthening our industrial arm which I would recommend for consideration by the Government would be implementation on a selective basis of the proposals in the Buchanan Report.  It would be a tremendous asset if we could say to the Italian oil monopoly or to the French or Italian tobacco monopolies that there was emerging in Ireland a concept of special industrial growth centres.  For example, in Cork there is the obvious area for a specialised petro-chemical oil complex and, with the new smelter plant, the oil refinery and with Whiddy Island near by, this area is worthy of consideration by major industrial specialised firms. Shannon is an obvious centre for international research similar to the international publishing firm which has <Col N="776" /> developed there in respect of academic books.</P>
    <P>If this kind of development were put forward by the Government they could transform their own image, which at this moment is not held in esteem by other countries.  I have spoken to a few people recently in Brussels and the technocrats there, with their very clear and definite views on the ordered society of Europe, regard with askance the recent events in our country.  However, they will probably forgive us in view of our promise to again Christianise Europe.</P>
    <P>The other industry which I think is extremely vulnerable in relation to the Common Market is the fertiliser industry. There are massive EEC subsidies at the moment contained with the Community.  I do not wish to start a scare about our prospects in this sector but I consider that firms such as Gouldings and Albatros could be faced with a tremendous blast of competition because of the questionable nature of the long-term prospects of the fertiliser industry.  We must look closely at the future of this important industry which gives valuable employment because it is an area where we could see substantial expansion of State-sponsored industry and is a sphere in which effective legislation could be invoked.</P>
    <P>These are my reservations in relation to the White Paper in regard to industry.  The White Paper is unduly complacent and is not explicit in the matter of development.  The Minister should do more than merely urge adaptation of industry and he should realise that there are a number of extremely vulnerable industries in this country.</P>
    <P>I am sure Deputies are aware of the excellent book by Catherine Brock of Trinity College.  In her report on 22 industries she made a significant comment in relation to external association. She said:</P>
    <P>In five industries and one industry sector the major part of the industry, measured by value of gross output or employment, was either under external control or governed by licensing arrangements or manufacturing <Col N="777" /> agreements with external firms.  As will be seen later, this radically affects the adaptation possibilities open to them.</P>
    <P>The industries are: the vehicle industry, the wireless industry, the chocolate industry; the chemical industry; the electrical equipment industry and the foundation garments industry.  They are industries over which we do not have any control in relation to the EEC but if Ireland enters the Community I see no reason why these industries should not continue in operation.</P>
    <P>In this whole matter of industry I would emphasise the point outlined in the <i>Review of Industrial Progress</i>, 1969.  In that report it is stated that the home and export markets for some food products are declining and have lost their former buoyancy and mention is made specifically of items such as bread, butter, jam, sugar and confectionery. If one goes into any supermarket in the greater Dublin area, one cannot fail to notice the substantial increase in imported products.</P>
    <P>The report also stated that some imported goods were attractive to distributors because their freedom from price control enables distributors to get a high profit margin and the difficulty of enforcing fair trading practices gives the advantage to the large importers. I am sure if Deputy Andrews or myself paid a visit to the Stillorgan or Cornels-court shopping centres we would not have to search very far for such examples.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>In recent years there has been a rapid decline in the relative competitiveness of our manufactured products.  This is a very serious matter. If I might illustrate the situation in terms of wage costs per unit of output&mdash;this is something of tremendous significance from the point of view of entry into the Common Market&mdash;since 1963 wage costs per unit of output have gone up by 25 per cent.  In England they have gone up by only 16 per cent.  We are in trouble then <i>vis-à-vis</i> England in terms of competitive wage costs per unit of output. In Italy, ironically enough, there has been a decline of 5 per cent, due to immense productivity; we are 30 per cent worse off then as against Italy in terms of wage costs per unit since 1963. We have gone up by 25 per cent.  West Germany has gone up by 23 per cent in that six-year period.  America has gone up by only 10 per cent and Japan by 4 per cent.  There is, therefore, a very serious situation here from the point of view of the relative competitiveness of Irish manufactured products <i>vis-à-vis</i> the Common Market. This is something of major concern not only to the trade union movement, which has a vested interest in this particular aspect of Irish life, but also from the point of view of competitiveness generally.  We should bear that fact in mind in any future development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would strongly urge, in preparation for the EEC, that there is a very considerable need to ensure that the Institute of Industrial Research is upgraded and its role and function made much more effective.  The 1969 Act provided that the IDA might make grants towards the cost of research and the development of new industrial processes, the grants not to exceed 50 per cent of the cost.  That was a very valuable piece of legislation, be it <Col N="779" /> said to the credit of Fianna Fáil. Government approval was necessary for anything over £15,000.  That was a little Spartan, but there had to be some limit.  As far as I remember the former Deputy Seán Lemass was deeply involved in this and a former Member of this House, Deputy James Larkin, was a member of the board.  It was the only board on which he ever served.  He was always very concerned about the great need for development research.  I believe the five-year programme should now be given a substantial shot in the arm.</P>
    <P>To come to another aspect, I think that when the Government become aware of what is happening in Belgium, France and Italy in relation to State-holding companies they will see the wisdom of such an approach.  In preparation for the freeing of trade&mdash;this seems inevitable irrespective altogether of entry into the Common Market&mdash; there is urgent need here for the setting up of a State-holding company comparable to that established in Italy, Belgium, and France.  These Governments have been particularly farseeing in ensuring the evolution in their respective countries of a different kind of approach in terms of State-sponsored organisations.  State holding companies have developed in Italy, France, Belgium and Sweden.  These are a dynamic force on the European scene. These organisations are comparable to the industrial re-organisation corporation set up in Britain by the Labour Government for the purpose of developing major centres of industry, such as the steel industry, the electricity industry, and so on.  IRI in Italy has been accepted by private enterprise as the kind of development necessary in modern world circumstances.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael are in favour of the establishment of a State-holding company and that, if I may say so, puts them on the altar of ideological purity.  In supporting the idea we can hardly be accused of another approach.  Such a structure would provide a very valuable co-ordination of the various State sponsored bodies which proliferate on the Irish scene.  Such a body could be responsible for injecting a great deal of extra capital investment into our <Col N="780" /> State-sponsored bodies.  I have in mind the great need there is for more capital for Aer Lingus and the Electricity Supply Board.  If the economic climate deteriorates the climate in these companies also deteriorates.  If there were a State-holding company that would help enormously in offsetting adverse trends and relieving the strain.  IRI activities in Italy range from banking to transportation to the production of steel and automobiles.  Sales, excluding those of some other holdings, total four billion a year, placing IRI among the European giants.  The Italians have achieved this since the war by setting up this Institute for Industrial Construction. It has emerged as a major state enterprise in Italy giving four billion sales.  That state-sponsored body in Italy is one of the most effective means by which the Government have been able, without introducing harsh budgetary methods, to model national economies along specific lines.  For instance, they have been able to avail of it to stave off take-overs.  It has, of course, a state bank in operation. There are lessons to be learned here by our Minister for Industry and Commerce in relation to banking.  It might stop some of the nonsense in this country in that regard.</P>
    <P>Sweden has acted likewise.  I cannot pronounce the name of their holding company but nevertheless, as and from 1st January of this year, Sweden formed a state holding company to co-ordinate most state-owned industries and to provide a partnership possibility for private enterprise.  That company in Sweden had an initial turnover of 500 million dollars.  It has restricted its primary holdings to manufacturing industries. Let us look at the position, in relation to the Common Market, of, say, Bord Iascaigh Mhara.  You can ask the chairman of that board or the information officer of that board what the anticipation is in relation to our fishing industry in the Common Market.  Deputy Begley went through the horrors of Hell in his outline.  Deputy Keating was equally preoccupied and concerned with the future of our fishing industry. In the dormitory surburb I represent there are 65 fishermen operating out <Col N="781" /> of 14 trawlers.  Is the role of BIM in relation to the EEC adequately being contained, developed, and so on, the context of other State-owned companies where there might be a need of massive State funds to bring them over the hump during the transitional period? In Cork, when we do not like a thing, we describe it as rather &ldquo;mangy&rdquo;. Beyond the rather mangy comment by Deputy Hillery, Minister for External Affairs, &ldquo;including future arrangements for fisheries&rdquo; he said nothing. That is where a State-owning company could, in respect of CTT, Heinz Erin, BIM, in respect of any one of the major trading companies of a State-sponsored nature in this country, play a very valuable role.

      <P>I am drawing analogies in relation to State-sponsored bodies.  With regard to the last-named gentleman, I can assure this House that we would not have any weird take-over ideology adduced to strengthen Irish industry in any sector.  I put that accordingly to this House for consideration.</P>
      <P>I am quite convinced that in this country, in facing the EEC, with a more dynamic combination of private enterprise of a trading, manufacturing, expanding nature&mdash;with a progressive private enterprise sector and with a major co-operative effort in the agricultural sphere&mdash;the productive potentialities of many of these industries could be expanded and we could possibly face many of the areas and a great many of the difficulties approaching us in the Common Market with far greater confidence.  I think, therefore, that private enterprise should be assisted but, equally, we should give a fairness of approach to the sectors of the public enterprise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to another very important report issued by the Government, and doubly relevant to this debate, may I say that the first report issued by the Committee on Industrial Progress, the report on the fruit and vegetable processing industry, is excellent.  I congratulate <Col N="782" /> the Department of Industry and Commerce on its involvement, and the staff, in this report.  I would point out that in the other CIO reports&mdash;I went through them at home the other evening in preparation for this debate &mdash;one meets the facts of life of 1961 to 1964.  These are out of date now in assessing the free trade prospects of these industries.  In respect of the eight or ten industries being studied now by the Committee on Industrial Progress, the sooner reports are available to Deputies the quicker we shall be able to advise our negotiators in relation to the EEC.  Certainly, this report has a valuable warning to give in relation to the Common Market.</P>
    <P>I do not see any dramatic change in the structure of Irish industry as a result of entry into the Common Market.  I speak in the broad structural sense.  There is a big dilemma facing the Labour Party, a peculiar ideological dilemma which faces every socialist democratic party in Europe.  Indeed, we have had to face this peculiar dilemma, if we may call it such, ever since the world war.  It is one in which we have no option.  As we presume to act in that manner, we must face it.  It is the kind of question which a socialist party, as such, must accept as a permanent feature of Irish life&mdash;a mixed economy with the Government's function, within or without the EEC, to ensure a correct and fair balance between public and private ownership. Furthermore, the Government should confine itself, in the Common Market, to controlling and planning the economy by efficient budgetary methods and by statutory legislation put directly through Oireachtas Éireann to provide for all the people of this country, north and south, greater equality and a better distribution of wealth.  That is the kind of question which faces us in the Labour Party or, alternatively whether we would advance the proposition of a society in which virtually every sector of the community, in terms of production, finance, land, distribution, would be in public ownership.  This is one of the major dilemmas facing a party with socialist approaches and socialist tendencies.  I think the inevitable answer in many respects is that we want to see the growth and development <Col N="783" /> and the emergence of a strong, dynamic and vigorous mixed economy in this country.  That alone should be an adequate answer to those who accuse us of being excessively ideological in our approach to this matter.</P>
    <P>Those are my comments on the preparation of Irish industry for entry into the Common Market.  Our economy is stronger and better prepared for membership of the EEC than it was at the time of our first application in 1961.  It is a matter for regret that the element of political hopefulness and stability in our island is less secure than it was at that time.  However, that is a different matter.  The degree of rationalisation has varied considerably between industrial firms in each sector.  All firms must try to expand if they are to survive in free trade conditions.  There will be increased opportunities for exports in the market of 250 million people.  The substantial re-equipping, adaptation and capital grants given to Irish industry by the Government have strengthened our industrial base and, by and large, have been of major benefit to the country.</P>
    <P>There is another very critical problem facing us, that is, the level of our export tax reliefs in relation to the EEC.  Some Canadian and American relations of mine were amazed at the taxation concessions given for Irish mineral exploration and for oil surveys off the coast of Ireland.  They regard this as a bonanza and they think it magnificent in terms of the exploitation and the general development of the industry.  It is accepted by the mining correspondent of the <i>Financial Times</i> and by virtually every Canadian mining expert that companies like Northgate have got a goldmine and are working it.  We have given tax reliefs to many Irish companies and it was intended to continue them at least until 1990.  Many people are rather dubious as to whether the EEC will permit us to continue giving these export reliefs until the end of that period.</P>
    <P>In the White Paper it is stated that the Government are hopeful that it will be possible to secure the Council's agreement to the retention of these measures.  I am very worried about the position in Shannon and the <Col N="784" /> position in relation to our mining industry and other sectors of our economy if there is any sudden turn-about on the part of the EEC Commission.  This will not be going to any European Parliament or any Council of Ministers.  It is the Commission who will be drawing up the tax regulations.  There will be a few Irish commissioners, I suppose.  Deputy FitzGerald is in Brussels at the moment and I suppose he is being interviewed for the job.  At any rate, he would make a good fist of it if he got it.</P>
    <P>There is a very urgent need to ensure that the Irish negotiators make this a very strong pre-condition of entry.  At Shannon there is the duty free aspect but I consider the tax reliefs to be the most important attraction for industry coming into this country.  We could face very severe repercussions in that regard.  The Government should approach it on a very careful basis.</P>
    <P>Before going on to agriculture I should like to deal briefly with another major criticism made about economic planning.  Deputy FitzGerald was unduly snide&mdash;and I do not often accuse him of being snide&mdash;about the pamphlet produced by Mr. Anthony Coughlan.  Seeing that Deputy FitzGerald denounced him I presume I can use his name.  This very vocal and vociferous academic, a fellow Corkman, performed a public function in laying this pamphlet before the House and the people giving his views and his fears on the Common Market. Irrespective of whether we agree with all he says, he has given a valuable public service.  He paid for the pamphlet out of his own pocket.  This is the type of elementary involvement which is needed.  I understand that he is not a member of any political party.</P>
    <P>He put a number of points before us for consideration.  There is one important point which is not very much stressed in his pamphlet, that is, the question of economic planning in relasion to the EEC.  It is not unfair to say that the Treaty of Rome is a product of the liberal <i>laissez faire</i> economists. From 1945 until 1956-58 the vast bulk of the poor, unfortunate socialists were either shot or imprisoned.  There were not very many of them knocking around to put the <Col N="785" /> social content which Deputy FitzGerald maintained they did into that treaty.</P>
    <P>We should ensure that we maintain the right to plan our own economy and the right to pursue an independent policy having regard to whatever form of planning we might adopt, whether it involves the full rigour of centralised planning or whether it is the rotational type of planning of a five year budgetary nature, or whether it is the kind of temporary indicative planning that so many Members of this House do not particularly like simply because they dislike planning.  They dislike public servants in particular.  They hate any plans they put before them which they have not concocted themselves and, to be crude about it, and perhaps to be snide myself, many of them could not care less about economic planning. As long as the medical cards and the jobs at local level and the houses for their constituents and the multitude of problems keep flowing, however important and vital they are, the EEC has a low priority.</P>
    <P>Much talk is going on within the Common Market in terms of planning but it is not all of a complexion which we in the Labour Party would favour. I do not like planning without responsibility. I feel very strongly that many of the EEC commissioners plan first and consult afterwards.  They then inform the member states of their intentions. This is evident in many of the regulations which have been put before us.</P>
    <P>One can quote back to him&mdash;and he may not particularly like it&mdash;Mr. Harold Wilson's statement made in 1962 before he was converted to supporting entry into the Common Market.  It was never a full scale conversion but rather similar to the kind of conversion that has been going on in the past week in the Labour benches.  Even though he is no longer in office I do not doubt that he would have a similar kind of reservation.  But he did say in relation to planning in 1962:</P>
    <P>The plain fact is that the whole conception of the Treaty of Rome is anti-planning or at any rate it is anti-national planning.  The title and <Col N="786" /> chapter headings of part 1 of the Treaty and the whole philosophy of the relevant articles show a dedication to one principle and this is the principle of competition.  What planning is contemplated&mdash;a tremendous amount of planning is involved in the Common Market&mdash;is supranational, not national, but it is planning solely for the purpose of enhancing free competition.</P>
    <P>This is the kind of incompatibility one finds within the general EEC approach and it deserves to be highlighted.</P>
    <P>In regard to Mr. Coughlan's pamphlet, he made some statements which. while one would tend to sympathise with them, one finds they overstate the case in terms of opposition.  This is a common feature in regard to the Common Market.  You are either a red, raving, roaring pro-Common Marketeer or you are violently, viciously totally, obscurantistly and obstructively opposed to it.  You never meet those who have an in-between view.  The Common Market, as I said earlier, is rather like sex.  It arouses the strongest feelings but not necessarily the most objectivity.</P>
    <P>In that regard Mr. Coughlan said that if Britain joined the Common Market the only course that would preserve for the Irish people some control of their own affairs would be for Ireland to stay out, ally herself with the smaller European countries and retain freedom of action to diversify her trade, reduce her excessive dependence on Britain and maintain the sovereignty and economic planning powers that are so necessary for a small State if it is to defend its interest in a world dominated by great power blocs.</P>
    <P>Much as I admire my colleague, Mr. Coughlan, as a friend, I would say that perhaps overstates the case, but I think he has been correctly savage in regard to all other aspects of his pamphlet.  I took a comment from the first page and I take one from the last page in which he said&mdash;and I fully agree with him&mdash;&ldquo;And the Minister for External Affairs, Dr. Hillery, echoed the Taoiseach on television in the Dáil on 14th May, 1970, when he said: `Full participation would involve full obligations.'  We would have to act closely in political as <Col N="787" /> well as economic affairs and we would have to participate in all common action, even the defence of the new Europe.&rdquo;  We had the Little Europe of the fifties, the Afro-Europe that some people envisaged in relation to their activities in respect of the African States and we have the Common Market development and now the Minister for External Affairs has this New Europe.</P>
    <P>Mr. Coughlan was rightly critical of these over-statements of the general case in relation to the Common Market. He did point out reservations in respect of regional policy.  I accept these. I think this matter is of considerable importance.  I think he also pointed out the deficiencies of the Parliament and of the Court and the Council itself and the EEC Commission and in general his statement was a reasonable one, if somewhat unduly emotive in language.  It was a fair analysis of the case against the Common Market in so far as such a case generally exists and in so far as there is an obligation to state the general situation facing the country.  I think he performed a useful public service which did not deserve the comment by Deputy FitzGerald that the arguments were as thin as the pamphlet itself.</P>
    <P>These are my comments on the situation at present.  Tomorrow, if I may briefly summarise what I intend to do, I intend to deal with the question of agriculture, the failure of the Taoiseach to deal with the effect on Irish agriculture of the present incompatibility of the British support system for agriculture and the common agricultural policy adopted by the Common Market.  The Taoiseach's statement failed to give a proper analysis of the present situation.  I intend to deal with the sale of land, the Mansholt Plan and other aspects of agriculture on which I do not claim any particular expertise, but it is important that some attempt should be made not only by Deputy Keating but also by myself to deal with them and with regional policy.  With that I think I shall have dealt with the points that require to be dealt with.</P>
    <P>If I may sum up what I have suggested <Col N="788" /> up to date, and perhaps make an initial comment on the first point I made in regard to education, there is considerable need, on entry to EEC, to examine our whole educational programme from a long-term point of view.  I am not satisfied with the present system of primary, secondary, vocational and university education, all in their own compartments with little comprehensiveness and quite different structures and diversity in content and curriculum from the EEC.  Our future success as a nation economically and culturally, will depend on the effectiveness with which we adapt and develop our human resources. Education will have a major impact and there is urgent need ruthlessly to examine our educational system on the approach to free trade. Otherwise, our children and university students now commencing their careers will find themselves in a European setting, or alternatively an Anglo-American setting, in a world which in many respects will be utterly different from that for which a great deal of our education has been designed.</P>
    <P>There is nothing particularly sacred about any system of education but in view of the complete imbalance in our system in regard to the teaching of science and European languages I submit we are entering the Common Market with our own children unaware and untrained and uninvolved in the consequences of the freeing of trade and therefore the need for a review of our educational system is so fundamental that beyond these comments I do not propose to develop it any further this evening.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Dr. J. O'Donovan gave notice he wished to raise the question of the continued closure of the commercial banks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>Everyone realises the seriousness of the closure of the commercial banks and that in a situation of this sort nothing should be said which would exacerbate feelings in this matter, though judging by what <Col N="789" /> is happening over the last ten weeks it would be very hard to exacerbate feelings in the matter.</P>
      <P>The Irish Banks Standing Committee who, I take it, are the essential people in this case, have at no time during the many disputes and strikes which have occurred since the year 1950 pleaded that they could not pay what the officials asked for.  What they have said in effect is that they are paying their staffs adequately for the work the staffs do.  This is a problem which it is not at all easy to solve, because who is to determine the answer to this problem?  There can be no absolute standards and therefore, as Lady Wootton wrote in her book on wages in Britain: &ldquo;It tends to be the done thing.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>My recollection goes back to the time when in this city the Guinness staff were paid completely different rates from those of other people and it did not give rise to any difficulty. The general attitude of people in other walks of life was &ldquo;Lucky fellow to be in the Guinness company&rdquo;.  There seems to be an attitude nowdays, which comes from an undue importance being attached to the opinions of the Civil Service, that everyone who has the same kind of work, no matter where he does it, must be paid the same amount.  This is absolute nonsense. In life if you get the breaks you get a better salary than the other person. Even in the Civil Service, if you become attached as a young man to a Department which expands, you go up with the balloon.  Nobody need tell me that is not so because I know it to be the case.  Therefore, this is not getting down to the root of the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The insistence of the spokesmen of the banks that if they were to meet the staff demands they would be upsetting wage and salary patterns in industry is a matter of opinion.  I am not unaware that it was a major matter in relation to the recent cement strike, which went on for 21 weeks.  The bank lockout, to give it its technical name, is ten weeks in existence, and the original forecast, which was commonly heard, that it would go on until September <Col N="790" /> or October looks as if it will prove true.</P>
    <P>One of the reasons for the seriousness of the situation is that approximately 50 per cent of the staffs of the commercial banks are women or, as they used to be known in the past, lady bank clerks.  The women officials are treated completely differently from the way the men officials are treated.  In the first six years they are on the same scale but after that, especially for promotion, the women clerks are submitted to entirely different tests.  This promotion is almost automatic now for the men officials whereas some years ago all the posts were filled by people returning from the first world war, and the men who went in between the years 1925 and 1935, on leaving school at the age of 18, had a very tough period.  Younger men entering in the last ten years have, on the whole, done well in terms of promotion.  On the other hand, the women officials are submitted to extremely severe personality and intelligence tests, and this is quite unfair and unreasonable.</P>
    <P>The Minister has not got down to bringing the parties together to negotiate seriously about this dispute. So far it has only been at conciliation level, which is a preliminary level, and this is a matter about which I do know something as a result of a number of years' experience of this kind of work. How long more will this dispute go on before a serious effort to put an end to it occurs?  I remember many years ago meeting the late James Larkin in the corridor of this House when there was a serious dispute on and I asked him how it was going.  He said: &ldquo;We are about half way through&rdquo;.  I think it would be a common opinion that this dispute is only about half way through. My reason for raising this question this evening is not to argue the case, but this closure of the commercial banks is a very serious matter for the community.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That is an aspect of the case which cannot be discussed on this question.  A short time ago I ruled out for discussion a question by Deputy Garret FitzGerald on the grounds that it was too big a question <Col N="791" /> for a half hour's debate on the Adjournment.  The Deputy must keep within the ambit of the question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>All right, I shall keep within the ambit of the question. Let me say this, however: the newspapers, I am told, have shown their prejudice in this matter by refusing to publish letters about the dispute.  I wrote to them myself when the 1966 strike was on and I could not get any newspaper to publish the letter although I delivered it personally by hand to two of the three editors.  One of them said to me: &ldquo;Do you want to get both of us sacked?&rdquo;  I said that would not worry me unduly.  The other man said I was taking a crack at a certain bank director, but this was quite untrue.  There is coercive evidence that the directors of the commercial banks are, like the directors of Cement Limited, acting as agents for the Government to try to defuse the inflation in the economy.  The last time the bank strike occurred in 1966, there was a considerable addition to the credit in the economy.  This time it has been different because, for one thing, the banks closed without notice on 30th April and there are attractions for money that were not there in 1966, 11 per cent rates for moneys and that kind of thing.</P>
      <P>The closure of the banks this time is much more serious to many people than in 1966.  I think the bank officials have been justified in refusing the offer.  It does not matter what I think, but I understand the vote was 90 per cent against accepting the terms they were offered.  Of course what they were offered was a 17 per cent increase. This 17 per cent would not meet the cost of living increase which has already occurred since the bank salaries were last fixed.  This offer is to last for 21 months, to the 31st March, 1972.  One would need to be very green indeed to believe that we are at the end of the inflation which has been present in our economy for so many years.  Nobody believes that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The case made by the bank officials is that they are in competition for lodgings and the ordinary amenities of life when they come to this city with people who are better paid in the Civil <Col N="792" /> Service, the Port and Docks Board and the Electricity Supply Board and therefore they should be paid the same kind of salaries as these people are. They also plead that it takes 22 years to reach the maximum of the scale for any bank official who is not promoted. That is to say, he will be 40 years of age before he reaches his maximum, that is if he goes into the bank at the age of 18.  This means that he will be 40 before he will have caught up with a worker who qualified as a craftworker at the age of 21.  I am not to be taken as arguing as between the one group and the other, but you have to make some sort of comparison.  Scales lasting 22 years are just not sensible. On the whole, people should be remunerated for their work and they should reach the top point after ten years service because they will be as good after ten years as they are ever going to be.</P>
    <P>A normal scale would be ten years and shortening the scale would greatly improve the atmosphere between the officials of the banks and the bank directors.  I have my own views about the knowledge of banking possessed by many bank directors.  I had an interesting experience in this regard about ten years ago.  I said to a final year class in UCD &ldquo;You know there are certain bank directors and they are not too good but I am not prepared to mention their names&rdquo; and immediately from the back of the class came the names.  The names were thrown at me from the back of the class, these young people knew them.  We are not such a big community that we do not know what happens, or that if you hit this end of the desk it will not sound at the other end.  I am not to be taken as being in disagreement with the way in which this very awkward Department was managed by the Minister for External Affairs, Dr. Hillery, when he was Minister for Labour, but it may well be that it was handled too nicely, too easily and it is just possible that the present Minister may get the backlash.</P>
    <P>There was a time not so long ago when politicians settled strikes.  Deputy Paddy Burke used be a tremendous operator in that field and the <Col N="793" /> Minister will remember that too.  Then came the day when politicians were expected to keep out of this kind of dispute.  I do think, however, that the Minister, even though he may be a politician, has a different kind of duty and I would appeal to him in all sincerity, because of the implications arising from a prolonged closure of the commercial banks, to try to push through the remaining stages of this matter.  I am as well aware as the Minister is that the votes have not been fully counted yet but it is well known what the result will be.  An offer of 17 per cent at this moment which, of course, will not cover the inflation over the next 21 months, is not likely to be accepted by the people involved.  I would ask the Minister, with the help of his Department's officials, to try to settle this dispute.  The other dispute did end up after 21 weeks and let us hope that this dispute will end up after 12 weeks.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>We in the Labour Party are always very loath to ask for direct Ministerial intervention in industrial disputes but such is the degree of economic and social dislocation arising from the bank dispute&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That is an aspect we cannot discuss, as I pointed out to Deputy O'Donovan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Already the direct loss to employees has been £1 million, if I may quote the quarterly economic commentary of the ESRI.  Considerable bitterness has been created between the IBOA and the Banks Standing Committee.  Many of the staffs are abroad at the moment and some of them are sending remittances home. In view of the serious features of this dispute it would be appropriate for the Minister to exercise his good offices, bring the parties together and urge them to re-enter into direct negotiations under the auspices of the banks Joint Industrial Council under the chairmanship of that excellent head of the conciliation services, Mr. Dermot McDermott.  It is not the function of this House to do for either side what they must necessarily do for themselves by way of direct negotiations.  It would be inappropriate for me to comment <Col N="794" /> on the amounts involved, or the rejection of them, or to suggest terms, this being essentially an industrial relations matter of a trade union-employer nature, but nevertheless may we on a national basis express our concern to the Minister about the effect of this dispute on the economy, on tourism, on small incomes and so on.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, I would urge the Minister to bring the staffs and the managements together to get the matter sorted out and to get the rather shattered state of credit, loans, bills, advances and wage payments back on to an even keel as quickly as possible. I have no doubt in doing so that the newspapers will give due prominence to the duly authorised statements of the parties concerned without any inhibitions on their part.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. J. Brennan) Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. J. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The negotiations aimed at settling this dispute are being conducted within the Irish Banks Joint Industrial Council. This council is representative of the employers, the banks industrial relations committee, on the one side and the employees, the Irish Bank Officials' Association, on the other side.  The chairman of the Joint Industrial Council is a senior industrial relations officer of the Labour Court.</P>
      <P>On 30th June the banks staff relations committee prepared a set of proposals and on the 3rd July these were submitted for ballot to the members of the IBOA.  The results of this ballot are still coming in and it will be some days before the results are submitted to the JIC who will then further consider the results of the ballot.</P>
      <P>If the proposals are turned down&mdash; and although I have not had official notification about it, the Deputies inform me that they have been turned down and newspaper reports seem to have anticipated this also&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>In fairness, I might say we are going on newspaper reports also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>If they are turned down, I expect the parties would look again at their own agreed procedures for settling disputes.  I will quote the <Col N="795" /> relevant paragraph in these agreed procedures, referring to the JIC:</P>
      <P>In the event of the Council not succeeding in effecting a settlement of any dispute arising as to the terms and conditions of employment of serving officials, the matter in dispute may be referred by either side to a Tribunal consisting of a Chairman and two other members; the Chairman to be appointed by agreement between the parties or, failing agreement, by the Labour Court.  No award of the Tribunal shall be binding on either party unless it is accepted by both parties.</P>
      <P>It will be clear to the House that the dispute-settling procedures agreed between the parties have not been exhausted and it would be entirely inappropriate for me to intervene in negotiations which are in progress. Indeed, I should have preferred if this question had not been raised on the Adjournment because there is always a danger of bias being detected in a speaker's approach to the subject.  In fact, I think Deputy O'Donovan spoke entirely on the side of the employees and I am not sure that this will make it any easier for future settlement of the dispute if it has not been settled in the ballot which has taken place.</P>
      <P>If I may use that currently rather overworked phrase, I must refrain from making any reference that would exacerbate the situation.  I can only assure the House and those who have expressed concern about this and other strikes that not only am I as concerned as anyone else but I am more concerned because I consider it part of the work of my Department to ensure that industrial disputes are brought to a speedy conclusion or, in fact, that they do not occur in the first place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would not be inappropriate for me to make some reference to this belief that the Minister should get involved in every dispute at some stage &mdash;indeed many people consider he should be involved at an early stage.  I wish to assure the House that I keep myself fully informed regarding every dispute and I watch carefully the progress <Col N="796" /> of negotiations.  However, in this case the people concerned have had their own procedures built in by agreement of all concerned.  The procedures are as good as any I could devise or design for them and if they do not use them properly I can hardly be blamed. However, I think they still have all the necessary machinery at their disposal to bring this dispute to an amicable conclusion.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Labour is not a party to settling disputes as such in any legislation that has been provided for setting up the Department.  One of the points which seem to have been emphasised when the Department was set up was that it would divorce any political action from the procedure of collective bargaining and the settlement of disputes and that it would provide the necessary machinery for settling disputes in all cases.  The JIC is available to most of the large concerns in the country.  The conciliation side of the industrial relations section of the Department of Labour, the Labour Court, and more recently the Rights Commissioners are also available.</P>
    <P>Some people consider that, because something new is not introduced, what is already in existence is not good enough and they want some further institution to which they may appeal. Let us be very clear about every dispute: what is involved is the question of management trying to get off with a settlement on as easy terms as possible and the employees seeking the best possible terms they can extract.  You have a war of attrition, a hardening of attitudes, with hopes raised that as much inconvenience as possible to the public service will be caused so that pressure will be brought to bear and people will be dragged in to make a settlement at any cost.</P>
    <P>It is all very well for the Press and public commentators to blame the Minister for not getting into the dispute immediately but if this is going to be adopted as regular procedure&mdash; and it has not been recommended by the FUE or ICTU&mdash;then this whole matter of industrial relations as we know them&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is merely confirming what I have been saying.  It is not considered to be part of my job to be involved in these disputes. I have repeatedly said, as has my predecessor, that I should like to see the available machinery, which I consider is adequate, being used to the fullest extent.  Granted, when a stage was reached in the cement strike, when I considered all avenues had been explored and stalemate was reached, then something outside the ordinary machinery had to operate and at that stage I intervened.  However, the bank dispute is far from that stage but I would urge the parties concerned to use quickly the available machinery because with a hardening of attitudes and with recriminations taking place it will be all the more difficult, if not impossible, to keep negotiations going with the machinery at their disposal. If there is anything I can do to ensure that the parties do that, then I shall certainly lend my support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is as far as I am prepared to go in this sad affair of the bank strike, which I think is unique to this country. I do not want to make a case in favour of one side, as Deputy O'Donovan did, but many things have taken place in this dispute about which at some other <Col N="798" /> time I would have something to say. I do not think that this dispute, which has continued for far too long, has been conducted in a manner worthy of people one might reasonably consider as being above average intelligence and having regard to their place in society.  In the matter of the negotiations, or rather lack of negotiations, they adopted a most unbusinesslike approach and this applies to both sides.  I am afraid this dispute has done nothing to improve the image of one of our greatest institutions.  I would only hope that when this strike is ended&mdash;as end it must&mdash;both parties will have learned sufficient from it to set up within the framework of their own procedures some system of examination that will prevent their getting into this kind of situation again.</P>
    <P>I have said that it is not the job of the Department of Labour to settle strikes but it is very much our job to watch for the public interest.  Management are concerned about the successful conduct of their business, employees are concerned about getting proper terms and conditions, but the Department must watch on behalf of the public in general who also can be seriously affected by these events. This is an attitude to which I should like to give some deep consideration in relation to this particular strike and I shall not comment any further at this stage.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 11 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 9th July, 1970.</P>
