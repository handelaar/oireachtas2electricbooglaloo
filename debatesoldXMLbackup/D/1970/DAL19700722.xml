    <P>
      <Col N="1568" /> Debate resumed on the following amendment:</P>
    <P>30.  In page 29, before section 54, to insert the following section:</P>
    <P>(1)  In this section&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;the Commission&rdquo; means the Pigs and Bacon Commission.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;licence&rdquo; means a licence within the meaning of section 23 of the Pigs and Bacon Act, 1935, or a pork exporter's licence within the meaning of section 12 (2) of the Agricultural Produce (Fresh Meat) Act, 1930.</P>
    <P>(2)  The Minister for Finance, after consultation with the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, may by order do any one or more of the following:</P>
    <P>(a)  impose a levy of such amount as he thinks proper on every pig brought on to premises to which a licence relates and provide that the holder of a licence shall pay to the Commission the amount of any such levies on any pigs brought on to the premises to which the licence relates,</P>
    <P>(b)  provide for the payment of levies imposed under this section at specified intervals and in a specified manner,</P>
    <P>(c)  impose different rates of levy on pigs of different classes and provide that levies shall not be payable on pigs of a specified class or classes,</P>
    <P>(d)  authorise the Commission&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  to grant exemption, if and whenever it so thinks fit, from payment of levies under this section (either for a specified period or without limit as to time) on a specified number of pigs or on pigs of a class or classes specified under paragraph (e) of this subsection or on pigs of any category or categories specified by the Commission (by reference to such matters as it thinks fit) in the exemption, and</P>
    <P>(ii)  to revoke, if and whenever <Col N="1569" /> it so thinks fit, an exemption granted by virtue of this paragraph.</P>
    <P>(e)  specify, for the purposes of paragraphs (c) and (d) of this subsection, different classes of pigs (by reference to such matters as the Minister thinks fit),</P>
    <P>(f)  apply the provisions of section 38 and section 39 of the Pigs and Bacon (Amendment) Act, 1939, to levies payable under this section,</P>
    <P>(g)  revoke or amend an order under this section.</P>
    <P>(3)  Any levy payable pursuant to an order under this section shall be in addition to and not in substitution for any levy payable under the Pigs and Bacon Acts, 1935 to 1961.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>When progress was reported last evening we were talking about this amendment which proposes to put a levy on certain types of pigs as specified by the Minister.  In introducing this amendment, the Minister was very careful to mention nothing except smuggled pigs so that the House would appreciate the desirability of this piece of legislation which I assert was being introduced surreptitiously in order to cover all pigs in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know why there is need for this legislation.  We have reached the point where the Department of Finance <Col N="1570" /> now consider that there are grounds for suspecting that numbers of pigs have been imported illegally during the past two years.  Was there ever such a revelation in this House?  For as long as I can remember pigs were smuggled across the Border.  Therefore, it is nonsense for the Department to say that they are suspicious that this traffic is taking place.  Whenever we brought this subject up in the House we were told that there was nothing whatever to worry about but now it appears that the Department of Finance are becoming worried and are taking it on themselves to do the work of the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries as well as their own.</P>
    <P>As most people in the House will be aware, there is already in operation in this country a grading system for the purpose of dealing with undesirable types of pigs.  There are many grades and the prices paid for the different grades vary greatly.  I ask the Minister in what way this new legislation will improve the situation.  The Minister should appreciate that pigs cannot be produced to measure in the same way as can a suit of clothes, or an overcoat and that no matter how good a job has been done in pig production there are bound to be some pigs that will not be grade A specials as well as some that will not be grade A's, grade B's and so on.</P>
    <P>I have been reading details of the grading given by the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries in the June <i>Pig Bulletin,</i> 1970.  According to this publication the situation with regard to the different grades at the 30th of May, 1970, was as follows: Grade A specials, 52 per cent; Grade A's, 21 per cent; Grade A's&mdash;L&mdash;7 per cent; Grade B's, 14 per cent; Grade C's, 4 per cent; and Grade X which is this outrageous type of animal that we want to catch now with another net, 2 per cent.  In the heavier grades&mdash;upwards of 150 and 160 lbs&mdash;we had 62 per cent Grade A's&mdash;L&mdash;28 per cent B's, 9 per cent C's and, again, this outrageous animal, Grade X, 1 per cent.</P>
    <P>As I see it, we have more Grade A's and A specials and these are the only type of pigs that the Department are anxious should be produced.  Of <Col N="1571" /> course, we all desire to improve the quality as far as possible.  That is the reason for this grading system.  It is a system that has been discussed and agreed to by the various farming organisations.  However, in spite of all that, the Department of Finance want to override the arrangements that have been made between the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries and the producers and the Pigs and Bacon Commission.  They want to introduce something they can hit hard themselves. If it costs the Department of Finance £3, £4 or £5 a pig for the export of bacon from this country they will ensure they get it back from the producers. This is deplorable and it is overriding the Pigs and Bacon Commission, farming organisations and all those people who know something about producing pigs.  The Pigs and Bacon Commission say this is costing them something and they suspect that those people are not trying to produce pigs of the grade which will not cost them so much money.  They then decide to take the job over themselves because obviously the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries is not fit for his job and it is time they moved in, took this thing seriously and hit those people.</P>
    <P>Everybody in the House knows that in producing pigs you are bound to have a percentage which will not be up to the desired grade.  According to the grading I have read out for that particular week in June there are approximately 25 per cent in regard to which I believe the Department of Finance from now on will decide: &ldquo;We will give those the hammer and we will get back what we are paying in subsidy for bacon exports in this manner.&rdquo; This is deplorable.  There are various grades for which every week the prices paid by the factories are published.  I will read out the figures for last Monday. I do not have to say whether it is Clover Meats, McCarrons or O'Mearas because they are all the same.  The figures given were: Grade A Special, 303s; Grade A, 300s; Grade AL, 295s; Lean Pigs, 295s; Grade B and C, 280s. This is a typical sample.  Pigs not measuring up to those standards can be paid for at whatever price the <Col N="1572" /> factories decide to give because there is no fixed price.  If the processing factories buy unsuitable pigs they do not get paid by any Minister afterwards so those pigs have to be disposed of.  They cannot be exported. They must be sold within the country. Nobody wants to encourage the production of inferior quality pigs but there are all those safeguards.  The Department of Agriculture operate a grading system which is intended to eliminate the production of unsuitable pigs and the factories operate a price prescribed by the Department.</P>
    <P>That is not sufficient for the Department of Finance.  We are here giving a further blow to an industry which is already doing very badly.  I have a copy of the <i>Farmers' Journal</i> of 4th July, 1970.  There is a heading in big, black print: &ldquo;Big Drop in Pig Numbers&rdquo;.  Is the Minister for Finance trying to kill the industry altogether?  The article in this paper says that there is an enormous drop in the numbers of pigs delivered to the factories since May of the present year; that some of this is seasonal but there is ample evidence to indicate a fantastic drop in the number of pigs smuggled into the country and that this is due in part at least to the fact that they are now paying much more for pigs in Northern Ireland than they were heretofore, except for the heavy pig.  It is just admitting defeat, that we are not able to stop the traffic at the Border and that we are not taking the steps necessary to stop it.  We decide on this crude measure that if those pigs are coming in from the North of Ireland we will take the money back from the producers here because we will hit his pigs as well even though his may be a small percentage.  It is obvious the intention of the Department of Finance is to hit 25 per cent of the pigs produced in this country.  Further explanation is required before the Minister can justify this to this House.  I do not believe he invented the idea. I believe it was invented by somebody in the Department of Finance who knows nothing about pig production, who knows one thing only, that is how to get money from sources other than the Department of Finance.  This reminds <Col N="1573" /> me of the turnover tax which we discussed previously.  You hit everybody but get it back in the crudest manner possible.  People should be put on the Border to stop the traffic there.</P>
    <P>We all agree the farmers of this country are doing a good job in improving standards.  There is no levy imposed on the bacon processor or on the curer who produces a deplorable cure.  Everybody knows that you can buy bacon which nobody could eat because it is not properly cured.  There is no way of fining the curer.  The only thing you can do is put him out of business.  I fought for years on this and I do not know if anything has been done about it.  Nobody wants to close down bacon curers because of the unemployment which will be created and therefore nothing is ever done.  Immediately the producer goes off the rails he will be hit.  Is there any other place where less than a top quality product can be hit in this way by a levy?  This must be unique.  I ask Deputies to reject this amendment out of hand.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to get some information from the Minister.  The wording of the section as it is in the Bill is either most unfortunate or is intended to do something with which I could not agree.  Would the Minister let us know exactly what is intended? I certainly agree with most of what Deputy Mark Clinton said last night and this morning although there are some things I would not agree with. He said if people in factories are producing a substandard product every effort is made to prevent the continuance of the manufacture of that product and to improve it so that only first class material is produced.  As far as pigs are concerned it is absolutely impossible in many cases to produce the first class animal which is required.  Sometimes it is the feeding and sometimes the breeding which is the cause of this.  It may turn out that a particular type of animal is produced. Is it the idea that the substandard pig is to be levied or is it the suggestion that pig smuggling, no matter what standard the animals are, is respected, that the pigs going into the factories are smuggled and are to <Col N="1574" /> be levied?  I am not clear about this at the present time.  I live near enough to the Border to know how this pig smuggling racket works.  Some people find it extraordinary that it should continue but in fact it is simply a matter of most of the pigs being walked across the Border.  They are in the Six Counties and in two minutes they are in the Republic.  If pigs start running they can be scattered all over the place. It is quite a usual thing to see an innocent looking man walking along trying to put pigs back across the Border when he sees a car coming. The pigs have broken across and there is nothing you can do about it except put them back.  As soon as the car goes off he proceeds to rush them as quickly as he can into somebody else's field until eventually they are taken away.  I know the arrangement usually made is that there are two sections involved. If the man on the far side of the Border loses them, he carries the loss.  If they are brought across the Border and seized in the Republic, the man in the Republic loses them; he carries the loss.  That is the racket.  But they are doing quite well with the pigs they get across.</P>
      <P>I do not agree with Deputy Clinton that smuggled pigs saved our market. We require the market and the pigs, but the amount the taxpayer has to pay is so high that there is really no credit.  What we gain on the swings we lose on the roundabouts.  Would the Minister let us know what exactly is intended because I believe we may misunderstand the intention?  If my interpretation is correct I could not possibly support this amendment.  The Minister may be able to explain it in such a way as to change my mind.</P>

      <P>I have tried to follow this Bill closely on the different Stages. I cannot really understand how pigs have got into the Finance Bill.  Perhaps the Minister would indicate the amount the levy is likely to yield.  Some estimate must have been made.  I appreciate the points made by Deputy Clinton and others.  There is an onus on the Minister to justify the introduction of pigs into the Finance Bill and the circumstances in which this amendment was introduced because this is <Col N="1575" /> not a matter that can be regarded as relevant to the Finance Bill in the ordinary way.</P>

      <P>The Minister was less than honest last night when he introduced this amendment.  He stated its purpose was to catch smuggled pigs. One cannot identify smuggled pigs. They do not go into the bacon factory wearing a sash or a Union Jack.  If the Minister, or his colleague, the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, is serious about identifying smuggled pigs he should arrange with his counterpart in the Six Counties to have pigs marked in the Six Counties so that, if they do enter the Republic, they can be easily identified.  The Minister admitted last night that it was not easy to identify pigs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know why the Minister has to introduce an amendment concerning levies because, already in the Pigs and Bacon Acts, 1935 to 1963, levies are being collected from bacon factories in respect of pigs.  I should like the Minister to explain why it is necessary now to introduce amending legislation under a different Act for yet another levy. What is the purpose of this levy?  Why not amend the Pigs and Bacon Acts thereby keeping the levy in its proper place, so to speak?</P>
      <P>I should also like the Minister to explain the use to which the revenue from these levies will be put.  I should hope it would be earmarked for the development of the pigs and bacon industry or the improvement of the Pigs and Bacon Commission.  In subsection (4) this is not specified.  The subsection states:</P>
      <P>All moneys received by the Commission in respect of levies under this section shall be paid into or disposed of for the benefit of the Exchequer in accordance with the directions of the Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>This leads me to believe that the levy is not designed to offset subsidies in respect of bacon exports.  It is a very discriminatory amendment in so far as subsection (2) (a) leaves it to the Minister, after consultation with the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, to impose different types of levies on different licensees.  The House is entitled, I think, to a very full explanation as to what is intended under subsections (a) and (c).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Clinton, I think, said that these levies would be on pigs other than export pigs.  That is not stated in the amendment and the Minister should, therefore, make it quite clear to the House what is, in fact, intended. Is it intended to put a levy on pigs sold on the home market thereby making bacon and pork dearer for consumers here?  If that is the intention it is a very bad policy.  Is it intended to recoup the export subsidy?  This seems <Col N="1577" /> to be some what ridiculous.  A report compiled by the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries states that the bacon industry is, in fact, only working at 50 per cent capacity.  What point is there then in increasing levies on such an industry?  Is it the intention to ruin the industry altogether?  I think it must be because in the Budget statement it was stated that the guaranteed price for grade A pigs was to go up by 10s per cwt.  In point of fact, the actual price to the farmers was not increased by that amount.  It was codology to say the guaranteed price was to go up by 10s per cwt.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand why in subsection (2) (d) the Minister for Finance may authorise the commission to grant exemption or to revoke.  I should like to know why the Minister does not retain that right himself.  I feel that different factories can be picked for exemption.  Is this intended? Is it intended to have some types of factories only paid a levy?  I do not see how this amendment fits in with our application to the EEC.  We will not be able to subsidise our exports of pork and bacon if we go into the EEC so I do not see why we are complicating an industry where, in a year's time, we may have to abolish all subsidies.  The House is entitled to a very clear explanation from the Minister of the reason for this amendment &mdash;what is intended; what types of pigs and what factories will be affected.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will need to provide some very concrete evidence as to how what is effectively a levy on low-quality pigs can deal with the importation of pigs.  There does not seem to be a link between the two.  This question of a penal levy on low quality may be setting a dangerous precedent. Is there any precedent in financial legislation for this sort of penal clause in relation to other commodities?  It seems rather a bad way of ensuring high quality by providing this sort of penal approach.  I should like some information from the Minister on precedents for this type of thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said when introducing this amendment, it is intended to deal with the illegal importation of pigs.  It has nothing whatever to do <Col N="1578" /> with inducing better quality in pigs.  It has nothing whatever to do with the gaining of revenue.  It is designed solely to enable us to deal with the problem of smuggling.  We have had numerous complaints about smuggling in this House and outside.  Nobody has come up with any foolproof method of preventing this smuggling.  It is so self-evident that, if this levy were to apply only to smuggled pigs, we would not have a problem&mdash;I did not expand on this last night: obviously, we would know which were smuggled pigs and we would have no problem.  This is an attempt to deal with this problem.  Of course, it is not a foolproof, ideal method.  I certainly would not claim that.  However, it is an effort to control the smuggling of pigs and it is not designed to do any other thing.  It has nothing to do with agricultural policy nor is it intended to operate as a form of revenue-gatherer for the Exchequer. It is not expected that it will do so. The main thing it is intended to do is to remove the incentive which at present exists for the smuggling of pigs.</P>
      <P>The pigs which are smuggled are in general either the very light or the very heavy type of pig.  Therefore, it is anticipated that the levy would be applied to those classes of pigs.  As has been pointed out, the Pigs and Bacon Commission already collect a levy on pigs in discharge of their functions under the Pigs and Bacon Act.  The levy under that Act is a fixed levy for all pigs and all classes of pigs.  There are no powers to vary that rate of levy in relation to different classes of pigs. Therefore, that levy is not relevant in so far as what we are trying to do here is concerned.  The point is that a levy is already operated.  In order to comply with the requirements of the Pigs and Bacon Act, licence holders are required to count, weigh and, in the case of bacon pigs within specified weight ranges, to grade carcases of pigs brought on to their premises.  This operation is carried out under the supervision either of an officer of the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries or of the Pigs and Bacon Commission.  Records are kept and are available for inspection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While an order under this proposed section would specify different classes <Col N="1579" /> of pigs, by reference to such matters as the Minister thinks fit, in practical terms the specification would be related as far as possible to particulars which are already available in the factory.  For example, pigs could be classified by weight or by grade, or both, in such a way as to create a minimum of disturbance of existing procedures.  The number of pigs likely to be affected would depend on the classes of pigs specified in the order, if such an order were made.</P>
    <P>At the present time, the incentives to smuggle pigs are confined to very light and very heavy pigs.  If a levy were confined to those classes only, it is unlikely that more than approximately 10 per cent of all pigs slaughtered would be subject to a levy. Since this percentage is almost certain to include most of the smuggled pigs, the percentage of domestically-produced pigs which might be affected would be appreciably lower than that.</P>
    <P>Any adverse effects on our own producers are avoidable by them if they can sell their pigs in a condition which would qualify for classes where the levy did not apply.  On the whole, the lowering of prices for a small number of certain classes of pigs has to be balanced against the very heavy cost in subsidies to pig producers and taxpayers if smuggling is continued. Farmers have been sufficiently concerned about this problem of pig smuggling that, over several months last winter, they organised Border patrols to try to intercept the smugglers. They were not successful, as we know. This, and certain things said in the debate, underline the difficulties of the problem.</P>
    <P>This is an approach to the problem which it is thought would be the most effective way open to us.  From the description of the operation given by Deputy Tully, I think it will be seen that it is not solvable simply by manpower. It is true also that, to the extent that we can reduce the incentives for smuggling pigs&mdash;and therefore reduce the number of pigs smuggled&mdash; there will be better opportunities for increasing our own pig output and enabling us to avail of the market opportunities which are being developed <Col N="1580" /> by the Pigs and Bacon Commission.</P>
    <P>Deputy Clinton, when speaking about this&mdash;particularly last night&mdash; seemed to consider that the powers given in his amendment are wide open and would lead to all sorts of abuses. I would point out that, in the amendment as drafted, the Minister for Finance can act under this section only by way of making an Order following consultation with the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries and that order will be laid before the House and may be challenged by Deputies. What would be proposed to be done would be specified in the order and that order is not intended to apply to all pigs.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) (c) provides for the imposition of different rates of levy on pigs of different classes provided that levies shall not be payable on pigs on a specified class or classes.  As I have said, what is intended is to apply a levy only to such classes as may be likely to contain significant numbers of smuggled pigs.  The discretion of the Pigs and Bacon Commission to exempt certain pigs within a class from the levy will have to be authorised by order and, to do that, the Minister for Finance will have to be satisfied that it is operating in a fair manner.  The Minister will have powers to revoke or amend an order relating to the commission's authority to exempt pigs from the levy.  Primarily what is intended there is that, where there are home produced pigs coming within the terms of the class to which the levy applies which can be clearly shown to be home produced pigs and not smuggled, they would be exempt where this can be clearly demonstrated.  The object is to reduce to the minimum the impact of such levies on the home producers.</P>
    <P>I want to repeat that this provision has nothing whatever to do with agricultural policy or with encouraging the production of certain classes of pigs or discouraging other classes, nor has it anything to do with the raising of revenue.  It is designed solely to assist in dealing with the problem of the illegal importation of pigs.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> The Minister has told us time and <Col N="1581" /> again since this discussion started that the object of this section is to eliminate or to prevent the smuggling of pigs from the Six Counties into the Republic.  He has not told us, so far as I am aware, what the extent of that smuggling problem is.  He has not told us what is involved, numerically speaking or in cost to the State.  This appears to me to be a case of lifting a sledgehammer to kill a fly.  Indeed, for years that policy has been creeping into many Bills introduced in this House. The tendency seems to be to adopt all too drastic measures to deal with what are comparatively small problems.</P>
      <P>As I see this, we are imposing a levy on certain types of pigs, and that levy will be paid either by the producer or the consumer.  Within the past few weeks I had occasion in this House to raise the question of the cost of feedingstuffs to pig producers.  I satisfied myself, at any rate, and I think many others, that the cost of pig feeding rations had gone up very considerably between September, 1969, and the present time and that, as a result, the profits from pig producing and pig fattening had gone down.  I demonstrated clearly that the cost of one popular brand of pig feeding ration had gone up by as much as £4 per ton over that period and that the cost of other types of pig rations had gone up proportionately.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries did not accept what I said, of course.  As a matter of fact, he was less than gracious about the whole thing. Nevertheless I am satisfied, and the people who briefed me are satisfied, that the profit to be gained from pigs has gone down considerably and that many people are remaining in pigs because they have invested a good deal of capital in piggeries and that sort of thing and are hoping for better times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I see it, this proposal will tend further to reduce the profit on pigs. Either that or it will put up the price to the consumer.  It is bound to do one or the other.  The Minister should tell us what he believes to be involved in pig smuggling.  He should tell us how many pigs he believes are being smuggled into the State and what that is costing the taxpayer.  As I say, this <Col N="1582" /> will further reduce the profit on pigs. At first I thought the section gave the Minister power to impose this levy on pigs suspected of being smuggled.  I do not know whether that is so, but I do not think it is.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> I probably know as much about pigs as Deputy Tully or the Minister.  I believe that the numbers being illegally imported could be substantially reduced. The Minister says this will involve a total of 10 per cent of the pigs delivered to the factories and that that will cover the whole country from Tralee to Donegal.  He says that this 10 per cent includes the over-fat or under-weight pigs in the whole country and that it will include the number of smuggled pigs.  So, it appears to me that the percentage of smuggled pigs must be small, on the Minister's figure. If, instead of introducing this mallet to deal with everybody and everything, the Minister were to strengthen the forces at his disposal for the prevention <Col N="1583" /> of smuggling and, in that way, further reduce the number of pigs being illegally imported, he would then, in my respectful opinion, have on his hands a problem of so insignificant proportions that it would not justify this section.</P>
      <P>I certainly urge on the Minister that before he goes on with this&mdash;he has confined himself now to 10 per cent; this section will cover 10 per cent including home produced pigs&mdash;to tell the House what is the make-up of that 10 per cent.  What percentage of it applies to home produced pigs legitimately bred and fattened here and what percentage relates to illegally imported pigs?</P>

      <P>Earlier I asked the Minister if he would explain certain things and I am afraid he has not explained them to my satisfaction.  I fail to see the Minister's logic.  If I understand him correctly he said that only very fat or very lean pigs are smuggled and that this levy would be confined to those two classes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot understand why if we know so much about the type of pig that is smuggled we are unable to stop the smuggling.  I agree pigs do not come across the Border either with the Union Jack or waving a Tricolour but there is something extraordinary about this.  In fairness to the Minister I think he would never have attempted to put this section into a Finance Bill and I suggest to him that he will not lose face, in view of the fact that it is not his brainchild, if he withdraws the section and tries to get it into some legislation dealing with agriculture.  It will not work here.  Not alone is it an impossible section, as he has described it here, but it is absolutely impossible to administer.  While it is all right for the Minister to say that at present 10 per cent would represent the type of pigs he wants to cover, there are periods of the year when the percentage will be naturally very much higher.  Again, how does he propose to tell the people in Cork or in Galway <Col N="1584" /> or in the south or west of Ireland that they are having a levy imposed on their pigs because they are approximately the same weight as the pigs usually smuggled?  Would the Minister consider that aspect of it and would he not agree that the whole proposal is ridiculous?</P>
      <P>I shall not start an argument with Deputy Fitzpatrick about how the pigs come in but from personal knowledge I know that pigs have been imported in very large numbers from time to time.</P>

If he does not do that, I do not know what other parties will do but we shall have to vote against the section because it cannot be allowed to go through the House unchallenged. It is unfair no matter what way you look at it.  The whole idea was the brainchild of somebody who did not understand what he was trying to do.

Does the Minister appreciate that when this smuggling was known to be taking place in a big way at one stage some of us suggested in the House that the traffic might even reach a couple of thousand pigs each week?  We were laughed to scorn by the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Agriculture at the time.  On my calculation, 10 per cent of the total pigs in this country is in the region of 200,000 pigs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not a small number.  The Minister has not given us his estimate of the number of smuggled pigs but we can take it that at least half of those will be pigs produced in this country by Irish producers. I should like the Minister to explain why the present grading system has failed.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Failed to catch the heavy pig.  The Minister has said that this is designed purely to deal with the illegal importation of fat pigs.  In the next breath he said that nobody can identify a smuggled pig, that he does not wear a Union Jack.  We agree with that: if we could identify them there should be provision to confiscate them immediately but because we cannot identify them the innocent must suffer with the guilty, so to speak.</P>
      <P>Somebody at my elbow says that the only thing is for Irish pigs to have a birth certificate from now on.  We are doing this at a time when the industry is failing and when we have reports, to which I have referred, in the <i>Farmers' Journal</i> saying that something must really be done for the pig industry. But what we are doing is imposing a further levy on pigs that do not reach a certain grade.  I think I should quote further from this <i>Farmers' Journal</i> report:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Equally serious, Government support for the industry is not keeping pace either with the increasing cost of meal.  Since last September meal prices have jumped £3 10s to £4 a ton.  This adds 25s to 26s extra <Col N="1586" /> to the cost of turning out a pig.  To compensate, the Government gave 10s a cwt increase last October on As and Specials.  Another 10s was not passed on.  Instead, in June an extra 5s 6d per cwt was given on Extra Selected, 4s 6d on Grade As. All added up, this brings the increase since last August on top grades to approximately 15s a cwt or just under £1 a pig.  Now, balance that against 25s to 26s a pig.  Any wonder pig numbers failed to increase!</P>
    <P>The farmers are complaining; the <i>Farmers' Journal</i> is complaining that pig numbers are not increasing, that cow numbers are not increasing, and we want to try to maintain a foothold in the British market.  Now, we are deciding to bring in the special levy and the Minister, I assume&mdash;it is not specified&mdash;is to specify the different classes that are to be hit by this special levy.  This is a new role for a Minister for Finance if he is to specify the class of pig that does not measure up to his idea of what is a good pig.</P>
    <P>It is all confusion.  This is not the way to tackle the smuggling that has been going on for years.  I think the way to tackle it is through greater co-operation with the Ministry in the North of Ireland; go and talk to them and see how this problem can jointly be dealt with.  You will certainly not deal with it by putting a further impost on our producers who say they are already getting less than they were getting six or 12 months ago.  This is the way to kill the industry.  It is the way to increase prices to the consumers here because it is only inferior bacon that the consumer here is getting.  We export everything that is Grade A and Grade A Special.  The consumer must eat the lower grade bacon and he must pay the levy, not the curer.  The way it is put here anybody would get the impression that it was the curer who would pay this levy out of his own pocket.  That is very foolish because all these costs are passed on to the consumer.  It will be either the pig producer or the consumer who will have to pay it.  No farmer or producer can produce pigs made to measure.  There will always be a percentage of pigs that will come into the grades and <Col N="1587" /> categories the Minister says he wants to hit by this new section in the Bill. If the Minister is really sensible about this Bill at all, he will withdraw this provision and agree from what everybody has to say here that it is an unwise way to attempt to deal with a different problem altogether.  This is not the way to deal with a smuggling problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, would recommend the Minister to withdraw this amendment.  It is an ill-advised and unnecessary piece of legislation and a stupid way to deal with the problem the Minister says he wants to deal with. I was surprised to hear the Minister say that it was largely light pigs or heavy pigs that have been smuggled.  I understand that Grade A weight pigs have come in just as much as the light pigs or heavy pigs, and I believe his information is wrong in this respect.  If the levy is to be imposed on light pigs and heavy pigs, this will complicate no end the day-to-day workings in factories.  Factories will now have to go through the commission, apparently, to find out if Johnny Murphy's pigs are liable to levy or if Jack Smith's pigs are supposed to have been smuggled.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>What I have said is that the order will specify that the levy will apply to certain classes.  They could be easily identified in any category because they are already identifying them.  There is provision <Col N="1588" /> also for the exemption from the levy of pigs coming within the specified class.  I indicated that would operate only where it could be shown conclusively that the pigs concerned were home-produced pigs.  There are certain circumstances in which this could be shown but it would not be a question of people having to come along and prove it.  It would be specified in the order how they could be exempted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I stand over what I said.  It will be very awkward for factories to find out who is exempt from this levy.  It is wrong to impose a levy on light pigs and heavy pigs. Either impose a levy of 10 per cent globally or do not impose it at all. Another factor which has not been mentioned is the destination of these smuggled pigs.  Are they going to factories near the Border?  I doubt very much if they are going to factories in the southern and western parts of the Republic?  It is a very long journey. Why then impose a levy on those factories?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another point on which I should like the Minister to give us his opinion.  Sheep imported from the North of Ireland are punched in the ear.  Would it not be possible to have pigs punched in the ear in the North of Ireland with the agreement of the Northern Ireland Minister for Agriculture? This would be a simple thing to do.  The argument might be made that some pigs fight and their ears are eaten off, but the number affected are so infinitesimal that one could forget about them.  This suggestion, if adopted, <Col N="1589" /> would get nearer to the solution of the problem, and it would eliminate the imposition of a levy on factories in an industry which is not thriving, in which the population of pigs is falling and which is not working to capacity.  Why make things awkward in the factory, resulting in consumers and producers having to pay a certain amount of this levy?  I would recommend to the Minister the withdrawal of this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> The more one considers this proposal the more absurd it becomes.  It is clear now from the Minister's own case that he concedes that the proposed levy will not hit all smuggled pigs.  He said that, by and large, smuggled pigs are either light or heavy.  Therefore, even when this becomes law and the regulations are made it will still be possible to smuggle pigs into this country and escape the levy.  Therefore, his proposal is not foolproof and that is another argument why he should drop this provision and do as I say: strengthen the preventive forces on the Border and reduce the problem to insignificant proportions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I spoke last I referred to the fact that pig production in this country was becoming less profitable, that I had made that case on an Adjournment debate some time ago and that this proposal will reduce the profits still further.  When I made that case before I quoted the figures showing that the price of pig feeding had gone up by £4 a ton between September, 1969, and June of this year. The Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries would not agree with me and he quoted two extracts from the <i>Farmers' Journal</i> which he alleged showed that everything in the garden was lovely, that people were rushing into pig production, that there were more sows in the country and all the rest of it.  I should like to have heard Deputy Clinton putting on the record of this House an extract from the <i>Farmers' Journal</i> of 4th July, 1970, which corroborated every word I said in the Adjournment debate and which proved that the cost of pig rations is going up out of proportion to the increase in the price of bacon, that the <Col N="1590" /> net result is that the profit to farmers is falling, that the tendency is for them to get out of pig production, and that there are fewer pigs being delivered to factories this year than there were last year.</P>
    <P>The same article suggests that fewer pigs are being smuggled from the Six Counties into the Republic this year than last year.  I understood the Minister to say, and I should like to have this clarified, that he has some proposal in mind for incorporation in the regulations under which pig A of a given weight will be subject to the levy and pig B of the same weight may be exempt from the levy because it will come within a specified class.  I should be glad if the Minister would let us know what exactly he has in mind. There is no problem about applying the levy to pigs of a certain weight but it is a little bit beyond me to understand how the Minister is going to apply this levy to pig A of a given weight and to exempt pig B of the same weight, unless it is going to be done on some sort of hit and miss basis.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that this proposal has nothing to do with agricultural policy&mdash;it is quite clear that it has not &mdash;and that it has nothing to do with the levying of revenue for the State.  I also concede that.  He says that it is simply designed to prevent pig smuggling. It has all the appearances of such a proposal, a blanket proposal of the Revenue Commissioners to deal with a comparatively small problem of pig smuggling with a total disregard for its effects on agricultural policy, on pig production, on the profits of pigs or on the cost of living.  I do not subscribe at all to the idea that pig smuggling is a very easy business.  Before the pigs are walked across the Border they have to be conveyed to the Border and as far as I am aware there is no bacon factory within several miles of the Border.  The Minister may take it from me that the pigs are not marched through fields from the Border to factories.  They are put into lorries or put into vans and brought there.  It should be possible by strengthening the anti-smuggling brigade to deal with this problem.</P>
    <P>There is no point in the Minister <Col N="1591" /> coming in here and saying: &ldquo;I am here as Minister for Finance; I am dealing with the revenue laws and with the protection of the revenue and I have no concern as Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries.&rdquo;  He should say whether he thinks the effect of this levy will be further to reduce the profits on pigs.  He should tell the House how he is going to levy pig A and exempt pig B of the same weight.  He should tell the House what orthodox steps he has taken in recent years to eliminate pig smuggling which have failed.  He should tell the House whether the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries approves of this section, whether there has been prior consultation with him or whether the consultation referred to in the proposed section is an after-thought and whether it is going to be post-consultation.</P>
    <P>Pig smuggling, if it is a problem, has been going on for a long time.  Why was this section not put into the original Finance Bill which was drafted some time ago?  Why has it come along now as an after-thought to deal with this problem?  These are questions which we, representing rural Ireland, are entitled to put to the Minister and which he should answer.  We have not heard any of the Fianna Fáil rural Deputies expressing their views.  I wonder do they approve of it.  They will come in and vote, of course, because the Minister puts on the Whip but I do not believe that they could possibly subscribe to an absurd piece of legislation like this, that is going to hit without any regard, as the Minister says, to agricultural policy, quite a&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> It seems to me to be the same thing. It seems to me that it has not been taken into consideration.  It is a piece of legislation which will hit a comparatively wide section of the pig producing <Col N="1592" /> population from one end of the country to the other in order to deal with what as far as we know is an insignificant problem and which, according to the <i>Farmers' Journal</i>, which the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries was so proud to quote to me, is on the decline instead of on the increase.  It is stated there in black and white that the amount of smuggling this year is less than it was last year because prices have increased in the north.  We are introducing this absurd method of dealing with this declining problem and if the Minister consults seriously with members of his own party he will scrap it.  It may be that these regulations may never be made but, nevertheless, it is a dangerous piece of legislation to put on the Statute Book.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say that I, too, am shocked by this amendment to the Finance Bill the import of which we did not fully realise until last night.  I come from a constituency in which not many pigs are reared but I am contiguous to Monaghan and Cavan where they rear many pigs and I know a good deal about the pig trade.  I am involved in the production of pig meal.  For these reasons I have many contacts with the trade.  I know how pigs are sold, why certain pigs make better money than grading would give them if they went to the factories and I know that this is an advantage to the farmer.  Over the past ten years a continuous effort has been made to create a situation whereby all pigs would be graded.  The advantage to the farmer of having pigs which did not go to the factory but were used for pork was that the pigs for pork, of necessity, for their flavour and tenderness, needed more fat.  While there was a necessity for grading because of the very much larger number of pigs that went for bacon&mdash;it must be graded because too much fat is not wanted&mdash;than the number that went for pork there was, at the same time, a nice trade for pork pigs for which the price available was as high as if the pigs had been of the higher grade for bacon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know the Pigs and Bacon Commission have been trying to get their <Col N="1593" /> hands on this pork trade because they considered it was not desirable that the farmer could get such a good price for a pig that was not up to grade. They want to help the farmer by punishing him.  Perhaps it might have meant that they could have given, say, 6d a cwt. more for all the bacon pigs if they got their hands on the pork pigs and thereby control the price paid to the farmer.  It is a fact that a farmer could get from a pig dealer as good a price for a well-fleshed porker pig as he would obtain for a Grade A pig that was sent to the factory.</P>
    <P>This is an advantage for the farmer and I do not want it taken away from him.  To suggest that pig smuggling will be stopped by means of this legislation is utterly ridiculous and quite dishonest.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>

      <P>Yes.  Let us suppose that 100 pigs were taken across the Border last night and that 80 were pigs that would grade for bacon pigs and 20 would not grade because they were too fat.  The 80 pigs will be sent in the normal way to the factory and will grade as if they had been reared by any farmer in this part of the country. According to the Minister, the other 20 pigs will be subject to levy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister states that the levy will be in relation to pigs received at bacon factories.  Let us suppose that I rear ten pigs, eight that will grade and two that will not grade, and I send the pigs to the Dundalk bacon factory.  The two fat pigs I have reared on my farm will not be subject to the levy?</P>

Will I be further punished, notwithstanding the fact that I reared the two pigs on my farm, if regulations are made under this legislation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>According to the Deputy's version, the answer would be yes.  I have said they could be subject to a levy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us take the example of Cork, to which area it is most unlikely any smuggled pigs will be sent.  If Deputy Creed or perhaps Deputy Crowley from the Minister's party&mdash;although I find it difficult to visualise Deputy Crowley engaged in pig-rearing&mdash;deliver pigs reared on their farm but which did not make the grade to their local bacon factory, will they be penalised on the basis that the pigs might have been smuggled across the Border?  I need hardly add that everybody knows that the possibility of smuggled pigs being sent to Cork is highly unlikely, particularly in view of the fact that there are many bacon <Col N="1595" /> factories from Cavan to Dublin to which smuggled pigs could be sent.  We have the Minister's admission that if one of the Cork Deputies, for instance, rears ten pigs, two of which did not grade, if the pigs are offered to the local factory according to this regulation they could be subject to a further levy.</P>
      <P>The basis of pig grading at the moment is absolutely penal; a price is offered for the Grade A special pig in excess of the economic price and a lesser price is paid for the Grade X than the economic price.  Therefore, the farmer who has several pigs that do not grade is very severely penalised in the name of trying to stop pig smuggling.  This is not the way in which to stop the smuggling.  I understand it is necessary that the pigs be caught when they are actually crossing the Border and that it is not enough merely to see the pigs in lorries some miles away from the Border.  It is necessary that the law be changed in another way to cope with this problem, but it should not be done on the basis that the unfortunate farmer will be penalised.  We should deal with each problem as it arises.  However, the method proposed by the Minister would affect farmers' income.  It is wrong and it will not have any effect in three-quarters of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If smuggled pigs are to be used in the bacon factories, unless an exceptionally high price is offered in Waterford, Cork and Limerick factories, it is highly unlikely that the smuggled pigs will be sent to the south.  Therefore, the traditional pig-feeding areas in the Republic, apart from Monaghan and Cavan, will be penalised.  The other areas will also suffer and the farmers there are most indignant about pig smuggling.  They have had vigilantes on the road in an effort to stop the smuggling and have passed resolutions about it at National Farmers Association meetings and at meetings of committees of agriculture.  The method to be employed is hardly one of taking out the cane to the unfortunate farmer who may not succeed in having all his pigs in the Grade A category.  We have <Col N="1596" /> had the Minister's admission that, if a farmer rears pigs and a percentage of them are not in the higher grade category, under the regulations now proposed the farmer could suffer a further penal levy.  I do not believe that this legislation should be passed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>In his contribution Deputy Donegan referred to a farmer who might have, say, two out of ten pigs not eligible for the higher grade category.  I am more worried about a farmer who might have only a small number of pigs but who is unfortunate enough to have them graded as fat pigs.  The Minister should remember that generally farmers are not the people who actually smuggle the pigs. The people who are engaged in smuggling pigs are involved in smuggling many other items across the Border.  It is an industry with them and if you speak to them about it they will tell you so.  The second point is that farmers do not like to fill up forms; therefore, surely it would be much better if some system of registration was introduced.  A farmer could register the number of pigs he had in a litter, the number of pigs he had bought and the number he had sold to the factory.  In this way it might be possible to catch the people who really do smuggle.  This section is not an effort to catch a person who is smuggling; it is like the fisherman with the small mesh net who brings in everything in front of him.  If they are within certain grades they will be caught and they will be penalised.  It cannot be justified in any circumstances.  I would ask the Minister to withdraw the section.  The Minister, having had another look at it, may find that he can deal with the matter in a better way in the Seanad.  I would ask him not to put in a section like this which cannot be justified under any heading.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BillyFox" hpid="Mr. Fox Mr. Fox">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fox</NameTxt>
      <P>As a Deputy representing a traditional pig-producing county and as a small pig producer, I agree with the comments made by my colleagues on this side of the House.  If the Minister proposes to go ahead with these amendments and enforce them he will kill pig production in the Border <Col N="1597" /> counties.  I should like the Minister to inform the House to which factories he intends to apply this levy.  There are two factories in the county which I have the pleasure to represent and I feel reasonably confident in saying that very few smuggled pigs enter either of those factories, despite the fact that they are within yards of the Border.  A considerable number of smuggled pigs enter factories miles and miles from the Border.  I am sure the Minister knows the factories to which I refer.</P>
      <P>If this section becomes law it is only reasonable to assume that the people who will be most affected by it are the pig producers in the Border counties. Deputy Donegan has given an example of pigs that will not grade and the position with regard to similar pigs in Cork.  The Minister should remember that the Border counties are probably the poorer counties of the State.  Pig production plays an important role in the income of many small farmers in counties like Monaghan and Cavan.  If the commission are allowed to pick individual pigs it will not be very long before the producers stop producing pigs.  Despite the fact that a few people who are not farmers have started up large piggeries the pig population in Monaghan has declined.  Many of the traditional producers have found it an uneconomic proposition.  If this section is allowed to operate they will be forced, through no fault of their own, to cease pig production.</P>

      <P>It is only reasonable to assume that, if this section is allowed to operate, it will operate to a greater extent against pig producers in Border counties than it will in the south of Ireland.  If a farmer puts in a batch of pigs half of which grade and half of which do not grade, will it be assumed that the half which do not grade came from Northern Ireland?  A constituent of mine has a piggery right on the Border.  He is not involved in smuggling, but if he puts 50 pigs into the factory, 40 of them grade and ten do not, will it be assumed that he smuggled those ten pigs?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fox</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a half a dozen people from the south of Ireland engaged in this practice.  If the pig producer in Monaghan is compelled to pay for what these half dozen people are doing, it is no fault of his that they are doing it.  The pig producers in Monaghan and Louth put vigilantes on the Border.  They were able to prove where these pigs were going, as were the Customs people.  I do not believe it is fair that the pig producer in Monaghan, Cavan, Louth or Donegal, if he has five pigs falling within that category or weight or measurement, should be penalised because Mr. X is smuggling pigs to a bacon factory 50 miles from where he lives or from where his pigs are being slaughtered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like if the Minister would further enlighten us on how he proposes to select these five pigs which fall within this weight and measurement category.  There never was a weight range yet with a line under a certain measurement but a pig producer <Col N="1601" /> would have a number of pigs falling within that weight and measurement, through no fault of his own.  It is very unfair that, because somebody else is smuggling pigs, this man who has pigs of that weight and measurement should be penalised.  It is another way of forcing him out of pig production.  I do not propose to say much more.  I am convinced at this stage that this is a deliberate attempt to catch out not alone smuggled pigs but to compel the traditional producers, of the Border counties especially, who happen to have a long tradition in pig production, to go out of business.  It is a deliberate attempt to force them out of a livelihood which provided them with many a pound in years past.</P>

So far as I can see from an examination of the details of miscellaneous revenue last year there is no such precedent.  That does not say it should not happen.

      <P>Normally when boards of this sort make levies, such as the Racing Board or Bord na gCon, they collect the money and they do not pay it over to the Exchequer.  So far as I can make out from account No. 13, which is the appropriate finance account for 1968-69, there is no precedent of any sort for the collection to be paid through the Pigs and Bacon Commission to the Exchequer.  There is no precedent of any sort for this kind of thing.  That does not prove it it wrong.  I am extremely doubtful about it.  Provision is made in subsection (4) for all the moneys received by the commission to be paid into a fund to the benefit of the Exchequer in accordance with the directions of the Minister for Finance&mdash;the time honoured phrase.  Without that phrase it would not fit.  Not even the most careless Dáil would let it pass without that phrase.  The Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Finance would object also.  They would say that they could not go that far, if that phrase had been left out, and the Pigs and Bacon Commission had been allowed to keep the money.  This suggests beyond question that this is a peculiar section to put into a Finance Bill.  Apart from any semblance of logic, provisions about levying pigs at the Border and in bacon factories are scarcely provisions connected with finance.  We have been told they are not provisions connected with finance but connected with the prevention of smuggling of pigs.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> Is there any precedent for this method of dealing with smuggling?  Is there any precedent in the Customs code to justify this section?  We are told by the Minister that the object of this section is to deal with the illegal importation of pigs.  In order to do that we are imposing a blanket tax&mdash;I will not call it a levy&mdash;but a Customs tax on all pigs of a certain type, whether they are legally imported or lawfully produced in the country.  I say that is an extraordinary proposal.  Is there any <Col N="1603" /> precedent for it?  Jewellery is illegally imported into this country from time to time&mdash;perhaps very valuable jewellery.  Did anybody ever think of imposing some sort of higher rate of turnover tax on all jewellery in the country in order to deal with the comparatively small amount of jewellery smuggled into the country?  Clothes are imported illegally from time to time. Did anybody ever suggest that all clothes should be taxed in order to get at clothes that are illegally imported? The same argument could be related to butter, to motorcar parts and to a variety of other things that are imported.  Why select the farmer, the agricultural producer, for this extraordinary experiment?</P>
      <P>I shall be interested to know whether the Minister can cite a case where a similar proposal was adopted to deal with the smuggling of specific articles. In other words, can he quote any instance where Irish-produced articles were taxed through this House in order to prevent the importation of foreign articles?</P>

He said that it must be without precedent to endeavour to get money in this way through the Finance Bill.  Reference has also been made to the fact that none of the Fianna Fáil Deputies from the pig-producing areas of the country is here to object to this.  Perhaps this is excusable because nobody would have expected that a blanket levy would be put on pigs through the Finance Bill.  If the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries was proposing such a levy, all these rural Deputies would be here to fight against it because if they did not do so, they could not face home.</P>

This is an area where there are many pig producers.  He will need to be well guarded if this legislation goes through because these people will have a lot to say about this extra levy.</P>
      <P>The Minister has brought in this section without having had adequate advice on it.  I think it was Deputy Fitzpatrick who asked if there has been any consultation with the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is free to answer at any time.  He has been very slow to answer many of the questions put to him so far.  Was there any consultation with the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries?  I do not believe that he could have agreed to this.  If he did we shall have something to say to him later.  Was there any consultation with the Pigs and Bacon Commission <Col N="1605" /> as such or were there merely discussions with an official of the commission? Did they agree?  Did they consider this to be good for the pig industry? Was there any discussion with farming organisations or was their advice sought as to whether they considered this to be good for them?  In his opening speech, the Minister said that the farmers would appreciate the value of this.  How does he know that? As I have already said, this section was introduced in a surreptitious manner.  Also in his opening speech on the section, the Minister did not refer to any pigs other than smuggled pigs but he now admits freely that this covers all pigs of a certain grade or category.  Therefore, as time goes on, the meaning of this section is being revealed.</P>
      <P>We are all disappointed with this. More than once, Deputy Tully appealed to the Minister to consider seriously withdrawing the section because it is not the way to deal with smuggling and because it is the consumers and the pig producers who are being asked for the money that the Minister is hoping to collect.  I appeal to the Minister again to have regard to the fact that a large number of pigs in this country are produced on swill.  This is food that would otherwise be wasted. Also, when the potatoes are being taken out&mdash;this probably covers a period of about two months&mdash;pigs are fed exclusively on the small, or what would otherwise be waste, potatoes. Such feeding produces less than top quality pigs but we must remember that such pigs are the only ones retained for home consumption.  The Grade A and Grade A Specials are exported.  If this section goes through, the price of bacon will be increased.  I know many people who still eat fat bacon.  The point will never be reached, and it would be bad if we were to attempt to reach it, where all pigs described as &ldquo;fat&rdquo; would be eliminated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a result of this, I cannot see how there will not be overlapping of the grading system operated by the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries.  It was difficult enough to get acceptance of this system by the farmers.  There <Col N="1606" /> was extraordinary suspicion in relation to its operation.  Perhaps in the early days the suspicion was well-founded. Producers were sending pigs for grading which they thought should be graded as A but which were graded as B or C, and so on.  Grading is now very carefully carried out and farmers are invited to go along to see grading in operation.  There is nothing in this legislation to indicate standards or measures by which pigs would be graded.  If it is left entirely to the discretion of the Pigs and Bacon Commission it is possible that a certain man's pigs might be turned down because somebody did not like him. Therefore, there has not been and could not have been sufficient discussion between the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries, members of the Pigs and Bacon Commission, the farming organisations and the Minister for Finance before the introduction of this piece of legislation which we all know will have an adverse effect on pig production and will mean an increase in the price of bacon to the consumer.</P>
    <P>The only reason why the Minister brought this in was to collect revenue. He agrees with me that 200,000 pigs can be caught in this net.  He would not have introduced this if he did not intend collecting a substantial amount of money as a result.  He is not doing it for a frivolous sum.  From whom is the money to be collected?  Certainly not from the people who smuggle pigs across the Border and the sooner the Minister realises this the better.  We were scoffed at when we said it was possible that at peaktime some 2,000 pigs a week cross the Border but 200,000 pigs are covered by this.  It is the pig producers and the consumers who will have to pay the bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been asked to tell the House the estimated number <Col N="1609" /> of pigs smuggled.  I cannot give such information and it is quite unreasonable to state that I should.  The information I gave was that every pig smuggled costs, between the taxpayer and the producer, a sum of about £5. It is known that the question of smuggling of pigs was of considerable concern to farmers and to pig producers in general.  This concern has been clearly demonstrated time after time.  The cost of subsidies on all pigs, as far as the taxpayer is concerned, in the current year, is £3.4 million and, in addition, £1 million is contributed by the producers' levy.  The very light and very heavy pigs which constitute about 10 per cent of all pigs would, as Deputy Clinton said, amount to 200,000 pigs.  A large proportion of those could be smuggled although we do not know how many are.  It is in this area smuggling takes place because of the price differential.  This is where the incentive to smuggling occurs and this is why the operation of this section, in relation to those particular gradings, will be related to the areas in which there was a price differential acting as an incentive to smuggling.  It will not be operated on the basis of what was considered desirable or undesirable by way of grading but solely by way of reference to the existence of incentives to smuggling by way of price differential.</P>
      <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick referred to a statement in the <i>Farmers' Journal</i> of 4th July, 1970.  He did not, in fact, add that that article indicated that the smuggling of heavy pigs was still continuing on a significant scale.  I must confess I find it a bit mystifying listening to Opposition speakers on this because some of them would give you the impression there is virtually no smuggling and others would give you the impression that smuggling is on a very big scale and that we ought to have done something about it before this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suspect the position is that they feel smuggling was going on, that it is still going on, but at a lower rate.  That may be so, but there is nothing to ensure it will not be speeded up again.  Neither, indeed, at the present time can we view the position with equanimity.  As I <Col N="1610" /> said, the reference to the <i>Farmers' Journal</i> was to the smuggling of heavy pigs still going on and this section is designed to try to do away with the financial incentive to pig smuggling.  If the incentive arises in relation to one grade rather than another, it is possible to vary the levy in respect of that grade. If smuggling were to cease this could be taken away and, if it were to start up again, then it could be put on again. That is the object of the section.</P>
    <P>I referred to possible exemption. This is provided for in the section.  The basis of exemption would have to be specified in the order.  In general, it would relate, as I said in an interjection, to the supply of pigs on a contract basis or, possibly, the supply of pigs from a pig-fattening station&mdash;in other words, where it could be clearly demonstrated that the pigs were home-produced.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what happened before the Budget, but I know there was consultation after the Budget.  We had numerous complaints about pig smuggling, about the damage it was doing to the pig producer, about the cost to the pig producer and to the Exchequer.  We had complaints from Deputies who spoke on this section. We had no practical suggestion as to how this problem might be dealt with. When I say that I am not trying to be derogatory.  Any suggestions we did hear turned out to be impractical.  If we let this go on, we subject the pig producers to the losses involved in the levy as far as they are concerned; we subject the taxpayers to these losses also unless we take some steps to deal with the problem.  This is an effort to deal with the problem.  It is true that, in the case of some producers who produce pigs that would come within the terms of the levy&mdash;in general, that would be pigs that were either over heavy or over light&mdash;they would be penalised because they would not be within the exemption terms as well.  That is true, but I want to put it to the House that what is involved here is not merely the question of ensuring that no pig producer of over-fat or over-light pigs is in any way inconvenienced and, by ensuring that, let this whole thing go on and let all pig producers and the taxpayers suffer.  I suggest that the number of pigs involved is about 10 per cent and, of this 10 per cent, a very big percentage must be smuggled pigs so that what is left are the producers we are concerned about because this will impose a hardship on them if they are not exempt.  I accept that this is so.  I would much prefer not to subject them to this levy but I have no other method open to me of doing this and, as the same time, doing something practical to try to reduce pig smuggling. If we do not deal with this problem every pig producer in the country will lose more and the taxpayer will lose more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want Deputies to view this situation in perspective.  It is no use telling me that this will seriously affect all pig producers.  It will not.  Quite <Col N="1612" /> obviously it will not.  We are talking about a relatively small number of pigs.  We would rather it did not do any damage, but the price of not doing that damage is to damage every pig producer and every taxpayer in the country; unless someone can produce a better and more effective system of doing it, that is the price involved. These are the two things that have to be balanced.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is quite wrong when he says only some pig producers will be affected.  Every pig producer will be affected because no pig producer produces 100 per cent Grade A pigs.  Every producer has some degree of failure and, therefore, every pig producer will be affected.  In what other way could this be done?  The NFA as far back as 12 months ago suggested there should be a licence to move pigs near the Border, pigs within five, ten, 15 or 20 miles of the Border, and any person found moving pigs in that area without such a licence would be deemed to have imported the pigs illegally.  I can see no legislative reason why that suggestion could not be put into effect. This could be done without affecting every pig producer in the country.</P>
      <P>What has happened here is that the Minister, on the advice of his officials &mdash;and officials in the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries have apparently agreed and the Minister responsible for that Department&mdash;has set up a situation whereby they will defend taxation, they will defend revenue, they will defend the payments made from the Department of Finance to Agriculture&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>If a pig producer in this country sends eight grading pigs and two non-grading pigs to the factory, the two non-grading pigs are subjected when the regulations are <Col N="1615" /> made to a second levy under this section.  The money from that levy will go into the maw of the Minister for Finance and will not go back to the Pigs and Bacon Commission.  Therefore, the position is that he will have received exactly the same as he would have received before this legislation for eight pigs and considerably less for the two non-grading pigs.  Deny that, if you wish.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I deny it because it is only half the truth.  The whole truth is that, to the extent that the operation of his levy reduces smuggling, the drawing on the levy paid by the pig producer to pay for smuggled pigs is reduced.  Therefore, the producer is gaining.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is suggesting that something affecting a fraction of 10 per cent will help these producers whereas, in fact, the penal levy the Minister is taking on that 10 per cent is being put into his own financial purse.  The Minister asked for another way to do it.  Surely the Department of Finance and the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries have considered the recommendation of the NFA.  I, as a farmer, have on many occasions&mdash;during foot and mouth disease epidemics and in periods of danger of foot and mouth disease, for example&mdash;been precluded from moving cattle, pigs or any cloven-footed animal, except under licence, from my farm to any other farm.  Why can that not be done in areas beside the border?  That suggestion was made 12 months ago by the NFA.  Here is another suggestion. Could there not be legislation&mdash;as there has been in the course of the 16 years I have been a Member of this House&mdash;whereby a person without a licence could be deemed to have illegally imported those pigs so that there would be no levy?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>We are all as anxious as the Minister is to get away on our holidays as this has been a very heavy session.  However, we are genuinely concerned that this is a measure that will not help anybody and that will adversely affect a certain number of people in this country.  I have said again and again that the consumer of bacon in this country will also be affected by higher prices.  The Minister has been challenged to tell the House why the same thing could not be done by operating the grading system which is in existence at the moment.  He has gone to some considerable lengths to explain that.  He has partly explained it by saying that it would be his intention that pigs supplied on contract from, say, large fattening stations would be exempt from this levy.  In doing it in this way, he is being selective.  He is ensuring that the bigger man in the industry will not be affected but that the small man all over the place will be caught.  I do not think the Minister wants this but this is the effect of the proposed levy.</P>
      <P>The Minister challenged Deputy Fitzpatrick in relation to the report in the <i>Farmers' Journal</i> and asserted that Deputy Fitzpatrick was either underquoting or not fully quoting and that the report indicated that smuggling was on the increase.  The report does not indicate anything of the sort.  In order to put it on the record, let me read this extract from the report:</P>
      <P>Reports, too, from Northern Ireland indicate a very substantial drop in smuggled pigs from there. Clearly, this is affecting the number of pigs being offered to southern factories.</P>
      <P>The earlier reference was to a drop in the number of pigs arriving at the factories.  The report continues:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The big reason for this, of course, is the increase in pig prices in <Col N="1617" /> Northern Ireland.  Top price for a &ldquo;Special&rdquo; up there is now 322s a cwt.  This is higher than ours.  In fact, the only pig that it now pays to smuggle is the too-heavy pig.  These, it would appear, are still coming across.</P>
    <P>There is nothing in that to indicate an increase in smuggled pigs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say there was.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said there was either an under-quote or a misquote that would indicate that this smuggling was not taking place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I said that the smuggling of heavy pigs was still going on on a significant scale.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>This report says there was a substantial drop.  I want to confirm that there is a substantial drop.  It is due to a number of things.  There was an increased effort here to stop smuggling.  There was an increase for pigs of a certain grade in Northern Ireland which attracted producers there to keep them at home.  We still have a limited amount of smuggling.  The Minister's measures certainly are not such that any sensible person or anybody with any contact with pig production in this country would introduce to stop an undesirable traffic.  I asked the Minister about this earlier but he did not reply.  Subsection (2) of this section provides:</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance, after consultation with the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries may, by order, do any one or more of the following&mdash;</P>
      <P>What if the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries disagrees?  May the Minister for Finance still go ahead?  It does not say whether the agreement of the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries is necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>This has a serious effect on agriculture also whether or not the Minister says it.  He refuses to commit the Minister for Agriculture <Col N="1618" /> and Fisheries.  He simply says that there will be consultations with the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries. That is not committing the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries to this levy.  I do not believe any Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries could stand over this levy.  The only person who could attempt to stand over it is the Minister for Finance who wants a sum of money regardless of where he gets it or of the inability of the people to pay it.</P>

The Minister shoots off remarks and says that the phrase which Deputy Clinton was talking about, &ldquo;after consultation with the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries&rdquo; is the usual phrase.  That is not so.  This is an agricultural matter and the usual phrase would be, &ldquo;with the consent of the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries&rdquo;.  The Minister shoots off remarks, but that is not the usual phrase in a matter of this sort.  I well remember an example when we had a disagreement in the Department of Finance about something they could do after consultation with the Minister for Finance and eventually after an exchange of letters we said: &ldquo;Look boys, you have consulted us.

We are doing something for which there is no precedent.  In order to prevent smuggling, we are deliberately imposing a tax on innocent people.  We are deliberately imposing a tax on home-produced goods in order to try to prevent an insignificant number of pigs from being smuggled into this country.  I say that is fundamentally wrong.  It is unsound.  It is a dangerous precedent.</P>

I am fully aware that the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries can make regulations without any trouble whatever whereby it is illegal to move pigs near the Border except under licence.  I know this because of my experience as a farmer in times of disease when such orders were made within hours.  I now <Col N="1621" /> want to know if the Minister agrees with me that there is no reason why legislation should not pass through this House setting out that a person who moves pigs without such a licence could be deemed to be importing them illegally.

Listening to the Minister I am inclined to think that he is not aware of the implications of this Bill which he has brought before the House.  I believe he is not aware of the way pig smuggling operates and everything pertaining to it.  He has stated what would be involved in a licence for the movement of pigs in the Border areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a small pig producer from a Border area I can tell the Minister that there would be no great hardship on pig producers in Border areas if there were a licence.  The people who are moving numbers of pigs in Border areas are not from Border areas.  They come from miles away with large double-deck lorry loads of pigs.  They can be seen clearly in broad day light. If somebody is heading south from the northern direction on an unapproved road and there is no pig-fattening unit <Col N="1622" /> between where the lorry is intercepted and the unapproved Border cross-point, we would only need our imagination to tell us where the load of pigs was coming from.</P>
    <P>This levy is designed to hit the poorer section of the community.  It will not interfere with the large co-operative piggery or the large pig fattening unit that supplies pigs on contract to a particular factory.  The people this will interfere with most are the small family farm traditional producers who have ten or five or 15 pigs.  They will pay the piper.  I cannot help thinking that, as far as the Minister is concerned, it is a question of getting the money and, as somebody said: &ldquo;Get it right and, if you cannot, get it anyhow.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I will not detain the House very long but I want to point out, since the Minister made a point about inter-Party Governments and other kinds of Governments, that the date stamped on the back of this Finance Bill is 7 of 70, that is, the month of July, 1970.  Although the Budget was on 12th May, I think, we did not get the Bill for a long time and yet this section was not in the Bill.  Therefore, the Minister need not pretend to me, if he is talking about a proper system of administration, that this matter was properly considered. Obviously, it was not.  I was flabbergasted at the lapse of time between the Finance Bill and the Budget.  Also, on the back of the Finance Bill is: &ldquo;Ordered by Dáil Éireann to be printed, 20th May, 1970.&rdquo;  Of course, it was not with us when it was ordered to be printed: we just ordered the Bill as introduced, that is the Long Title. We did not know what was in the Bill until we got it in the month of July.  It is not right for the Minister to pretend that the section was properly considered. I know it was not because of that external evidence.  I shall not delay the House any longer.</P>

      <P>This section is extending to profits derived from exempted trading operations in Shannon Airport the benefits already provided by section 35 of the Finance Act of 1968 in respect of double taxation relief, where a company has invested in a foreign subsidiary profits which had been relieved from tax under the exports relief provision and where the dividends or interest arising from such investment suffer foreign tax.  The section is only effective where the investment is made in a country with which a double taxation agreement is not in force.  As I say, this was provided under section 35 of the Finance Act, 1968, but it did not apply to Shannon Airport. The effect of this section 55 is to extend this benefit to Shannon Airport.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry but I am really puzzled here.  The section with which we are dealing is one under which we give a concession ourselves, under section 35 of the previous Act and section 55 of this Bill, where there is not a double taxation agreement and where because of the absence of a double taxation agreement with a tax sparing clause it is necessary for us to make some provision which will enable companies not to be at a disadvantage because of this.  Surely that should also apply, and we should give the same unilateral exemption, if that is the right word, to the two cases where there is a double taxation agreement and which does not cover this point?  In so far as it is clearly unilateral because it is a provision which relates to cases where there is no agreement whatever, surely we are equally entitled to make the same unilateral decision in respect of countries with which there is a double tax agreement which is unsatisfactory in character in this respect?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure if I quite follow the Deputy but what I have said is that this section is not effective, or rather is effective only where the investment is made in a country with which a double taxation agreement is not in force.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>But the explanatory memorandum says that it extends to companies trading at Shannon Airport the measure of unilateral relief which was provided by section 35 of the Finance Act, 1968 in respect of countries with which there is no double taxation agreement.  It is unilateral.  We do not ask anybody else; we do it ourselves. We are providing it for the countries with which there is no double tax agreement. Why are we not providing it in respect of countries with which there is a double tax agreement if it does not give this particular benefit and when they are the two most important countries in respect of which this could be required?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 30a:</P>
      <P>Before section 57 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Notwithstanding anything contained in the Income Tax Acts income derived from the export of tomatoes shall not be taken into account for the purpose of assessment to tax.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Assessment to tax has been a matter of concern to tomato producers for some time past.  I would ask the Minister to accept my amendment so that the tomato industry might go ahead as it has been doing in recent years.  The Minister knows that a considerable amount of money has been provided by the Government by way of grants for expansion of the tomato-growing industry.  These grants have been taken up and considerable progress has been made.  However, the industry has now reached a point where a further move is necessary.  The Minister will recall <Col N="1631" /> that the grants have been suspended by the Department of Agriculture because they are aware that a further move is needed.  The move is required in the area of marketing.</P>
    <P>We have reached a point where demand for tomatoes on the home market for the greater part of the year is satisfied and at certain periods there is a surplus supply.  If the surplus is not exported the price on the home market drops below economic production level.  I know this is a matter of concern to the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries as indicated by the fact that expansion has been halted until progress is made on the marketing side of the business.</P>
    <P>One of the greatest fillips given to the mushroom industry was tax exemption which was also given to other industrial projects under the 1956 Act. I do not see any reason for denying to the tomato-growing industry the exemption given to the mushroom-growing industry.  In both cases you prepare a seed bed, you sow the seed, the crops are packed in almost identical containers and are exported to the same markets.  I shall be very surprised if the Minister is not prepared to accept this amendment and to give this concession to the tomato-growing industry.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries is anxious to expand tomato production.  We started off with an area in the region of 3,000 acres and we want to increase that to 10,000 acres in order to have a continuous supply for the export market.  Quite considerable expenditure is necessary in the promotion of exports.  The industry has not got a marketing body although they have been looking for such an organisation for some time past to determine standards and other factors essential for the successful operation of an export trade.</P>
    <P>Tax exemption would be a tremendous fillip and is what the industry needs at the moment to encourage exportation.  The smaller people in the business who have not got the necessary export organisation do not wish to export but if the larger concerns sell exclusively on the home market the price drops below the economic <Col N="1632" /> level.  Therefore, I would urge the Minister to accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to develop the reasoned argument of Deputy Clinton and to give as comparisons export incentives in industry. I cannot see any difference between the exportation of tomatoes which are intensively cultivated and which create considerable employment, and the exportation, say, of tinned foods and the dehydrated foods that Erin Foods, among other organisations, produce which quite properly enjoy tax relief. I do not understand why in the case of this intensively cultivated crop new exports are excluded from this freedom from income tax.</P>
      <P>Deputy Clinton has been quite clear about the policy which is known to us all and which has been recently published in a booklet on agriculture&mdash; namely, to expand the glasshouse industry by about 2½ times its present size and thus provide the quantity required.  In view of the fact that there are many tomato producers in my constituency I am aware of certain other factors in relation to this industry. The Department have been extremely wise in ensuring that a quality tomato is produced in this country; it travels well and is of a higher quality than the continental tomato.  Representatives of British supermarket stores have been very anxious to get a constant flow of Irish tomatoes because of their high quality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure this amendment will be accepted because it is quite obvious that it is a reasoned and sensible one. I mentioned the fact that dehydrated vegetables, such as peas and beans, are exported and enjoy tax relief.  In this process the vegetables are taken from the fields, they are dehydrated and eventually canned but in the case of the tomato industry the crop is cultivated under glass at a cost of £25,000 per acre.  The expenditure involved in the tomato industry, the amount of intensive cultivation and the labour created in the whole operation would appear to me to be a far more detailed undertaking and possibly of greater benefit for this country than the other crops I have mentioned.  I would add that the other products have their own <Col N="1633" /> value and quite properly enjoy tax relief but the exclusion of the tomato industry from this relief certainly needs correction.  Every Finance Bill introduced into this House needs correction and revision the following year.  The Finance Bill takes so long to deal with because it is so detailed, and many changes have to be made as experience each year shows are necessary.  There is an unanswerable case here for the extension of export tax relief to the production of tomatoes.</P>
    <P>My last argument in favour of Deputy Clinton's case is that it is practically impossible&mdash;I use that phrase to mean not practical&mdash;in this country to grow tomatoes in the open air.  If export tax relief was given there is no question of anyone being in a position to grow tomatoes in a field and export them.  This is not possible.</P>
    <P>The industry is faced with heating and covering by glass wide areas at a cost of £25,000 per acre; the employment of men to produce the heated atmosphere required, to deal with the plants and pluck off the blossoms not required, to look after the disease factor, sterilise the clay in the glasshouses, remove that clay after each operation and completely replace it. Tomato growing is as close to industrial production to which export tax relief is extended as anything can be. It is certainly as close as mushroom growing and production of chicks, if not closer.  There cannot be the slightest doubt that tomatoes should be treated in the same way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Clinton said he would be surprised if this amendment were not accepted.  It would be more accurate to say he would be surprised if it were accepted.  He has unsuccessfully tried to have this idea accepted before.  Exemption from income tax liability as related to exports is confined to exports of manufactured goods. The only exceptions are cultivated mushrooms and fish produced on a fish farm.  I do not know the origin of these exceptions but they exist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Arising out of something which Deputy Donegan said, there may be some misconception about this.  Dehydration, <Col N="1634" /> packing, <i>et cetera</i> are processes to which tomatoes are not subject.  If tomatoes were dehydrated, cooked, preserved or tinned they would qualify for export tax relief but as they are not if they were to be granted this exemption there are a number of other products which could equally well claim exemption.  I agree this is not a conclusive argument for not giving the exemption in the case of tomatoes but it is one which makes any Minister for Finance look closely at the situation.  There would be a very strong case for a number of other products to be included on the same basis as tomatoes if this relief were given.</P>
    <P>Apart from the financial implications of this there are other aspects to it. If such exemption were to be given some difficulty might arise under the Free Trade Area Agreement.  I do not think this would be insuperable but certainly there would be objections. Even more difficult at the present time would be the fact that it could give rise to some difficulties in connection with our negotiations to join the EEC. We would have to phase out this kind of relief as a result of joining the EEC and to introduce it at a time when we are actually negotiating for entry could present a number of difficulties for our negotiators.  For these various reasons I find myself unable to accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I had a not taken that I had omitted to mention the EEC. In my view the Minister should be extremely anxious to have this relief for the tomato industry before we enter the EEC.  The Minister's feeling and the feeling expressed in this House is that commitments already entered into will be honoured in relation to relief of this kind particularly income tax relief on exports.  It would be of great benefit to this country if the tomato industry could be included before we reached any sort of advanced stage.  We have only just introduced our application; we shall be doing nothing for several months.  This tax relief could be a <i>fait accompli</i> now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We want to expand our tomato industry but we are several years behind some of the countries already in the EEC in relation to tomato <Col N="1635" /> cultivation and the production of glasshouse crops.  One of the things the Department of Industry and Commerce, the IDA and the Department of Finance are always anxious to ensure is that when they give a grant to an industry that industry will succeed. They are also anxious to ensure that there should be as large an export content as possible in the industry.  If we want exports of tomatoes to increase and the expansion of the industry&mdash;we have all the evidence we need that the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries knows it is extremely important to expand the tomato industry&mdash;this tax relief would be a great fillip to the industry.</P>
    <P>The Minister attempted to say that because there was no processing involved this sort of relief could not be provided.  I would remind the Minister that both the mushroom industry and the products of fish farms were given this relief.  On two previous occasions I tried to get two different Ministers for Finance to accept that similar relief should be provided for day-old chick exports.  On both occasions the Ministers concerned said they were in sympathy with this but that for the time being at any rate they could not provide it.  Last year I raised the matter again and I told the Minister that I knew if relief was not provided at that time we would lose exports of day-old chicks worth £300,000 because if the people concerned did not get the relief they would have to set up in the North of Ireland.  Relief was not provided; they set up in the North of Ireland and we lost all those exports. I appeal to the Minister not to look at this in the same sort of way simply because it is an amendment brought in by a member of the Opposition. Deputy Donegan has spoken about the degree of processing in other industries.  We are told that the jam manufacturing industry will be in serious trouble when we join the EEC because the bulk of the contents for jam are imported.  Yet this industry gets tax relief.</P>
    <P>The North Dublin Growers are another case in point.  Their premises are only a grading place.  This firm <Col N="1636" /> was entitled to grants which we could previously give only to manufacturing industries.  If the Minister wants to do it, he has the precedent.  There is nothing in existing legislation to prevent him from accepting this amendment. Far from it being a disadvantage, as I see it, it would be a positive advantage to this country.  Tomatoes are one of the commodities which are exempt under the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement.  They do not come into it. The British can register no protest. Even if Britain did register a protest, we could ignore it.  When it suited Britain to ignore the terms of their agreement they did so.  They did so in the case of the deposit scheme.  It was admitted to me and other Deputies that there was a flagrant breach.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>We had the same thing in relation to cheese.  Tomatoes are outside the scope of the agreement.  I appeal to the Minister to be sensible about it and to see that this would be an asset for the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I still adhere to the view that the harvesting of French beans and dehydrating and packing them is less complicated than growing tomatoes at a capital cost of £25,000 per statute acre.  The amount of employment involved is less.  Deputy Clinton mentioned the fish farm situation and the mushroom situation. Mushrooms are grown in old, disused houses or sheds with thick walls, which lend themselves to the development of this type of horticulture.  What is the difference between getting an old shed, growing mushrooms, putting them in a chip and sending them off and producing tomatoes?  Tomatoes are grown in glasshouses which are heated and then put in a chip, graded and sent off.  The probability is that the capital expenditure involved in the growing of mushrooms is tiny in comparison with the expenditure involved in the growing of tomatoes.  We have given State grants towards the capital expenditure of £25,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have the situation that something which is exactly on a par with another type of production in the same field is excluded, while the first item <Col N="1637" /> is assisted by grant.  Tomato growing involves heavy capital expenditure, employs more people and is a more detailed process.  I prophesy that, if the Minister does not accept this amendment, some other Minister for Finance will accept it.  The Minister says he does not know about the mushroom and fish farms.  Pressure will bring a Minister for Finance to do what is right and fair.  This is the same old conservative attitude.  We are told that by accepting this the door will be opened for further grants.  There is no good in the Minister for Finance being a stick-in-the-mud. This country cannot afford to have that sort of Minister for Finance.  In this time of little stability it is necessary to attack export markets. We can attack them by sending our people to sell our tomatoes abroad in order to bring in the money which is so necessary here.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to broaden the scope of this debate.  But for the fact that people cannot sign cheques abroad the slightly better trade figures produced last month would not have occurred. They are artificial.  We will be sorry if the Minister does not accept this amendment.  We should encourage further exports.  It is only a question of time until this is done.  The Minister has pointed to one reason why it should be done now.  We are approaching the EEC.  The fact that we sell our tomatoes to Britain will have as much effect on our negotiations with the EEC as I would have in a statement to the Canadian or American Parliament.  It will have no effect whatever.  The acceptance of this amendment would give the fillip which is necessary and would bring about the expansion which has been mentioned by Deputy Clinton. Tomato production could be more than doubled.  The Minister would be well advised to accept this amendment. If he does not accept it, he is wrong, and is merely holding up something which will be done by another Minister for Finance in the not too distant future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like the Minister to say a little more on this.  I hope the Minister will intervene before we put this amendment to the House.  I should like the Minister to tell us <Col N="1638" /> what other products do not receive this type of relief.  They must be very few indeed.  Does the Minister consider it is desirable that the glasshouse industry should expand and that our tomato exports should increase?  If he does, does he consider this would give a great fillip to the tomato industry?</P>
      <P>We have reached a point in the industry where for a considerable portion of the year we have tomato surpluses.  Export is vital if the industry is to expand.  The Department of Agriculture and Fisheries say that they have only suspended these grants and will re-introduce them.  They also say they have a target size and that this depends on the success of exports. I attended a symposium in relation to this matter last year.  There was a man there from Britain who said that he would take all the Irish tomatoes he could get if he could get them consistently and in quantity, if he could be assured of getting the quantity. At the present time our quantities for export are small.  Nobody is prepared to build up for the export market. From a national point of view, it is desirable that this relief should be provided in order to stimulate exports at a vital period for the tomato industry.</P>

      <P>At the moment the development of the production of chicory in this country is carried on in conditions similar to those under which mushrooms are produced.  Chicory is produced in old, darkened houses with thick walls.  Its production creates probably a little more employment than the production of mushrooms. What is going to happen when we start to export chicory?</P>

      <P>The reason why I did not intervene a second time was that I do not think I can add much to what has been said.  The Deputies opposite have not added much to what was said the first time.  The reliefs given for mushrooms could be justified on the basis that mushroom growing is a completely artificial process but I think that this is a technical distinction.  The basic <Col N="1639" /> problem here is whether we want to see an expansion in the export of tomatoes.  I certainly would like to see an expansion of all our exports.  It is not quite as simple as that.  If we were to give tax exemptions in respect of all our exports we might achieve enormous growth in exports but we would not be able to pay for the various services which we ought to provide. Indeed, if this were to go too far, it would be grossly unjust because there would be an expansion in the economy in which it would not be possible for the community in general to share owing to the absence of any payment of taxation.</P>

Not alone would it place them in an awkward position, but it would place those who would hope to benefit in an awkward position, too, because I would not like to lay any money on our being able to hold on to this for any length of time.

However, the case was made on section 39 and I do not propose to say any more about it beyond pointing out that this amendment would give effect to what the Minister said was the intention and purpose of the change being made, and would limit it to that.  I made the case for that on section 39 and I do not propose to press the matter any further at this stage.</P>

      <P>In page 2, line 19, after &ldquo;case&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;,other than owner occupied residential business premises,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Title of this Bill is rather deceptive. Actually, it is a rather revolutionary Bill.  In effect, it means virtually the termination of reduction in valuation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1645" /> There are two aspects of the Bill, the first being the question of abolition. It proposes the abolition of rating reliefs available over a wide range of building projects such as factories, hotels, office blocks, and supermarkets but also non-grant-aided domestic housing and private business premises, the proprietors of which may often be of very modest means and ineligible for any other form of relief of rates. The reason offered is that the need for this type of concession to the building industry, which has been in operation in one form or another for nearly 50 years, no longer exists.  Whether we accept this reasoning or not the concession is surely desirable in the case of the small trader, especially under present circumstances, in the era of supermarkets and intensive competition and high taxation.  Remission of two-thirds of the rates for seven years on the valuation of new buildings or on the increase in the valuation of existing buildings which have been enlarged or improved must have, in conjunction with the recent cement strike, a serious effect on the construction industry.</P>
    <P>The second aspect of the Bill is the phasing out.  For those who may not have applied for building permission before 9 December, 1969 there will be a final and reduced rating concession until 31 March, 1972.  For work completed by 31 March, 1970 there will be six years remission of rates. For work completed by 31 March, 1971 there will be five years remission and for work completed by 31 March, 1972 there will be four years remission.</P>
    <P>It is obvious that the reduced concessions can apply only to a very small quantity of work, already in the pipe line, so to speak, at the end of 1969.  This Bill does not interfere with existing concessions for new or improved housing under the 1960 Housing Act or the Housing (Gaeltacht) Act.  Grant-aided housing is unaffected by this measure except in so far as the size of the grants for housing under another Bill has been reduced. Neither does it affect total remission for an indefinite period on new or improved farm buildings which has been in operation in principle for over <Col N="1646" /> 100 years under section 14 of the Valuation Act, 1852.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in his Second Reading speech, raised the point that it did not seem necessary or perhaps even just that rate remissions should be continued at the expense of the ordinary ratepayers for large concerns such as hotels, insurance offices, banks and so on.  Admittedly, he has a point there. But I do not think that justifies the global wiping out of this concession which has existed for about 50 years, particularly at this time.  It is particularly onerous considered in conjunction with recent housing legislation. Take domestic housing.  It was mentioned by the Minister for Finance when he was discussing the Housing Bill during the by-election that alterations in the size of the houses in the Bill, which now provides for smaller houses, would mean that those who did not get housing grants would suffer a loss, between stamp duty concession, grant and rates remission, of about £1,000 per house.  I cannot offhand say how much of that amount would be represented by rates remission.</P>
    <P>If we are building 7,000 or 8,000 grant-aided houses per year it has been pointed out that under the new housing legislation being introduced, about 20 per cent of those who formerly qualified for grants would not now get grants. That is on the basis that they would continue to opt for the same size of house as heretofore.  I admit that with the pressure of the question of grants, the stamp duty and rates remission they would probably be forced to build smaller that obtained previously, it system that obtained previously, it would mean that between 1,500 and 1,600 people trying to build their own houses would lose approximately £1,000 per person.  Persons who will be cut out under the Housing Bill represent 20 per cent of the annual building rate.  That section will lose about £1,000 per house.  The figure will probably fall because people will probably opt to go into smaller houses even though they may not wish to do so if they have large families.  The loss involved to them in all would be about £1,000 per house.</P>
    <P>I have, therefore, submitted an <Col N="1647" /> amendment in which I provided in effect that these rates remissions would continue for owner-occupied residential business premises.  It is difficult to frame an amendment covering all the classes for which one would like to retain and continue rates abatement.  I am not particularly worried about the big combine building a bank or insurance building in any of our towns; the matter of rates remission will not cause them extreme difficulty; but I am concerned about the small shopkeeper and the man trying to build his own house who, perhaps, has a large family and feels he will have difficulty in living in a smaller grant-aided house, even allowing for the possibility under that Bill that he might be able to build an enlargeable type of house.  There is no understanding that if he does enlarge it within the 15 year period he will get a second grant.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to formulate all the categories one would like to include specifically.  Therefore, in a general way I put down this category which covers the small shopkeeper who lives over his shop or at the back of his shop. Some of them may be well off but usually that type of trader is in the middle income group and sometimes lower and to him a rating concession is a very important matter.</P>
    <P>The general pattern in regard to rates has always been that any time the Department could, by way of legislation, unload anything on to the rates, they happily did so.  Our rates now amount to about £40 million a year. Therefore, I am rather unimpressed by the concern of the Minister which might be implied in his termination of rates relief.</P>
    <P>In general, the small town dweller, the small trader, who wishes to improve his premises&mdash;and he must do it nowadays if he is to compete against supermarkets&mdash;will no longer enjoy the rates relief he previously enjoyed.  This would be very onerous for him.  I am, therefore, asking the Minister to accept this amendment in respect of the small trader who happens to live on his own premises.  It was the only way I could think of classifying and segregating the small trader from the more opulent and <Col N="1648" /> well-to-do business man.  I took cognisance of the Minister's remarks that it might be unfair to continue giving rates relief to very well-off sections of the community at the expense of those who are less privileged.  Here I am making a plea for the underprivileged sections of our society that this Bill should not completely terminate reductions in valuation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Molloy) Robert Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Subsection (1) of section 3 of the Bill, which is the one the Deputy wishes to amend, operates to limit the rating reliefs to cases where planning permission had been applied for before 9th December, 1969.  The amendment, as proposed by Deputy Hogan, seeks to exempt owner-occupied residential business premises from this requirement. As I indicated on Second Stage, the Bill is a general one which provides for the phasing out of these omnibus rating reliefs.  These reliefs, as I explained previously, were introduced at a time when it was felt the building industry needed a special stilumus and to bring about greater activity in the construction industry.  I think it will be generally agreed that the reliefs at present in operation are not now necessary, that it is not necessary to give rating relief in respect of many of the buildings being erected today, to persons building supermarkets, who up to now could claim two-thirds remission of rates over a period of seven years or to persons building dance halls.  If these reliefs are phased out it will represent an increase in revenue of approximately £1,250,000 or £1,500,000 per annum to the local authorities.  This would, of course, relate to the total rates remitted in one year on buildings erected or approved any time over the past five years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The time is now opportune to phase out these reliefs altogether.  This amendment&mdash;I do not want to have a general discussion; we had a fairly general discussion on Second Stage&mdash; relates to exempting owner-occupied residential business premises.  On Second Stage I gave an indication that I have certain sympathies with some shopkeepers who have to carry a heavy rating burden, that this matter was <Col N="1649" /> under review and that I would see if there was anything I could do to bring some improvement in that situation.</P>
    <P>I do not think the method proposed by Deputy Hogan is the correct approach to this difficulty.  Whatever merits there might be in a claim for special consideration for small shopkeepers, I do not think anyone could argue that there is any case for singling them out in relation to the date of application for planning permission. The date specified in the Bill is 9th December, 1969, and this date was chosen by my predecessor because it was on that date that he made the announcement about this Bill.  It was felt that persons who had plans to construct the type of building which up to that time qualified for this remission should be allowed to benefit from it over a certain period.  Therefore, it was decided to continue the relief for those persons and that it would subsequently be phased out.</P>
    <P>The benefits of the Bill might well have been confined to persons who had actually undertaken this work before that date.  This was not done and this was a major concession.  To relate that now to the exemption of persons with owner-occupied residential business premises in the matter of applying for planning permission would not be a practical way to provide the type of concession which I think Deputy Hogan has in mind.</P>
    <P>Certain investigations are being made in regard to the rating system in the Department.  Therefore, having given public expression to my own sympathies in this regard and bearing in mind the fact that this is a general Bill and is not related to any specific type of development, I would ask the Deputy to withdraw his amendment and to give me the opportunity of considering during this phasing-out period what type of remission we might introduce by way of a special Bill which would give concessions to a specific type of development.  I think that is going quite some distance with the Deputy's concern for the particular class of ratepayer whom he has identified in his amendment and I would ask him to withdraw the amendment.</P>

      <P>I agree in general with the views of the Deputy on Article 44.  I do not think it does anything to enhance the special position of the Catholic Church and it could certainly create the difficulties suggested by the Deputy as far as other religions are concerned.  I have already said that publicly and so have high-ranking members of the Catholic Church.  I would suggest that in view of the likelihood of amendments being necessary in the event of our accession to the European Economic Community, and in view of the likelihood of other amendments being likely or desirable as well, all the amendments might be treated at the one time if possible. In other words, as the Deputy is aware, a Bill will have to come before the Oireachtas and will have to be passed before a referendum could take place. Rather than engage in repetitive expense for piecemeal amendments I think the overall amendment would be better.</P>

Would he not accept that his decision to reject the all-party committee recommendation which contained the comment that the Article gave offence, was divisive in its influence, leads one to believe and leads our opponents to believe that the Taoiseach is unconcerned or indifferent to the offence caused to other religions, is indifferent to the divisive influence it has, is in some way afraid of appearing to give offence to the Catholic Church thus increasing the suspicion which people who are anxious to emphasise the differences have that the Catholic Church still exerts an undue influence on decisions taken by politicians in the south, and, finally, that the Taoiseach is not genuine in his undertaking to take all the necessary steps at this particular time in our history to remove any real or imaginary <Col N="1652" /> obstacles which exist between ourselves and our fellow Irishmen in the north?</P>

Secondly, views on Article 44 have been expressed by myself, members of the Opposition and by other authoritative people, including members of the Catholic Church, and I do not believe that offence of the nature suggested by the Deputy could be given by the continued existence for a short couple of years more of Article 44 in our Constitution but if I saw it as a crucial issue in the immediate months ahead, then there would be some case for taking special action in relation to Article 44.</P>

Would the Taoiseach not agree that final negotiations and decisions in regard to the EEC may take 18 months or two years and two years in the opinion of my party and myself is a little too long to delay a referendum on changes in the Constitution related to the situation we have in the North of Ireland?  There is also the added factor that there is a growing demand for votes at 18.  There are votes at 18 in the north and in Great Britain and would the Taoiseach not agree that this important change should be made by way of referendum as quickly as possible?</P>

It would involve many questions being put to the voter, some requiring &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; and some requiring &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  If the democratic procedure of a referendum is to be made to work as well as possible, and if proper campaigns are to be organised so that the real issues can be debated and then adjudged, would it not be desirable to have two or three different referenda to adjudicate on quite different subjects rather than mixing them all up together?</P>

      <P>Convention No. 111 of the ILO is aimed generally at providing equality of opportunity to all persons in the field of employment and occupation and to removing any preferential treatment based on race, colour, sex, religion, political opinion, national extraction or social origin.  The Convention also requires ratifying States to seek the co-operation of employers' and workers' organisations in achieving these aims.</P>
      <P>No difficulty would arise in accepting the obligations of the Convention as far as race, colour, religion, political opinion, national extraction or social origin are concerned.  However, ratification of the Convention would also involve changes in certain arrangements which operate in favour of men in a number of employments and occupations.  Many of these arrangements are the outcome of negotiations between employers and trade unions and any changes in them would require re-negotiation and agreement between the parties.</P>
      <P>The issues are at present being examined by the Commission on the Status of Women which was established by the Government some time ago.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  There is a question of restoration and conservation involved. The work will be very costly and will take ten years to complete. This is the largest and best preserved Norman castle dating back to about 1200 AD.  Before we start on conservation we want to do an archaeological dig to find out what remains there may be in the grounds surrounding the castle.  There are proposals for the setting up of a limited company whereby full restoration might be possible with the aid of local co-operation and assistance.  We are very hopeful of doing a partial restoration initially which will provide for the Bunratty type banquets and so on in order to raise funds for the restoration of the castle.  I would prefer if the Deputy would not press me too hard on this matter now.  I intend to meet some local people on the matter in the near future.</P>

      <P>I appreciate that the Parliamentary Secretary is displaying an interest in Trim Castle which was not displayed by some of his predecessors. When the archaeological dig takes place, will he ensure that damage is not done to the old castle?  There was the collapse of a neighbouring building some years ago when three lives were lost.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Education if he will state in relation to each of the years since 1960 for which such information is available the position in each of the national schools in Dublin of which particulars have been supplied to him (a) total number of teachers; (b) whether the principal teacher spends more or less than half his time teaching; (c) the number of special and remedial classes; (d) the number of other classes; (e) the total number of pupils; (f) the number of classes of more than 60 pupils; (g) the number of classes of 50-59 pupils; (h) the number of classes of 40-49 pupils; (i) the number of classes of 30-39 pupils; and (j) the number of classes of less than 30 pupils.</P>

      <P>Statistics relating to national schools are prepared on a county basis with a separate breakdown for the county boroughs.  The inordinate amount of time and trouble involved would preclude information of the nature sought by the Deputy from being prepared.  Furthermore, considerations of the public interest enter into a matter such as this where unless detailed explanations were given in each case invidious comparisons might be drawn.</P>
      <P>I might add for the Deputy's information that where details are sought as to classes with numbers from 30 upwards the position in special classes has no relevance as there is no special class with numbers approaching 30. Neither does the amount of time spent on teaching by the principal of the larger schools enter into the matter as in every case the class numbers are related to whole-time teachers.</P>

      <P>Can the Minister reconcile his answer today with that <Col N="1672" /> which he gave me the last day?  I asked this question on the last day on a group basis.  He said the information was not available by wards.  I asked for it in relation to the individual schools in the area.  He replied that, if I gave him the names of individual schools, he would see what he could do about it.  He is now telling me that that was a misleading reply; that it is not the practice to give information on schools and that he is not prepared to do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 39, 40 and 41 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware that some companies are reluctant to provide motor insurance for persons not previously insured, but I am not aware of any instance of failure to secure cover in the market. There is machinery available under the auspices of the Minister for Local Government for dealing with cases of individual drivers who find difficulty in securing cover.</P>
      <P>Under their agreement with me, the companies are not free to increase the basic rates by more than 17½ per cent. Where instances involving a possible breach of the arrangements governing control of premium rates have been brought to my attention, I have had the matter taken up with the companies concerned.  I must, however, accept the right of the companies to apply reasonable additional loadings on the basic rate on renewal where there has been an increase in risk.</P>
      <P>It would be premature to consider the possibility of a system of State motor insurance in advance of the report of the committee which I am setting up to look into the insurance industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister not aware that at present middle-aged or elderly persons who have not previously held insurance, although possibly driving motor vehicles all their lives, if they attempt to get cover cannot do so?  Is he aware that insurance companies are, on renewal of policies, adding clauses in the form of a typed or printed notice on the back of the policy saying that under-30 drivers are not covered.  If the insurance company has a query they <Col N="1685" /> will increase the price on the ground that there is a big increase in risk although under-20 drivers have previously been covered by the same company? Is the Minister aware that one particular insurance company, the PMPA, have made it widely known that they are prepared to accept practically everybody, and as a result, they have a queue which takes about four hours to clear and that every day there are people who, after waiting hours, are not dealt with?  Having reached that stage would the Minister not agree that the next stage is to have a considerable number of uninsured drivers?  Would the Minister investigate the matter to see if something can be done before the position gets completely out of hand? I am not making it awkward for the Minister but I am giving him information of which he may not be aware.</P>

I was not aware of the effort at swing-over.  As I said in the reply, where there is additional risk there is a question of additional loading. Certainly, in any investigations I have conducted, where the risk is the same as it was, I find the insurance companies have not increased the premiums charged apart from the 17½ per cent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the death grant, the Minister said it was not intended to be a funeral benefit, that it was not big enough to be such.  Surely the whole object of the grant is that it will assist those who are really in trouble.  Over the years I have been receiving requests from people who have had deaths in the family and who have been asked to pay fantastic sums for funerals.  Local authorities will supply what somebody said had disappeared out of this country, a pauper's coffin, for about £9 10s.  What I cannot understand is that the coffin appears to be exactly the same as the <Col N="1691" /> one for which the ordinary person pays £40 or £45.  Either the people who supply the coffins charge far too much or this grant is far too small.  There is a change in the amount of the grant given according to the size of the child. As far as adults are concerned the expense will be the same regardless of the size of the coffin.  The grant of £5 even for a very small coffin does not meet the requirements at all.  When it is said it is not a grant for the purpose of paying for a funeral, I think it should be or the nearest thing to it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I do not, but in this respect in regard to the differences in the price of coffins what he says may have some substance.  It may well be that far more is charged for a coffin in the circumstances of an ordinary funeral than is charged in the case of one provided for a pauper's funeral.  However, in case I am doing an injustice to the people concerned I must make it clear I have no facts on which to base this.  It is merely a suspicion.</P>
      <P>I am not quite sure what can be done but certainly nothing can be done under the Social Welfare Bill as regards the amount of grant provided for here.  We are making a start and we do not claim it is the end of the road.  The whole scheme has been worked out and I cannot undertake at this stage to do anything to step up the grant.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a provision about which the Minister should do something. If I read the section correctly it means that a person who qualifies <Col N="1692" /> for an invalidity pension must have either 47 stamps or credits in the last year or 47 stamps or credit on average for his insured life.  I assume that that dates back to 1953 when the change took place.  For instance, take somebody who was involved in the recent cement strike and who for 12, 13 or 14 weeks was not allowed to draw unemployment benefit, and was not entitled to any benefit, and for that reason did not sign on at the labour exchange.  Maybe it was stupid of such a person not to sign on; he might not have been allowed on the grounds that he was on strike when in fact he was not.  Take also the people who were on strike.  Both sections would be debarred from this grant, if my interpretation is correct, within the next 12 months.  The number 47 is too high and the Minister should have gone back to the qualification for old age pension and disability benefit and made it 26 with a sliding scale up to 47 or 48. The other arrangement is far too harsh. I can imagine somebody saying &ldquo;We are doing something good now and we will just put it in as it is&rdquo; without realising what the effect might be. There is also the problem of people who go to England or who may have been employed on a &ldquo;lump&rdquo; job, about which we heard so much.  Both of these sections could find themselves ineligible for this grant if they wanted to take advantage of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The same procedure applies in regard to all benefits and persons who are in the position described by Deputy Tully can, at a later date, qualify.  The number of persons who would be precluded from qualifying in the circumstances he described must be quite small.  He is assuming that the persons concerned have, say, been involved in the cement strike and within quite a short time become otherwise entitled to an invalidity pension, but the number of persons in that situation would be small.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am saying that if any of the persons involved were applying within 12 months they would be ruled out.  Things like this do happen, not every year but every couple of years. There are strikes; there are reasons why <Col N="1693" /> men take a few weeks extra holidays, or they will do some work for themselves and they will not have 47 stamps or credit.  These people will or can come outside this particularly stringent provision. The Minister says that this is the same qualification but he knows that it is not.  Twenty-six is the normal qualification and why should 47 be written in here?  It is a new departure. The Minister should have another look at it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a principle which if we accept it then the Minister will say to me when we come to another section &ldquo;We have already accepted that principle&rdquo;.  If the Minister is persuaded of the validity of my argument will he try to do something about it before it goes to the Seanad?  The Minister should not say that he is going to look at it when he is not going to do anything about it.  The Minister said that several times already today.</P>

      <P>Here again we have the same argument and here it has even more force because this section applies to somebody who would be retiring. The reason which the Minister gave me would not apply in this case.  A person is entitled to draw certain benefit but would not be entitled to draw this new benefit unless he had the new qualification. When we are talking about improving social welfare we should do something which will improve it rather than take a retrograde step.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like the Minister to explain this.  When the Minister was introducing the Bill he said it was bringing in something which would allow people who did not apply for a non-contributory old age pension to apply for this benefit and I said that if they did not apply for a non-contributory old age pension I was sure they would not apply for benefit for somebody who was looking after them.  The Minister changed that and in his Second Reading speech he referred to the fact that it was intended for people who were over the limit for non-contributory pension and their being 70 years of age the people looking after them would qualify.  Is that the situation? Will persons who because of a means test are ineligible for the non-contributory pension be entitled to this allowance in respect of somebody who is looking after them?</P>

      <P>It has been the case that payment can only be made when there is proof that the person is dead.  It occurred recently in my constituency that a person was drowned and there was no proof of death for a considerable period.  As a result, social welfare benefit could not be obtained by the people affected.  Eventually, an arrangment was made.  However, if something were written into the Bill it would be possible to pay the money in cases where it is reasonable to assume that the person is dead.  Would the Minister consider looking into this matter?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Deputy had in mind in his amendment involved more than we could contemplate.  The House might be interested to know that there are some cases, with which the Department have dealt, in which the husband was missing for more than 25 years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>We know that the day after the wife got the pension the husband returned.  In circumstances in which death may reasonably be presumed, the Department does presume death.  In the circumstances described by Deputy Tully I think the benefit would be paid in a matter of perhaps weeks, or certainly months.  Provided the other conditions are complied with, the Department in following the usual procedure in cases of presumption of death would follow that practice in this case and benefit would be payable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>It is stated in section 19:</P>
      <P>Regulations shall provide for the return, subject to any conditions, restrictions and deductions specified in the regulations, of so much of any contribution paid by an employed contributor or a voluntary contributor who entered into insurance for the purposes of paragraph 9 of the Fourth Schedule to this Act after he had attained the age of fifty-five years as is determined in accordance with the regulations to have been paid in respect of retirement pension.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the contributions conditions proposed in the Bill for retirement pension is that the claimant must have entered insurance before reaching the age of 55 years.  A person who enters insurance after the age of 55 years will be precluded from deriving any benefit from the element for retirement pension in any employment contribution or voluntary contribution paid by him or on his behalf.  The purpose of this section is to provide for regulations to allow the refund to an insured person who enters insurance after the age of 55 years of his share of the element for retirement pension in any contribution paid by or in respect of him.  The amount of the element attributable to retirement pension will be determined under regulations.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> The case I have in mind does not concern a relative of the old person.  However, would the Minister not think it might be a good idea to extend the section to cover such a case?  Part of west Cavan is very isolated and there might be cases of an old person living on his own in a very remote area with no relatives nearby.  The only alternatives open to the old person is to go to St. Phelim's Hospital or to live with somebody else.  If a neighbour would be prepared to take in the old person and care for him would the Minister not consider it might be worthwhile to extend this section to cover this category?  Conceivably, it could lead to abuses but I am sure that regulations could be worked out.  I think the old people would probably be happier living with some people in their own locality than they would be living in an institution 40 or 50 miles away.  At any rate, the Minister assures me that if a relative takes them in the relative will get the allowance. I should like him to tell us what he thinks about the person who may not be a relative.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> The object of this section&mdash;it is a very laudable section&mdash;is to encourage relatives to look after aged relatives at home instead of sending them into institutions.  If the section is flexible enough it will encourage relatives to look after aged relatives and the old people will be happier among their own.  Secondly, it will effect a considerable saving to the ratepayers and taxpayers because I am sure it must cost £10 or £12 a week at least to keep an old person in an institution. In the case of a relative taking an old person to live in her house there should be no means test so far as the former is concerned because she is effecting a saving for both taxpayers and ratepayers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I strongly urge that the section should be made even more flexible. The whole idea is to encourage people to look after aged relatives.  There <Col N="1700" /> should be no means test when the person being looked after is in receipt of a pension.  In the case of an old person with means I would be in favour of a modest means test.  An old person with means can afford to pay someone to look after him or her; but in the case of a person in poor circumstances, the means of the relative who is prepared to look after the old person should not be taken into account.</P>
    <P>I am 100 per cent in favour of the principle behind this section.  As things stood, this just did not operate.  The number who benefited, as was stated in reply to a Parliamentary question, was negligible.  There was a considerable improvement last year.  I expect there will be a further improvement this year.  The means of the relative should not be taken into consideration if the relative is looking after a person in receipt of an old age pension in the relative's own house.</P>

      <P>I am concerned about this question of a female relative. In many cases a son looks after the aged person or, perhaps, a younger brother.  Why should it be confined to a female relative?  Why not a male relative?  The whole purpose is to keep people out of the county homes and institutions. The saving would be tremendous. We should encourage relatives, male or female, to provide this care and attention for the elderly.  In the case of those who give up employment to look after aged relatives, what happens about resumption of employment benefit?  Do they lose that benefit?  I should like the Minister to clarify these points.  Sometimes a neighbour looks after an old person.  Why should the neighbour not qualify?  This must be made as flexible as possible in order to keep these old people out of institutions.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> Sometimes a male relative comes home from England to look after the old people.  The farm is just above the level that would entitle him to a small farmer's dole.

      <P>I agree with Deputy Fitzpatrick.  It is an admirable approach.  Introduced only two years ago, it has since been improved and improved again and, in all likelihood, will be further improved.  I cannot undertake now to extend the improvement beyond what is contained in the Bill for this year.  The means test applies to the pensioner&mdash;not to the recipient.  In the case Deputy Fitzpatrick had in mind, a case where the benefit was not given, it probably arose not from a means test, because there is not one, but because the other person involved&mdash;possibly the husband of the niece, in the case he mentioned &mdash;was capable of giving the care and attention required, though I am not sure, in the circumstances he described. The pensioner is treated as living alone, even though he may not be living alone, if the people with whom he is living are not capable of giving the care and attention required.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> Let us be gracious and welcome this <Col N="1703" /> section.  It is something we have advocated for some time.  It is long overdue. I want to repeat what I said on the Second Reading that this should be worked in a flexible manner.  I was rather perturbed to hear the Minister for Social Welfare state that it would be necessary for wives who claim to be deserted to pursue as far as possible their legal remedies to claim maintenance from their husbands.  If this is pursued any distance at all, it will render this section valueless.  Very few husbands who desert their wives in this country stay around.  They usually emigrate to Britain or to some other country.  It is impossible for the deserted wives to contact them.  Even if they did so, or knew their addresses, it would be unreasonable to compel them to take court proceedings.  Litigation in Britain is quite expensive and almost invariably involves advance payment of fees and expenses.  The regulations should be very flexible this year and, if it appears that there are obvious abuses, they can be dealt with by amending the regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy Fitzpatrick.  Unfortunately, perhaps, for some of these wives, Britain is very close at hand and the husbands go abroad and the wives never hear from them.  I have made representations on behalf of a few hundred of these women who have been deserted.  They have their husband's British insurance number.  If they write to the British national insurance authorities about it the British authorities will not give the address but say that, if they write to them, they will forward the letter. These husbands draw social welfare benefit in Britain in respect of their wives in Ireland.  The husband in Britain may send £1 now and then. Even if they remain here, they very commonly send only £1.  In many of these cases it may be claimed by the Department that the husband is contributing. If he contributes £1 every month or every two months, or very infrequently, I would still say the wife has been deserted by her husband. Perhaps the Minister might like to comment on this point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not intended to <Col N="1704" /> interpret this absolutely rigidly.  First of all, in the case where there are some contributions, if they are very infrequent, the Department would be prepared to accept that this amounts to desertion.  Secondly, it is a relatively simple matter for a wife in these circumstances to obtain a maintenance order in the district court here, but the difficulty is in the enforcement.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> I know of a case where a woman was deserted by her husband over 20 years ago.  He left her with one child.  He went to England and she has never heard from him from that good day to this.  She does not know where he is.  She reared the child in very difficult circumstances and made a good job of it.  He is in employment now. The world and his wife in the district know that she was deserted.  The husband has never been seen around there. <Col N="1705" /> She has been in receipt of assistance of one sort or another from the local authority on the grounds that she was destitute, or practically destitute, or in need of assistance.  I do not know whether she could now take proceedings. I suppose she could but, without looking up the Act, I do not know. Probably the court where she is living has jurisdiction.</P>
      <P>Surely a certificate from the local authority or the home assistance officer of the home assistance department of the local authority who have been looking after this woman for the past 20 years should be sufficient to satisfy the Department that she was, in fact, deserted.

Those dangers exist without a doubt. <Col N="1706" /> The proposal about the maintenance order is obviously a good one and Deputy Fitzpatrick's suggestion is also a good one.  We all appreciate that if we were in the position of a local authority officer attempting to make a decision we would find it very difficult indeed.</P>
      <P>I wonder could the Minister go into all the different kinds of situation that arise in order to give some guidelines to the local authority officers so that people in this very difficult position would be given some support by defining these situations, not so much for our benefit, but for the benefit of the local authority officers, which would help them in turn not to promote abuses but to feel that we have not circumscribed their right to allocate grants.</P>
      <P>It is extremely vague at the moment. This is not a criticism of the Minister or the Department because I have nothing very helpful to offer myself. Those two proposals would appear to me to be the kind of proposal which would be of great help to local authority officers in their attempt to administer this valuable piece of legislation.</P>

They could not go beyond those regulations.  I would be in favour of writing into this that where reasonable evidence is available&mdash;and let some appeals officer decide it if necessary&mdash;that the woman has been deserted and has not been supported by her husband, and that she cannot reasonably enforce a claim for maintenance against him, it should be accepted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister says that there are approximately one thousand who would qualify under this section for an allowance.  This provision is very much welcomed because up to now these people have been dependent on the local authorities for home assistance. It might be said of local authorities and those who approve estimates and strike rates that they are not very generous either with this group or with any other people who have not sufficient to keep themselves and in many cases their families.  I am sure that all these people&mdash;whether they are more or less than one thousand makes no difference&mdash;are looking forward to the payment of this allowance from approximately, the first week in October.  I am sure they will expect to have a decision made very quickly, in a month at the outside.  I want to ask the Minister if he has sufficient outdoor staff to deal with not only these cases but with the various other changes this measure will bring about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know many social welfare agents and I think it would be no exaggeration to say that they are very much overworked.  Their job is supposed to entail a five-day week but the Minister and his officials must know that they are constantly engaged after normal working hours in their own houses still working for the Department of Social <Col N="1709" /> Welfare.  They do this work also on Saturdays and Sundays.  If they are to investigate circumstances and establish that wives have been deserted it will mean much more work.  I am concerned about both parties, the social welfare agents and the deserted wives who expect to get this allowance reasonably soon.  There have been complaints&mdash;and possibly in this House also&mdash;about the work of social welfare agents.  I suppose many Deputies can particularise, but I think it can be said in respect of all of them and, at least, of those with whom I have contact that they are very hardworking.  They are deemed unpopular with certain people merely because they must carry out the law as decided by this House and the regulations as decided by the Minister.</P>
    <P>The Minister should have a serious look at the new work that will be imposed on social welfare agents, particularly in the period when desertion must be established.  I suggest the Minister should, if possible, try to recruit personnel from his Department to ensure that deserted wives will get their allowances in good time if they qualify.  Failing that, the Minister should give the agents some compensation for the overtime they do every weekday and on Saturdays and Sundays.</P>

The number of applicants who will present a problem will, I hope, be relatively small.

        <i>(Cavan):</i> As this is a new section it is no harm to throw out all possible suggestions. The Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to children has been mentioned. It has done great work and I am glad the Minister will refer to that Society.  Another society that has done good work in its own way is the St. Vincent de Paul Society.  In many cases they have been doing their best to contribute to the support of deserted wives for years.  It might be no harm to have it on record that it was suggested that an assurance from that society that, to the best of their knowledge, a wife was deserted should carry considerable weight in convincing the Department she was, in fact, deserted.</P>
      <P>I should like to add to what Deputy Corish said about social welfare officers because I believe they are concerned about the amount of work this Bill will place on them.  I am not sorry that it will place additional work on them because that means that more benefits will be brought to people who need them but if the officers are to have considerable extra work thrust on them they should be adequately compensated.

      <P>Sorry, the day after.  I hope she took appropriate action to qualify.  There is a qualification here that she must be between 50 and 70 if she has no children.  This could limit the number of people who would qualify and the amount of money which will be paid out.  Can any provision be made for the person who has no children to look after, who has been married for a number of years, whose husband has deserted her, who is unable to work due to illness and who has no entitlement to sickness benefit?  There are quite a number of these people.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is very kind to make that point.  I was hoping <Col N="1714" /> he would, and I intended to ask why some provision could not be made for these people.  People over 50 are in the very same situation as the single people, as the Minister says, but under 50 if they are ill there is a difference. Many of them would be suffering from mental strain and so on.  A single person has this advantage.  She may possibly at that age get married, whereas the married woman whose husband has deserted her, being under 50, cannot hope to.  If she is unable to work due to illness she is in a very poor way, depending on the charity of the local authorities, and local authorities look with a very jaundiced eye on these people before they give them any benefit.  They are really hardship cases.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that the situation of such a woman is a difficult one, and a single woman in these circumstances has to depend on public assistance, and this would be the position of a deserted wife under 50. Fifty was chosen because from that age on it becomes increasingly difficult to get a job anyway, but Deputies will appreciate this is new and it is experimental. It certainly is conceivable that the qualifying age would be lowered in the future, but at this experimental stage we do not consider it prudent to put it any lower than that.</P>

There is just one other matter.  In regard to the woman who is drawing a widow's pension, if my memory serves me rightly the age has been reduced from 50.

Is there any way in which this can be dealt with?  Again there is the matter of the man who returns after a long number of years.  Such cases can arise. Men have disappeared and have not returned and the wives have been treated as grass widows&mdash;I think that is the term.  Can there not be a limit to the number of years?

      <P>Would the Minister consider advising investigating officers, who I understand investigate also for the Department of Defence, that it is not necessary to count the number of apples on a tree or to find out if hens are laying eggs?  I know of such cases although I do not know of any in the last 12 months.  This matter should be dealt with in a Christian way.  It may be that they consider that if they do not do this strictly the Department may feel that they are not doing their jobs and they could be done without. They are a group of people for whom I am sorry because many people dislike them and feel that they are overstepping their duties.  These officials should be told that they do not have to go into all the details.  Apparently they start off with the idea that they must prove that people are not entitled to the benefit.  I would suggest to the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary, who has a very soft heart, that the objective should be to see that deserving cases are considered and not to disqualify people, which appears to be the attitude of mind at the moment.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that this is a difficult problem because each person has a different idea of what is reasonable and what is unreasonable.  There are divergent views on the question of shirking of duty by the officer and what is being unchristian.  I know the attitude of the Minister for Social Welfare on this point because I have discussed it with him and I may add that my own attitude is the same.  I do not go quite as far as Deputy Tully, to say that the attitude should be to see how these people can be fitted in&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>However, one would hope that they would act as a normal conscientious person would act.  Different people will adopt different aproaches but what is outlined by Deputy Tully seems to be going too far. <Col N="1720" /> I do not think it is common or widespread and I do not think the Minister for Social Welfare would want it to be widespread.  That is not to say that the officers are to ignore the regulations and means but I think a reasonable approach is possible and, by and large, this is being achieved.  In any case in which the bounds are overstepped, if this is brought to the attention of the Minister it will be made clear to the officer concerned where he should draw the line.</P>

      <P>I think it would meet the wishes of all Members of this House if it went from the Minister to his most senior officers who are at present here down to the investigating officers in the country that they should have a more open and flexible attitude.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>In this case it appears the operative phrase is &ldquo;protect the fund&rdquo;.  Apparently the officers work on this principle and I shall quote the following case to illustrate my point.  An old man who had formerly been a tailor being self-employed had no stamps, and he had been getting food from people in return for patching clothes.  An officer went so far as to visit all the people concerned in an effort to find out exactly what the old man had received.  Eventually he got the old man disqualified not from a social welfare benefit but from an allowance he had from the Department of Defence.  After some time the whole business was straightened out but it caused much distress.  In cases such as this many of the officials are under the impression if they do not succeed in proving that an applicant is not entitled to benefit the Department will think they are not doing their job.  I realise that the officers are doing a good job and if they get the same advice from the Minister which he has just given to this House there would be better relations all round.</P>

      <P>There is one point about the number of people employed to which I should like to advert.  It is said that there are not sufficient officers to go around and perhaps this may be partly responsible for the present rather unsatisfactory state of affairs.  It is conceivable that if an officer has to do too much work he may be in a rather bad mood when he meets the applicant. I have been the subject of criticism from these officers because of the fact that they claim I have attacked them in the House.  I want to make it clear that as long as they administer the system <Col N="1722" /> in the manner in which it is administered I shall attack the system and the person who, in my opinion, is guilty of maladministration.  If there are not sufficient officers to do the job effectively, more people should be appointed; but they should be told that it is not their business to bend over backwards to deprive somebody of their just entitlement.  Perhaps it is merely a matter of interpretation but if the officers think they are advised in a certain way very severe hardship can be inflicted on the poor.</P>

First of all, the Minister on Second Reading referred to the fact that, because of the way this is done, it is difficult to know precisely what the position is but he went on to say that, specifically because of this, the explanatory memorandum had been designed to make the position clear.

It would probably not be discussed.  I imagine it would have put the whole thing out of order.  Therefore, I had to do it this way.  I honestly believe this is something which should not be thrown out immediately by the Minister.  If the changes I suggest are made I cannot see how they could affect the drafting of the Bill.  The Minister has his experts to advise him and I will have to accept what he says.  If he <Col N="1724" /> says it cannot be done there is no point in trying to force the issue.  All I ask is that someone will have a look at it.  The Seanad will have to deal with this Bill and there should be no problem at all.  It could come back here and we could agree to it.  Usually, indeed, there is no debate on amendments from the Seanad.  Because of the value of this I think it should be done.

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I should like to avail of this opportunity to ventilate a grievance a constituent has.  She is a widow.  She was married on 14th September, 1933, and she became a widow on 13th November, 1945.  Her insurable employment record is as follows: she was in insurable employment with the Great Southern Railways from March, 1927, to August, 1933, prior to her marriage.  She again entered into insurable employment on 12th December, 1949, and she remained in that employment until January, 1953. She entered the employment of CIE in January, 1953, and she remained there until 30th November, 1967, when she reached 60 years of age and retired. I understand CIE pay widows' and orphans' contributions for employees and, if that is so, this woman had a total of 24 years and four months insurable employment.  Her application for a contributory pension was refused in 1968 under section 4 of the <Col N="1725" /> 1966 Social Welfare Act.  Admittedly, the bulk of this woman's contributions would appear to have been paid after she became a widow.  This is a case which would not arise very often and I would ask the Minister to look into the case on the facts I have given him. All her employment was with the railways, either the Great Southern or CIE.  She was in insurable employment for six years prior to her marriage and 18 years subsequent to her widowhood. I ask the Minister and his experts to examine the case.  It appears to me to have great merit.  If the Minister agrees with me I would ask him to bring in an amendment on Report Stage to qualify this widow for a pension. I believe the Parliamentary Secretary knows the case.</P>

      <P>I know&mdash;but I am not convinced.  It is utterly ridiculous that social welfare benefit is not paid to entitled persons who have been stamping cards for a long number of years if, due to default by the employer, the card is not stamped.  We incorporated a proposal in the amendment that there would be an extra 1d on the stamp to pay for the loss: therefore, nobody could say it would involve a charge on the Exchequer.  I raised this point on the Second Reading.  The Minister for Social Welfare expressed sympathy for the people concerned.  He said it was difficult to recover from employers who went bankrupt.  A great many wealthy employers fail to stamp insurance cards and brazenly refuse to pay the benefit due to workers even though they stopped the employee's share of the insurance stamp.  Under the occupational injuries scheme the State pay the benefit and recover it from the employer.  We suggest this as a way to deal with the problem.  If the Minister for Social Welfare has not considered this aspect, or if it is not intended to do it immediately, would he and his advisers look into this matter and put an end to the grave hardship that arises due to the failure of an employer to stamp the insurance card for his employee.  Frequently, such workers have been a long time with their employer.</P>

It is amazing the number of times we have to employ a solicitor to recover from employers money due to unfortunate people who are unemployed or ill and who may have been so for lengthy periods before coming to us with a complaint.  Either the Department should recover it immediately or pay it and then recover it. They are in a much better position to do so.  If there is a charge for the purpose of having it paid, I do not think there would be any complaint. Most people know that it could be their turn next time.</P>

      <P>This is a rather mean section.  To those who drafted the Bill, and possibly to ourselves in this House, the amount of money involved may appear very small.  I travel among many people with limited means.  The amount of loss sustained, even for short <Col N="1729" /> periods, is quite substantial to those people.  They should not have been included.  I am afraid I possibly tempted them to do it because I suspected something like this might happen and I put down a question to the Minister for Social Welfare a few months ago, shortly after the Budget, asking if this was happening this year.</P>
      <P>I see it is being copperfastened by a section in this Bill.  Normally they hoped no one would notice that, for a short period, they were entitled to a higher amount.  It used to be August to the following January, or October to the following January.  This time because it is a relatively short period and I am quite sure it was felt that the loss of £1 or £2 would not matter very much, but the loss of £1 or £2 to people who are depending on another few pounds per week to live represents luxury.  This section should not have been put into the Bill.</P>

First of all, I should say that this section really underlines the policy decision taken by the Government that the increases should commence from the beginning of August.  I should also say that, in a situation where a person would be entitled to the advantage envisaged here on a permanent basis, there is no restriction.  It is only on the temporary one.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the section I wanted to deal with earlier.  A number of years ago a change was made.  For a long time a person could have an income of £26 per year without non-contributory benefits being affected. Then it was decided that there should be a change and the amount was reduced to nil.  If a person had any income that could be assessed, the pension was reduced by 5s per week. This applied to non-contributory old age pensions and non-contributory widows' pensions.</P>
      <P>When the question of income arose, many of us were surprised to find that a cottage or house occupied by an old person, no matter what condition it was in, was considered to be income. A vested cottage was considered to be income.  A person who was unfortunate, or fortunate, enough to be living in a vested county council cottage, for which some of them were paying only 6½d per week, lost 5s per week to the State so the rent of the cottage was 5s 6½d and not 6½d.  The same thing applied where somebody was living with a friend.  A value was put on the bed and 5s per week was deducted because of the fact that the person had accommodation, even though he or she had to buy food, clothing and fuel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Labour tried to correct me here the other day.  He said that so far as houses were concerned exceptions were made.  I knew there was an exception and I said to him that the exception he was talking about was a tumble-down old thatched house in County Donegal.  Deputy Paddy Harte had kicked up such a row that the house was eventually taken as not being means and that old lady got her extra <Col N="1732" /> 5s.  I am aware of no other case in which the house has been exempted.</P>
    <P>An exemption has now been put in for a county council vested cottage on which the annuity is not completed. For those who do not know what the situation is, let me explain that, when a cottage is vested, the amount of vesting may be from 6½d per week to 10s or 12s per week over a period of anything between ten and 44 years.  The cottage and plot are one entity.  Somebody put in a section here which precludes the house from being counted as income but not the plot.  What did they think they were playing at?  The two are paid for together and go together.  In what way could the cottage be precluded without precluding the plot as well?  Was the person who put it in not aware of this, or is there some special reason why it was done in this way?  If it was put in with the full knowledge of the person who put this section into the Bill of what he was doing all I can say is, thanks for nothing. The people concerned get nothing out of it.  They are living in the cottage and the plot is beside it.  Can they dig up the cottage and move it away from the plot?  Otherwise they are stuck.</P>
    <P>When vesting is completed, all it means to the ordinary people is that they do not have to continue paying the small annuity of 6d or 9d or 11d per week, or whatever it is.  If this went through as it is, the cottage and plot would be included and they would be back in the same position and would lose 5s a week as soon as they became full owners of the vested cottages.  The Minister might have an explanation which may have escaped me and, if he has, I should be glad to hear it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>We have to go back a little to get the background to this. Some time ago the regulations were changed to bring the figure from £26 per year down to nil but in the case of unvested labourers' cottages the rent which was paid was deemed to account for the annual value of the House and, therefore, having the house did not count while you were paying the rent. Once you entered into the purchase scheme the value of the cottage was taken into account.  The effect of this <Col N="1733" /> section is to take the value of the cottage out so that it is not true to say that people will not get any benefit. When Deputy Tully said: &ldquo;Thanks for nothing; this does nothing for them&rdquo; that is not correct.  At least it takes the value of the cottage out of assessment where heretofore it was in.</P>
      <P>Secondly, in the case of the plot, some plots may be completely unproductive and some quite lucratively productive and in practice there can be a considerable difference in the means derived from a plot.  It is on that basis the distinction is made here.  Even some people who have means in addition to the cottage and plot may benefit from a higher rate under this provision even though it may be a small improvement. To say this is not of benefit is quite inaccurate.  It may not go as far as Deputy Tully would like but it operates as a relieving section and should benefit virtually all envisaged in this context and some who have a cottage and plot and some means in addition.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>This is coming to the root of the whole question of means tests.  One could argue&mdash;in fact, we have often heard it argued&mdash;that somebody who has been very industrious all his life and accumulated something for his old age, is penalised. This is a very old argument into which I do not think I should enter now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Minister will not think me rude but what he has just said shows that he does not understand the position.  If the plot were productive and producing an income that income would automatically be counted whether or not the cottage and plot were put out of assessment.  That income could be easily assessed and would normally be counted.  If the plot produced only £26 a year, which would be the next step, it would not be very productive so that hare, as I said before, will not run.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position, from what the Minister <Col N="1734" /> said, is that somebody was trying to be too clever and took out the cottage but did not take out the plot. Unfortunately, most of the vested cottages in which you find old people living have a plot either untilled or badly tilled because the old folk are unable to do it or it does not pay them. They do not use much of the produce and do not sell it.  They are not in the market garden business.  What the Minister has done by excluding the cottage and not excluding the plot is to leave them in the very same position as they were previously, and this applies to the whole class of vested cottiers.</P>
    <P>I grant it may have been done in error by people who may not have known what the situation was.  It is very easy to make a mistake.  One can do something with the best intentions and it may still turn out wrong.  I ask the Minister and his advisers to look again at this matter.  The Bill will not have to be redrafted.  It will simply mean taking out three or four words to rectify the position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>But that is for the reason I have been mentioning.  Before it was vested the value did not operate because the rent was deemed to cancel <Col N="1736" /> it out.  When it became vested it was calculated because there was no rent to set off against it.  This section is restoring that position.  You do not assess the cottage.</P>

You assess what he is making out of his house and it will deprive him of the pension.  What the Minister is saying here is that the land of the cottage, for which he is paying in his annuity just as he is paying for the cottage itself, is not taken into account but if he plants cabbage or potatoes in the garden, even for his own use, they are counted against him and this will deprive him of benefit.

      <P>We are very careful in this House when it comes to the application of a means test for the payment of allowances to the poorest people in the country.  There was strong objection here from all sides of the House when there was a provision proposed to the effect that a vested cottage would constitute means for the purpose of qualifying for an old age or a non-contributory old age pension, meaning that they would not get the maximum amount.  Practically every housing authority in the rural areas has encouraged people to buy their cottages so as to relieve the ratepayers in the various areas of a certain amount of expense, particularly in regard to the repair of <Col N="1738" /> cottages.  The Minister talks about the value of a cottage; as far as I can gather&mdash;I may be wrong in this&mdash;as soon as the payments are completed, the value of the cottage may be assessed as means.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Will be.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Will be assessed as means.  Therefore, the Minister and the Government regard this little labourer's cottage as constituting value to old age pensioners of 75 or 80 years of age as if they intended to convert it or make some money out of it.  As far as the cottage is concerned, it is a home for them for the remaining years of their lives.  It is scandalous that it should constitute means for the purpose of deciding whether or not a person should get the maximum non-contributory old age or widow's pension.  It is of no value to the pensioner where it is bought out only as a home.  Surely we are not going to assess a home as means for the purpose of depriving these people of the maximum pension.  We are merely talking about a plot of a quarter of an acer or half an acre.  The Minister should know also that in the majority of these cases the plots are not used at all by the old age pensioner or by the widow.  How does the Minister intend to assess the value of that plot to the applicant for the maximum rate?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should consider this.  Anyone in the country can get £300, or maybe more in some cases, as a grant from the local authority for building a house of 1,249 square feet.  Any farmer&mdash;and I do not begrudge it to him&mdash;can get grants for various purposes without any means test.  Anyone who wants to start an industry here or to expand one can get money.  There are no qualifications like those that are applied to the poorest people in the land who are getting £4 or £4 5s per week and who would be deprived of 5s per week merely because they had a quarter of an acre or because they had a few hens or a few apple trees.</P>
      <P>This is a very bad provision and this was said on both sides of the House when it was first introduced.  The Minister, in consultation with his colleague, the Minister for Social Welfare, should do as Deputy Tully suggests&mdash; and this would be limited&mdash;exclude the plot of land with the cottage and do not let us here in this House keep badgering and plaguing these unfortunate people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Deputy suggesting we should exclude the plot no matter what use is made of it or what income is derived from it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose that the Minister should accept Deputy Tully's proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that not what it amounts to?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it is not, and I shall spell it out in words of two syllables if the Minister cannot understand it. If the land is being used for market gardening and the produce is being sold, then the Department are entitled to and will put a value on what comes off it.  If it is simply being tilled or half-tilled or not tilled at all by the people who live in the house, it should not have a value put on it.  The question was asked a while ago, what is &ldquo;use&rdquo;?  If a county council plot is vested and you do not go near it at all it will grow grass and one of two things will happen: a neighbour may put a cow or a calf in it for a couple <Col N="1740" /> of weeks, or someone will cut the hay and give back a bag of potatoes to the old person instead of it; he may give nothing at all or he may give him a few drinks, if the old person is fond of a drink, at the weekend.  That is all the value that is involved in this, a quarter of an acre or half an acre, or a maximum of one acre.  We are not asking too much.  In view of the fact that the Minister&mdash;and I give him credit for this&mdash;thought of the idea of excluding the vested cottage, surely he should now be prepared to go a little further and exclude the plot as well?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we are at cross purposes.  I do not disagree with the Deputy.  I would be prepared to accept that the use of the plot just for the household should not count as means, but excluding the plot, as the Deputy says, does not meet the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Excluding the house does not exclude them if people start a shop in the house?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not mind the Minister's officer making the inquiry but what I do mind is an investigating officer looking at a plot, as has happened where there was a ridge of potatoes for about 50 yards and about 50 cabbage plants planted by a widow and a value of 4s per week was put by the investigating officer on that produce in order to deprive that widow of the amount which she would get in one category as against another.  This sort of thing can happen again and <Col N="1741" /> if this is left in we will be plaguing the Department's officials to have cases investigated.  I suggest that cottage and plot be left out completely. Just omit the words which the Minister put in saying &ldquo;excluding any plot&rdquo;.  If the Minister takes those words out I am satisfied he can still catch the person concerned if he has a market garden or he is selling valuable produce off the plot.  The Minister can catch that person just as if the person started a shop in his house.  It is not a question of the Minister having to back down; we have had a good argument and we should have convinced him.</P>

I can visualise that if you just say &ldquo;commercially&rdquo; it would open the door to other things.  There are circumstances in which the plot is not attached to the house.</P>

      <P>Just listen to me.  I get a bit tired too when I find this kind of changing of feet going on and I am accused of changing feet.  I have said on a number of occasions, and the Deputy has not disagreed with me, that the effect of this section is to exclude the cottage from the computation of means.  Secondly, that in so far as the plot is concerned the mere ownership of the plot does not and will not count for means; it is the use which is made of the plot that counts for means.  The area of difficulty that arises is in the use which is made of the plot.  The deletion of the words here does not affect the use which is made of the plot and how that is assessed.  I said that I would be prepared to accept in so far as the use is concerned that the use of the plot for the production of vegetables and so on for consumption in the house would not count as means, but excluding the words here does not solve the problem and is not relevant to the problem.</P>

I am prepared to take the Minister's word that he believes he can deal with this in the <Col N="1744" /> way he said he could but he is not the Minister dealing with social welfare and the interpreation put on it in this House is very often not the interpretation given by people outside.

    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Deputy Hogan.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Earlier today we were <Col N="1746" /> discussing this Temporary Reduction of Valuation Bill which might be more properly titled the permanent disappearance of reduction of valuation. The Minister mentioned that he would give consideration during the phasing out period to an amendment I had put down.  The phasing out period would last until the end of March, 1972, and during that time the Minister mentioned he would give some consideration to the points raised.</P>
      <P>I consider this is totally unrealistic. People who have enjoyed abatement for seven years, if they have not been lucky enough to have made application for building permission before the 9th December, 1969, will have to pay rates in full.  Even if the Minister decides in 1972 to give selective abatement the fact remains that these people have had to pay in the meantime.  There is no selectivity about this measure and all those who have previously got the benefit of abatement will now be deprived of that benefit.  I do not think the Minister's suggestion that he should use the phasing out period to consider this matter of abatement is realistic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister intends to give selective abatement now is the time to do it and not to wait until 1972 or even later to introduce a new measure applying selective abatement.  I accept the idea that large concerns may not be unduly worried about reduction of valuation but it is extremely important to the less well-off sections of the community. To deprive such people of what they have enjoyed for the past 50 years is too radical a change to be carried out immediately.  If we arrive eventually at the stage at which the whole matter of abatement of valuation is abolished this should be done gradually and the Minister would have been well advised to have introduced this measure in a phased fashion.  Coming to the House, having decided that certain sections would still enjoy abatement of rates, I put in &ldquo;owner-occupied residential premises&rdquo;.  First of all, I thought of putting down valuations and then certain occupations; it is not easy to draft an amendment covering certain sections in respect of whom one would like to continue the concession.  It is a matter which requires thought.  I put <Col N="1747" /> in &ldquo;owner-occupied residential premises&rdquo; to cover one section which might continue to benefit.  As against that, the Minister may say that there are others who are badly off whom I have not included.  There are those people who live over their business premises who are quite well-to-do.  The well-to-do publican may live above his premises.  By and large, this is the simplest way I could do it: pick out the small shopkeeper who does not have a house in the suburbs, who is forced to live with his family above his shop, with a kitchen, perhaps, at the back of the shop.  That is the usual pattern in the towns and villages throughout the country.  These people enjoyed this abatement up to now.  The Minister proposes to remove it from them.  I see no justification for doing that in this wholesale fashion, lumping everybody in with large insurance companies, banks, supermarkets and so on. He could surely have introduced a more selective type of abolition.  By all means let him take the concession away from the large concerns but it is unjust to take it away so abruptly from the less well-off in our society.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Local Government announced this phasing out on 9th December, 1969.  No warning whatsoever was given until the Minister made the announcement: &ldquo;All planning applications thereafter will cease to qualify for temporary abatement of valuation.&rdquo; Really this legislation is retrospective.  The Minister could have named an operative date.  He will tell me that, had he done so, there would have been an avalanche of applications for planning permission.  There might have been, but I doubt if the situation would have been all that difficult.  By and large, I doubt if there would have been a tremendous rush.  Even if there were I do not think it would matter very much.  An 11th-hour rush would neither kill nor cure anybody.</P>
    <P>I tabled this amendment for the purpose of lending some measure of justice to the Bill.  As the Bill stands, it is very coercive.  This is something people did not expect.  It is something which will be bad for the building industry. These people employed small contractors <Col N="1748" /> or small local tradesmen.  I think the amendment is a very humane one.  Indeed, I think the Minister himself would wish the Bill was somewhat different.  He has expressed his sympathy with the ideas I have put forward.  I appeal to him to accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Molloy) Robert Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make it quite clear to Deputy Hogan that, whatever sympathy I may have expressed, I cannot agree to accept his amendment as it stands.  It is most unrealistic.  The Deputy has more or less admitted that there is great difficulty in introducing legislation giving remission to specific classes.  There is need for a very close study and a full review of the whole rating system before positive proposals can be brought forward in regard to the type of development to which this remission should extend.  I should not like the Deputy to think that, because I said this would be considered during the phasing out period, that meant I would not have the legislation until March, 1972.  I hope to have it before that.</P>
      <P>With regard to the amendment, this is not a precise way in which to identify small businesses which might merit consideration.  Straightaway we would be distinguishing between the small shopkeeper living over his premises and the shopkeeper who owned a lock-up shop with no residential accommodation overhead.  Such legislation would have many anomalies in it and would be open to different interpretations. The owner of a supermarket, for the sake of qualifying for a remission of rates for seven years, might build a small residence for himself above his supermarket.  I do not think the Deputy wants to cater for that kind of possibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should point out that only those owners of owner-occupied shops, which were being substantially improved or reconstructed, would qualify for the remission.  In fact, they would qualify for only part of the total increase in valuation arising out of the improvements, a very minimal benefit indeed. Listening to Deputy Hogan, one would think that shopkeepers all over the country were going to have something <Col N="1749" /> taken away from them.  The remission applies for only seven years and those in business for longer than seven years would require to carry out major improvements to their premises in order to qualify and they would then qualify only for that part of the total increase in the valuation arising out of the improvements. My personal concern, let me emphasise, is with the wider problems facing small shopkeepers and not just with those who can afford to improve their premises.</P>
    <P>There are other ways in which this problem could possibly be met.  One of them might be a review of the valuation system.  It is unrealistic to put forward this amendment.  It would create anomalous legislation which would be difficult to implement and which would not be of benefit to many shopkeepers. I regret I cannot accept the amendment.  I would ask the Deputy to withdraw it and to accept in good faith my expression of concern, the review and my hope to introduce legislation later which will meet the problem more adequately.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I find it difficult to look kindly on the Minister's suggestion about legislation at a future date to deal with cases which might and should receive sympathetic consideration.  He says it may be possible to introduce that type of legislation earlier than 1972 but that the matter needs close study and full review.  One would think that, when this Bill was being drafted, the necessary close study and full review would have been applied to the situation.  Abatement of rates has been in operation in this country for 50 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister could have carried out the close study and full review before introducing this Bill so that it would be a graduated measure.  He has introduced a Bill which is taking away abatement from everybody and indicates that he will sit back and carry out what he calls a close study and full review and, when that is completed, return to this House like Santa Claus and announce concessions to certain sections of our society.  In the meantime, people will wonder whether <Col N="1750" /> they should carry out necessary work; whether they should improve the little shop and have their valuation raised or whether they should wait until the Minister for Local Government has carried out his close study and full review and restored to them what they had before.</P>
    <P>This is a laughable piece of legislation. It is an ill-conceived Bill.  The Minister implied that the measure was defective when he said he was in sympathy with my proposal.  Would society stop if this Bill were not brought in?  Can this Bill be deferred until next year?  Would our economic situation collapse?  There is no urgency about this Bill.  It is not an emergency Bill in any sense.  The in-between period is quite unnecessary.  If the Minister had passed from full abatement to partial abatement&mdash;in other words, selective abatement&mdash;it would be a logical procedure in so far as he admits that he is in sympathy with my amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy Hogan's excellent case.  In proposing to oblige shopkeepers who improve their shop premises to pay the full load of rates from the moment of improvement, the Minister is kicking the small shopkeepers of Ireland in the stomach at a time when many of them are being forced to close down because of the immense competition in the retail trade which is financed to a large extent by foreign entrepreneurs.  There is no justification for the Minister's conduct in coming to this Dáil with a Bill which he admits will harm small shopkeepers&mdash;a Bill which he has acknowledged is lacking in sympathy for and understanding of the problems of the small shopkeeper.  The most he can say, in effect, is: &ldquo;Give me this.  Let me put down the small shopkeeper.  I will think about giving him back some form of relief in the future.&rdquo; That is not enough.  It is an insult to the small shopkeeper and it is an insult to this Parliament.  It is totally unworthy of the Minister.  He is not obliged to proceed with his predecessor's Bill.  On his own admission he accepts that it is a faulty and unfair proposal to make. The honourable and proper thing for him to do would be to withdraw it.  If <Col N="1751" /> he wants to see to it that the large wealthy investor pays full rates from the start on his building, or from the moment it is completed, he can do that in a measure even shorter than the one which we are asked to pass tonight.</P>
      <P>We have to make a fundamental decision.  Do we want the small shopkeeper to continue in our midst?  Do we accept that the small shopkeeper has a contribution to make to our society?  Are we in favour of the personal manner in which the retail trade was conducted in the past?  Do we believe that the small shopkeeper is a person with roots in the community, loyal to the community in which he lives and who, because of that, can make a contribution to our society and our economy which we cannot expect from the runners-in who may be chasing profits in the retail trade but have their loyalties elsewhere?</P>
      <P>Do we think it is preferable to encourage the small Irish shopkeeper, who has his roots in the community, rather than to facilitate people who, because of their vast capital resources, can move in from abroad and, because of the capital they have to invest, can make vast profits and, having made their profits, can export the profits and avoid paying tax on them?  Profits earned from the money of the Irish consumer are leaving this country year in and year out and are not paying the proper share of Irish tax because of various tax agreements we have with other countries.  The question is whether or not we want to continue to encourage that development, which may have its own contribution to make to our retail trade and to our economy, and facilitate it against the small shopkeeper who is, as the Minister should know even better than I, the mainstay of rural Ireland and of the towns in the provinces.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If small shops close in rural Ireland at the rate at which many have been forced to close in the past, serious damage will be done to the society and to the economy and the welfare of many rural communities.  This is a problem also in many suburban centres where small shops are being put out of business because of the competition of <Col N="1752" /> the vast supermarket chains which have been moving in.  These supermarkets may offer, or seem to offer, goods at more attractive prices than the small shopkeeper but, if they do, they do it by depriving people of other services they had in the past, such as personal attention.  They certainly deprive the community of the kind of worthwhile employment and worthwhile social stability which you get in a community served by small, individual, independent shopkeepers rather than by large impersonal chains.</P>
    <P>As a Parliament we have very properly provided incentives for Irish industrialists. We have provided and continue to provide incentives for Irish farmers.  We have retraining grants for people in industry, so that if they become disemployed in one activity they can get training to equip them for another.  We give tax concessions to industrialists and to exporters.  In the past half century, shopkeepers and other sections of the community have enjoyed freedom from the full rates liability.  Now, at a time when all other sections of the community are getting tax concessions and grants and assistance of one kind or another from the Government, we are proposing to victimise the small shopkeeper, the small factory owner, the small people who are deserving of more than the sympathy which the Minister has said he is prepared to give.</P>
    <P>The Minister's sympathy is of little value if your bank balance has gone from credit to debit and if the bank manager sends for you and tells you he has to close down your business.  The Minister's sympathy, offered in the Dáil on 22nd July, 1970, will not be of any assistance to those people when they are ruined.  What we should be doing is endeavouring to assist these people. We should take particular care not to do them a harm which is not done to them under our existing legislation.</P>
    <P>What is the reality facing many small shopkeepers at present?  They are finding the going hard.  Their only hope of survival is to modernise their premises.  Very often this modernisation requires investment in tearing down an old shop front and putting up <Col N="1753" /> a new one.  It is a rather negative form of investment.  It does not create new wealth.  Perhaps it entices people to come in and buy goods which they otherwise might not come in to buy. Because they do that, the rateable valuation of a small one-, two- or threeman shop may be raised by anything from £15 to £20 or £30.  Under our existing legislation, the additional rates burden in the following year might be £7 10s or £15.  The shopkeeper can weight that against the additional business he hopes to earn.  The effect of this piece of legislation will be that, instead of paying £7 10s or £15 in additional rates, he will find himself paying £75 or £150 rates in the following year simply because he has improved his premises.  In any case the increase will be big.</P>
    <P>This Bill will be another nail in the coffin of the small shopkeepers.  It would be utterly unworthy behaviour for this House to give its approval to a measure of this kind merely because the Minister says: &ldquo;My predecessor introduced this.  I am in sympathy with the people it will harm.  I promise to take a look at their problems and bring in another measure later on.&rdquo; As Deputy Hogan has very properly said, the thing is not to do the harm or not even to propose to do it, and to accept his amendment which I think is very reasonable, or to give an undertaking to consider an amendment which would meet the kind of problems which Deputy Hogan has very properly outlined.</P>
    <P>My only criticism of Deputy Hogan's excellent amendment is that it is limited to premises which are owner-occupied. Of course, there are many lock-up shops in which there is no residential accommodation available. The owners of such shops should have facilities similar to that which Deputy Hogan suggests.  It seems to me that if the Minister is looking for a ready and easy way to provide relief for the kind of people he should be assisting, he can do so by providing that the relief which has hitherto existed will continue to apply to persons with rateable valuations of £50 or less.  Something of that kind would meet, in a fairly simple way, the problems of the small property <Col N="1754" /> owners who are deserving of a continuation of the reliefs which they and their fathers hitherto enjoyed.</P>
    <P>Not only are the Government proposing to kick the small shopkeeper in this respect by providing this discouragement to improve his premises but, as we have been debating over the past few days, the Government also propose to increase the stamp duty on the sale of goodwill of shops from 1 to 3 per cent.  Here, again, we have this deliberate effort, apparently, by the Government to do down the small man in our community.  I believe this is unfair to the individuals involved and that it will do untold harm to the moral fibre of many of our communities.  The small shopkeeper has enough to contend with as things stand, with the large international investment of capital in the retail trade, and with the development of mobile shops which are not paying an appropriate share of either rates or taxes.  In that situation, to select for further punitive treatment those who have to carry the most and are least able to do it is a proposal totally unworthy of the Minister.</P>
    <P>This Bill also proposes to deprive householders of new houses which do not qualify for the Government grant of the relief of rates which they previously enjoyed.  All this is done because the Minister has argued&mdash;rightly, I think&mdash;that the wealthy should be asked to pay their full share of rates. With that argument nobody disagrees but we assert that, as it is right to ask the wealthy to pay what they can afford to pay, it is wrong to drag into the net people who are not in a position to pay.  That is exactly what the Minister is doing.  It is not good enough to say: &ldquo;I shall take a second look at it.  So long as you will give me this stick with which to beat the small man I shall promise to soften the blow but I must have the big stick before I am prepared to continue the concessions they enjoyed in the past or to give them any concession in the future.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister said that the assistance offered by way of relief of rates was offered in the first instance and throughout the past 50 years because it was of assistance to the building trade, that it was a concession to the <Col N="1755" /> construction industry which does not need it at present because the industry is working at full output.  Reconstruction and improvement which is the kind of thing we must encourage if our existing stock of property is to be maintained in good condition is done mainly by the small builder or contractor and he needs encouragement today as much as he did in the past. That encouragement to the small contractor will be withdrawn if the small employer is discouraged from reconstruction and improvement.  That is what this Bill will certainly do, discourage people from reconstruction or improvement or building small additions to their property.  It will, therefore, do very serious harm to small builders and contractors, and the group that the present Government have selected for further burdens in this year's Finance Bill because they are to be caught under new tax proposals and subjected to more rigorous tax impositions than those which previously applied to them.</P>
    <P>When difficulties arise in the construction industry&mdash;and this has been the sorry cycle of events through the years and it is not likely to be cured for ever&mdash;the first people to suffer and suffer most grievously are the small builders and contractors.  It is entirely wrong, therefore, that a Bill aimed at requiring the proper contribution from the wealthy and at removing benefits which were available for the big contractor should cause harm to the small contractor.  That is certainly the effect of this Bill.</P>
    <P>This is a wholly unworthy Bill.  We are providing a disincentive to improvements and imposing a new burden on people who are not in a position to bear it.  The way in which the Minister can mend his hand is to be magnanimous enough to say: &ldquo;I shall meet the point the Opposition are making by providing that people with smaller properties will still enjoy this concession in future.&rdquo;  He is allowing the concession to apply to people who live in small dwellings.  Why not also allow it to apply to people who are trying very hard to make a living for themselves and their families in the small properties? That is all we ask.  It is not <Col N="1756" /> a great deal.  If the Minister has in mind providing some kind of concession for these people in future&mdash;I think he has &mdash;let him be big enough to do it now. Certainly, as Deputy Hogan said it will not do untold harm to our economy to allow that concession to continue for the small man for a year or two while the Minister takes another look at the situation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The main reason for introducing the Bill, as I have said previously, is to ensure that whatever assistance we give by way of rate remission is given to the section of the community most deserving of it.  All those who qualify for State housing grants will continue to qualify for this rate remission.  That should be quite clear.  It is the policy of the Government as far as possible within our resources to ensure the channelling of as much assistance as possible towards the provision of houses for people of modest means&mdash;those who, in the main, cannot afford to build houses without State assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My concern in regard to the Bill lies with the ratepayers.  Under this remission of valuation a hidden subsidy has been granted to certain sections of the community at the expense of the ratepayers. This subsidy amounts to between £1¼ million and £1½ million and, in the main, it goes to a section which, in my firm opinion, are not in need of this kind of help.  Those who can afford to come here and establish supermarkets, to my mind, should not be aided by the State granting them two-thirds remission for seven years of the rates on the valuation of those buildings.  It is quite unworthy of the Deputy opposite to suggest that the removal of this particular remission will operate in some secret way against the shopkeepers and cause them great financial difficulty.  The purpose of the Bill is to ensure that the State is not giving assistance to the type of persons who, as I have readily admitted, are creating difficulty for small shopkeepers. The idea of highlighting the effects if this section on small shopkeepers is most unworthy.  I regret that the Deputy has twisted my obvious concern for that section of the community in such a way.  Obviously, this <Col N="1757" /> is being done from political motives and not out of genuine concern for the people involved.  I cannot accept the amendment.  It is impracticable as drafted.  It is imprecise and would not <Col N="1758" /> be operable.  For those, and the other reasons I have given, I cannot accept it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lalor)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Committee agree with the Seanad in amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 3.</P>
      <P>In page 4, before section 3, the following new section inserted:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1)  In a contract of sale of goods of a kind in relation to which an order under section 2 of this Act applies, there is an implied warranty that the packing of the goods is not in contravention of the provisions of this Act or of an order under this Act and is not such as to occasion, in relation to the sale or importation of the goods, a contravention of those provisions.</P>
      <P>(2)  A contract of sale that has the effect, directly or indirectly, of depriving a person of the benefit of a warranty of the kind specified in subsection (1) of this section shall, in so far as it has the effect aforesaid, be void.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The effect of this amendment is that if packaged goods are not marked in accordance with the relevant order not only will it be an offence which can be prosecuted but in addition the purchaser can take civil action to recover any damages he has suffered as a result. During the debate on this Bill in the Seanad it was suggested that the Bill should contain a provision which would protect the civil rights of a person who is damaged by a breach of the requirements. There is such a provision in section 17 of the Merchandise Marks Act of 1887 which lays down that a vendor shall be deemed to warrant that a trade mark or description of the goods he is selling is not false.  This provision would ordinarily give adequate protection to the civil rights of <Col N="1760" /> purchasers damaged by the breach of the Merchandise Marks Act but it was pointed out that under that section it is possible for a vendor to evade his liability in this matter by giving the purchaser a note to that effect at the time of the sale or contract.  This is the object of the amendment as suggested to me in the Seanad and this is the reason for my acceptance of the amendment.</P>

      <P Just="Center">SECTION 4.</P>
      <P>In page 5, subsection (4), lines 46 to 54, deleted and the following substituted:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(4)  Where a person is charged with an offence under this Act in relation to goods packed in a container, it shall be a defence to the charge for him to show&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  that he took reasonable precautions against committing, in relation to the goods, an offence of the kind with which he is charged,</P>
      <P>(b)  that at the time of the commission of the alleged offence, he had no reason to suspect that the packing, importation or sale, as the case may be, of the goods was in contravention of the provisions of this Act or of an order under this Act, and</P>
      <P>(c)  that the packing, importation or sale, as the case may be, of the goods in contravention of the provisions of this Act or of an order under this Act, was due to a cause beyond his control.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This is an amendment which I accepted in the Dáil from Deputy Donegan and in the Seanad my attention was drawn to the fact that from a drafting point of view it was not too correct.</P>

      <P>This amendment was suggested in the Seanad arising from <Col N="1761" /> the necessity to have it redrafted.  In fact, this amendment is a technical putting in order of an amendment Deputy Donegan and I devised here and it is a question of a straightforward drafting arrangement providing as an additional defence that the person charged had at the time no reason to suspect that an offence was committed.</P>

      <P>As the Minister has pointed out, the amendment sent to the Seanad was concocted by the Minister and myself in about three minutes. While I am confident the Minister and I are excellent draftsmen, as the Seanad is a more leisurely institution perhaps Members of that House might have been in a position to improve on the amendment.</P>
      <P>There has been some criticism regarding the fact that apparently there will be the necessity for makers of crockery who export to this country to stamp the name of the country of origin both in English and Irish.  Statements have been made that manufacturers will not do this because the amount sent to this country would be too small to make this practicable.  I should like to know the Minister's view on this matter and to find out if he is going to insist that this will be done. Perhaps the Minister does not have knowledge of this?</P>

      <P>I have made an order that there must be dual language markings on pottery.  The reason this Bill is involved is from the point of view of granting exemptions in certain cases. In this Bill it is possible that exemptions can be made for any type of pottery or ceramics not manufactured in this country.  However, in connection with the order regarding dual language, at the present time I have no intention of not adhering to that regulation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Conney Mr. Conney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Conney</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to this section the offences it creates will depend essentially on the subjective assessment of the inspectors.  I realise it is impossible to establish subjective standards but there will be a certain amount of subjective judgment as to whether a horse is in a condition likely to cause suffering.  One can imagine an old horse with knocks or some equivalent <Col N="1763" /> ailment which is not causing any suffering but which could well give the appearance of suffering.  If you are going to have subjective standards, and I submit they cannot be avoided in this section, it would be important to insert the word &ldquo;knowingly&rdquo; in each of the subsections so that the offence is knowingly committed by the owner of the riding school or riding establishment. At the moment it creates an absolute offence based on a subjective assessment by an inspector of the Department.  I suggest it would be more equitable to insert that it would be necessary to prove that the offence was knowingly committed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>If that amendment were made it would open the door to a type of ill-treatment that could be common enough.  It would be legalising a type of ill-treatment that arises from ignorance of the proper way to handle animals.  So far as the subjectivity of the examination that will be carried out under this section is concerned, we must expect that the people who carry out such inspections would be able to recognise real ill-treatment.  I consider the section as drafted in the Bill more effective that what Deputy Cooney has suggested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister would compromise and insert the idea of <i>mens re</i> in subparagraph (a) only?  I agree that with regard to equipment or failing to provide a cure it would not be necessary but it should be applied in cases where a horse that is suffering from some ailment is let out on hire.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Deputy not agree that this could open the way for much unwitting ill-treatment of horses?  I accept that such unwitting ill-treatment might in a way be blameless but nevertheless it would be real. I think that section 31, subparagraph (a) as it stands would be more effective and would provide more protection for the animals than what Deputy Cooney has suggested.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>On looking at the matter in a certain way one would have to agree with the Minister.  If a person is so incompetent as unwittingly to cause any suffering to a <Col N="1764" /> horse or unwittingly to countenance it after it happens, that person's licence could stand to be revoked.  My objection is one of principle; a provision where the offence is based on subjective assessment creating an absolute offence is objectionable in any legislation.</P>

He would be unfit for hire.  I do not think we should specify in the subsection that he was for hire.

    <Title>Tourist Traffic Bill, 1970: Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. B. Lenihan) Brian (Snr.) Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. B. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;. The purposes of the Bill are, first, to raise the statutory limit on the aggregate amount which may be paid to Bord Fáilte for the giving of grants for the development of holiday accommodation, secondly, to raise the statutory limit on the aggregate amount of loans which may be guaranteed for the development of tourist projects and to extend the time limit on the giving of such guarantees and, thirdly, to provide for the registration of approved holiday accommodation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Grants for the development of holiday accommodation were first introduced in 1959 and provision was made in the Tourist Traffic Act, 1959, for the payment to Bord Fáilte of sums not exceeding an aggregate of £500,000 for the purpose.  As the tourist industry developed and accommodation needs expanded this limit was successively raised to £1.5 million by the Tourist Traffic Act, 1963, to £3 million by the Tourist Traffic Act, <Col N="1766" /> 1966, and to £5.5 million by the Tourist Traffic Act, 1968.  The total amount issued to Bord Fáilte for accommodation development grants up to 31st March, 1970, was £4,930,000, which leaves a balance of £570,000 before the statutory limit of £5.5 million is reached.  The amount which the Government have agreed to provide in the present financial year is £1.5 million and amending legislation is therefore necessary to authorise payments in excess of £570,000 this year and to provide for payments in future years.</P>
    <P>From the funds provided for the development of holiday accommodation, Bord Fáilte operate a scheme of grants with the approval of the Ministers for Transport and Power and Finance.  The scheme provides for the payment of up to 35 per cent of the total construction cost of new hotels in the western counties and up to 25 per cent in other areas.  Where the total construction grants do not apply grants up to a maximum of 50 per cent of the cost of new hotel bedrooms are provided in the west and 40 per cent elsewhere.  Grants up to 30 per cent are provided for dining areas, kitchens, <i>et cetera,</i> in hotels in the west and 20 per cent in other areas, subject to the exclusion of certain locations such as Dublin and Cork.  Twenty per cent grants are provided throughout the State for hotel staff accommodation and for the provision of recreational facilities for hotel guests.  Guesthouses in all areas are eligible for grants up to 20 per cent of the cost of new bedrooms subject to the condition that at least five guest bedrooms are available on completion of the project.  Caravan and camping sites are eligible for grants up to a maximum of 50 per cent of the cost of the site development and amenity works subject to a maximum grant of £20,000 in each case. There are grants also for the provision and improvement of youth hostels and for improvement works in colleges and similar institutions providing accommodation for visitors during vacation periods.</P>
    <P>I would emphasise that the percentages which I have mentioned represent the maximum grants which Bord Fáilte are authorised to pay.  Each development <Col N="1767" /> is, however, examined by Bord Fáilte on its merits and it is the responsibility of the board to determine the actual level of grant appropriate to each case having regard to various factors, including the location of the development, type of accommodation being provided, the cost of development, the price level, the market demand, the volume of existing accommodation in the area and other relevant tourism criteria.  Thus the grants are operated on a flexible basis so as to provide maximum encouragement to projects which best meet tourism needs.  Hotel and guesthouse owners and other promoters of accommodation have responded to the incentives provided and the £5 million expended by Bord Fáilte in grants since the schemes were introduced must be related to a total investment of £36 million in accommodation development.  Thus the grant element in the total development programme has been 14 per cent.  The number of bedrooms in hotels and guesthouses has increased from 17,800 in 1960 to 27,890 in the present year, an increase of more than 56 per cent.  There has also of course been a significant improvement in the standard of accommodation.</P>
    <P>Policy in relation to accommodation development is designed to achieve a flow of accommodation to match the growth in demand and the standards tourists seek.  It is clear that this balance is difficult to achieve and grant schemes were introduced so that accommodation growth targets could be realised.  The effectiveness of the incentives is assessed on a continuous basis and the schemes are revised in the light of experience. For a number of years, although grants had been provided, it had not been possible to secure adequate accommodation growth.  So in April, 1967, the accommodation incentives were improved, but in deciding on the level of funds to be provided for this purpose the Government have to have regard to the overall demands on the Exchequer.  The improved incentives coupled with an easing in the availability of credit for holiday accommodation development resulted in an atmosphere conducive to investment in <Col N="1768" /> the hotel industry.  By late last year it became clear that the rate of growth in accommodation was beginning to outstrip targets and the level of funds which the Government could make available for this purpose.  Bord Fáilte, accordingly, found it necessary to introduce a moratorium, the effect of which is that the board are not entering into any new grant commitments for the time being.</P>
    <P>Since the introduction of financial assistance for accommodation development in 1959, income from tourism and travel has risen from £39 million to almost £98 million.  Apart from its important role in the balance of payments, tourism has proved to be an effective stimulus to the economy through the additional spending power it injects, through the enlarged market it provides for Irish foods and other goods and through the employment it generates.  Tourism has been particularly valuable as a means of improving the economy of western areas where prospects of industrial development are limited.  I am confident that tourism will continue as a strong force for economic development.</P>
    <P>The growth of tourism over the past decade could not have been achieved without a considerable expansion of the volume of accommodation and the improvement of standards.  For various reasons, including high construction costs and the problem of seasonality, investment in hotels and other forms of holiday accommodation, particularly outside the main urban areas, is not as attractive commercially as other types of investment and financial incentives have been necessary to ensure that the expansion of tourism is not retarded by a shortage of the right kinds of accommodation.</P>
    <P>Financial assistance will continue to be necessary to ensure that accommodation expansion keeps pace with the needs of tourism and particularly to encourage development in the less populated areas now being reached by the growing volume of motoring visitors.  Deputies will recall that in December last the House voted an additional £500,000 by way of supplementary estimate to enable Bord Fáilte to meet grant commitments that had <Col N="1769" /> matured more quickly than expected.</P>
    <P>This brought last year's provision for accommodation grants to a record £1.5 million and this year I am providing a further £1.5 million.  To provide the necessary statutory authority for this year's payments and to provide for the continuation of the grant schemes I propose that the present limit of £5.5 million on accommodation grants be replaced by a new limit of £11 million.  The provision in the Bill is of an enabling nature and the amounts to be provided for accommodation development in each year will fall to be debated and voted by the Dáil in the normal way under the Vote for my Department.</P>
    <P>The financing of tourist development projects usually includes an element of borrowing.  The State does not provide any direct loan facilities but, to assist developers in raising loans, Ministerial guarantees can be given in respect of repayment and interest on loans raised from banks, insurance companies or other lending institutions to finance the cost of holiday accommodation or other amenities or services for tourists.  The Tourist Traffic Act, 1952, provided that the aggregate amount of loans which might be guaranteed in respect of such borrowings was £3 million.  The Tourist Traffic Act, 1961, raised the limit to £5 million.  Guarantees have been given to date in respect of some 70 loans accounting for an aggregate of approximately £2.6 million and approval in principle has been given for guarantees of further loans which will bring the aggregate above the £5 million level.  Amending legislation is therefore necessary to increase the limit.</P>
    <P>Section 21 of the 1952 Act provided for the giving of guarantees during a period of five years, i.e., up to 1957. This limit has been successively extended&mdash;by five years at a time&mdash;by the Tourist Traffic Acts of 1957, 1961 and 1966 and the present limit will expire in 1972.</P>
    <P>The guaranteed loan scheme has proved to be a valuable instrument for promoters of tourist development projects and it is considered essential to retain it.  I am accordingly proposing <Col N="1770" /> that the limit of £5 million imposed in the Tourist Traffic Act, 1961, be raised to £8 million and that the time limit imposed by the Tourist Traffic Act, 1966, be extended by five years to 1977.</P>
    <P>The third element in the Bill arises from the development of a new type of holiday accommodation, that is, the holiday cottage, of which the Shannon Free Airport Development Company have been the pioneers.  This company in association with local interests in the Shannon region have promoted a rent-a-cottage scheme under which 12 cottages were provided at Ballyvaughan, County Clare, last year and a further eight will be available at Corofin this year.  Cottages are also being provided at other locations in the region.  In 1969, there was a heavy demand for the cottages and bookings for 1970 show that there is a strong demand for this type of accommodation.</P>
    <P>Provision was made in section 64 (2) of the Finance Act, 1969, to enable the initial and annual tax allowances applicable to capital expenditure on hotels and holiday camps to be claimed in respect of holiday cottages.  It is a condition of this provision that the cottages must be registered with Bord Fáilte and it is therefore necessary to authorise the board to set up a register of approved holiday cottages similar to the existing registers of hotels, guesthouses, <i>et cetera.</i>  To secure registration, accommodation must comply with standards which will be prescribed by Bord Fáilte in regulations made with my consent, and proprietors must file with the board a statement of maximum prices.  The regulations will require a minimum of ten separate units for letting to tourists to qualify for registration; thus a person with one or two houses for holiday letting will not be required to meet the registration standards and the letting of individual seaside houses or lodges, which is such an important feature of many resorts, will not be affected by the present Bill.  However, the use of the titles &ldquo;approved holiday cottages,&rdquo;&ldquo;approved holiday house,&rdquo; and similar descriptions, will be confined to registered premises.  This is in line with the present registration schemes for hotels, guesthouses, caravan parks, <i>et cetera.</i></P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1771" /> The rent-a-cottage scheme promoted in the Shannon region is designed to bring visitors to villages and rural areas which have so far been unable to share fully in the benefits of tourism because of the lack of suitable tourist accommodation.  It is an imaginative scheme which has proved very popular with visitors and I hope that it will be followed by projects on similar lines in other parts of the country.  The development of this type of accommodation is in line with my concern that tourism should be used as an instrument of economic and social development in rural areas, particularly in the western counties.  The setting up of a register and the publication of registration standards at this juncture will guide promoters or local groups who wish to embark on development of lettable accommodation of this kind and should ensure that development takes place on the right lines.</P>
    <P>There has been a good deal of comment and speculation for some time about the prospects for tourism in 1970.  I have already covered this subject fairly extensively in replies to recent questions but, in view of the importance of the matter, I feel I should return to the subject on this occasion.  As relevant statistics and returns become available, Bord Fáilte make assessments in relation to the season.  These assessments or estimates are revised as more up-to-date information becomes available.  The most recent figures showed June as a disappointing month with declines in all our main markets.  Despite the drop in June, however, the overall situation for the first six months showed an increase of 4.8 per cent in tourist numbers for all markets except Northern Ireland, for which it is not possible to make an estimate at this stage.  Traffic from Northern Ireland is, however, likely to be down on last year for obvious reasons, and Bord Fáilte have increased their promotional activities in that area in an effort to alleviate the trend.  It is impossible at this stage to be more specific about likely tourism returns for 1970.</P>
    <P>Over the years the Government have provided funds for the development of <Col N="1772" /> tourism on an ever-increasing scale. In 1960, £500,000 was provided for Bord Fáilte, whereas in the current year the board will receive more than ten times that amount, that is £5.55 million, an increase of £300,000 over last year.  In recent months a number of people, including some Deputies, advocated that special additional funds for marketing be made available to deal with the unusual situation which had developed.  Deputies, however, no doubt also recognise the need for realistic marketing and that any substantial diversion of funds to counteract short-term adverse factors at the expense of long-term plans for the permanent building of our tourism industry might not represent the best use of tourism funds or be in the best interests of tourism.</P>
    <P>I met the Board of Bord Fáilte on 8th July last, and asked them to carry out a full appraisal of their activities in the light of the problems facing the industry with a view to making any changes which appear necessary to ensure the continued expansion of our tourist income.  On 10th July, I met a deputation from the Irish Hotels Federation to discuss the planning and proper organisation of tourist development for the coming years.  At both meetings, we had a constructive exchange of views, as a result of which the board and the federation undertook to submit to me, as soon as possible, reports in relation to the development of tourism, not only for next year but for the next five years.  I shall be reviewing the outlook for tourism in the coming years in the light of these reports.</P>
    <P>In the course of my discussions, both organisations were agreed that it would be unrealistic, at this period of the year, to embark on a special marketing campaign for the 1970 season. Bord Fáilte, however, are now making a special effort to encourage Irish people to holiday in their own country this year.</P>
    <P>The expansion of the Irish tourist industry has gradually become more difficult as our tourist interests have to compete for business on an international basis, and the competition has become much keener.  In an exceptional year, such as the present <Col N="1773" /> one, with an unprecedented combination of adverse factors, the industry is working under exceptionally difficult conditions.  It is, accordingly, essential that tourist interests gear themselves not only to recover any ground that may be lost, but to secure an increase in tourism income in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>Having considered the matter, I have come to the conclusion that it is necessary to increase the membership of the Board of Bord Fáilte in order to enrich the expertise and experience available at board level.  The existing board has done a magnificent job, but I am convinced that it would benefit from an expanded membership in preparation for the challenges of the future.  I, accordingly, propose to increase the maximum membership of the board from seven to nine.  I will introduce an amendment at the Committee Stage of the Bill to give effect to this proposal.</P>
    <P>I would emphasise that our policy on tourism has been to encourage the development of the facilities and services at home and to prepare marketing strategies abroad which will secure a continuing and increasing tourist traffic to Ireland.  Tourism is sensitive to many events over which neither the Government nor the industry can exercise very much control.  Each year brings its own crop of problems and I believe that the continued pursuit of steady development represents the best use of our resources and is in the best long-term interests of tourism.</P>
    <P>This Bill is designed to provide for the continuation of some of the schemes and programmes which have helped to bring the tourist industry to the important position it now occupies in our economy, and I, therefore, confidently recommend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasGODonnell" hpid="Mr. T. O'Donnell Mr. T. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>During recent weeks at Question Time the Minister indicated that he was about to introduce a new Tourist Traffic Bill.  He also indicated that the introduction of this Bill would provide an opportunity for the House to deal in a comprehensive and extensive way with the various aspects of the tourist industry. My reaction to this Bill is, to put it simply, that I am astonished.  It is a <Col N="1774" /> ridiculous Bill.  It is ridiculous in the light of the problems which confront the tourist industry, problems which were obvious to anyone who was in any way associated with the tourist industry.  We have been aware of these problems for several months past. They are problems which have existed, but which have been denied by Bord Fáilte, and by the Minister in this House.  There are problems which the Minister recently admitted existed, problems which have been highlighted in the news media and particularly on the feature in the &ldquo;7 Days&rdquo; television programme the other night.</P>
      <P>We are now in the middle of the tourist season.  Week after week and day after day, we have been reading reports of the serious difficulties in which the tourist industry finds itself. The Minister, who is the Minister responsible for the tourist industry, comes into this House now, coming towards the end of the session, and introduces a Tourist Traffic Bill sandwiched in amongst a number of other measures.  This is purely an enabling Bill.  The only thing new and revolutionary in it is that the Minister has decided to increase the membership of Bord Fáilte from seven to nine.  I intend to comment at length on this suggestion later.</P>
      <P>The Bill has three main purposes. First of all, it gives Bord Fáilte additional funds for the provision of holiday accommodation.  Secondly, it adds a new category of registered holiday accommodation to be known as holiday cottages.  Thirdly, the Minister proposes to bring in a special amendment on Committee Stage to increase the membership of Bord Fáilte.  When one looks at this Bill against the background of the difficulties in the tourist industry this year, one cannot but be astonished that the Minister responsible for what is, in fact, one of our most important national industries comes in here and, despite continuous probing at Question Time recently, still fails to face up to the situation which everyone knows exists and which everyone knows is serious.  Only the Minister and the Government can give a lead in finding a solution to these problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the money provided <Col N="1775" /> for the provision of additional holiday accommodation, it seems rather ludicrous that this measure should be introduced now when hotels are not filled. When our existing accommodation capacity is greatly under-utilised, it seems rather ludicrous to seek additional money to enable Bord Fáilte to provide additional accommodation. Surely the main emphasis now should be on devising ways and means of ensuring that all our holiday accommodation is utilised to its maximum capacity?  This should be the major objective of Government policy on the tourist industry.  It should be the major objective of Bord Fáilte, our national tourist board, to find a way of filling the hotel bedrooms and the guesthouses and the various forms of supplementary accommodation.</P>
    <P>Of course, the real purpose of this Bill, so far as it applies to holiday accommodation, is to take Bord Fáilte out of the impossible and most embarrassing situation in which they found themselves by reason of the fact that people were given the go ahead to undertake various projects for holiday accommodation, hotels and so forth, on the understanding that grants would be paid.  When they had gone to the trouble of finishing their projects they found, when they looked for the grant, that there was no money in the kitty.</P>
    <P>In so far as this Bill will enable Bord Fáilte to pay the money they owe to the people who undertook the various projects, I support the Bill.</P>
    <P>This grant situation is much more serious than I personally realised.  I quote from the most recent issue of the <i>Irish Hotelier and Caterer,</i> the July issue, page 13.  Under the heading: &ldquo;Grant Situation is Grave&rdquo; it says:</P>
    <P>Bord Fáilte stopped making new commitments on grants for hotel development some time ago but the money currently available is nowhere near the level required to meet existing commitments.  A Bord Fáilte spokesman declined to say how many cases are at the grant stage at the present time but the Bord Fáilte spokesman told the <i>Irish Hotelier and Caterer</i> that there is a shortage of money.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1776" /> An impossible situation has arisen. Hoteliers have undertaken to build hotels and motels and other types of tourism projects and approval has been given by Bord Fáilte and those who undertook the project were told they would get grants when the projects were completed.  The result is that you have Bord Fáilte owing these people money and these people owing money to the builders who constructed the different buildings.  In this Bill the Minister is raising the statutory limit on the aggregate amount which may be paid to Bord Fáilte for the giving of grants for the development of holiday accommodation.</P>
    <P>I want to say this and I would say the same thing regardless of the purpose for which the Minister sought extra money for the tourist industry here: I am not proposing at this stage to make a comprehensive statement on behalf of my Party on the tourist industry because I believe the industry must be examined thoroughly and we have undertaken a study of the industry which we propose to continue over the next couple of months.  I must say at this stage, however, that I am not satisfied with Bord Fáilte or with the manner in which the Minister for Transport and Power, who is responsible for the tourist industry, is approaching his responsibility in this matter.  We have had an extraordinary situation this year where the Minister responsible for the tourist industry has come here and attempted to paint a picture of something which did not exist.  We had the director general of Bord Fáilte making one statement today and contradicting it the next day. We have had a most appalling breakdown in communication between the people engaged in the industry, hoteliers, car hire operators and so on, right up through the regional organisations to Bord Fáilte and to the Minister with the result that there has been a continuous flow of confusing and contradictory reports about the state of the industry.  This began last April.  I raised it for the first time on 19th May and subsequently week after week.</P>
    <P>I have the greatest sympathy for unfortunate hoteliers and others who built hotels or provided other amenities <Col N="1777" /> and to whom grants are due and because the Bill will enable Bord Fáilte to meet their obligations to these people I am supporting it.  But I am not satisfied with Bord Fáilte and I believe the people are completely dissatisfied with the manner in which Bord Fáilte have handled the industry, particularly in the past four or five months.  I repeat what I said in previous debates on the tourist industry: I believe Bord Fáilte must be made publicly accountable and that the concept of public accountability which has been advocated in regard to other State companies must be applied to Bord Fáilte.</P>
    <P>It is a ridiculous situation that Deputies are unable to get relatively straightforward, simple information regarding the expenditure of taxpayers' money by Bord Fáilte.  I can see no reason why the House should not be furnished with an annual report similar to the report provided by An Foras Tionscal regarding grants for industry. Many of these are small grants, particularly in the small industries section. Bord Fáilte must be made accountable to the people.  If there had been more accountability Deputies would be able to get the information they seek. Not merely is it impossible to get information as regards the hoteliers to whom grants were paid but I, and some of my colleagues, in recent weeks tabled questions seeking simple statistical information regarding tourist traffic in certain regions and these questions were disallowed on the ground that the Minister had no responsibility.  One question asked for the number of tourists in the months of May and June this year and for the corresponding months last year in the Minister's own region, the lakeland area, but the Minister could not give any information to the Dáil.</P>
    <P>I am anxious to co-operate with the Minister in any possible way&mdash; and I said this before on the Estimate debate&mdash;in ensuring that this most important national industry is developed to its maximum potential but how can I, or any of my colleagues or my party, attempt to assess the potential of the industry if we cannot get relatively simple information?  I have never indulged in mud-slinging here in my <Col N="1778" /> nine years as a Member but I would be failing in my duty if I did not state publicly a number of factors that have been brought to my notice in recent weeks since I undertook, on behalf of my party, to examine the tourist industry.</P>
    <P>First, there is total dissatisfaction at all levels of the industry regarding the services provided by Bord Fáilte. Secondly, there are numerous complaints about lack of communication between those engaged in the industry and Bord Fáilte.  I have 15 or 16 statements from people who have even written letters to Bord Fáilte and got no reply.  For example, in the <i>Irish Press</i> of yesterday there is a letter under the heading &ldquo;Discouraging the Tourist&rdquo; from a Mr. Murphy of the Falls Hotel at Ennistymon.  I shall not quote at length but I should like to quote the relevant paragraph because it will save me from having to quote from 15 or 16 other examples that I have from other parts of the country. The letter says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Perhaps you may find the following facts relevant to the present crisis in our tourist industry and the body (Bord Fáilte) that we are relying on to rescue us from it.  As you are probably aware, Bord Fáilte bring out a monthly bulletin called <i>Contact</i> in which they advise one as to how he might promote his hotel or other tourist ventures.</P>
    <P>These people were invited to contact the sales department of Bord Fáilte. This unfortunate man who owns a hotel said he did contact Bord Fáilte at the beginning of this month and followed it up with a reminder.  He says, &ldquo;I am still waiting for a reply.&rdquo;  Then he says:</P>
    <P>On the advice of their Dublin office, I wrote to the area managers in London, Manchester and Birmingham to get on the spot advice.</P>
    <P>&mdash;as to how he might go about getting tourists in his area&mdash;</P>
    <P>I received help from Manchester. The poor fellow in London got so upset that he referred my correspondence back to Dublin, and despite three letters I am still waiting <Col N="1779" /> for the chap in Birmingham to reply.</P>
    <P>It is an absolutely outrageous situation, that a national tourist board set up by this House and to whom a subvention of £5.5 million was made in the current year will not even reply to correspondence.  I have had complaints from persons engaged in the travel trade, car hire operators and travel agents who have gone abroad exploring markets in North America and Great Britain and who have received no assistance of any practical value at all from the board's offices in various areas.</P>
    <P>Since last April, despite the fact that I have asked numerous questions I have been very careful not to exaggerate the situation.  I certainly would not make any categorical statements until I had fully investigated the facts.  I have not yet fully investigated the whole matter because we shall not get the full picture of the current season until October.  However, from discussions I have had already I have been appalled at the fact that Bord Fáilte would appear now to be an aloof organisation.  Apparently the Minister does not know what is going on there.  The people engaged in the industry do not seem to know what is going on.  It was described to me by one of my colleagues the other day as a bureaucratic organisation.  All I know is that hoteliers, car hire operators and all the other people engaged in the industry are not getting from this national organisation the service they should be getting.</P>
    <P>Then there is the situation of the eight regional tourism organisations. From the day the Minister's predecessor announced in this House that he was regionalising tourism development and promotion, I welcomed it, thinking that regionalisation was something which could very effectively be applied to the tourist industry.  What is the situation now?  The people engaged in the tourist industry in the various regions are not satisfied with Bord Fáilte.  There appears to be a considerable amount of overlapping of functions between the regional tourism organisations and Bord Fáilte at the <Col N="1780" /> top.  Rivalry, petty jealousy and many other animosities have developed.  The regional tourism organisations as such and Bord Fáilte are not co-operating to the extent which the people who are engaged in this industry and who are depending on it for their livelihood expect from a national organisation like the tourist board.</P>
    <P>The Minister is proposing by means of an amendment on the Committee Stage to increase the membership of the board of Bord Fáilte from seven to nine.  I cannot see that the two additional members will make much difference.  I am aware that very strong representations have been made to the Minister by the Irish Hotels Federation and other tourist organisations about the composition of the board, about the lack of practical experience of the tourist industry on the part of members of the board.  It has been put to the Minister that he should ensure that Bord Fáilte would have on this board persons who have practical experience and the technical know-how in the various aspects of the tourist industry, persons who have gone out themselves and brought in tourists to fill their hotels without any assistance from the board&mdash;and there are many of these people throughout the country.</P>
    <P>I would deplore vindictiveness or talk about people who are not here to defend themselves.  Nevertheless, I must face the facts of the situation.  I said I was not satisfied with Bord Fáilte.  I challenge the Minister and the Government to circularise on a nationwide basis hoteliers, guesthouse owners, travel agents, car hire operators and the various other people engaged in the industry and ask them a simple question: &ldquo;Are you satisfied with the services being provided by Bord Fáilte?&rdquo; I guarantee that 90 per cent will reply that no, they are not satisfied.</P>
    <P>In view of the fact that we are making additional money available to Bord Fáilte it is only fair to try to assess what is wrong with the board. What strikes me is that, despite the fact that over the last six months people connected with the industry have been making public statements drawing attention to the various problems in the industry and that statements <Col N="1781" /> have been made in the newspapers, the chairman, the directorgeneral and the members of the board have been remarkable and conspicuous for their silence about these problems in the industry for which they are responsible.</P>
    <P>Let us consider the courageous statement by Mr. Michael Dargan of Aer Lingus the other day, with which the Minister agreed and which we all endorse, and the comprehensive statement made by Mr. Lemass of CIE some weeks ago regarding the financial problems of CIE.  Let us contrast those statements with the rather milk-and-watery statements by the Director General at Carrick-on-Shannon in May in which he bemoaned the fact that the annual subvention to the tourist industry has remained static in real terms over the last couple of years.</P>
    <P>Why have these people not had the courage to make it known to the people that there were certain problems that should be tackled?  Why did they not make it known that the board were short of money, that hoteliers and others were embarrassed because the grants were not paid and the unfortunate building contractors were waiting for their money?  Bord Fáilte is now known, in case the Minister does not know it, as the great silent service. I have heard this description being applied to Bord Fáilte, and I am talking about the board of directors.  Looking at this board, I have made inquiries into the backgrounds, qualifications, experience in the hotel industry and so forth, of all these people and I have not been very impressed by what I found.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Deputy should criticise individuals who can be identified by the Deputy's remarks.  It is unfair that these people cannot reply.  The Minister is responsible for the activities of the board and the Deputy may criticise the Minister if he wishes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasGODonnell" hpid="Mr. T. O'Donnell Mr. T. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>We are making additional money available from the taxpayers to Bord Fáilte for the provision of accommodation and the Minister has stated that he proposes to increase the number of directors of Bord <Col N="1782" /> Fáilte from seven to nine.  I felt I was entitled to assess whether or not Bord Fáilte as at present constituted are entitled to extra money and whether the addition of two new members would make any practical difference to the tourist industry.  I and my party will vigorously oppose the appointment of additional members to Bord Fáilte unless the Minister gives us certain guarantees. One particular guarantee which we want is that the Minister is not just finding jobs for two prominent supporters of his party.  This has been a common feature of Fianna Fáil appointments to various State boards. If on Committee Stage the Minister can make the case for the addition of these two new directors I will be looking for an assurance that they have practical experience of the tourist industry and that their trade organisations will be asked to nominate the members. Assuming, for example, that one comes from the Hoteliers Federation and the other from the travel trade, these people should be asked to submit nominations to the Minister.  We will be watching the Minister very carefully to see who he is going to appoint and what their backgrounds and qualifications are. The Minister wil have to be extremely cautious here.</P>
      <P>I wonder will the addition of two new members to the board achieve anything.  There might be a case for changing some of the present members, it could well be, for we are not very impressed by the performance of the board of directors.  Anyone connected with the industry could not be impressed by the carry-on over recent months.  Bord Fáilte will have to be made accountable to the people.  They will have to account for the money which they get every year from the Oireachtas and account for the manner in which it has been spent or allocated. We want to know who is getting the money, to whom are the grants being paid.  We are entitled to have this information just as we are entitled to have information about the number of tourists coming into Athlone or any other area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unfortunately, the Bill does not provide us with the opportunity we should have for a comprehensive discussion on the tourist industry.  I hope that the <Col N="1783" /> Minister will not have to come in again in October to look for more money to pay more grants.  Last November or December just before the Christmas recess we had to vote £250,000 to enable certain grants to be paid.  This piecemeal method of paying grants is deplorable.  In regard to the provision for setting up this new category of cottage holiday accommodation I am particularly interested in this and in favour of it.  I have first-hand knowledge of the rent-a-cottage-scheme operated by the Shannon Free Airport Development Company in the mid-western region and I am aware of the success which has attended the initial projects which they have under way in Ballyvaughan and other areas. Projects for the erection of these cottages are going ahead in three or four areas in Limerick.  This rent-a-cottage type of scheme is an excellent one with a very great potential.  I am satisfied from the information I have and from the research which has been carried out that this is a good scheme and should be expanded.  I should like to know if this provision for setting up a new category of holiday accommodation under the general heading of cottage accommodation will apply to individual cottages.  For example, if the Minister or I decided to erect one&mdash;it will not?  It will apply to the rent-a-cottage scheme as operated by the Shannon Free Airport Development Company?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The regulations will require a minimum of ten units. It will have to be people in the cottage renting business not just the ordinary person who has one or two cottages. It will not apply to them.  Ten cottage units must be involved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasGODonnell" hpid="Mr. T. O'Donnell Mr. T. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that a register of this type of accommodation will be set up and do I assume correctly that grants will be payable to people who erect these cottages?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  It will be done on a businesslike basis with a minimum of ten units involved.  We will not be giving out grants to a casual person who rents his or her house or two houses.  You have to be in the business, as it were.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>We can have another word on that on Committee Stage.  I wanted those matters clarified because I have been asked for information and clarification on them.  I am rather disappointed that the Minister did not attempt to outline future policy regarding the provision of holiday accommodation in general.  In recent months many people have been saying that we have too many of certain types of hotels, that all hotel building should be stopped for the next four or five years and that the money should be diverted to the provision of, say, amenities or supplementary accommodation. I have looked into this fairly carefully&mdash;I am not clear about the validity of the argument which has been put forward particularly by the Hoteliers Federation&mdash;that all hotel building should cease for the next five years.</P>
      <P>There are indications that in certain parts of the country there are too many hotels and for this reason I am raising this matter.  Are we going to continue building hotels and what criteria will Bord Fáilte use in determining the feasibility of an application to build an hotel?</P>
      <P>The building of hotels is only part of the service of providing for tourists. We have made rapid strides in constructing hotels but we appear to have overlooked other aspects of the hotel industry.  Items such as staff training, staff conditions, the provision of amenities and recreational facilities are neglected.  The tendency is to construct the hotels and forget about the provision of staff training facilities, entertainment and so forth.  In many parts of the country one can see unfortunte tourists walking around the streets with no entertainment available. This lack of suitable entertainment has been criticised by many tourists, particularly Americans.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Shannon Free Airport Development Company have started a development in the matter of providing Irish cabaret and concerts in tourist centres. When the Minister is replying to this debate, will he state what is the policy of the Government and of Bord Fáilte in regard to the provision of hotels <Col N="1785" /> and guesthouse accommodation?  Has any assessment been made?  I have figures here that show the enormous growth in recent years in the number of hotels and guesthouses that have been built.</P>
    <P>I have with me a memorandum issued by the Irish Hotels Federation dated 7th July, 1970, which outlines various proposals put forward to Bord Fáilte on the occasion of the meeting between the hoteliers and Bord Fáilte.  In regard to accommodation it is stated that there was some confusion as to the actual figures for accommodation but these have since been clarified by the Deputy Director General.  It is stated also that the target for 1965-1970 was a total of 1,200 rooms in all sectors&mdash;for hotels, guesthouses and supplementary accommodation&mdash;and this target has been exceeded by 600 rooms.  I presume this explains in part the reason Bord Fáilte did not have enough money for grants for hotels.</P>
    <P>The breakdown of the room numbers is of some interest.  Hotel accommodation has increased by 6,700 rooms; guesthouses have increased by 1,500 and supplementary accommodation by 6,200 rooms.  This is the kind of information I had hoped the Minister would supply.  Were it not for the fact that I was able to get this document I would not have been aware of how much accommodation was provided and of the breakdown into the various categories.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I can give the Deputy that information any time he asks a question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasGODonnell" hpid="Mr. T. O'Donnell Mr. T. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, the Minister has a point there.  I am concerned about the future policy regarding the provision of holiday accommodation. I regret the Minister did not attempt to analyse the situation when he was introducing this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irish Hotels Federation recommended that no further encouragement by way of grants should be given to hotels for the present.  It is difficult for an individual Deputy to assess the situation thoroughly but this matter must be examined and we will be <Col N="1786" /> looking for information in the months ahead regarding the Government's policy in relation to the provision of accommodation.</P>
    <P>There are one or two other points I should like to mention.  I do not want to infringe the rules of the House by going outside the scope of the Bill which is very limited.  However, in view of the fact that the Minister has been allowed to comment on the present situation in the tourist industry and on the prospects for tourism in 1970 and 1971, I presume I will be allowed to make some comments.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his speech states that there has been a good deal of comment and speculation for some time about the prospects for tourism in 1970 and he states that he covered this subject very extensively in reply to questions. The Minister then mentioned the amount of money that has been allocated by the Government to Bord Fáilte and the fact that in the current year an additional £300,000 has been made available to the board for tourism development and promotion.</P>
    <P>The Minister appears to think that the present difficulties in the industry are of a temporary nature.  He has made a case, as has the Director General of Bord Fáilte, that the situation this year has been due to a combination of factors which may never occur together, in future years.</P>
    <P>I want now to pin the Minister down. A question was raised here in the House last week and the Minister evaded answering it to a certain extent. Can the Minister explain why, if it is a fact that Bord Fáilte got £300,000 extra from the Government this year, Bord Fáilte are spending more than £100,000 less on promotion in America, Britain and on the Continent? It is extraordinary that this reduction in promotional activity should have taken place at a time when so many adverse factors were present.  In such circumstances, would not commonsense have dictated an increase in promotional activity rather than a decrease? It is no harm to list the factors: trouble in the North of Ireland; the political situation down here; the economic recession in the United States; the <Col N="1787" /> decision in Britain to increase the holiday allowance from £50 to £150; the restriction on charter flights, particularly from North America, and the problem of high prices.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke tonight of the difficulties confronting the industry, but he made no attempt to assess these adverse factors.  He made no attempt to say which of them has been the main cause of the reduction in tourist traffic.  People are puzzled.  Most of the adverse factors were known several months ago.  The troubles in the North of Ireland were there 12 months ago and it was obvious that the situation there would have an effect on tourist travel this year.  There were political troubles here.  The economic recession in the United States has been in existence for several months.  The decision to increase the holiday allowance in Great Britain was known last November. The restriction on charter flights has been the policy of the Government for several years.  We all knew that prices were rising.  The Government helped to increase prices by increasing the turnover tax in the Budget.  People ask why, in Heaven's name, the Government did not increase the subvention to Bord Fáilte last April or May when it was obvious to all engaged in the tourist industry, except to the board of directors and the Minister, that there could be adverse effects. Instead of that, the subvention for promotional purposes has been cut by £100,000; £100,000 less is being spent on advertising, publicity and other promotional methods.  This is an extraordinary situation.  Perhaps the Minister was not aware of it.  The board may not have told him.  I am beginning to suspect that the directors themselves did not know what was happening.</P>
    <P>This is the situation.  I agree that the total subvention has been increased by £300,000.  Why is it then that Bord Fáilte had to cut their promotional budget by £100,000?  Where did the £400,000 go?  Has it gone in costs of administration?  I have the figures here for the number of employees, particularly abroad, and I can see no noticeable increase in the numbers of field staff or other staff.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1788" /> I am convinced, as are most people in the industry, that had the Government stepped in last April or May and given Bord Fáilte a special subvention to mount an intensive promotional campaign in Britain, on the Continent and in the United States, such a campaign in would have gone 90 per cent of the way towards counteracting whatever ill effects the adverse factors to which I referred were having. If a businessman is hit by new competition he takes steps to counteract that competition.  The Minister and Bord Fáilte have failed completely to take the necessary action.</P>
    <P>I have been to Britain on five promotional trips over the last eight years. I understand the British market from the north right down to the south coast.  I was there within the past five weeks.  Several people commented on the fact that no attempt was made to counteract the ill effects of newspaper and television reports of the unfortunate troubles in the North of Ireland. They explained that these tended to frighten them off.  I met British tourists who admitted to being a little apprehensive about their welcome here this year.</P>
    <P>I suggested to the Minister recently that he should have been at the tourism workshop in London last May.  Had the Minister gone to London he could have availed himself of the opportunity to make a comprehensive statement on the situation here in order to reassure the British public who spend their holidays here that there was still a welcome for them and that they had nothing to fear in this country.  The tourism workshop was attended by 1,200 representatives of the travel trade.  The presence of the Minister would have provided Bord Fáilte with a considerable amount of extra publicity because I am sure the Minister would not have been shy or bashful about going on television or anything like that.  There was a tourism workshop in Frankfurt a fortnight ago.  The Minister could have been there.  There is one coming up in Holland in the near future.  The Minister may smile but this is bread and butter for a great many people.  I have here the figures for Athlone this year as compared with <Col N="1789" /> last year.  This is the Minister's own area.  If he wants the figures I will give them to him.</P>
    <P>Despite the adverse factors affecting the industry I have the greatest confidence in the future of the industry provided the lessons which have been learned this year are taken to heart. The first and most necessary step to be taken is the restructuring of the entire board of Bord Fáilte.  This board will have to be mainly composed of persons with experience in the industry and who know the problems.  Some attempt must be made to introduce proper communications, proper liaison, between Bord Fáilte and the regional tourism organisation.</P>
    <P>My comment on the letter I quoted from a hotelier and which was published in yesterday's <i>Irish Press</i> is that this should not occur.  When the full picture of this year's tourist season is known I trust the Minister will be able to submit to the Dáil long-term proposals for the development of the industry. Some time ago he spoke about a five-year plan for the tourist industry but there is nothing in this Bill about a five-year plan.  We do not even know the policy regarding future accommodation developments.</P>
    <P>The Minister proposes to increase the number of directors of Bord Fáilte by two.  I shall have much to say on that point on the Committee Stage.  I am not satisfied that this step will resolve the obvious problem that has arisen this year.  I do not see what improvement this will effect in Bord Fáilte.  A more drastic reconstruction of the board must be carried out.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>For too long the Minister and Bord Fáilte were not prepared to admit the truth about the tourist industry this year.  I appreciate the motive behind that approach.  A person in charge of a large organisation does not like to be the first to admit that things are going badly.  It is not unknown in business that you put on more of a show when things are going badly; if things are going well, you do not have to put on a show.  Unfortunately, there has been an exaggerated euphoria in the approach <Col N="1790" /> of the Minister and Bord Fáilte in this connection up to recently.</P>
      <P>The Chair suggested to the last speaker that people might easily be identified.  With the exception of one individual whose photograph appears frequently in the newspapers, I do not know any other director of Bord Fáilte.  Therefore, anything I say is not intended to reflect on any person in that organisation.</P>
      <P>How much of their own money do these developers put into new hotels or new rooms or new what-have-you? In the western part of the country there is 40 per cent for new hotels and they can borrow money which will be guaranteed by the State.  There is no difficulty whatever about getting money if you have a State guarantee. I trust that Bord Fáilte and the Minister's Department examine propositions with a sceptical eye and say, in effect, when necessary: &ldquo;Look, that is too much of a good thing.  You are not going to borrow all that much or, if you do, we shall not support you&rdquo;. Fifty per cent of the cost of new hotel bedrooms in the west is given by way of grant.  How much, then, can be given by way of guaranteed loan?</P>
      <P>The Minister says the gross amount of grants has been pushed up to £11 million and the gross amount of money that may be guaranteed is pushed up to £8 million.  For all practical purposes, they have been moving side by side.  This would suggest that they get 50 per cent by way of grant and 40 per cent by way of guaranteed loan&mdash; a total of 90 per cent.  Doubtless this has happened occasionally.  Elsewhere, 40 per cent of the cost of a new bedroom is given by way of grant plus some amount by way of guaranteed loan or moneys may be got by way of guaranteed loan which makes that particular part of the approach an open-ended approach.</P>
      <P>The Minister talks about the scheme for caravan and camping sites. Do the words &ldquo;in each case&rdquo; mean in the case of each camping site or do they mean in the case of each person who develops caravan and camping sites?</P>

      <P>Except for being in Kilkee a few months ago I have not been in the holiday parts of the west of Ireland for many years.  Perhaps this year I might do a tour down in the west.  Is it true that one well-known firm has developed a number of these camping sites?  I assumed a camping site was of the kind developed years ago by a private person in Skerries, namely, a field with toilet facilities and a washing room for ordinary domestic washing.  I was so busy and so intent on my work that I did not take the opportunity when I was in Kilkee recently to go up and see the camping site which I understand is being developed there.  I am told that the site includes caravans.</P>
      <P>I assume there are certain platforms to which people can take their own caravans, but I understand that other caravans are provided on the side by the developers, and that there is a television room.  There is also a play-room. I presume that is also the case in the other sites in the west.  I am not to be taken as being against this.  That is not the point.  I want to get my thinking straight.  If this 50 per cent is subject to a maximum of £20,000 in each case, presumably as much as £50,000 could be spent on one of these caravan sites.</P>

      <P>As much as £50,000 gross.  Inevitably the Minister and Bord Fáilte will come under criticism if a kind of supermarket in caravan sites develops.  Since I have not seen them I do not know whether it is developing. If it does develop, there will be severe criticism of the Minister and Bord Fáilte.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said that Bord Fáilte <Col N="1792" /> found it necessary to introduce a moratorium, the effect of which is that the board are not entering into any new grant commitments for the time being.  Whenever I talk about management development to people in semi-State bodies or to civil servants, they say it has all changed since I was in the Civil Service and that they have much improved methods of budgetary forecasting.  When I was in the Civil Service for a long period, this kind of thing would not happen.  It was never known to happen.  A thing can be called by a fancy name like &ldquo;budgetary forecasting&rdquo; but I know a fair amount about estimating.  It is not all that accurate a science but you can get very close to it if your mind is really on your job and you would not get into this kind of situation very easily.</P>
    <P>The Land Commission with which I used to deal at one time had a vast number of what they called commitments. We all knew what their commitments meant.  We knew the percentage that would mature.  In this case it seems to me that Bord Fáilte had not the foggiest idea of how their commitments were running, judging by the effect.  The result is that we are now in the &ldquo;stop&rdquo; part of a &ldquo;stop-go&rdquo; economy.  Obviously there was a tremendous &ldquo;go&rdquo; if all the money was spent, and we are now in the &ldquo;stop&rdquo; part.  Perhaps in view of the fact that tourism is not going so well this year, there will be some little saving in not having extra accommodation made available.</P>
    <P>I said on the Supplementary Estimate that so far as the development of tourism went I regarded advertising by Aer Lingus as one of the most valuable parts of it.  It seemed to me, at any rate, that there was more advertising in the good journals in Britain by Aer Lingus than by Bord Fáilte and, therefore, such success as tourism has had is partly due to the efforts of Aer Lingus.  In this Bill the Minister is making provision for the next seven years, more or less.  I am not to be taken as against this, and I am not to be taken as against the philosophy which the Minister puts forward in this Bill, that you should plan on a systematic basis and that, if you make up <Col N="1793" /> your mind to do a certain thing, you should not be put off it because you have a bad season.  I am with the Minister there.</P>
    <P>I have one serious criticism about the holiday cottage scheme.  I am not against the Minister refusing to register one or two cottages but he says there will have to be a minimum of ten before a person may use the terms &ldquo;approved holiday cottages&rdquo; or &ldquo;approved holiday houses&rdquo;.  The Minister said that similar descriptions will be confined to registered premises. This is an example of the kind of minutiae used by public officials in certain Government Departments and semi-State bodies when they are allowed their heads.  It is one thing to restrict the word &ldquo;hotel&rdquo;, an international word which is well known, to a particular kind of place and when we come to &ldquo;guesthouse&rdquo; it is a doubtful matter, but when we come to &ldquo;approved holiday cottage&rdquo; or &ldquo;approved holiday house&rdquo; we are getting into the position where we are dealing with a kind of never-never land.  The Minister takes a jump in his brief.  He says that a person with one or two holiday houses will not be required to meet the registration standards and that you must have ten houses before you can be registered. The Minister then makes the logical jump, as is the pretence in his statement, and says:</P>
    <P>This is in line with the present registration schemes for hotels, guesthouses, caravan parks, <i>et cetera.</i></P>
    <P>There is no necessary connection between somebody who wants to let a cottage or cottages to people and the registration of hotels and guesthouses. I agree with the Minister when he says there is a very substantial increase in the amount of money which he is making available for tourism.  I disagreed with my good friend Deputy O'Donnell about this before.  On the Supplementary Estimate he said the money being made available was not adequate for this important industry.  I think £5½ million a year is a very big sum indeed.  The Minister demonstrated the point by saying that in 1960 the sum provided was £500,000 and now it is over £5 million.  That is ten times <Col N="1794" /> as much in a decade and, even with the fall in the value of money, that is a sizeable increase.</P>
    <P>The Minister said:</P>
    <P>I met the Board of Bord Fáilte on 8th July last.</P>
    <P>He means the 8th of this month?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I realised when I went down through the sentence that he meant the 8th of this month.  I understand we will have an amendment to the Bill tomorrow.  The most significant part of the Minister's statement occurs where he says:</P>
      <P>I have come to the conclusion that it is necessary to increase the membership of the Board of Bord Fáilte in order to enrich the expertise and experience available at board level.</P>
      <P>There are differences of opinion about what is the ideal committee or board but certainly for this type of job I would bet that five would be better than nine.  In the age in which we live we are all so sophisticated that the Minister cannot come to the House and say: &ldquo;These fellows are wrangling with each other&rdquo; or &ldquo;They are NBG&rdquo;, which means &ldquo;no bloody good&rdquo;.  The Minister cannot really make any criticism of them but we all understand this sophisticated language. To return to the Minister's speech, he continued:</P>
      <P>The existing board has done a magnificent job, but I am convinced that it would benefit from an expanded membership in preparation for the challenges of the future.</P>
      <P>These are pretty well-known words which we hear frequently nowadays.</P>
      <P>I stand over my point that if, in fact, the Minister and his Department are dissatisfied with Bord Fáilte, it would be better if it were recast completely.</P>

      <P>I am thinking of the genuine argument, not of language at the moment.  The Deputy has obviously put tremendous effort into getting information about the tourist industry.  I do not profess to know very much about it except what I see once in a while.  However, I shall do better. I shall take my holidays in this country in future and go back to my old habit of a lifetime.  In five years' time, if the Minister and I are still here, perhaps even in three years, I shall be in a better position to say something about it.</P>
      <P>It is necessary to pass this enabling statute in the system of financial operations we pursue here.  This kind of legislation is necessary and I have no objection to it, subject to the criticisms or the queries I have made about the size of the grants and the possibility that certain favoured persons, not necessarily political people&mdash;it is extraordinary how certain people have a greater capacity for getting grants than others&mdash;might be enabled to dip their hands fairly deeply into the public purse.  Such people would be facilitated by this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is timely in that it is getting its Second Reading at a time when tourism is topical all over the country.  I welcome the Bill if for no reason other than that the purposes of the Bill are to raise the limit on the amount which may be paid to Bord Fáilte for giving grants for the development of holiday accommodation; to raise the limit on the amount of loans which may be guaranteed and to provide for the registration of approved holiday cottages. Apart from that, the Bill gives us an opportunity of discussing the tourist industry as a whole, of considering how successful we were in building up this industry over the past ten years or so and learning where any mistakes were made.  It gives us an opportunity to discuss the existing situation and to say how we think the tourist industry should be developed in future and how we think our marketing system in particular can be improved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1796" /> It is well worth nothing that expenditure in grants has increased over the past ten years or so from £½ million to over £5½ million and also that the amount of money availed of in respect of State guaranteed loans shows a substantial increase.  It is also worth noting that the number of bedrooms in hotels and guesthouses increased from almost 18,000 in 1960 to nearly 28,000 in the present year, an increase of over 56 per cent.</P>
    <P>Capital investment by the State in this industry played a major part in providing increased accommodation. Approximately 25 per cent on average of the investment of £36 million in accommodation development was provided by Bord Fáilte by way of State-guaranteed loans.  In other words, I think the developers invested approximately 75 per cent of the £36 million of their own money, or by way of loans which they raised and are repaying, and the State invested 25 per cent by way of grants.</P>
    <P>Tourism is infallible as a means of improving the economy, especially in the western parts of the country and in areas where industry has not yet appeared to the same extent as in the cities and industrial estates.  I welcome the provision for the registration of approved holiday cottages and the manner in which this scheme is being promoted.  It appears that the pilot scheme in Clare is very successful and this should encourage interested persons in other parts of the country to adopt similar schemes.  It appears that at the moment we have surplus accommodation and that in certain areas there are surplus bedrooms while in other areas there is a scarcity of bedroom accommodation.</P>
    <P>In considering future applications for grants Bord Fáilte should have regard to the areas in which the proposed developments will take place.  The grants should be directed more towards the provision of accommodation in areas where there is great potential for tourism but where very little development has taken place to date.  I also welcome the idea that proprietors of holiday cottages would supply the board with a statement of the maximum prices.  This should be a safeguard in many respects.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1797" /> It is certainly too late now to do anything to improve the tourist situation for the current year.  Marketing for any year should be done during the preceding winter.  To a great degree promotional work in the spring, certainly after 1st April, is too late for that year.  I am informed that particularly in England the majority of people who go abroad on holidays decide around Christmas where they will spend their holiday the following year, and then proceed to save up for that holiday.  Therefore, marketing should be carried out during the winter prior to the tourist season.</P>
    <P>I can see good reason why Bord Fáilte are not considering applications for grants for bedroom accommodation at present but the board should definitely proceed with the provision of grants for the development of caravan parks in certain tourist districts and in areas where there is a great demand for properly serviced caravan parks.  I have in mind the town of Kenmare where there is certainly a great need for such a park. There is an application before the board for a considerable period for a grant in respect of this park.  The developer is prepared to put a substantial sum of money into this project. He has great confidence in the future of this project, and schemes such as this should be given a grant without which they could not proceed.</P>
    <P>There is a great tourist market which is completely untapped.  I have been told by people who have visited Germany, Sweden, Norway and the Netherlands during the past year that the people there who go abroad on holidays know very little about Ireland and that we have practically no marketing system there.  The hoteliers should form chains or groups.  The time has come when the hotels should not be depending on either the Government or Bord Fáilte or any other organisation to bring in their business; they should go out and seek it themselves. A scheme of marketing grants should be devised whereby any hotelier or representative of any chain of hotels would go abroad to seek business and get a grant, as is given in the case of industries.</P>

      <P>There is a tendency to form groups but at the same time you could have a proprietor of a fairly large hotel who would like to go it alone and who would probably have his own contacts in a certain city or country.  He should get a grant the same as a traveller for a chain of hotels.  I can see the difficulty in so far as it could be costly to give a grant to every hotelier, even a man with a ten-bedroom hotel.  However, some scheme should be worked out whereby marketing grants would be paid to hoteliers and to representatives of chains of hotels.</P>

      <P>I believe Bord Fáilte are overstepping their functions in regard to their obligations in the operation of the Planning Act and the regulations made thereunder.  I do not mind Bord Fáilte lodging appeals against decisions of planning authorities in respect of amenity areas, areas of great scenic beauty.  However, I do not like the idea of Bord Fáilte lodging <Col N="1799" /> appeals against decision of planning authorities in respect of areas outside amenity areas.  This is a matter which the Minister could take up with Bord Fáile with a view to allowing the planning authorities to operate this Act in the manner in which it was intended.</P>
      <P>I can see nothing wrong with increasing the membership of the board provided good men are appointed.  An appointee to the board should have a special interest in the tourist industry. He should be a director of a hotel or a group of hotels.  He should have an interest also in the transport system, experience of dealing personally with tourists and he should have good contacts abroad.  He should have contacts particularly in the countries I have mentioned where there appears to be huge untapped market, such as Germany, Sweden, Norway and the Netherlands.  I do not agree with Deputy O'Donnell that the additional directors should be nominated either by the hotel federation or the travel agents.  The directors should be independent and not answerable to any organisation.  In conclusion, I would urge the Minister and Bord Fáilte to consider seriously the provision of a scheme of marketing grants for hoteliers and representatives of hotel chains.  For the moment, at any rate, we should concentrate on marketing and if we are successful with that we should proceed with building additional bedrooms and accommodation.</P>

      <P>This Bill reminds me of a prescription for a very sick man. It is a poor prescription for a very sick industry.  The moneys which are to be injected into this industry will have to be watched carefully.  The figures which are quoted here relate only to retrospective grants, the payment of grants to which the board are already committed. One would think that it was something that was to be done in the future.  Men are waiting to be paid these grants.  The bank strike was the greatest blessing in disguise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Coming from the major tourist centre, I measure the tourist industry in my town in one way.  Whenever I have a £10 note to change I go into the <Col N="1800" /> town and change it and I will get £9 English notes in the change.  Today you will not get nine English pound notes; if you get four or five you will be lucky.  One matter to which I should like to draw attention is the question of foreign exchanges in tourist centres. It is all right to say that the rate may appear in the local paper but you have German, Belgian or French tourists coming to a town in which some of the smaller hoteliers do not know what the rate of exchange is and you will find these tourists wandering around seeking to have their money exchanged because they cannot go to the banks.  I should like to know if we have been meeting the needs in this regard.</P>
    <P>We have to examine the possibility of whether we will win back the trade which we have lost-because we have lost it, there is no doubt about that. The new film industry which we are about to start could be utilised in this direction, particularly as we are going to have colour television, to try to attract tourists.  We should try to get our own people to go to our tourist centres even at this late hour.  Television could help to encourage people to spend their money in their own country.</P>
    <P>I was greatly disappointed to hear the Minister for Local Government saying that he intended to see that the signs in Connemara would be only in Irish.  Because a subversive element tarred out the English version, we have the Minister, jelly-spined, not able to stand up and say: &ldquo;We are catering for tourists and not Irish speakers alone.&rdquo; We should be able to direct foreign tourists to wherever they want to go. Who are we catering for?  The majority in the west want the signs to be bilingual.  It is bad enough to have only Irish signs over toilets.  Mistakes have been made, very embarrassing mistakes, by our own people who do not know the difference.</P>
    <P>I had the privilege this year of visiting the northern English counties with a promotion group and I heard a lot of complaints about the cost of food here.  That was before the Budget. Overnight the Minister doubled the tax on hotels, or additions to hotels, on food and drink and on the furnishings <Col N="1801" /> for these hotels.  One could go on and on.  These are the things which priced out the tourists.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>We have been told that information regarding Ireland is not available in the booking offices in England.  We all know that in these offices colourful <Col N="1802" /> advertisements are displayed for countries such as Spain, frequently depicting glamorous blondes on sun-drenched beaches.  We, too, have a beautiful country which we should publicise to a greater degree.</P>
    <P>Of the tourists from England, nine out of ten are either Irish or of Irish descent.  I have met scores of them and know that in many cases they take their cars over here and drive with their families around the country.  It is a sad state of affairs that at the moment some hotels have more staff than tourists. I would add that taxi men also have been affected adversely by the fall-off in the tourist trade and they are finding it difficult to pay the insurance and tax on their cars.</P>
    <P>Visitors sometimes have an unfavourable concept of Irish behaviour and this is illustrated in the following anecdote. Last year an old English lady came to my town with a coach party of tourists.  She was invited by the courier to attend at some Irish entertainment in the hotel and her first question was &ldquo;Will there be much fighting?&rdquo; I am glad to relate that she did attend the &ldquo;Irish Night&rdquo; festivities and she told the courier the following day how much she had enjoyed hereself.  However, this image of the fighting Irish is the image many visitors have of our people and I am afraid in view of recent events it will be even more difficult to eradicate this impression.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Tourism should be the concern of us all because of its contribution to the economy of the country.  Therefore, when we see signs of recession quite properly we should be alarmed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should ask ourselves if we have concrete plans regarding tourist accommodation: have we set a target and are we making any forecasts as to the accommodation that is required?  We got off to a good start in this connection but in this era of intensive competition <Col N="1803" /> perhaps the mere provision of accommodation is not the answer.</P>
    <P>Have the troubles in the north, the high cost of living here and the service we offer been responsible for the drop in the tourist trade?  We must examine carefully all these matters because this is a most important industry.  As an attraction to tourists we should consider offering special rates for Irish-manufactured goods, for petrol and so on.  Some years ago in France, General de Gaulle ensured that French products were available at 35 per cent of cost to American tourists.  As a result, he built up a reservoir of American currency which he exchanged for gold and later sent his planes to collect the gold from the United States.</P>
    <P>The Government should remove the tax from Irish goods, food and petrol and thereby provide an incentive for tourists to come here.  On a recent TV programme many British visitors commented that prices were much too high in Ireland.  Visitors will not go to places where high prices are the order of the day and the Minister should give this aspect very careful consideration.  The recent Government taxes certainly have not helped and perhaps the hotel charges should be reviewed.</P>
    <P>Two years ago I spent a weekend with my family at Tramore and the cost was £65 18s 6d, which is exorbitant. An American friend recently booked for four days into a Nenagh hotel.  Subsequently it transpired he could stay only for one day but although he had paid for the four days he did not get a refund.  If this practice persists or becomes prevalent we will certainly have a reduction in the number of tourists coming here.  The people who engage in such practices do untold damage to our tourist industry and the recent announcement of increased hotel charges next year will certainly kill the goose that lays the golden egg.  It is not good enough that those people, for their own selfish interests, can carry out this exploitation. It is up to the Government to protect the important tourist industry.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the grants paid to hotels and the fact that we are never given any data about those grants.  We have a list of the grants <Col N="1804" /> made available to industry; however, the Minister and his predecessor have refused to give details of grants paid to hotels and I should like to know the reason.  I was surprised to see that such large grants are given in respect of caravan sites.  Are these grants available for the caravans themselves?</P>

      <P>Are our advertising and marketing as good as they should be?  American tourists on package deal holidays stop over for just one night and then go on to Britain and the Continent.  I do not think we give potential holidaymakers enough information about the country.  There are people who think Ireland and England are all one.  Ignorance about this country is greatest on the Continent. We should pay more attention to marketing.</P>
      <P>I am disappointed that the Minister for Local Government has decided that destination signs in the west are to be in Irish only.  I deplore this decision. We should have a realistic approach.  Is there proper liaision between the Minister for Local Government and the Minister for Transport and Power? Harm could be done to the tourist industry by this decision because this kind of thing could discourage tourists. The Minister is a realist.  I should like him to discuss this matter with his colleague, the Minister for Local Government, before a final decision is made.  The Minister made some comment about unionised hotels.</P>

      <P>Ought we, I wonder, to change our licensing laws?  Drinks should be available with meals for tourists.  Our liquor laws are antiquated.  They should be brought up to date even at the risk of offending some vested interests.  We must be realistic about this.  I would like to see drink made available to tourists tax free.  The tax forms a considerable part of the cost.  Why not encourage tourists by making drink available to them at a very low price?</P>
