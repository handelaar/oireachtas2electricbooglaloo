      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>A fair yardstick of the success of the Government's agricultural policy is the degree to which the targets set out by the Government in the Second Programme for Economic Expansion have been reached.  The proposed terminal year for the Second Programme for Economic Expansion is 1970.  If we compare the projections made then as to what agricultural output would be this year with the actual results it can be seen that the agricultural policy has been a substantial failure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Second Programme projected that agricultural output in the sixties would rise by 62 per cent, but in actual fact agricultural output up to 1968 had only risen by 24 per cent.  It is highly unlikely that we shall reach the targets in 1969 and 1970.  Agricultural targets have fallen well below the targets set set out in the Second Programme for Economic Expansion.  This should cause the Government considerable concern.  They cannot sweep under the carpet the projections which they made in 1963 when drawing up the Second Programme.  These projections were made by the Fianna Fáil Government, they have seen them through and if the <Col N="311" /> programme has failed it is indicative of the failure of the policies the Government introduced to ensure that programme targets were met.</P>
    <P>The target for cattle production for the year 1970 was 6½ million but in actual fact we only have 5,800,000 cattle at present.  We failed to reach that target.  An unfortunate aspect of cattle numbers is that the payments made by the Government under the beef export guarantee scheme have not kept pace with payments made to British factories and, in particular, to Northern Ireland factories.  The Government have kept pace with the most recent increase in Britain, and this is commendable, but I cannot see why they cannot now restore parity and pay the same amount to our factories as is being paid by the British Government to factories in Northern Ireland.  This puts these factories at a considerable advantage over our factories and, while the effect is not yet evident to any great extent, it could well become evident at any time if our factories get into difficulties.  Northern Ireland factories would be at a very considerable advantage and the danger would be that employees in the meat factories here would be put out of employment. Because our factories are not receiving the same support, in a competitive situation they would be the first to go to the wall.</P>
    <P>On artificial insemination, only 63 of the 265 dairy bulls in the service have been progeny tested.  This is a very bad situation.  We should ensure that all bulls used in the AI service are progeny tested.  If they are not tested no one will know what kind of progeny they will produce and people will be working more or less in the dark.  We should ensure that the highest proportion possible of these bulls is progeny tested.  This could be done quite easily.  So many bulls would not be necessary with modern methods of semen dilution and, by adopting the methods used in New Zealand, we could make a smaller number of bulls go much further, thereby ensuring that we use only the best.</P>
    <P>In relation to performance testing, the Department takes a certain amount <Col N="312" /> of credit in staling they are introducing performance testing and setting up a station to do this at Tully in Kildare. It is worth noting that in the Second Programme they were also talking about performance testing.  That was in 1963.  They are still talking about it. Nothing has actually been done yet. If the case for performance testing is as strong as it apparently was in the minds of those who drew up the Second Programme for Economic Expansion why have we had to wait until 1971?</P>
    <P>It is, I think, very unfortunate that there is no representation of farmers' organisations on the CBF.  The producers and their organisations are the most important component in the beef industry.  They should have representation on CBF.  I understand a classification scheme is at present being drawn up.  This is being drawn up by a body made up of representatives of the CBF, the Department of Agriculture, An Foras Talúntais and the meat factories. Why is there no producer representation on the body responsible for classification? Surely, the farmers have as much interest as anybody else in ensuring that a proper classification system is drawn up?  Such a system is one of the best ways of ensuring a good export trade for our beef because people will know what they are getting and the system will ensure they get what they want.  The farmers have as big an interest as anybody in having a proper classification system in existence.  I should like to know why it was decided not to give producer representation on the body drawing up this classification system to the farmers.  I should also like to know when the system will come into operation.</P>
    <P>With regard to milk production, the multi-tier system has been partially modified as a result of the recent announcement by the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries.  The system acts as a severe disincentive to expansion. That has been accepted by all responsible bodies in the industry.  It is extraordinary that the Government have not responded to the repeated representations made to them by all the responsible bodies in the creamery milk industry.  I notice that those producing over 30,000 gallons per annum are <Col N="313" /> getting no increase.  This is very unfortunate. This will operate as a disincentive to people to increase production beyond 30,000 gallons per annum. It is worth noting that under the most modern dairying methods in Britain and in the EEC countries the production of 30,000 gallons means that very good cows provide employment for only one man.  The ideal in Irish agricultural policy is to ensure that on any given farm there is employment for two men so that there will be some time off for each and that no one man will have to be on the farm all the time.  It is unfortunate that our agricultural policy in relation to creamery milk should contain a regulation which has the effect of preventing people reaching a level of production which, using the most efficient methods, would give employment to two men.  With the most efficient methods of production a level of 30,000 gallons per annum would give employment to only one man.  I think this policy will discourage the most efficient methods and also discourage people reaching a level of production which would give employment to two men.  This is not in line, I think, with the policies we should be adopting.</P>
    <P>In the last two years there has been a substantial decline in creamery milk production.  The greatest decline has taken place on the small farms.  These are the farms the multi-tier system was intended to benefit, the best price being given to those producing below a certain level.  Yet these are the areas in which the greatest decline in creamery milk production has occurred.  It is entirely wrong that we should have a system of pricing which discourages an increase in creamery milk production, particularly in view of the fact that it is essential, if we enter the EEC, that we should produce the maximum amount of creamery milk in order to ensure our taking full advantage of the opportunities offered for creamery milk production in the EEC.  One of the sectors which should benefit most from EEC membership is the creamery milk industry and any policy which allows creamery milk production to decline is highly unwise.  Such a policy means that we are reducing our capacity to take advantage of the <Col N="314" /> opportunities available to the creamery milk industry in the EEC.</P>
    <P>I notice that in the early 1960s creamery rationalisation was recommended by a study group set up by the IAOS.  Subsequent to that there was the Knapp report which made the same recommendations.  Now the Minister is setting up yet another study group to make recommendations to him on rationalisation.  When will the studies and the reports stop?  When will some decision be taken on creamery rationalisation? Surely we have done enough study now to enable us to take decisions?  Is the Minister putting off decisions because he is afraid to take decisions which might make his party unpopular in certain areas?  I sincerely hope that is not the case.  It is clear we will not be able to take advantage of the opportunities offered in the EEC unless we have an efficient creamery milk industry.  It is also clear that without rationalisation we will not have an efficient creamery milk industry.  I should like to know why the Government have not yet taken decisions in relation to rationalisation.</P>
    <P>In the case of liquid milk production supplied for domestic consumption, I should like to draw the attention of the House to the fact that in 1969 there was only one increase totalling three-pence per gallon to liquid suppliers.  In that year the bottlers of liquid milk received an increase equivalent to 8d per gallon, or 1d a pint per bottle.  Why should the Department sanction such a large increase for the wholesalers, who are merely the middlemen, and only give 3d to the producers?  We should also remember that the increase of 3d this year was exceptional and that in previous years increases for the liquid milk suppliers were much less.</P>
    <P>It is also worth noting that the 3d increase for the suppliers this year was intended to cover only the increased costs that had occurred to the end of 1969.  Since 1970 there have been further increases in costs for the suppliers and the Government should consider whether the increase is sufficient to cover those increased costs since the beginning of 1970.  Wage costs have increased by 25 per cent; fertiliser costs have risen by 10 per cent; and feeding <Col N="315" /> costs have increased by 15 per cent.  All these increases are reducing the profit margin for the liquid milk suppliers and the Government must look into this matter.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see that the scheme in relation to farm buildings is being revised in order to achieve parity between dry stock and milk suppliers.  I I hope that when this revision takes place certain bureaucratic requirements will be removed.  There are many requirements for farmers to qualify for a grant under the farm buildings scheme &mdash;requirements that bear no relation to the productive needs on the farm. In some cases the requirements laid down by the Department would entail too much expenditure and it is not worthwhile for the farmer to apply for the grant.</P>
    <P>In relation to the small farm incentive bonus scheme, at the end of 1969 there was a considerable decline in the numbers accepted for this scheme.  In the last three months of 1968, some 1,646 people were accepted, whereas in the last three months of 1969 the number had declined to 621.  These figures indicate that while this scheme was quite promising in the initial stage it has been declining in effectiveness. The scheme should be revised and made more attractive to farmers.  I am sure that many who could benefit are not availing of the scheme.  Something needs to be done, either by way of publicity or by improving the terms of the scheme to ensure that farmers are made aware of its benefits.  In this connection it is important to note that there are some counties where the number of applicants have been high relative to the population and in other counties the number is very low. The areas that give greatest concern include Counties Donegal, Longford, Monaghan, Kildare, Roscommon and Meath.  In these areas the small farmers have not been taking advantage of this scheme to such an extent as, say, farmers in County Mayo.  These regional discrepancies need an explanation.</P>
    <P>This scheme introduces the idea of farm planning and the keeping of <Col N="316" /> accurate accounts.  This is valuable. It should be applied to a wider range of farmers than is currently the case. If a farmer wishes to qualify for the scheme he must have a system of farming that in the last calendar year gave an estimated gross profit margin of less than £700.  This figure should be increased at least to £1,000, particularly in view of the fact that inflation has been so high and the figure of £700 now bears no relation to its value when the scheme was introduced.</P>
    <P>The greatest failure in our agricultural policy has been sheep production. It is worth noting that had the target set out in the Second Programme been reached, sheep numbers in 1970 would be in the region of 6.6 million. Sheep numbers in 1970 are no more than 3,900,000 and this indicates clearly that the policy adopted by the Government has been a monumental failure.  It has also had a serious effect on our balance of payments.  In 1966 our exports of sheep to Great Britain and Northern Ireland exceeded our imports from those areas by 66,000. However, in 1969 imports of sheep from Great Britain and Northern Ireland exceeded our exports by 41,000. The Minister claims to have evidence that the trend of the decline in sheep numbers in the past few years has been reversed.  However, he has not produced any concrete evidence to back up his statement.</P>
    <P>This decline is particularly serious when we consider that sheep production has the greatest opportunity for expansion under EEC conditions.  The consumption per head in the Common Market is much lower than in Great Britain.  In France the annual consumption of mutton and lamb is only 6 lbs. per head of the population, whereas in Ireland and Britain consumption is 23 lbs. or 24 lbs. per head of the population.  Obviously, therefore, there is great opportunity to expand consumption of mutton and lamb in the EEC.  We produce mutton and lamb effectively.  There is an opportunity to increase consumption and to expand exports.  It is worth noting that it has been estimated that in an enlarged EEC the self-sufficiency in relation to <Col N="317" /> sheep and lambs, even taking into account the fact that consumption levels are so low and that there has been no effort to increase the consumption in Europe, will be only 60 per cent.  There is great scope for sheep production in EEC countries.  There are great opportunities for Irish farmers.  It is a great tragedy that we allowed, and are continuing to allow, sheep numbers to decline.  The numbers of sheep mentioned under the Second Programme target are twice what we have in 1970. There has been a constant decline to date in sheep numbers.  It is a pity that this has happened.  The advantages under EEC conditions may be lost. Emphasis should be placed on sheep production to ensure that we take advantage of EEC conditions.  Under the Wool Marketing Act, 1968, a grading system was to be brought into operation in relation to wool.  This system is not yet fully effective.  I do not understand the delay in this matter.</P>
    <P>A report of a body set up by the Government to consider pig production recommended rationalisation in relation to the number of pig factories in this country.  Nothing has been done.  We will not be in a position to take full advantage of pig production under EEC conditions because of this.  There are a large number of bacon factories in the country at the moment.  For this reason they are not as efficient as they might be.  Lower prices are being given to producers and higher prices are being charged to the consumers in order to keep the factories in existence.  The conditions prevailing in the future may force some of these factories out of existence.  We must do something now about the number of bacon factories so that the employees can have proper re-training in preparation for the time when the numbers employed in the bacon factories decrease.  These people must get re-training early enough to ensure that they will qualify for alternative employment.  We have neglected to do anything about bacon factory rationalisation.  It may be too late for many of the employees.  We are misleading them.  These factories cannot all continue to operate under competitive conditions.  We should be doing something about the departmental report.  If we are rejecting the <Col N="318" /> report we should give good reasons for doing so.  If we do not reject it we should be doing something about the factories.  That report was introduced seven years ago.  Pig numbers could be increased substantially.  In Belgium pig production has been trebled over the last three years.</P>
    <P>We have been talking about the damage done by sheep scab for many years.  Efforts have been made to eradicate sheep scab over the past 50 years.  The Department admit that a proper system of eradication could rid us of this disease within two or three years.  We have not been resolute enough and have not taken the measures necessary to eliminate the disease.  Perhaps a scheme similar to the bovine tuberculosis eradication scheme should be put into effect, by which the matter would be handled on a county basis and eradication would be carried out in certain areas first and then extended to other areas.  Farmers are quite used to this method.  The eradication of scab does not involve the extensive use of blood tests as in the case of brucellosis.  A scheme for the eradication of sheep scab could be introduced without undue expenditure. The short-term expense might be heavy but in the long term the savings would be great.  The amount spent on small schemes which do not make eradication effective is probably greater than any expense involved if we adopted a full eradication scheme over two or three years.  The severe losses to the national economy and to the sheep industry arising from this disease must be taken into account.  I hope something will be done soon.</P>
    <P>I deplore the attitude of the Minister and of the Government in relation to warble fly eradication.  I quote from the document &ldquo;Main Activities of the Department&rdquo; which says in relation to the increase in warble fly infestation between 1967 and the beginning of 1970:</P>
    <P>As a result it was decided to reintroduce a general autumn dressing campaign in 1970 but because of opposition by some farming organisations this was not practicable.</P>
    <P>Clearly the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries was trying to put the <Col N="319" /> whole blame for the failure of the warble fly eradication scheme on the farming organisations.  This is entirely wrong.  There may be blame on all parties but to blame the farming organisations entirely is grossly unfair. This is serious in view of the fact that the most important component in a successful scheme for the eradication of this pest is the farmers' co-operation.  If the Minister blames the farming organisations entirely he will ensure that he will not get the farmers' co-operation which is vital to the success of the scheme.  In his speech the Minister says :</P>
    <P>It seems that in future treatment of the warble fly will have to be on a voluntary basis.</P>
    <P>It is clear to me that there is no hope of the warble fly being eradicated if it is to be done on a voluntary basis. We might as well cease calling it a warble fly eradication scheme if we operate it on a voluntary basis because the same thing will happen as happened in 1967.  Infestation will rise fast and we shall be back where we started.  In 1967, warble infestation was approximately 1 per cent but, by August, 1970, it was up to 12 per cent. Obviously, the scheme on a voluntary basis is not effective.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to introduce a general autumn dressing with a price for the drug not of 4s which was considered by the farming organisations to be excessive.  The Government withdrew the general autumn dressing in 1967 and the farmers naturally considered that a cost of 4s per beast for dressing was excessive. I trust that, in the near future, the Department will make a contribution towards the dressing costs in view of the fact that the scheme would not be necessary now but for the mistake made by the Department in 1967.  That is one way of ensuring co-operation from the farming community.  Then, some time next August, there should be an announcement that, in the following spring, spot checks will be carried out to ensure there is no warble infestation and that penalties will be imposed on farmers who have a level of warble infestation which indicates <Col N="320" /> they did not have their cattle dressed according to the compulsory dressing scheme.  If these spot checks are announced well in advance and if there is some penalty involved it will ensure that all cattle are dressed.</P>
    <P>During the general autumn dressings in 1965 and 1966, a minority of farmers did not dress their cattle.  Their farms became the seed beds for warble infestation and gradually it has spread throughout the country again.  We should aim at rooting out these pockets of infestation.  We must stop fiddling with the problem and get rid of warbles in a short space of time.  There has been a considerable expenditure, a lot of which has gone for naught.</P>
    <P>I am generally satisfied with the progress of the brucellosis scheme.  However, under the voluntary brucellosis certified herd scheme which is in operation in all counties since June, 1965, and which is particularly important in counties where full-scale eradication has not been introduced, there is a possibility that a herd could become certified by using not only the negative blood test but also the milk ring test. This would be a more economical and less cumbersome way of testing for brucellosis.  Careful consideration should be given to the use of the milk ring test under the brucellosis certified herd scheme.</P>
    <P>A point which causes me some concern is the limit on the price to be paid per beast destroyed as a reactor under the brucellosis eradication scheme.  Recently, this has been raised from £100 to £125 per beast as a result of pressure in this House and also from the farming organisations.  A limit is unwise. Why can we not pay the actual value of the beast to be destroyed? With a limit, there is a tendency for people to go right up to the limit.  The limit system is probably costing the Department more than would be the case if the actual value of the beast were paid.  Does the Minister not trust his inspectors to settle the real value of animals destroyed under this scheme?</P>
    <P>There has been a substantial decline in potato production.  This fact is mentioned without comment in the notes dealing with the main activities of the <Col N="321" /> Department.  We do not know if the Department are prepared to accept this continued decline in potato production. Do they intend to arrest this decline? There has been a particularly bad potato harvest in parts of the country due to flooding.  The potato harvest in Donegal has been very bad.  Emergency measures may be needed here in the way of, perhaps, interest-free loans to farmers to help them to cope with their losses on this crop this year.</P>
    <P>In relation to agricultural advisory services, we are told that in-service training is being given to advisers. They are being brought back for various types of courses even after they have completed their formal training as advisers.  How many of them can avail of this?  Another factor in relation to advisers is that many of them move from one county to another very quickly in order to obtain promotion. They move from one county to another to a great extent because promotion may, as a result of some staff changes, become difficult in a particular county and the logical thing is to move to another county where opportunities may be greater.  As a result, we have a position in which agricultural advisers are playing musical chairs, moving from one county to another.  This is very bad when you remember that the most important thing in regard to agricultural advisory services is the development of a confidential relationship between the farmer and the adviser so that they know each other personally. If the adviser is changed from one year to the next and there is a succession of different advisers they will not be able to develop this relationship. A bonus should be given on salary to advisers who stay in the same area for a considerable period and are thus in a position to develop confidential relationships with farmers in that area.</P>
    <P>It has been generally pointed out in regard to international organisations that our contribution to the relief of poverty in less developed parts of the world has been well below that of other countries and certainly below the 1 per cent laid down, I think, by the United Nations.  I do not know if it was that body: I have not done much research on this but I believe it is generally accepted that we have not been <Col N="322" /> playing our part as a developed country in helping undeveloped countries.  We all have a great feeling of sympathy when we hear of a disaster such as the recent Pakistan disaster but this is an emotional reaction, not something that takes much practical effect.  It is easy to feel sympathy about something as obvious as the recent disaster in Pakistan but the need for aid in these countries is a continuing one.  It does not arise when a disaster like this occurs; there is poverty all the time in some parts of the world.  While I recognise that the Department have been increasing their contribution, it is clear that as a developed country, which we are, our contribution is not on a par with that given by other developed countries.  I sincerely hope something will be done to improve the position.  As an immediate measure I suggest that the annual grant-in-aid of £10,000 to Gorta should be substantially increased.</P>
    <P>On page 47 of the notes on the main activities of the department it is stated that Ireland in 1967 signified its readiness to make a contribution to the Food Aid Convention and a nominal provision of £1.000 has been made for this purpose.  I should like some information as to what this Food Aid Convention is and as to why, if the convention became effective in 1967, we are still making only a nominal provision of £1,000 towards it.  Has the convention not become effective?  Perhaps that is so.  I should like some information on this matter.</P>
    <P>I see that officers of the Department have attended meetings of the OECD committee for agriculture and its working parties during 1969.  Among the matters which continued to engage attention, it is said, were the position and prospects in respect of agricultural commodities particularly dairy products and meat.  I should like some information as to the result of our participation in these international bodies.  We are sending civil servants to various parts of the world to attend meetings of bodies such as this but the House never gets much information as to what is happening, what our representatives are doing, what policies they advocate and what are the results of participation in these bodies.  The <Col N="323" /> OECD committees are only an example.  There are many bodies to which we send representatives every year.  The House never knows what is happening.  I do not think that is deliberate; if we sought the information I am sure we would get it but I hope that the Minister, when concluding, will give more information than is given here about our participation in these organisations.</P>
    <P>In regard to information and publicity, there is reference in the notes to the <i>Farm Bulletin</i> published monthly now.  Deputies receive this publication.  I do not know how much it costs.  I do not suppose it costs a great deal.  I do not know who else receives it or how wide its circulation is but I wonder if any reader research has been done to ensure that it meets the needs of those receiving it.  Is it read or just thrown away?  We should find out.  I am not sure if the format has changed very much over the years but if we are spending money on it we should ensure that it is readable and fulfils an actual need.  If not it should be withdrawn and we should cease spending money on it.  I hope some reader research will be done on this bulletin and on all the Department's publications to ensure that they meet a real need.  I am sure the £50,000 the Department spend on publicity and information each year could be more effectively spent.</P>
    <P>Credit and fertilisers are probably the two most important inputs of any farming enterprise and I hope the Department will continue to extend the grant to the Agricultural Credit Corporation to ensure that all the credit needs of farmers will be met so that they can expand and take advantage of EEC conditions.</P>
    <P>Under the technical assistance scheme grants are made to firms in agricultural-based industries to meet part of the cost of (1) training management supervisory personnel, (2) study courses and tours abroad, and (3) engagement of consultants to advise on matters relating to improvement of productive efficiency.  Representatives of agricultural and rural organisations as well as officials employed <Col N="324" /> by the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries and by the county committees of agriculture participate in the programme.  I should like some information on what type of enterprise gets assistance under this programme, what agricultural and rural organisations are represented and how long the programme has been in existence and how successful it has been.  We should have this information.  The figure of £45,000 is not very great but if we have this programme we should know more about it than we are told here.</P>
    <P>In regard to the EEC the Minister said he had made arrangements for regular consultation between his Department and representatives of agricultural organisations on agricultural aspects of the negotiations.  How often have these consultations taken place or how often is it proposed that they should take place?  Is there any possibility of the Department bringing representatives of farming organisations to Brussels when the negotiations are taking place there so that the Minister would be able to have on-the-spot consultation with them if any problem arose in the negotiations which affected the interests of the farmers and so that he would not have to make an agreement without consulting them first?  He could ensure immediate consultation with them if a difficult problem arose in the negotiations in regard to the position of our farmers.  As these negotiations proceed farming organisations should participate on a day-to-day basis, not on a <i>post facto</i> basis where the Minister comes home and tells them what he has negotiated.  That would not be true consultation but would be merely informing them of what he has done. I hope the Minister will adopt the idea of bringing representatives of farming organisations to Brussels with him or, alternatively, find some other method of having this day-to-day consultation as the negotiations proceed.</P>
    <P>The Minister said :</P>
    <P>Sheep numbers have been declining but there is evidence to suggest that this period of decline is now ending as a consequence of our improved production incentives and of the satisfactory level of sheep prices.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="325" /> I should like the Minister to give us the evidence he has, and I should also like him to tell us the scale of the increase which is indicated by this evidence. To make a bald statement like that is not sufficient.  The Minister also said that the Government decided to increase the level of support for our carcase lamb exports to Britain &ldquo;by a similar sum&rdquo;.  That was in relation to the increase in the British guaranteed price for sheep.  I do not think this has meant anything so far as the Government are concerned because our exports of lamb to the British market do not reach the level where Government contributions are made from our side.  So, that is really a rather meaningless statement.</P>

It is very difficult for a speaker in my position to put forward a total concept of agricultural development.

      <P>The Minister regards himself, I think, as an artist of a kind. I was informed that he engaged himself yesterday evening in setting down some impressions of me.  I am very thankful to be honoured by the Minister and I am sure when the masterpiece is seen on the canvas it will be very nice.  Am I right?  There is nothing wrong in setting down impressions of anything or anyone.  I do not find fault with the Minister on that score but I like to return compliments and I should like to set down my impression of what has happened here since this debate on agriculture commenced at 7.7 p.m. on the evening of Wednesday, December 2nd.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If I may digress a little, many people throughout the country feel that important debates in this House should be televised&mdash;debates such as this <Col N="326" /> which is regarded as one of the most important, second in importance to the debate on the Vote for the Department of Finance&mdash;and that people should know what is happening.</P>
    <P>Supposing our friends who are employed by Telefís Éireann, Joe Fahy and Arthur Noonan, had the task of commentating on the Dáil proceedings to date in this debate, what would they be telling the people?  They would say that this debate commenced at 7.7 p.m. on Wednesday last with the Minister taking his place and reading his statement with a small attendance in the House, which possibly could be excused yesterday evening; that having concluded his statement he drank a glass of water and departed from the House and his place was taken by a Parliamentary Secretary.  The general public would say that was a rather unusual procedure because the speaker from the main Opposition party, Deputy Bruton, indicated that he went to a great deal of trouble in researching his statement on this debate and the general public would expect that a Minister would be courteous enough to wait and listen to what he had to say.</P>
    <P>The debate proceeded for almost an hour.  The quorum bells rang and a House could not be found.  The Ceann Comhairle had to adjourn the debate for 18 minutes.  It was then resumed at 9.30 p.m., the Minister being present on the resumption.  From 9.30 p.m. until 10.30 p.m. Deputy Bruton continued to address the House and the Minister engaged himself in child-like drawings.  He has the finished article. I am setting down my impression of this debate up to the present.</P>
    <P>The debate was resumed shortly after 10.30 this morning.  It seemed to me that the Minister went to sleep shortly after the resumption.  He woke up at about seven minutes past 11 but while Deputy Bruton was speaking the position was that the Minister was sleeping.  After a few minutes he dozed off again until 11.30 when Deputy Bruton resumed his seat.  I mentioned that these two commentators would be telling the people that the attendance was exceptionally limited and that a quorum was not present in the House <Col N="327" /> during any part of this discussion.  An impartial observer, or possibly the commentators, would say that the general feeling was that the discussion seemed to be of no avail, that here was an elected representative of the people expressing the views of his party, the main Opposition party, and not being given the courtesy of the Minister's attention.  I think that is bad.  That is my impression.  The Minister has set down impressions of me and I think it is no harm for me to set down my impression of what is happening here.</P>

I thought it was a most inopportune time for the Minister to be engaged in drawing when Deputy Bruton was addressing the House.  I thought the Minister should engage in that after 10.30 p.m. or before the discussion commenced.  He should have availed of some other time to set down his impressions.

      <P>I know he is in a peculiar position.  Possibly even the date of this discussion is notable, the date of the by-elections in Donegal and South County Dublin.  It would be reasonable to assume that a man of the stature of a Minister for Agriculture <Col N="328" /> and Fisheries would be engaged on electioneering yesterday.  If he had been exception would not have been taken.  More junior Ministers were absent in Donegal.  In fact, the State went to great pains on Monday night, according to press reports, to tell them to stay at their posts.  I am not judging the charges and counter-charges that have been made, neither do I intend to take up time going over these charges but to a constituency such as Donegal South West, mainly a farming constituency and possibly like parts of South West Cork made up of small farms, one would have thought that the most influential man for any Government to send along would have been the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries and that he would have been much better employed at the peak hour yesterday evening trying to persuade voters to vote for his party than setting down on canvas his impressions of me.</P>

      <P>I do not blame the Minister for whatever is in this Estimate or whatever is not in it.  The fortunes of war appointed him quite recently. I am sure his senior officials thought up this statement and I will not take the Minister to task for the activities of his Department since his appointment.  He has had a hard time from his own people and I do not propose to add to that.  He had difficult assignments of a repetitive nature.  He was unfortunate in having to cover ground twice in our courts and I appreciate that that was a difficult task and possibly the Minister could be excused for not taking great pains about his Department during that period and subsequent periods.  I am of a very sympathetic nature.  I know that the by-election in part of this county is supposed to be largely attributable to the Minister.  At least it is definitely attributable jointly to the Minister and the Taoiseach.  That is not my statement.  It is the statement <Col N="329" /> of the former Deputy and Minister, Mr. Boland.  He said he would resign to preserve his honour.  He castigated severely the Minister and the Taoiseach. I am not pronouncing judgment on whether that was justifiable or not except to say that Mr. Boland and the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries and the Taoiseach were, I am sure, close friends over a period of years. They worked closely together.  They were able to assess one another better than we could.  We could be regarded as outsiders in comparison with those within the Cabinet and within the party. There is this position then of a Minister and his Taoiseach being responsible for this upheaval in South County Dublin, responsible for a great deal of public expenditure.  Polling costs must be met from public funds.  I shall not prejudge the result now but it could be one of some significance.</P>

      <P>Since becoming a Member of this House I have never brought along as much documentation as I have on this occasion, so you might start praying that I do not use it all.  It is unusual for me to do this because I do not see much point in Deputies reading from books or statements that are available in the Library.  However, I have departed a little from my usual custom on this occasion and I have brought with me the Minister's statement as well as the notes on the activities of the Department and some other notes also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last Tuesday night I was amazed to hear the announcement on the 10 o'clock news bulletin that increases were to be granted for certain agricultural products.  I was not disappointed with the announcement but I was disappointed that it was made on the night before the Estimate was to be introduced in the House.  So far as I know, nothing of this nature has ever happened before.  Of course, the idea was to influence the voters in the by-elections but while we all like to influence voters at election time we <Col N="331" /> realise that there are certain standards to be upheld in relation to departmental work.  I regret that such standards were not upheld on this occasion</P>
    <P>There might be some justification for such an announcement if there was no question of a debate on agriculture arising the following day but the manner in which this announcement was made was almost akin to making a Budget announcement on the day prior to the reading of the Budget statement in the House.  Certainly, this was a break with tradition.  Whether the announcement, made as it was on the eve of the by-elections, has had any effect on the results of the elections, remains to be seen.</P>
    <P>We are told that we are living in an inflationary world.  Some of us are prepared to admit that we cannot be regarded as being economists in any sense of the word.  Like the majority of Irish people, we have limited education but, of course, some people set themselves up as economists and they lecture in depth on such matters.  What the people want to know is what is going to happen here.  What will become of the country and where is all the extra money that is being demanded to be found?  It is only to be expected that there would be increases but the present situation in this regard is unrealistic.  Looking at the Estimates for the current year I notice that the amount required is £418,085,000; last year it was £354,180,000 and for the year 1968-69 it was £302,000,000. Surely such a rate of increase cannot continue.  It must be remembered that these increases are apart altogether from the increases voted through local revenue and through increases in rates, a matter about which the Acting Chairman, being a member of three local authorities in Cork county, will be well aware.  To my mind this kind of money is not available.  We are leading up to a situation such as that which obtained in relation to the stamp auctions some years ago.  We are borrowing all the time but one day someone will have to do the reckoning.  I suppose we can continue for some few years until that day is reached.</P>
    <P>This year the increase in the Estimate <Col N="332" /> for agriculture is £64 million; last year the increase was £52 million. An amount of £52 million is a sizeable sum of money in a country with a population of only 2.8 million people. I shall go back for a moment to the year 1956-57, a year about which we hear much from Fianna Fáil speakers, I was here during that period and I saw nothing wrong with the Government of the day.  My only criticism was that the Dáil should not have been dissolved at that time.  In the year 1956-57 we were told that the amount required was £109,123,280.  It will be seen, therefore, that, 13 or 14 years later, the amount has increased almost fourfold.  We are moving at a fast pace but can we stand that pace? I am sure that the rate of increase in taxation coincides with the last period of this Government's time in office. Fianna Fáil have governed continuously since 1957.</P>
    <P>That increase is a feature the people should not overlook.  One need not be an economist to know that it is a formidable increase.  As well as that, we have borrowed money everywhere. We have tried to get what we could from our own people.  I appreciate the necessity to get money for capital services, but we have borrowed from Germany, Britain and any other place willing to lend us money.  I think we are about to go to the World Bank for a loan this year.  In the meantime one of the State-sponsored bodies are busily engaged in seeking capital, which I hope they will get for the work they are undertaking.</P>
    <P>Not enough attention is being given to this alarming increase in the demands on the tax-paying public.  I repeat that Ireland cannot continue at that pace.  We are travelling too fast and we are bound to become tired and fall by the wayside.  Something must be done to halt that mad race in taxation that seems to be on at the moment.  How it is to be done is a matter for the Government of the day. I assume the previous speaker, Deputy Bruton, scrutinised closely the figures he gave to this House when he said the personnel of the Department of Agriculture has almost trebled since <Col N="333" /> 1961-62.  I was surprised to hear that statement and on the assumption it is correct I ask: can we afford to expand and employ people at this rate? Are the Department of Agriculture employing people in work of a nonproductive nature and are they contributing towards this upward trend in national taxation?</P>
    <P>From reading the particulars of the Estimate and taking into account the overall increase of £64 million in the taxation rate to be levied this year it can be seen that the expenditure of the Department shows a decrease in 1970-71 of £1,062,000 as against 1969-70.  The Minister mentioned last night&mdash;and I cannot understand why the figures are not included in this Estimate since the year is eight months old now&mdash;that supplementary Estimates would be forthcoming to the extent of £4 million.  In any case it is reasonably evident that the Department are responsible for only a relatively small percentage of the gross demand, for taxation purposes, on our population. How have agriculturalists benefited from the increase in taxation and from the many schemes which are supposed to be in operation to assist them since Fianna Fáil took office in 1957? The agricultural organisations' representatives, even in statements made as late as this week, tell us they are not doing very well.  They tell us their members are leaving the land, that in some years up to 14,000 have left agricultural employment.  Last year the figure stood at around 10,000 and it is steadily decreasing.  Those who remain in the industry find that their incomes have not risen, a fact which was admitted by the Minister in the course of his statement, in comparison with the incomes of those engaged in industrial activities.  The figures are given in page 1 of this memorandum submitted to us, so I do not think it is necessary to delay the House reading them.</P>
    <P>Despite all that has been said about agriculture and all the props and aids that have been given to it, it is strange that the Government have failed to measure up in a reasonable way to the requirements of the organisations' representatives.  I am well aware of <Col N="334" /> the general position obtaining at present whereby our population is divided into several groups and in most instances such groups are engaged in fighting for a greater slice of the national cake than they are entitled to.  There does not seem to be anyone to arbitrate or to say to any section of the people : &ldquo;You are looking for too much.&rdquo; If this is said the language is relatively mild.  The reason for this is the danger of losing public support, of losing votes.  That is possibly one of the defects of a democracy, that people cannot be spoken to, even by a Government such as the Fianna Fáil Government who are regarded as dictatorial, in firm language when their demands are not in keeping with their rights.  I claim that agriculturalists are not getting a fair slice of the national cake.  I do not blame organisations, elected representatives and members of committees of agriculture claiming increased incomes for the farming community particularly the small and medium sized farms.  We are told that only 2½ per cent of the farmers are deemed to be big farmers.  This relates to those producing milk in excess of 30,000 gallons.</P>
    <P>What do we find on the other side of the picture?  When I speak about the other side of the picture I mean land of lower fertility yields such as the 12 western counties or to be more exact the 11? western counties because peculiarly enough less than one-eighth of Cork is deemed to be in the western counties for the purposes of some departmental schemes.  How do we find agriculture there after 13 years of Fianna Fáil Government plus years and years of it in the thirties and forties?  We find the agricultural community are incapable of making ends meet out of the moneys received from their agricultural activities.  Direct payments are being made to farmers all over the area because of this.  I think it is most exceptional and most peculiar that this should be the case.</P>
    <P>I have never been favourably disposed to giving hand-outs to able-bodied men.  I shall continue to say that irrespective of what effect it may have on me politically or otherwise. We do have obligations to those who are mentally and physically handicapped <Col N="335" /> but it is very unfortunate that the farming community are placed in the position of getting hand-outs.  The Irish people are known for being an independently minded race and I hope this tradition of independence will continue but this system of giving hand-outs is not conducive towards helping or building up that tradition. People cannot bring up children on air.  They must be paid a fair wage. Despite what Fianna Fáil have told small farmers down through the years about being well-off if they were voted back to power, the fact is that they are not well-off, they cannot enjoy the comforts of life without availing of this type of assistance.</P>
    <P>Why must we ask these people to go along to exchanges once a week in order to receive their assistance?  If this system must continue would it not be better to assess their means, assess what their entitlements are and post the money to them?  If they engage in work or their means change the same system which operates in relation to old age pensioners could operate here and they would be obliged to report a change in their circumstances.  I do not like the idea of this system being in existence at all in 1970.  I do not like bringing these people along to exchanges to sign forms; it is a waste of their time and I am sure they do not like it either.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach said last night that once we get into the Common Market we are going to be in heaven on earth. Apparently once we are in the Common Market we shall all be able to go around in Mercedes.  I am elected to this House mainly on the votes of small farmers and I am obliged to look after their interests and help to promote beneficial measures for them. I am sure Deputies know that the Labour Party have been diligent in their efforts to get assessments of what is likely to happen in various fields should we become a member of the EEC.</P>
    <P>I have been a member of my party's delegation to Brussels and other parts of Europe with a view to getting that kind of information.  In May last, I <Col N="336" /> think it was, we had a three-day session in Brussels and we dealt with agriculture in a most detailed fashion. We had the deputy head of the Department with us, as well as a member of the Commission.  I expressed views, personal views, on the agricultural position in Ireland and I mentioned the direct money aids given to some of our farmers in order to bring their incomes up to a living standard.  The commissioner had never heard of such a position obtaining anywhere else.  He said it certainly did not obtain in the Common Market countries and, since it did not, there was no precedent.  He had no hesitation in staling that, if Ireland were to become a member of the Community, he was quite satisfied that that position would not be allowed to continue.  He was quite satisfied that after a short transitional period these aids would have to disappear.  As well as that the Commission member gave some detailed views on the matter; he said Ireland would not be free to indulge in this kind of system if she were to become a member of the EEC and if she had to continue this system, she would have to get the Community's permission and, if the permission were given, it would have to be set down as a local charge and not as a Community charge.</P>
    <P>The Government and others feel, apparently, that we will become members of the EEC within a few years. This question has been with us since 1957.  We will have to make changes and we must start making those changes now.  I want to say in this Parliament this morning to the farmers concerned that one definite result of our membership of the Community will be a change in the present system. We will have to set about providing an alternative system.  The Common Market officials have sent us a great deal of material.  The Government have also sent us a great deal of material on our proposed membership of the EEC.  I am sure the number of books and pamphlets of different kinds must be exceptionally large.  I am sure it is in excess of 100, or more, so that we have got a variety of information on what will happen when we become members of the EEC.</P>
    <P>Now the Government are shelving <Col N="337" /> many matters by telling us that we are on the threshold of entry and whatever problems or difficulties exist will be wiped out overnight.  No one exemplified that more than the Taoiseach in a statement he made somewhere last night; it is reported in this morning's papers.  Everything would be all right; we would be living in a kind of heaven on earth.  Possibly the Taoiseach paints a brighter picture than the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries does as to what will happen.</P>
    <P>Agriculture is tied up with every industrial development in the country. We are too prone&mdash;I have said this all down the years&mdash;to discuss agriculture in isolation.  We discuss agriculture without reference to industrial activities, activities which have a bearing on agricultural interests.  We should have more interdepartmental relationships in order to get the best possible return from the funds expended by the State on development.  The Minister did not deal at great length with our EEC membership application.  He said he felt compelled to comment on it and he went on to say: &ldquo;I refer to the unbalanced and distorted arguments which have been promulgated by certain groups and personalities against membership.&rdquo;  In a democracy people must accept criticism; people must accept other views and, if we are not in a position in which that is done, then we must have laws and regulations similar to those in operation inside eastern European countries where criticism of public affairs is not allowed.</P>
    <P>I do not know to whom the Minister is referring.  I know my colleagues on these benches have made some criticisms. I said earlier that there is no party and no one group who have gone to greater pains to get information on the European Economic Community than the Labour Party have. We went along as free agents and we got a great deal of co-operation on different parts of the Continent from different people.  We got numbers of booklets.  In our discussions the one thing that struck me was that these people seemed to be very frank and objective in their views.  I had the opportunity of being a member of the <Col N="338" /> Council of Europe and had the opportunity also of visiting Europe on a number of occasions.  I believe, as I have always believed, that a country like ours cannot live in isolation.  We must have in the changing world of today some kind of federation amongst the western States of Europe.  You have that federation or amalgamation&mdash;call it what you will&mdash;in eastern Europe. It is very difficult for a small country like ours, with a population of less than 4,500,000 people, if we include the entire country, to live on its own.  Once our main market becomes limited, as it will if Britain joins the EEC, we will have no alternative but to join the Community.</P>
    <P>I visited the six Common Market countries and I was favourably impressed by the standards obtaining in those areas.  This applies even to the poorest parts of Southern Italy.  Standards in France, Holland, Belgium, West Germany and Luxembourg have improved and this trend is continuing. It is a pleasing feature to note that these countries, which not very long ago were devastated, are once again prosperous.  When we see the progress they have made it is obvious that we will not lose by association with them.</P>
    <P>However, the over-optimistic picture that has been painted about the EEC contrasts with the facts and the statements made by member countries of the Community.  An impartial observer could with justification hesitate about our entry into the Common Market. There are many people who are totally dissatisfied with the picture painted by the Government.  So far as agriculture is concerned, the view of the Government seems to be that once we enter the Community all our troubles will be over.</P>
    <P>We must realise we shall have to pay a high price.  There has been much talk about the restructuring of milk prices in the Community but, if we become members, we shall have a lot of work to do in this direction.  I have here an official booklet issued in 1968 by the secretariat of the Commission which deals also with small farmers&mdash; a subject I discussed earlier in my speech.  The Parliamentary Secretary is deemed to be a knowledgeable man <Col N="339" /> and I assume he has read this booklet. Several chapters are devoted to agriculture and I shall quote from some statements made on the subject.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I must confess to the Deputy that I have not read the booklet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>The booklet is worth reading.  Although it is endeavouring to sell the Community, it is quite objective. In the chapter on agriculture it is stated:</P>
      <P>Certainly, the market and price policy which is the basic element of the common market for agricultural products and which, therefore, will have to be extended to a number of additional products, can be conducive to specialisation and further rationalisation, and thereby make a more effective contribution to raising the general level of prosperity in the Community.  But this will be possible only if the pattern of production and the farms themselves are adapted to the end in view. Otherwise the common agricultural market will create serious problems for those farmers who, because of the structure of their enterprises, cannot adjust to it, let alone derive any benefit from it.</P>
      <P>A point that is worrying some of my colleagues is what is the percentage of farmers in Ireland to whom this last sentence could apply?  I can make a guess and possibly the departmental advisers could give a more accurate figure.  However, it has been stressed by the Community&mdash;and I know I am repeating myself&mdash;that raising the level of prosperity will be possible only if the pattern of production and the farms themselves are adapted to the end in view.  Otherwise serious problems will be created for farmers who, because of the structure of their enterprises, cannot derive any benefit from it.  I assume the percentage of farmers to whom this might apply is high; I would hazard a guess that it might be around the 30 per cent mark.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the EEC policy the numbers engaged in farming will decline <Col N="340" /> considerably.  In the booklet issued by the secretariat it is stated:</P>
    <P>The rapid diminution of the agricultural population is a feature of the times.  But if the living standards of farmers are to rise enough within ten years to make good the present leeway, then the rate of decrease in the agricultural population must be greatly accelerated.</P>
    <P>They are not satisfied with the decline of 10,000 per year.  Despite the decline in the numbers engaged in farming, the problems in regard to the standards of living and conditions of farmers are becoming more serious from day to day.  Can one see where the farmers are going?  What will happen to them?  They have more to say about this.  It reads:</P>
    <P>Many farmers who had hoped that the creation of the common agricultural market and a common price policy would solve their problems are today disillusioned, especially in view of the critical situation of the market in dairy products.</P>
    <P>They are disillusioned in Europe. Dairy products are very important. They are the most important aspect of our agricultural policy.  The main incomes of farmers are derived from dairy products.  I would not use parliamentary time reading from a booklet such as this, were it not from official sources.  This is the official communication from the Community.  It is produced and published by the Commission. That is why I attach a great deal of importance to the statements contained in it.  It also reads:</P>
    <P>In the past 20 years it was still possible to produce in order to meet a steadily growing demand.  But today it is the case of most products that output is growing faster than consumption.  Our prices are too high to enable us to export on satisfactory terms.  Except for beef and veal, there is not much room left for expanding production.  The Community is forced, therefore, to adopt a cautious policy on prices.</P>
    <P>There is much food for thought in that chapter.  We are dealing with dairy products.  All this led to the man in the <Col N="341" /> street being very doubtful of entry.  I was able to see personally what was happening.  Apart from the advantages which there are in consolidation and in building this super-power in mid-Europe, I know that many people feel we will not benefit from the advantages but that there will be disadvantages as well.  This is not a very bright picture in so far as the small farmer or the milk producer is concerned. They realise that these products are important and form a large part of the income of the small farmers.  This is an important change-over.  The farmers' position will be completely revolutionised.  From what one can gather, numbers will decline by 50 per cent within a relatively short period. This booklet also states:</P>
    <P>What is needed then is not merely to act quickly on the markets suffering from structural surpluses, but even more to initiate a fundamental transformation of the structure of agriculture, which will contribute to the integration of farming into the economy as a whole.</P>
    <P>The Community is now having to pay so heavy a price for an agricultural production which bears no relation to demand, that measures to balance the situation on the market can no longer be avoided.  Without them, it would be extremely difficult to achieve a lasting improvement in farm incomes, and they are, in addition, necessary for reasons of trade policy.</P>
    <P>But the solution of the agricultural problem calls first and foremost for radical structural reform. Simply to treat the symptoms will not lead to the desired result.  The reform must lead to a new structure of production, to changes in marketing arrangements and to a new outlook on the part of the agricultural population&mdash;those who want to stay on in agriculture, those who want to retire and those who prefer to take up another occupation.</P>
    <P>Such statements are set down here in the Commission's report.  They are pointing to the obstacles.  They are pointing out that the numbers engaged in the agricultural industry will <Col N="342" /> diminish and that there is an absolute necessity for restructuring our farming position.  They point out also that many small farmers are likely to be disappointed when they find themselves within the Economic Community.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the Taoiseach's statement that the Community holds out such great hope for us one would have thought that some effort would be made at restructuring.  Within the Community agriculture is not a very important industry.  It bears no relation there, in so far as importance is concerned, to the importance it bears in Ireland.  The books tell us that 16 per cent of the population is engaged in agriculture within the Six and that the agricultural activities produce 8 per cent of the gross national product there. These figures are relatively small in comparison with what agriculture means in Ireland.  We are told that the number engaged in agriculture here is somewhere in the region of 330,000 persons and that were it not for the export prices for our agricultural products we would not be able to balance our economy at all.  The Government are overlooking that fact.  They are giving no evidence of that fact receiving attention.  There are many booklets like this one.</P>

      <P>This is a useful little booklet.  I was reading what the farmers had to say.  That is only an opinion.  I prefer to read what the secretariat of the Commission had to say.  That is the most important of all.  I give it pride of place.  It does not support the Taoiseach's statement yesterday that everything in the garden will be lovely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have here a few notes I made in Brussels concerning the Mansholt Report. They had great fears for milk and butter production and milk product production.  They were very worried about milk.  In the course of discussion on what would happen to the numbers having to leave farming, their case was that the rapid decline in the numbers engaged in farming presupposes that alternative employment will be made <Col N="343" /> available-locally, if at all possible.  I have seen no evidence in this country of any great efforts to provide alternative employment for these people.</P>
    <P>Our last visit was in May or June and our previous visit was in 1967, three years ago.  The price level for agricultural products had not changed in that period.  The prices were the same in the Community last May or June as they were three years prior to that.  They admitted that production costs had increased but they felt that the price level of 1967 for agricultural products was entirely too high and the only way to beat down production was to leave prices at a standstill.  In Ireland, costs increased sharply between 1967 and 1970&mdash;maybe to a lesser extent within the Community but undoubtedly costings increased, but there has been no increase in prices. Furthermore, the Community representatives were unable to state if prices would increase this year, next year or the following year or whether this level would remain for a longer period until, even according to our own standards, such prices may be deemed to be barely economic.  I do not know if the Government have addressed their minds to the freezing of prices for agricultural products.  The Minister's statement in regard to price support centres mainly on dairy products.  I believe the Irish people are not getting a proper assessment of what is happening in relation to this Common Market question. There are different views.  Let me quote from page 2 of this same booklet:</P>
    <P>The alarming situation&mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash;this is of interest to us because there is £30 million plus there for milk support although it is not deemed sufficient. I should love to hear the Taoiseach explain to a group of farmers at Skibbereen Mart or at Bandon Mart the statement that everything will be bright for them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy FitzGerald is <Col N="344" /> entitled to make his own assessment.  I hold the same line.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree.  I do not know if it was in the Deputy's constituency that the warble fly breakdown occurred but it was somewhere around there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me put this quotation on the record:</P>
      <P>The alarming situation on the milk market necessitates a coordinated set of measures the purpose of which would be to bring about a sharp reduction in the butter surpluses which have accumulated. Concurrently, action needs to be taken with a view to establishing structural equilibrium on the market at a later date.  In the long run, it is only structural measures that can help here effectively.  The measures proposed by the Commission to this end are as follows:</P>
      <P>(1)  Special campaigns to increase sales of butter;</P>
      <P>Well and good.  That is difficult at the moment here in Ireland because there is more or less a campaign against increased consumption of butter.</P>
      <P>(2)  a general and appreciable reduction in the price of butter whether coupled with revision of the values of the non-fat components of milk;</P>
      <P>(3)  an increase of 250,000 in the number of dairy cows to be slaughtered in 1969 and again in 1970, so as to speed up the current structural adjustment in milk production.</P>
      <P>At the end of 1968 they want an increase of 250,000 cows in the numbers to be slaughtered in 1969 and 1970.  They suggest a production subsidy for specified grades of beef and veal during 1969 and 1970.  I do not like to delay too long on this but it also says:</P>
      <P>However, the problem of surpluses cannot be solved otherwise than by a set of measures that must be adopted as a whole and fitted into a reform programme which lays down when and where they shall apply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="345" /> The measures proposed ... will not be enough&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>these are the measures I have read out</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;to reduce the Community's stock of dairy cows to a level at which a lasting balance could be established between supply and demand; to achieve this dairy herds will have to be diminished by about 3,000,000 cows within five years.  Special measures will therefore have to be taken as part of the plan to reform the structure of agricultural production. The medium-term measures listed in section 20 above should, therefore, be followed by others as indicated below:</P>
    <P>(i)  For farmers who own at least two dairy cows, the &ldquo;structural reform grant&rdquo; recommended in section 70 below would be raised by an amount calculated on the number of dairy cows on condition that these farmers cease all agricultural activity within three years of the date when the reform programme enters into force.  This supplementary amount may be paid in instalments spread over four years, or in a lump sum.</P>
    <P>That chapter centres around reducing the farm force.  The next measure suggested is:</P>
    <P>A grant of 75 UA per year per dairy cow disposed of;&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>I think UA refers to unit of account and I believe it is equivalent to 1 dollar, so that there would be about £30 bonus for a cow.</P>
    <P>At paragraph 22 in the book it says:</P>
    <P>In the light of the supply position in dairy products it would, of course, be well to discontinue such measures as lead to the maintenance or increase of existing dairy herds.</P>
    <P>Farmers here are seeking increased prices for milk and the NFA and ICMSA are telling us of their disappointment in this morning's papers. Mr. Maher yesterday told us of the advantages of EEC membership, but is this EEC statement conducive to an increase in the price of milk?  It could be said that an increased milk price leads to both the maintenance and the increase of existing dairy herds.  It is <Col N="346" /> quite clear that will not be allowed when and if we move into Europe.</P>
    <P>The representatives from different organisations in this country who went to Europe to appraise the position&mdash; I refer in particular again to the members of the Labour Party&mdash;performed a very useful service because, so far as the two main parties are concerned, Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael, they are both quite satisfied that entering EEC is the best thing to do.  To my mind, neither of them indicated sufficiently the many obstacles and barriers and difficulties in our path to Europe. These are all set down here by the Commission themselves.  This programme will revolutionise farming completely.  We can only guess what may happen.  The Commission indicate quite clearly that numbers must be depressed.  That will happen.  If our present aim is realised we could be full members of the Community by 1978, which is not so far away.</P>
    <P>If numbers are to be depressed what will happen?  What steps are being taken by the Government to provide alternative employment for those who will have to leave agriculture and possibly other industries?  Perhaps we should confine ourselves largely to the agricultural industry today.  There is nothing in the Minister's statement or any indication by his Department about any policies formulated to provide alternative employment.  As we were informed, it is presupposed by this Commission that some farming population will become redundant.  We are making no provision in that field.</P>
    <P>I shall not stress the probability of people from Europe buying up some of our farms.  If they do they will be acting legitimately.  They will be quite entitled to bid competitively for any holdings on offer.  I think that policy will be rigidly adhered to by the Commission as part of our price for entering. I discussed this matter with the Commission.  It arose directly during our party's discussions there because comments had been made in the German Press about the manner in which Germans were treated in Ireland. A great deal of publicity was given to the fact that three farm homes of Germans in the midlands were burned <Col N="347" /> and that they were, so to speak, bounded out of the country and that the Land Commission was pestering other German owners of lands.  That was their side of the story.  That led up to a discussion on what would happen when we get into EEC.  It is quite clear that there will be no interference with any outsiders coming to buy our land.  They will be legally entitled to do so and if we object we shall be told that we can go to Italy or Germany and buy farms there if we want to do so.</P>
    <P>Why this bright picture now?  This is what came to us from the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries.  We will have a look at what they have to say.  In all fairness I do not think it bears out to any degree the statements made by the Taoiseach and other Ministers in recent times on the question of the Common Market.</P>
    <P>I referred at some length to milk and dairy products.  We will have a look at what the Department have to say.  They agree on the difficulty of selling milk and dairy products.  Some people feel very pleased that the market price for milk within the EEC countries at present is 50 per cent or more higher than ours.  That is one of the things that has been bandied about as an advantage of Irish membership of the EEC.  We are told in this booklet, and in statements made by the Commission, that our share of this market may be greatly reduced and if the price freeze continues the price obtainable when we become a full member, say, in 1978, may not be much greater relatively than the price our farmers are in receipt of today.</P>
    <P>The Community stressed to us in their booklets and leaflets that milk and milk products are out.  I have read at length from their statements.  I want the dairy farmers to take note of that. I have seen their statements.  I do not agree entirely with some of the statements made by their leaders because the quotations I put before the House are from the Commission's Secretariat. They are not mine.  I depend more on their statements than on views given by organisations of any kind.  So far as dairy products are concerned I should <Col N="348" /> like the Taoiseach or the Minister to tell a group of farmers, and particularly small farmers, what the advantages are and to stress in detail what the advantages are.</P>
    <P>I hope they are far in excess of what I think they will be.  I hope they are, but our type of agricultural structure does not fit in with the European structure.  We are an island far removed from the EEC.  We will have to make changes, and big changes, if we are to measure up to their standards in a reasonable way.  We are not doing that.  I want to stress again that neither are we making any moves towards providing alternative employment for our redundant farming community.</P>
    <P>Poultry and eggs are out.  I think the Irish view agrees with that.  Poultry and eggs used to be a very important industry.  Now it is scarcely worth mentioning. Its value is confined to a small number of people.  The traditional producer has disappeared.  The price is too low and markets are not available. There is no need to quote from their statements or from the Department's statement on poultry and eggs.</P>

      <P>Potatoes are out.  Fruit and vegetables are out.  We are left with two big items which are stressed very forcibly by the different organisations, and I hope rightly so, cattle and beef, veal and so on.  Through the beef incentive bonus scheme we are developing that trade and I hope we will continue to develop it.  Possibly the fact of being within a community of 270,000,000 or 280,000,000 should be helpful so far as such commodities are concerned.  I say &ldquo;should be helpful&rdquo; because their own booklet tells us that the production within the Community at present is almost at par with their requirements.</P>
      <P>I do not think it is necessary for me to take up any more of the time of the House on the question of the EEC so far as it relates to agriculture.  I have referred to some of the main features and I have endeavoured to give a valid, balanced view by quoting the Commission's official policy sectors which are important sectors to Irish agriculture. I mentioned milk products, pigs and pig meat, eggs and poultry, fruit and sugar beet.  Our price for sugar beet is as high today as, if not higher than, the Community price, we are told.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To sum up, while the Government are making great claims about, and endeavouring to get some kudos out of, our proposed entry into the EEC, they are taking no definite steps to prepare us for this changed society which will exist if we become a member of that Community.  I am referring to the agricultural side.  If the Minister had anything <Col N="350" /> to offer it should have been embodied in his opening statement.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I shall be brief because I do not like keeping Deputy Mrs. Hogan O'Higgins waiting too long.  Horticultural production is doing well now in West Cork. We are very pleased with the factory at Skibbereen.  It is providing a good market for local produce and it is providing good employment at good rates of wages.  However, it is about time they paid some dividend on the share money they got from subscribers.  When this factory commenced perhaps there was some doubt about its survival but they collected amounts of up to £200 from various people all over that area <Col N="351" /> and having regard to the reports we have seen, and were delighted to see, it is about time they thought of declaring a dividend.  I would not like them to operate in the same way as a notable firm in Dublin operates.</P>

      <P>The development of horticulture is very pleasing and it could possibly be developed further along the west coast.  It may be the best method of providing some of the alternative employment that will be needed for redundant farmers.  Another advantage is that in the Skibbereen area now there are a number of small farmers employed in this factory.  Of course there are a number of them employed growing the products for it directly.  Part-time farming is a good idea.  I have stressed this here time and time again.  Possibly if we could provide part-time employment for farmers it would eliminate the necessity to pay out money to them directly, as happens at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to bacon production it is <Col N="352" /> most disappointing to me that we seem to have failed in our efforts to encourage the small and medium farmers and indeed cottiers to increase the number of pigs kept by them.  I hoped years ago that pigs and sows would be a great side-line for the small farmer. The idea does not seem to have got off the ground.  What is happening?  Are prices too low?  Is there a move to weed out the small pig producer just as there was in the past a successful move to weed out the small poultry or egg producer? Are these combines, stations of 2,000, 3,000 and 4,000&mdash;perhaps 10,000 pigs later on&mdash;to take over?  Are we to have sow farms of 100, 150, 200 sows? Is it likely that in the not too distant future the pig industry will be confined to a relatively small number of people? Will these big combines, favoured of course by processing plants, take over? The factories will say that the bigger combines can supply pigs with greater regularity than can small producers but I have stressed here, and I believe the former Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries was of the same view, that it would be a much greater advantage to our people as a whole if we were able to tackle this question again of trying to get farmers, cottiers and other country dwellers to keep more pigs.  I notice that the guaranteed price for the higher grade has increased by only 10s but the prices of all feedingstuffs have increased sharply of late.</P>
    <P>The only conclusion I can reach is that the margin of profit per pig is too small for the producer.  If a man is fattening, say, 15 pigs at a time and is making a reasonable profit, one would expect him to increase the number to 25 or 35.  Even lower percentage increases would result in a sizable increase in the pig population.  As this booklet indicates, the increases are hardly worth mentioning.  There is no great change in the number of pigs.  It is a pity that this should be the case.</P>
    <P>Although I am a member of the Cork Committee of Agriculture, I do not know what our agricultural advisers are doing in relation to pig production. They should be advising people to engage in pig production and encouraging producers to increase their numbers. For some years past I have been <Col N="353" /> pessimistic about the prospects for the small producer.  As I see it, the industry will be taken over by combines. We know that there is quite a lot of interest now in the establishment of units.  Regardless of whether those concerned are private individuals or persons working on a co-operative basis, if this idea is implemented, the day is over for the man who keeps five or ten pigs.</P>
    <P>During the years I have spoken here on the question of bacon processing and from time to time I have expressed resentment that there is no bacon factory in south-west Cork.  It is pleasing to note that during the past 12 months indications in this direction are favourable and I can only hope that they will prove to be correct.  In Cork city there are four bacon factories but, of course, the city is a distance of some 100 miles from parts of Cork county. A factory should be located where the pigs are produced.  In West Cork there is produced 11 per cent of the total pig population of the country.  Why, therefore, should we not have a factory in West Cork?  I know that there is opposition from the pig factories in Cork city but pigs are not produced in Cork city.  I am not advocating a cutting down in the number of factories in any one place but I see the present situation as being a result of bad management.  This idea of centralisation is not good.  There are other areas of activity in Cork city that would cater for anybody who might become redundant.  I am aware also that the bacon factory people in Cork city are endeavouring to get the co-operation of the trade unions in hindering the establishment of a factory in south-west Cork&mdash;a factory that it is our right to have.  I am glad that some business people in Ireland have realised that the place to locate a factory is where the raw material is produced.  I have not the slightest doubt that if we were to get this factory the result would be a marked increased in pig numbers.</P>
    <P>Pig producers usually like to be present when their pigs are being sold, weighed and so on, but of course this is not possible when the pigs must be sent a long distance to a bacon factory. I want to impress on the Government <Col N="354" /> the desirability of co-operating with those who are interested in having a factory located in south-west Cork.  If I were not to do so I would not be doing my duty on behalf of the people who sent me here.  Representations in this direction are being made to every public representative in West Cork. Each representative is being asked to help in any way possible towards securing this much needed factory for the area.</P>
    <P>I have no wish to delay the House unduly but I must say a few words in relation to brucellosis.  I notice that some improvements have been made towards eradicating the disease but I am disappointed that Cork county is excluded from the scheme at the present time.  The Minister has stated that grants of up to £75 for pedigree animals and £25 for non-pedigree animals are payable when the herd is certified free of the disease.  I understand that applies to all counties.  The case I made in the past about brucellosis was that some farmers&mdash;these may be small in number&mdash;sold infected animals at public marts with the result that untold damage was caused in some instances.  On the other hand, anyone who goes to his veterinary officer to report an outbreak of the disease among his herd and who takes steps to isolate his cattle gets no help from the State.  I am tired raising that matter.  I thought that Deputy Blaney would have done something in this regard on a national scale.  The unfortunate person whose herd is afflicted by this disease but who takes steps to contain the disease within his own herd is acting in the national interest and should receive some reward.</P>
    <P>I am not satisfied that we have done enough in relation to brucellosis. People have sold at public marts and fairs animals which should never have been taken to any such public place.  I am not suggesting that the incidence is very high but it is of the greatest importance that the disease should be contained.</P>
    <P>I shall refer briefly to sheep scab. A former Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, Deputy Haughey, said in 1966 or 1967 that animal diseases cost the country £25 million annually.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="355" /> Sheep scab is supposed to be responsible for a sizable percentage of that loss.  We are told by our technical advisers that with complete co-operation sheep scab could be eliminated entirely within two years.  If that is so, and I am satisfied it is, surely this disease should have disappeared long ago?</P>
    <P>Cork County Council set up a special committee to deal with sheep dipping and sheep scab or other ailments common to sheep.  We formed a joint committee with Kerry County Council in view of the substantial numbers of sheep in the mountain ranges of the Cork-Kerry border. Every effort was made to ensure that all sheep in Cork and Kerry would be dipped and that regulations would be rigidly adhered to.  However, I regret to say we have received very little co-operation from the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries in recent times.  They scarcely answer our correspondence.</P>
    <P>The joint committee was approved by Deputy Haughey when he was Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries. He also approved of another committee in Cork, the Cork animal health committee, and assured both of his full co-operation.  In fairness to him let me say he did give that co-operation during his period as Minister, but since he left that office we are not getting the co-operation we should get.</P>
    <P>I am surprised that Department officials are not able to formulate some system whereby sheep owners would have to measure up to their obligations to the community.   The position in Cork at one time was that offenders would be prosecuted.  There have been no prosecutions of late because the case was made that the district justice treated the prosecutions with contempt by fining the offenders 1s.  The reason I am attaching importance to this matter is that the good suffer as much as or more than the bad.  One farmer may comply rigidly with all the regulations but the fellow next door&mdash;they have a mountain range in common&mdash; does not, and the man who abides by the regulations cannot tell his neighbour <Col N="356" /> to do likewise but has to go to his local councillor or other public representative to get the Department and the local authority to ensure he will do so.  I do not think we are getting the help we should get from the local authority.</P>
    <P>The pilot areas are set down here.  I know the Cork pilot area quite well, and I am satisfied the idea was a good one.  Is there any possibility of increasing the size of the areas?  That is a demand we get every other day.  We are asked that the grants under the farm buildings scheme operating in the pilot areas should be extended to the 12 western counties.  It is noticeable within the 12 western counties that farm buildings and indeed roadways leading to farm houses are not up to standard, and it is a reasonable request that the farm building grants should be extended.</P>
    <P>I do not want to hold up the House much longer.  There are some matters in the document supplied by the Department with which I have not dealt, nor have I dealt to any great degree with the Minister's statement because there was very little in it with which to deal.  One thing I would ask is why they change their minds so often.  A forceful case was made here about the advantages of these higher prices for the smaller farmer, that the higher grant was being given to the farmer producing under 7,000 gallons. He was to be given a special inducement because he required it and the other fellow did not require it because he was much bigger.  Now that is all changed.  I see here that the man producing up to 7,000 gallons of milk will get an increase of 1d.  Am I right in saying that the man producing between 7,000 and 30,000 gallons will get an increase of 3d?</P>
    <P>A strong case was made for the small man last year, and the case against a change, which was advocated by some Deputies here, was resisted strongly by Deputy Blaney at the time. Are we to assume then that because Deputy Blaney was from Donegal, where possibly there is a high percentage of small farmers, and because Deputy Gibbons is from Carlow-Kilkenny, where the land is much more <Col N="357" /> productive and the herds are much bigger, this change in policy has come about to help the bigger farmer?  The Department of Agriculture and Fisheries do not seem to have fixed views and it is not today or yesterday that happened.  That position has obtained within the Department for a long time.</P>
    <P>I do not want to go back on old history, but I remember that when Deputy Smith was Minister for Agriculture he brought a measure into this House setting down that the membership of committees of agriculture should be comprised mainly of farming organisations&mdash;at least 50 per cent. Deputy Blaney came in a few years later and said that it was all wrong, a change was made and we are now back where we started.  This chopping and changing shows the Government are not sure of themselves; they are not positive about which road they are taking.  An increase of 1d a gallon for 7,000 gallons of milk or less cannot amount to more than £29 even for the man at the end of the scale.  If the man producing between 7,000 and 30,000 gallons is entitled to 3d so is the man producing up to 7,000 gallons.  Why will the Department not give this extra 2d?  I think they should.</P>
    <P>A number of years ago I made a case for a subsidy for island holders.  I was quite satisfied the case was justifiable and it would not cost very much to implement, but it fell on deaf ears until Deputy Haughey became Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries.  In fairness to him he saw the justification of the island holders' claim and acted without much delay.  He gave them a subsidy of 1s 6d in the £.  Deputy Haughey left Agriculture some years ago now and incomes and costings have increased sharply since then.  I am now asking for an adjustment to be made in the figure laid down by him because I think it is about time it should be increased. I do not have the slightest doubt that if Deputy Haughey were Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries today it would have been increased before now.  I am asking Deputy Gibbons, the present Minister for Agriculture, to increase the subsidy.  At the time the Is 6d was introduced the islanders were <Col N="358" /> quite satisfied but I hope this figure will be increased.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned at the outset, I have used documentation today which I seldom use when making my contributions. I thought it well worth while quoting from this book because it gives valuable official information.  I suggest that books of this kind which come from the Commission be made available so that farmers can purchase them.  If they were sent out to organisations free of charge it would be a job well done.  A book such as this which gives official information should be at the disposal of all farmers and I would ask the Minister to consider the feasibility of publishing such books.  There is much more information in them than in books put out by different organisations which, it could be said, are slanted in their views and in any case they are the views of the particular organisation and not official ones.</P>
    <P>I apologise to the House for delaying it so long.  I think it is justifiable to delay in order to discuss the many aspects of our agricultural policy in a detailed fashion on the occasion of the annual debate on this Estimate.  It would take a full day to deal with all the headings so I have referred to what I think are the more important ones and I am sure the other headings will be covered by later speakers.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I want to say I am surprised the Minister has not returned to the House.  I think the Minister should be in the House when the debate on his Estimate is taking place unless there is some valid reason for his absence.  The Minister left as soon as he completed his address and he has not returned.  I do not think this is correct.  It may be that Fianna Fáil are too long in power but I disagree entirely with the absence of a Minister when discussions on his Department are taking place.  I think it is treating the House and democracy with contempt. If it is not possible for the Minister to be here discussion on his Estimate should be postponed.  I am sure Deputies would agree with that because, after all, the Government order the day's business.  I want to voice my disapproval of this growing practice.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephMSheridan" hpid="Mr. Sheridan Mr. Sheridan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheridan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is seldom my voice <Col N="359" /> is heard in this House.  The Chair can be sure that it would not be heard on this occasion if I did not class myself as a fairly practical farmer.  Great play is made inside and outside this House from time to time, and at every crossroads especially at election time and at every county council meeting, about the small farmer.  I am glad to be able to say I came from a stock of small farmers even though I am now living in a county of larger ones and I may have graduated to high levels.  Small farmers have never had an easy living at any time in their career.  The small farmer always had to work hard and it was he, of all people, who earned his bread by the sweat of his brow.  He never had it easy and, apparently, he never will.</P>
      <P>There is one consolation, which anybody who is honest will admit : the small farmer today is much better off than he was at any time in the past.  It is not unusual today&mdash;in fact, it is quite a common thing&mdash;for small farmers all over the country to own their own motor cars.  Again, it is not unusual to see them using a tractor instead of tramping along behind a pair of horses.  Surely this is a sign of progress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Great play, too much of it dishonest, has been made about the small farmer. I should like to stress to the Minister and to the Government that the small farmer is entitled to hold his small farm and to get subsidiary employment convenient to that small farm.  If all those who wail about the conditions of the small farmer and bemoan his lot would put their heads together and provide subsidiary employment for him convenient to his holding we would then have a prosperous community of small farmers.  We have evidence of that in the midlands where there is work to be done for Bord na Móna which brings the small farmer a weekly wage plus the benefits he can reap from his small farm.  One can see the improvement where there is a weekly wage coming in; there is an improvement in the land, in the housing, in the mode of transport and, above all, in the farmer's family.  This solution has been proposed by the Minister for Lands, Deputy Seán Flanagan, but it <Col N="360" /> does not seem to be getting any further. I should like to see this proposal put into operation.  We would then have, if not a wealthy community, at least a comfortable community, a community of which we could be proud.  Surely it is admitted that there is no better stock than the people I am talking about.</P>
    <P>The larger farmer also has one consolation. I do not count myself an old man by any means but I remember the time when cattle, sheep and pigs were unmarketable.  That happened on many occasions in the past.  We were and are dependent on the British market, except for some European contacts which can be very dicey at times and, at times, very disappointing. Over the past year practically any kind of livestock in reasonable condition made a good market.  That is a relief to a great many people&mdash;to the producer, to the country and to its economy by and large&mdash;and that is why I think the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries should give every encouragement to the farmer engaged in livestock production to produce more and to bring his stock into better condition.  This is one sphere in which there is no burden at all placed on the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>We have heard a great deal about the Common Market.  This year I spent three weeks in two Common Market countries.  To the very best of my ability I tried to acquaint myself with conditions in these countries, with prices and with production.  I went to livestock sales, to beef and bacon factories, and I saw the products going out by rail and plane to France and Germany.  I am satisfied beyond all doubt that there is no reason why we should not go ahead and push our way into the EEC.  That is my own personal opinion.  I am glad to say it is also the opinion of the Government and of the main Opposition party. Everyone is free to hold his own opinion but I cannot see any reason why it should be to our disadvantage to join the EEC.  I do not pretend that by joining the EEC life would become a bed of roses.</P>
    <P>The people in the countries I visited are very well-established.  Their populations are much larger than ours. They certainly work much harder than <Col N="361" /> we do here.  They are prepared for longer hours.  I have here figures for the EEC in regard to agriculture, veterinary services, the statutory organisation of industry in the Netherlands, production costs in the consumption and export of milk and dairy products.</P>
    <P>There is nothing that these countries are doing that we cannot do.  We have one great advantage.  We have good land and we have an equable climate. These are very much to our advantage. I would like to see the Government and the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries giving every encouragement to the farmer to become more efficient and to produce more because of our proposed entry into Europe. The heifer scheme met with a great deal of criticism.  We heard a good deal about racketeering and the evils of such schemes.  I believe it was a good scheme and, were it not for that scheme, I am very doubtful that we would have today the cattle population that we have and, God knows, we can do with more.  I am not saying that the subsidy should be increased for the beef cattle incentive scheme but the scheme should be revised.  At the moment it is necessary that two checks be carried out and this does not improve the efficiency of the scheme. Nowadays the farmers can be trusted and one check carried out by officials of the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries should be quite sufficient. Farmers are well aware of the value of the calves.  There were cases last summer where calves fetched as much as £50.  I am appealing to the Minister to have this scheme revised because it is not good enough that the farmer must wait until the second check is carried out before the grant is paid. I am sorry the Minister is not here but I intend to discuss this matter with him later.</P>
    <P>I do not deny that the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries have done good work and much progress has been made in the matter of livestock breeding and progeny testing.  However, much more work remains to be done. In view of our application to join the EEC I should like to see more cattle of the European-type, such as the South Devon and Charollais breeds, introduced <Col N="362" /> into this country and the bulls made available to farmers throughout the country.</P>
    <P>Deputy Murphy mentioned the western counties.  In my business I buy cattle for my own farm and for other people and I have occasion to visit fairs and marts in the west every month.  The farmers in the west of Ireland are the best producers of quality cattle in the country.  They have certain breeds of cattle there and once they leave the area they cannot be replaced.  Unfortunately, in recent years the farmers have tended to go into dairying and I am doubtful if this is an economic proposition for them, apart from the fact that it constitutes a further burden on the Exchequer.  It would be an advantage to the Exchequer and would be in the national interest if, instead of following this course, a subsidy was paid for every calf in the west.  The farmer in the west generally operates a small farm and he would be better off if the method I recommend were introduced rather than changing the breed of cattle and stocking low-producing cows.</P>
    <P>The lack of farm workers is a serious problem.  I do not blame the people who do not wish to work on the land when they find they can do much better in industry.  However, some recommendation will have to be made by the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries to the Department of Social Welfare, or some concrete proposals must be made if this country is to have sufficient farmworkers.  It is often stated that the small farmer is the backbone of the country but the farmworker is the backbone of the farm.  It does not matter how much mechanisation is carried out on the farm, the owner cannot continue to operate without reliable farmworkers.</P>
    <P>We all know that the farmworker does not obtain the same wages as the worker in industry but it is essential that something be done to improve conditions for him.  He must be given sufficient wages to enable him to remain on the land.  Years ago people were interested in remaining on the land and in many cases there were families who had a tradition of working on farms throughout the country. However, that situation does not <Col N="363" /> obtain at the moment and unless we take some steps to help the farmworkers we will not have a sufficient labour force.</P>
    <P>We are sometimes told that the farming industry suffers because of the lack of education among farmers.  I do not believe that.  I know very competent farmers who had very little formal education.  However, with all the changes in the world in future it will be necessary for every young man who intends to work as a farm manager or farm worker to get some specialised education.  Such a man would benefit from one year at least in an agricultural school in which he would be shown the methods he would be using in his later life.  I attended such a school myself and never regretted it.  Such education is a help to anyone in later life.</P>
    <P>Our committees of agriculture give some help in this direction but they are only scratching the surface.  There are certain types of people who can send their children to school for a time with the help of a little subsidy from the Department but the subsidy is not sufficient for the people I have in mind.</P>
    <P>We hear about the various farms which have been set up by the Department in places like Mayo, and here and there around the country.  I would like to have a record of the numbers of farmers from each county who have even seen one of these farms.  I do not believe many farmers visit those places.  I would like to see many more research or demonstration farms set up in the various parishes with the help of the committees of agriculture and local organisations.  The Department would do very useful work if they set about establishing small demonstration farms in the various parishes in rural Ireland.  Very few people visit the present demonstration farms.  This does not reflect credit on the Department or on the farmers.  I spent three weeks in the countries I mentioned earlier and have practical knowledge of what is happening in them.  In conclusion, I must say that I hope we will have speedy entry into the European Economic Community.</P>

      <P>I would like to protest about the taking of this Estimate at this particular stage.  I appreciate that arrangements are made by the Whips for the taking of business. When one looks at the three Whips one is struck by the fact that they are all urban Deputies.  Two of them are from Dublin city and one is from Dún Laoghaire.  The Estimate for the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries might not seem as important to them as it does to those of us who represent rural Ireland.  Some Deputies may be inclined to give what appears to be lip-service to the agricultural community.  We like to boast that agriculture is our major industry.  We like to boast that farmers are getting more grants than anyone else.  The fact remains that the most important Estimate of the year was taken on a day on which there were two by-elections. Whether it is proper or not, it has become the practice for Deputies to go out and work on by-election days.  For that reason very important Estimates should not be taken on such days.  I must be very frank and admit that I was not in the House yesterday.  I was in south County Dublin.  I did not hear a news bulletin.  I did not hear the Minister's speech.  It was not until I got an urgent telephone call this morning to ask me to speak on agriculture that I was aware that the Estimate was under discussion.  Some of that is my own fault.  I should have been in the House, but it has become the practice of Deputies to work in by-election areas.  In such circumstances either the House should be adjourned or business that is not quite so important should be taken.  Quite recently at a social function a certain Minister said to me that there was not much interest taken in what I say in the House.  That is not important, but it is important to remember that I represent a very large constituency which goes from almost Athlone town to Killaloe and from the bridge of Banagher down to the parish of Ennistymon.  That constituency is mainly composed of small farms.  It is a 3-seat constituency and because of the illness of Deputy Carty and the professional commitments of Deputy H. Gibbons I feel that I am the only Deputy in the constituency who really <Col N="365" /> is aware of what the position is there. Whether the Minister takes notice of my contribution or not, I would be grateful if the House took notice that we in the west are falling behind the rest of the world.  We have the largest number of small farmers in the country.</P>
      <P>I also feel that the Minister should not have left the House this morning leaving us with the Parliamentary Secretary, excellent in his own way, but Dublin-born and reared.  By the very nature of his environment he cannot be sympathetic or understanding towards the problems and conditions of rural Ireland.  The Minister should have sent in a rural Parliamentary Secretary. This is not asking too much. I am rather shocked at the Government's handling of the whole affair.  No Government speaker has offered or even sat in this morning to hear the debate.  This must be an indication of the view that the Government take of the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries as a whole.  I hope it is not.</P>
      <P>Much has been said this morning about conditions in the EEC.  In this House we have not been entirely helpful to the farmers.  We have not been truthful to them.  One reads speeches in which the farmers are being told that most of their problems will be over once we enter the EEC.  They are told that life in the EEC will hold great advantages for them.  This is not a fact. Whether we go into the EEC or not depends on what the British position is. If we go in we will get better prices for our better stock but we will have to work harder in order to compete with the Dutch, German and French farmers. We cannot say that we will be better off in the EEC.  We must make conditions here such that we will be better off in the EEC.  We have not been frank enough.  We have not tried to educate our people about what the position of the Irish farmer will be in the EEC.  It has been said that there is no future for farmers unless they have 200 acres.  I am convinced that in some circumstances some of our small farmers can survive in the EEC.  It is not so much the size of the farm that matters but the use that is made of it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Cork ESB district as elsewhere, progress of the post-development scheme has been retarded by the great numbers now seeking supply as a result of the reduction in special service <Col N="373" /> charges arranged by the Government in June, 1968, and the necessity to strengthen the existing system to accommodate the rapidly increasing load.

      <P>On the assumption that the Minister is well briefed, is he not aware that in this House, as Minister for Transport and Power, he gave a definite assurance that a supply would be provided to the five townlands in question not later than 1967? Earlier assurances were given regarding the years 1965 and 1966.  Will the Minister not further agree that it is completely out of place for the Minister and his successor, who is responsible for this State-sponsored body, to dishonour assurances given in respect of the provision of supply to these townlands which are located near Dunmanway town and the headquarters of the ESB?

      <P>I think the present Minister has already made it clear to the House that the board, for the first time&mdash;certainly in my memory as Minister&mdash;underestimated the number of persons who would take connection when service charges for the more distant subscribers were reduced.  They estimated some 26,000 and 36,000 additional persons are now likely to be interested.  In addition, the board underestimated the extent to which the consumption of current would increase. It increased more rapidly than anticipated requiring strengthening of all the existing lines and the provision of more power in every area.  Further, there has been a greater number of new houses erected and of factories and hotels requiring power than was anticipated when the original prediction was made.

      <P>It is a statutory contribution condition for entitlement to disability benefit that an insured person must have not less than 26 employment contributions paid or credited in the contribution year governing the claim. Statutory regulations also provide that where for any two complete consecutive contribution years there are no employment contributions paid or credited in respect of an insured person <Col N="375" /> then an employment contribution shall not be credited to such person until 26 employment contributions have been paid in respect of him.</P>
      <P>The insured person referred to in the question, who had not been insurably employed in this country between 1954 and 1967, surrendered her 1967-68 and 1968-69 insurance cards each bearing 13 stamps.  On 20th March, 1969, she claimed disability benefit and submitted medical evidence of incapacity covering the period 10th October, 1968, to 17th March, 1969.  She was not entitled to disability benefit in respect of this claim as she had not 26 employment contributions paid or credited in the governing contribution years.</P>
      <P>The insured person made a second claim for disability benefit in December, 1969.  Following investigation it was found that one of the stamps on her 1968-69 insurance card had not been paid in respect of insurable employment. She had therefore only 12 employment contributions paid in respect of the 1968-69 contribution year and as the total number of contributions paid in 1967-68 and 1968-69, following the gap in her insurance record from 1954 to 1967, was only 25, credited employment contributions could not be granted to her in respect of the period October, 1968, to March, 1969.  She was not therefore entitled to disability benefit as she had not 26 employment contributions paid or credited in the governing contribution year 1968-69.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Inquiry was made of the British Department of Health and Social Security to see whether contributions had been paid in Britain which would help her to qualify for benefit but without success.  Investigations were also initiated into the insured person's employment in 1968-69 and there has been delay in completing them due, partly, to difficulty experienced in contacting the person having charge of the employment records and partly to the fact that it was learned during the course of the inquiry that the insured person was, in fact, working during part of the period for which she had submitted medical certificates of incapacity <Col N="376" /> for work and claimed disability benefit. The inquiries will be concluded as quickly as possible and the claim will then be reviewed.</P>
    <P>A new benefit year for women commences on 7th December, 1970, and if the insured person continues to be incapable of work after that date she will be entitled to disability benefit by virtue of employment contributions paid and credited in the 1969-70 contribution year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Minister for the detail with which he answered the question, but does he consider it reasonable that somebody who has sent in 40 certificates should, at the end of that period, have got only acknowledgments and that after a question has been asked by me in this House it is now indicated to the woman concerned that there is a doubt about one of her stamps?  Does the Minister know that the reason why there is some difficulty in checking on the employment record of this woman is that the person who had the record of the cards has been dead for five or six months? I do not know if they are going to wait for the last day until she rises again before they get the records.  It seems to be the only way in which this could be done.</P>
      <P>Does the Minister not agree that it is extremely unfair to an insured person, particularly a widow with a number of children, that she should have to wait almost a year for benefit and depend on home assistance while the Department are spending money finding out whether some of the stamps she put on were put on incorrectly? This is one of the greatest cods we have in the Department, that while they are supposed to be terribly busy and unable to deal with normal cases, they are spending time checking on unfortunate women like this.</P>

      <P>Schools vested in the former Commissioners of National Education which are no longer required for school purposes and where the lease is still current are surrendered back to the grantor or his successors in title if they are discoverable.  Where the grantors or his successors in title are not discoverable the premises are disposed of by the Commissioners of Public Works.  If the buildings have remained in use for a period of 12 years after the term of the lease has expired, the State acquires prescriptive title and arrangements for the disposal of the premises are made by the Commissioners of Public Works, who usually advertise for tenders for their purchase.</P>

      <P>Listening to Deputy FitzGerald one would imagine that I had not had discussions with the teachers.  He is fully aware, I am sure, that over the last year and a half I have had constant discussions with them and ultimately because of the fact that I could not get agreement between the three bodies, I had to put forward my own proposals and I stated that I was implementing those proposals. At the moment we are at a rather delicate stage in relation to the question of posts of responsibility in secondary schools.  As I mentioned, I have discussed this over the whole period of a year and a half and I found that in the end I could not get agreement so I had to do the best I could to try to meet the conflicting claims of the various bodies and this was embodied in the proposals I put forward and the proposals which I am at present implementing.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government whether he is aware that zoning regulations forbidding a concentration of industrial development in designated residential areas are now flouted in many parts of Dublin; whether his Department have this problem under consideration; whether action is contemplated; whether he has received any complaints on this matter; and whether he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I would remind the Deputy that this is primarily a problem for Dublin Corporation to consider and deal with.  So far as I am aware, the incidence of unauthorised industrial development in areas zoned for residential use in the draft development plan for Dublin is not as high as the Deputy suggests.  I understand that all cases of unauthorised development that come to notice are fully investigated by the corporation, that they have succeeded in having unauthorised structures removed and unauthorised uses terminated in a number of cases, and that they have several other cases of alleged unauthorised development under active investigation at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Very strong enforcement powers were given to planning authorities under the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, to deal with development commenced without planning permission on or after 1st October, 1964, when the 1963 Act came into operation, and I am satisfied that Dublin Corporation are prepared to use these powers where the circumstances warrant.  The powers cannot, however, be applied retrospectively in relation to uses established before the <Col N="391" /> 1963 Act came into operation and before they can be invoked it is necessary for the planning authority to be able to show beyond reasonable doubt that the development or use in question was commenced on or after 1st October, 1964.  In some cases it is not easy to establish the facts with any certainty.  This is particularly so in cases where the existing use of land can be claimed to be a continuation or reasonable intensification of an earlier similar use.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that a delegation made up of persons from several residential areas have already met the Minister for Local Government on this matter?  Further, is he aware that in several areas around Richmond Road, Fairview and Convent Road heavy industrial development has taken place adjacent to residential property while nothing can be done about it?  This appears to conflict with the Act but there has been no action on the part of Dublin Corporation to curtail these developments.</P>

      <P>A local authority have full statutory power to erect, acquire, purchase, convert or reconstruct, lease or otherwise provide dwellings.  Except where there is a specific statutory requirement to the contrary they can do all things necessary to this end, including the making of contracts.</P>
      <P>In pursuance of this power, the corporation, following public advertisement in February, 1968, entered into contracts for the provision of 1,352 purchase-type houses, including 732 at Donaghmede.</P>
      <P>My Department were not consulted before the contracts were signed by the corporation.  Consultation took place about the financing of the schemes and it was agreed that they would be financed in part from the corporation's capital allocation for house-purchase loans and grants and in part by loans guaranteed by the corporation from commercial agencies.  Approval was also given to the sale of the houses at a price not less than the full cost to the corporation of providing them, less the appropriate State and local authority grants.</P>

      <P>Before we adjourned the debate I had commented that there was a grave obligation on the Government, on all of us in this House and, in particular, on the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries to inform the farmers of the country honestly and truthfully what will be their position in Common Market conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies receive a large amount of information in the form of booklets and otherwise from the Department and from the Community among other places.  I have tried to keep abreast of <Col N="399" /> all the information.  I have been fortunate enough to have met people who have been taking part in EEC negotiations, two on behalf of this country and one on behalf of Britain.  From what I have read and from what I have been told by these people, I have concluded that the Irish farmer would be better off within the Community than he is at present, provided, of course, that he is geared to Community conditions.</P>
    <P>Any Deputy who chats with his constituents, as I do time and again, about their hopes for their future and for the future of this country within EEC conditions will know that most people are of the opinion that the small farmer will have no place within the Community whereas the big farmer will become very rich.  Of course, this will not be the situation.  It is agreed generally that the small farmer will fare badly but is it not the case that he is faring badly at the moment?  I am convinced that the small farmer has a better chance within the Community.  In the case of Britain entering the Community and this country remaining outside, we might exist for a very short time but after that short time there would be a complete collapse of our agricultural industry.</P>
    <P>It must not be concluded that the big farmer will necessarily be successful within Common Market conditions. He will not be successful unless he is geared to the conditions of the Community. It is my belief that the NFA, the ICMSA and other organisations are not being very straight with the farmers as well as with the Department and ourselves, because milk and dairy products in the EEC countries are in a very problematic position, to say the least.  The night before last a bulletin was issued by the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries announcing the increased income to the dairy farmers. This is fine but it is surely guaranteed to encourage people to get into milk production.  I have watched with alarm since I came into the House the absolute obsession of the Department with pushing farmers into dairying, getting agricultural advisers all round the country to say to small farmers : &ldquo;Get <Col N="400" /> into the dairy line.  You will have a steady income.&rdquo;  That is true.  It is a great help to the farmer to have a cheque coming in at the end of the month and not to have to wait until he sells a few cattle or lambs, but it is, in the long term, very bad economic policy.</P>
    <P>The beef incentive schemes have to some extent arrested this tendency, but, while the Department are taking that line, the dairy people&mdash;and who can blame them; their entire energies and their livelihood are tied up in this&mdash; are pressing for a greater income from milk.  If we provide a greater income from milk the logical conclusion to draw is that more and more people will go into milk production instead of getting out of it.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, I was not in the House when the Minister made his speech and I tried to read it this morning while Deputy Michael Pat Murphy was speaking.  As the House knows, he is always a very interesting speaker and it was very hard to concentrate on the two.  However, I am glad to note from the Minister's speech that the beef incentive bonus scheme has drawn some people out of dairying, but there again I have reservations about this.  When the first beef heifer grant, as we call it in the farming areas, was introduced some years ago I felt it was a bad thing because heifers of every description, good or bad, would be allowed to breed.  This is damaging for the cattle industry and as a result I have seen the most horrible types of animals straying around.  Only first-class stock will be accepted in the EEC, so that while we should be encouraging people into beef production we should be encouraging them into the production of the better type of beef.  If I were Minister I would increase the grant for pure bred animals, any breed, and not have beef, milk and everything mixed together. This is a mistake.</P>
    <P>Another difficulty&mdash;and I do not know how one gets around it&mdash;is that in the west of Ireland we used to go in a great deal for dairy shorthorns.  They are excellent cows in two ways : they are good for milk production and for suckling calves; a good dairy shorthorn cow can suckle two calves adequately.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="401" /> For some strange reason the dairy shorthorn has declined, certainly in the west.  I am glad to see the Minister has taken note of that and is trying to do something about it.  I agree it is a good thing to experiment with other breeds but a certain amount of caution is required.</P>
    <P>A neighbour and constituent of mine has gone into Charollais cattle in a big way.  He is a non-national, and it is interesting to watch his experiment.  It is enormously costly and the death rate at calving is very high.  I talked to his veterinary surgeon about it and there seems to be no explanation for this. Even the pure bred cows do not seem to be able to calve without assistance, and in rural Ireland it is not always easy to get your veterinary surgeon the moment you want him.  I am doubtful about the Charollais breed.  I do admit they grow quickly but they are not very suitable for the west of Ireland.  They need a great deal of feeding.  They are very hard on grass and need a lot of hand feeding as well.  On the other hand, I think Herefords and possibly shorthorns, the Kerrys, are suitable for the west of Ireland, and these breeds should be encouraged.</P>
    <P>I do not know how we are going to face our dairy farmers&mdash;and every constituency has them-and say to them : &ldquo;You would be better off out of milk production in the long run.&rdquo;  There will be a certain market for our dairy produce on the Continent, but they have their problems.  They have a big butter surplus and are encouraging the slaughter of cows.  They are trying to get over the butter surplus by publicity campaigns&mdash;&ldquo;use more butter&rdquo; and so on&mdash;but here this sort of campaign will not be very effective because the producers of margarine&mdash;more power to them&mdash;have a very slick campaign. Their advertisements and television coverage are good.  Another advantage to them is that margarine is so much cheaper than butter.  Those of us who are trying to run a house find butter is an expensive item, particularly where there are five or six children, and it is quite easy to sell the housewife margarine instead of butter.  Therefore, dairying is a problem.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the difficulty particularly <Col N="402" /> of farmers in the south who have specialised in dairying and never done anything else, but specialising is what the EEC want.  However, in the west of Ireland we have specialised in nothing.  The very big farmers might have a couple of hundred ewes, a few hundred cattle, 50 pigs and a few good horses.  The farmers will do that right down the line.  Even those who have only 25 acres will work the system of mixed farming with a few acres of tillage to feed their ewes, cows or other animals.  This would present a problem if we were members of the EEC.</P>
    <P>I do not think we have gone far enough in telling our people : &ldquo;You will not survive in the EEC unless you are prepared to work,&rdquo; and by that I mean &ldquo;look to the management aspect of farming, get out of this mixed farming we all do and try to specialise&rdquo;.  From reading the various reports supplied to us I can see there is a good prospect for our cattle industry in the EEC.  Our sheep industry is doubtful enough, though it can be improved. We have excellent lambs and those of us who produce sheep could specialise in having earlier and better lambs and market them earlier.  In this way there would be a much more lucrative continental market.</P>
    <P>On a few occasions I have met some French people at the end of the shooting season who if they were lucky enough to get some very early lamb at the end of February, asked: &ldquo;Why can we not get this in France?&rdquo;  I imagine there could be a great future for the lamb trade on the Continent if it were developed properly.</P>
    <P>Sheep numbers are declining.  I notice the Minister says this has been arrested to a certain extent.  In my constituency &mdash;and that is all I can judge from&mdash; sheep numbers are definitely declining. This is a bad thing.  I know why they are declining.  As far back as 1947 the price of wool was good.  It provided an income.  I remember a time when we used say the wool would pay for the rates.  It is hardly worth shearing the wretched stuff off their backs now.  It barely pays the contractor to do it, if it is being done by contract.  This little bit of income has disappeared.  Bord Olla have done their best about grading and that sort of thing and there <Col N="403" /> has been a slight improvement but there is just not a market for wool in this country or any other country. Synthetic fibres have done away with it.</P>
    <P>There is something wrong with the headage grant.  I watch people buying ewes, collecting the subsidy and then selling them.  This is defeating the purpose of the whole thing.  Ewes are for breeding, and I think it is a good thing that breeders receive a subsidy but this subsidy does not seem to be working out the way it should be.</P>
    <P>From all I have read it would appear there is a great future for thoroughbred horses in Europe.  This is a small but very profitable industry especially in the west of Ireland where people engage in breeding half-bred horses. In my area small farmers are supplementing their income by breeding. Can the Department give us more advice on this subject?</P>
    <P>Every small farmer in the west of Ireland used to keep a couple of sows and bigger farmers kept even more.  I do not see many farmers keeping pigs nowadays.  I have been told that it is not worth their while because the price of meal is too high, the labour involved is too great and as one farmer said the final income is so low that it does not pay the price of petrol used to take them to market.  This is a big loss of income to the small farmers.  The pig industry is now operated in big combines.</P>
    <P>I am not very sure about horticultural operation in EEC countries.  I understand the Dutch are far ahead of us.  The Department has done a good deal by giving grants to those involved in horticulture.  While very hard work is involved a great deal of money can be made.  Horticulture does not greatly concern my constituency but it concerns Connemara, Donegal, County Dublin and areas in the south of the country.  More should be done to bring our horticultural industry into line with that operating in the Common Market.</P>
    <P>I see there is an increase in the number of broilers being reared.  I often wonder why.  I think it is the most appalling form of meat.  I appreciate <Col N="404" /> that every time one attends a function one is served an oven-ready chicken. This is probably because the price of ordinary meat is very high.  Housewives must feed their families with something.  They buy these chickens which taste like nothing on earth. Nothing can beat free-run chickens but unfortunately they are not now available.  I was never interested in poultry.  I always considered that hens died in debt.  There was a time when the income from the eggs would buy the family groceries.  Anyone who keeps hens nowadays does so to supply the needs of the household and if there are eggs to spare they sell them but the proceeds hardly buy a packet of cigarettes.</P>
    <P>It has been said that if we enter the Common Market small farmers will disappear.  I admit small farmers are leaving the land and they will continue to do so, but medium-size farmers and big farmers are also leaving the land.  I can tell the House what is accelerating this.  It has to be accepted that what is good for one section of the community is not necessarily good for another.  With the introduction of free education boys and girls are picked up at their homes at 8 a.m. or 8.30 and returned home again as late as 5.30 or even 5.45. Obviously they grow away from the farm and the parents may well say, &ldquo;Ah, poor Johnny, he is working hard for his inter. cert.  I will not ask him to look after the cattle or sheep or milk the cow&rdquo;.  While Johnny is being educated in the rudiments of Greek, Latin, English and Irish he is growing away from the farm.</P>
    <P>In the past, farm education was home education and anything a boy learned about farming he learned from his father.  We must educate boys about farming.  We have reached the stage in this country where people are saying, &ldquo;Oh, he has done five years at secondary school; he has his leaving cert.; he is educated&rdquo;.  That means nothing to me.  A boy can have his leaving cert. and still be uneducated in some spheres.  We have to encourage people to stay on the land by educating them because gone are the days when the brighter children went to school and the slow ones stayed on the land.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="405" /> If our agricultural industry is to survive in the EEC farmers must know their business, they must be educated in farm management as well as the ordinary everyday business of the farm, including doing accounts and filling in forms.  Every weekend I go home farmers ask me to fill in these grant forms for them.  They should all be able to do this themselves.</P>
    <P>If a boy decides at the age of 16 that he wants to do farming he should be channelled into farming and instead of spending one year in a farming school as happens at present he should spend three years there, gain practical experience, learn modem techniques and the business management of a farm.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that the TB eradication scheme had been intensified. About an hour ago Deputies were handed a Supplementary Estimate amounting to £1,530,000 which is required for TB eradication.  It strikes me as odd, to say the least of it, that after all these years we need that kind of extra money for TB eradication. What has gone wrong?  Surely TB should be eradicated by now?  Is it as a result of vets being careless and passing cattle that should not be passed or is it that we shall never get rid of bovine TB?  What is the explanation?</P>
    <P>Brucellosis eradication is very important. More education would help here.  When some people discover that their cattle have brucellosis they rush off to market and sell them.  This is not good enough.  They may do it because they are not aware that stock coming from an infected herd can cause immediate infection in another herd. They should be alerted to the fact that this is so serious.  Many of them are, but I think it needs to be brought home to the vast majority more forcibly. Every help should be given to the man who makes the effort, reports the incidence of the disease to the veterinary surgeon, isolates his cattle and tries to eradicate the disease.  He should get every possible assistance from the Department.</P>
    <P>About two or three years ago we started dressing our cattle for warble fly.  It was, I think, compulsory.  Now <Col N="406" /> it seems to have ceased to be compulsory. I notice from the Minister's statement that further legislation will be brought in to cope with the present position.  Warble fly dressing is most important and it should be compulsory. However, I do not think the farmer should have to pay a great deal of money to have this done.  It should be a nominal sum and the Department should bear the brunt of the cost.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Sheridan said, farm workers are leaving the land.  That is true.  It is a great tragedy.  No matter how good a farmer is he must have some sort of help because he cannot be there day in and day out, 365 days of the year, milking his cows twice per day.  Farm workers are entitled to good wages.  I believe the average farmer is just not able to pay what he would like to pay his farm worker.  The Department of Social Welfare, or some Department of State, should make some contribution.  Every Budget increases the price of the social welfare stamp. This is good for those entitled to social welfare and nobody argues against it but the fact is that both the farmer and the farm worker have to meet this extra cost.  This is becoming a burden and there are people who say: &ldquo;I could do with another man, but look at the price of the stamps&rdquo;.  It is a major headache for farmers.  It is not as it may have been in bygone days, a lack of appreciation or consideration for employees; that is not the reason why they are not paid as much as the farmer would like to pay them.  It is an economic problem. The farmer just has not got the money to spend on help.</P>
    <P>Deputy Murphy referred to the excellent schemes initiated by the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries.  The incentive bonus to small farmers is an excellent thing and many small farmers in my constituency have gone into the scheme and benefited greatly from it.  I would give the very maximum in the case of an incentive.  We have arrived at the situation in which we are giving relief to small farmers through the Department of Social Welfare.  It is sad that this should have to be done.  It is an admission that we have failed to make our small farms viable.  I am all for giving money where money is <Col N="407" /> needed and where people simply cannot exist without it but giving our small farmers this kind of money is an insult to them.  The small farmers in my constituency are most independent.  They have a pride in themselves and this scheme may easily destroy that pride. It will destroy pride in personal achievement.  It will destroy pride in one's work.  Ultimately it will sap the moral fibre of these people.  I hate to see them queueing up to sign on outside the barracks.  Are we reduced to that?  Is that all we can do for our small farmers?  I see both Ministers' predicament : the small farmers are so badly off they need social welfare assistance.  This is a terrible indictment, but this is the wrong way to go about alleviating their position.  I cannot advise the Minister but the aim should be an incentive to earn, not an incentive to idle.  It is perhaps our climate, but we are a little lackadaisical and, if we get an incentive to idle, that is the end.</P>
    <P>I know the Department of Lands and the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries work in liaison but I have always believed that the Land Commission proper should be the responsibility of the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries and not the Department of Lands.  A scheme was introduced some years ago to encourage the elderly or those unable to run their farms to surrender them to the Land Commission. This scheme has not been availed of.  If it were we would have allover better farm management and better farms.  The division of land is purely a function of the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries.  Land is, after all, basic to agriculture.</P>
    <P>I heard a Deputy say this morning that the number of officials in the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries has trebled.  There are schemes in operation which require extra officials to operate them, but I wonder has the agricultural income risen as a result of all these extra advisory services and, very often, administration services in the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries.  I must say the officials I meet are excellent.  They work very hard and, for this, we should be grateful. We often slate Departments and <Col N="408" /> rarely thank the officials for the services they give.  It seems to me, however, that the rate of increase where officials are concerned and the rate of increase in income has not kept in step. Are we, I wonder, overburdened with civil servants and not getting the maximum benefit out of the services?  I do not know.</P>
    <P>If, and when, we enter the Common Market non-nationals will be able to buy land here.  Someone said we will be free to buy land in Germany.  Where would we get the kind of money needed to buy land in Germany?  I am afraid non-nationals will cast a covetous eye over our hardwon acres and, with their large bank accounts, snap them up very quickly.  I do not see how we can prevent that.  The person who owns the land is free to sell it.  If we go into the Common Market how will we prevent this free sale of land to non-nationals? If, after 50 years of native government, we hand over our land to non-nationals, we will no longer be a nation.</P>
    <P>It is argued that the small farmer, if he gives up his farm, can go into industry. Where will he go into industry? The only hope I can see for him is the Ruhr Valley, which is a long way from home.  It is different for Europeans. Europeans are used to migrating.  We are not.  Our workers migrate to Britain and even that migration has led to complications in homes and marriages. If our young boys and girls have to go into industry, then let us gear ourselves to providing those industries in the agricultural areas.  Instead of disparaging the part-time farmer he should be encouraged in every way.  I am all for this.</P>
    <P>In my area I have seen how effectively the small farmer can work his farm and take employment in another job.  In Tynagh mines they employ about 300 men.  These men have good working hours, they receive good pay and, as a result, the farmers have better farms because they can afford to improve them.  In many cases they have gone over to dry feeding rather than milk.  We should do everything possible to encourage this development.</P>
    <P>We frequently hear people on television say there is no hope for the <Col N="409" /> small farmer.  I do not share this view. There are many small farmers in Europe who are managing very well to cope with a job in addition to their farm work.  As the Minister knows, farms in Europe are often considerably smaller than farms in Ireland.  It must be realised that size is comparative. Some people regard 50 acres as small while others think a 25-acre farm is small.  However, a man with 150 acres who does not manage his farm efficiently very frequently is worse off than a person who has a well-run 25-acre farm.</P>
    <P>We must instil in the minds of our people that all is not lost for the small farmer.  Perhaps he may not do very well in the EEC but he will be much worse off if we stay outside.  We must gear the larger farmer to conditions in the Common Market.  Above all, we must streamline our farms and we must specialise.  In the past the matter of specialisation has been mentioned in a vague way but now we must do something about it.  This will require rethinking for many of us and now is the time to do it.</P>
    <P>Already we have wasted much time. We have been talking for the last ten years about entry into the EEC and during that time we should have been telling the farmers how to prepare themselves for our entry into Europe. If Britain gets in&mdash;we are completely dependent on her&mdash;we could be full members before the end of the Seventies.  I do not think we are ready for this.  I hope the Minister and his Department will be able to help the farmers and to warn them of what is in store.  The Department of Agriculture and Fisheries have ample resources at their disposal; they have many inspectors and advisers and it is their job to give accurate information to the farmers.  In the west we are inclined to put things off until another day but we cannot afford to adopt this attitude any longer.</P>
    <P>I must apologise to the Minister; I have not read his speech very carefully as I was not here.  In his absence I objected to taking the Estimate for the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries yesterday and today.  I appreciate that it is not the Minister's <Col N="410" /> responsibility&mdash;I presume it is the Whips who arrange business&mdash;but I would like to point out that the three Whips are Dublin city representatives and perhaps they do not think the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries of great importance.  To my mind, apart from the Department of Finance, it is our most important Department but, having regard to the way the Estimate was taken and the attendance in the House today, one wonders if other Members consider the Department very important.  I have always believed, and I hope my belief will not be shattered, that the future of this country rests with the farmers.  If we all believed this and worked as we should, we would have a much better country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Since I became a Member of this House, and indeed for many years before that, I have heard politicians describe agriculture as our primary industry.  Having said that most of them considered they had done their share for agriculture.</P>
      <P>During this debate some of the remarks made by various speakers were interesting, if not completely accurate.  The subject of agriculture is so wide that it is not possible to be fully detailed on every aspect.  Having studied the Minister's brief and the very detailed document regarding the main activities of the Department, I realised it would be difficult to know what comments to make on both documents. Therefore, I decided that I would only refer to them where necessary and instead I would deal with matters about which I am deeply concerned. Perhaps the Minister might comment on some of those matters in his reply.</P>
      <P>I do not propose to be very critical. I know the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries have an extremely difficult task.  As agriculture is the primary industry in the country it follows that the largest amount of money must be found from State sources for the purpose of running that industry.  It is inevitable that some sections will at various times be aggrieved they are not getting a fair share.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is difficult to understand the attitude of some people when we consider <Col N="411" /> our proposed entry into the EEC.  Like many other speakers I have visited the EEC countries and have discussed at official level the problems of entry into the Community.  While I agree that there are aspects of entry that are very favourable for this country, my personal opinion is that it will be a good thing for us if Britain finds it impossible to go in and, consequently, we shall not have to enter the EEC.  I held this view from the time of my first visit to the European countries and I have not changed it.  However, if Britain goes in I do not think we have any option but to follow, although I agree that other people may not share this view.</P>
    <P>When the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement was concluded we were promised many wonderful things. Some of the Ministers&mdash;alas, no longer with us&mdash;were lauded by the then Taoiseach, Mr. Lemass, for their brilliance and ability in negotiating that agreement. At that time the Labour Party thought it was a bad bargain and subsequent events have proved we were right.  Fine Gael were not entirely satisfied with the bargain but they did not vote against it and, therefore, the Fianna Fáil Government went through with the agreement.  I should point out that this agreement was negotiated and signed before the Government brought the matter before the House.</P>
    <P>Subsequent events have proved that there were so many loopholes in the agreement that it can only be described as a &ldquo;sieve agreement&rdquo;.  Every time something went wrong we were informed there seemed to have been a loophole which allowed the agreement to be breached.  Extra duty was put on our exports, there were limitations on some of our exports to the British market and this all meant that for a long time past we have been attempting to struggle along.</P>
    <P>When too many complaints were made somebody said &ldquo;It is training for entry into the EEC.&rdquo;  So far as entry into the EEC is concerned, I will leave that to somebody else to deal with.  It appears that we are hell-bent on attempting to improve the production <Col N="412" /> of items for which there does not appear to be a great demand within the EEC.  I do not know whether it was political or not but all of us have been struck since yesterday by the apparent reversal on the milk subsidy.  Possibly because Deputy Blaney said something was to be done in a certain way while he was Minister, Deputy J. Gibbons now, as Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, feels that the right thing to do is to prove that Deputy Blaney was wrong.  Very definitely there is a change in accent from the small producer to the large producer.  This is hard for people in this country to understand.  I would like the Minister to go into more detail about this when replying.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sheridan spoke, and I felt that he was confused about one thing. The Deputy knows a great deal about agriculture, cattle breeding, cattle buying and selling.  The calf heifer subsidy was introduced a couple of years ago and it would never have been introduced were it not necessary to get a certain amount of votes in order to carry the 2½ per cent turnover tax in this House.  That subsidy no longer exists.  The Deputy referred to it.  I think he was speaking about the beef subsidy.</P>
    <P>The whole question of milk and milk production is a terrible headache.  I was glad that the Minister was able to point out that the production of beef had increased because of the change that took place last year.  The whole problem is that in the EEC we will find that beef, lamb, mutton and pig meat will be in demand.  It is idle to say that one can have a supply of beef without having a certain amount of milk.  I thought that the Department had decided on that problem a few years ago and that the beef subsidy was one which would encourage a reduction in milk production.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mrs. Hogan O'Higgins referred to the fact that there was a problem about excess butter in the Common Market.  I understand that the problem no longer exists.  The one million tons has been disposed of.  People are not too anxious to talk about how it was disposed of.  The Minister is probably aware that some of it was converted into fertiliser and some was sold at a <Col N="413" /> low rate.  It was disposed of and they are not too anxious that we should go into the Common Market with an ever-increasing supply of milk and milk products.  I was trying to find out when I was away&mdash;and this subject was referred to this morning in some of the newspapers&mdash;about agricultural prices generally.  Agricultural prices generally in the Common Market have not increased in the past few years.  We were given to understand that it was almost a certainty that they would be allowed to remain static and eventually by the time we got in in eight years, because we will be negotiating until 1973, and then there will be another five years before we get in, there would be not much difference in the price of milk here and the price of milk and milk products in the Common Market.  They have been having second thoughts about whether they will increase agricultural prices generally.  I note that the Minister proposes next year to allow an extra 6,000 acres of beet.  Is the situation that while the Common Market countries do not need our beet, as such, if we got another 50,000 acres on contract being grown we would have a better lever on entering the EEC to say &ldquo;We have the beet now and it must be bought from us&rdquo;?</P>
    <P>Last year the wheat crop was smaller than in previous years.  This year it was bigger.  The Minister knows the cycle.  No one can guess what will happen next year.  I would like to mention briefly the question of fruit and fruit-growing.  This is something which is being badly dealt with by the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries. In this case the Department are allowing the fruit-growers to be put out of business.  I am making this charge here because of my own experience when attempting to negotiate for fruit-growers. Last year the number of contracts which were signed for soft fruits throughout the country were small.  The jam manufacturers said they did not want some fruits and they had only a limited need for other fruits.  It is almost a certainty that most of the contracts will not be signed this year. The jam manufacturers, knowing that they can get more fruit than they need, are not going to bother.  This may mean that the fruit-growers will be giving <Col N="414" /> away the fruit and trying to compete to get it off their hands or, alternatively, the fruit will be allowed to rot. Each year before the Irish fruit comes on the market I have asked a question of the Minister or of the Minister for Finance as to whether the importation of fruit pulp from other countries, particularly Britain, will be allowed.  I am aware that arrangements have been made for a number of years not to allow in any fruit pulp until all the Irish soft fruit has been used by the jam manufacturers.  The jam manufacturers last year could not understand the position because I was told last year that fruit pulp had not been imported during the summer or autumn.  They could not understand why there was no demand for their pulp.  Then the penny dropped.  In fact, what had happened was that the Department had allowed jam from Britain into this country.  Thousands of tons of jam had come into this country and the result was that the Government collected a few pence per pound duty on the jam.  The unfortunate fruit men were left with the soft fruit unsold. That might be considered a slick thing to do.  The Minister is not responsible because he does not impose the duties.  People who had been working very hard on their fruit found that when the time came to reap the results of their labours they did not do so well because of a deliberate act of the Government.  The Minister should see to it that neither fruit pulp nor jam is allowed into this country until the-Irish fruit crop is taken off the hands of the growers.</P>
    <P>I do not know what has happened with regard to Irish apples but anyone who is fond of eating an apple and who buys an Irish apple in a shop must wonder why he must pay 4d or 5d for such a poor specimen.  There are plenty of Canadian or Australian apples on the Irish market.  What has happened to Irish apples?  The Irish apple crop should be properly marketed. It is bad enough that a native should have to take what he is offered in the way of an Irish apple but certainly a tourist would be very adversely impressed by some of the Irish apples on sale here over the years. Something rather peculiar is happening <Col N="415" /> so far as tomatoes are concerned.  I understand that tomatoes which came from Spain were being offered for sale in this city not so very long ago although they were packed in an Irish box.  The matter was brought to the notice of the Department.  Some firm was being clever and was selling as Irish tomatoes a commodity which was not, in fact, Irish.  Quite a lot of Irish people grow tomatoes in glasshouses and sell them.  We have available the steam from the Bord na Móna generating stations on the edge of our boglands. Why is use not made of this steam, to produce early tomatoes and whatever fruit or vegetables could be grown under those conditions?</P>
    <P>It is quite common for the Irish housewife to buy, not Irish fruit, but tinned fruit, not Irish vegetables, but tinned vegetables.  This is a terrible situation&mdash;even potatoes, cauliflower : name it, it is there.  The Department of Agriculture and Fisheries should run an advertising campaign to encourage people to grow vegetables for sale, fresh, in our towns, villages and cities at a reasonable price.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sheridan and Deputy Mrs. Hogan O'Higgins referred to the shortage of labour and to the fact that people are leaving agriculture.  The estimate is about 12,000 people per annum.  It was down a bit last year; possibly the supply is running out.  Not alone are farm workers and small farmers leaving agriculture but the medium-size farmer is also leaving.  So long as we have a situation where a man&mdash;be he a hired hand or the son of the farmer&mdash;is expected to work from early morning to late in the evening for lower wages than he can obtain in industry so long will we have this unsatisfactory state of affairs.  The hired man must work 50 hours per week in summer and 44 hours per week in winter : his average is 48 hours.  They have less holidays than they would have in industry and they are generally treated as inferior beings.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton referred to agricultural colleges and to the number of people who take certain degrees but who do not return to agriculture.  He mentioned a figure of 3 or 4 per cent <Col N="416" /> and seemed surprised.  In Paris, a few years ago, I found in one of the colleges that, after screening, one-third dropped out the first year, one-third dropped out the second year and, of the remainder that did the course, only 5 per cent returned to agriculture.  The others found employment in some subsidiary industries but not in agriculture. Whether it was worth the effort to educate them to improve agriculture is a big question.  It happens here but it also happens elsewhere.  Until proper conditions of employment are available in agriculture, people will be inclined to leave it, unless for very special reasons such as owning part of a farm, and so on.  Sons and daughters working on farms are entitled to something more for the job they are doing than they are getting.  It is not sufficient to say that they belong to the house.  They are given a few pounds pocket money at the weekend, money for clothing occasionally, and maybe the use of the family car.  More than that is required. Youngsters who work in industry and who live in digs would put a certain amount of money by to enable them to set up house later on.  While quite a number of progressive farmers realise this, far too many of them treat members of the family as unpaid farm workers and they remain that way until, as they say in the country, &ldquo;they have beards on them&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister for Lands, Deputy S. Flanagan, that the man with a little bit of land and a job is the snuggest man in the country.  Deputy Sheridan did not seem to appreciate the situation.  It is not the farm that is making the man comfortable but the fact that he enjoys favourable conditions in industry for which others fought dearly.  He has his wages to invest in his land on which he can work in the evening or at weekends. Naturally, if he is progressive and believes in his farm he will invest in it. Many very small farms are doing extraordinarily well.  I know men with a few acres of land who are doing a part-time job and who have been able to look after their families very well indeed : I am speaking now of a good many years ago.  If they have an interest in doing it, it can be done.</P>
    <P>I should like to see the Minister's <Col N="417" /> colleague, the Minister for Lands, doing what he says he believes in instead of giving jobs to the small farmers, which he says he finds is extremely difficult to do as the factories do not exist, giving small portions of land to the men who have jobs near the divided farms.  If he does that he will achieve the same thing.  I think he genuinely believes that the man with the small farm and a job is an asset to the country.  I believe that if we go into the Common Market Dr. Mansholt's prediction will be correct, that there will be no place for the small farmer trying to live on a farm as an individual, not co-operating with his neighbours.  Either he must have a job&mdash;which would be the ideal way to hold on to his farm&mdash;or go into a cooperative farm and this is something Irish farmers are not keen to do.  Alternatively, he must get out.  That would be the position and no amount of glossing over it, by people who paint rosy pictures about farmers not having to get up at all except perhaps to close the window to prevent money from rolling in and smothering them when we join the Common Market, will get away from the reality.  If farmers believe the story being trotted out by Government speakers they are in for a rude shock.</P>
    <P>To conclude, I want to mention a few small matters one of which is the rates remission for the employment of a man&mdash;the sum of £17.  This does not do any good and my suggestion is that it be done away with completely or the Minister should make representations to his colleagues that it be raised to a realistic figure.  I thought there was a suggestion from Deputy Sheridan that social welfare should in some way pay a subsidy to farmers employing farmhands. Some years ago I suggested that might be a way of assisting farmers who wanted to improve their holdings but could not afford help to do so.  I am not satisfied that it is exactly the answer to the problem; it could be abused but it is worth thinking about. The £17 comes to a colossal sum for the whole country but it does not do very much.  The Minister must be aware of this.  It does not encourage a farmer to keep an extra man and that was the whole idea.  When it was introduced <Col N="418" /> perhaps it was a good idea but it is no longer any use.</P>
    <P>I know that every time I meet a farmer who has applied for a grant of any kind he complains that he is finding it very difficult to get a reply from the Department or get an inspection carried out.  I am sure there was a necessity for these people to be employed or otherwise they would not have been employed.  I am sure the Minister will say: &ldquo;We will find extra employment by putting them in here; nobody will ever notice it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am rather surprised that it has been found possible to get the numbers employed in the Department in view of the fact that other Departments seem to find it extremely hard to get staff to carry on, such as in the case of Social Welfare and Finance, although the income tax section seem to be able to get sufficient people to send out notices.  I am surprised that the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries have been able to increase their staff but so long as it is agreed that the Minister and his officials are satisfied that the money is being well spent, I think that is all right.  An effort should be made to speed up the inspection of grants because it appears from the complaints I get that there is a very long delay between the time the job is done and reported and the money is paid.  Also there is long delay when a request for inspection is made before an inspector arrives to examine the job.</P>
    <P>I was also surprised to find that at least one Deputy did not seem to be able to differentiate between the Department and the Agricultural Institute. I know that in some cases both are doing a similar type of work.  The Grange Farm in County Meath is under An Foras Talúntais and they are doing an excellent job there.  I appeal to the Minister to ensure that the money necessary to allow the institute to do their work fully is made available. The Minister may ask: &ldquo;Where will the money come from?&rdquo;  But there is no point in having services if they cannot be used.  There is a rumour that a certain report by the Agricultural Institute has not been published because the Department will not allow it to be published.  I can only go on <Col N="419" /> what I hear by &ldquo;bush telegraph&rdquo; but, if this is so the Minister should look into it and ensure that the work of the institute is not frustrated by any section of his Department.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to the question of small farmers in western counties receiving the dole.  This is a type of State aid and while it was suggested that it is a way of keeping them from working, I do not look at it like that.  I might not go 100 per cent with the idea that every farmer without exception under a certain valuation should get this money just because he happens to live in this area but I would ask the Minister again to use his good offices in regard to another angle on this.  There are small farmers not in western areas and who because their farms are so small are unable to live on the farms.  Many of them have families.  I know one man with 15 children.  These people go out to Bord na Móna and to building jobs or anywhere they can get work and work for a portion of the year when farmwork is not so important.  But when they sign, not for the dole but for unemployment benefit, for which they have stamps they are told by the State that because of the farm they own, irrespective of whether they are married or not, if it is estimated that they can make more than £3 per week&mdash;10s per day&mdash;on that farm they are not allowed to draw unemployment benefit.</P>
    <P>I had one case in which a man was eventually granted unemployment assistance.  He could not be given unemployment benefit because somebody decided that his farm would have yielded more than 10s per day.  That poor devil was travelling more than 27 miles on a motor bicycle morning and evening in order to work while he could earn a week's wages.  The Minister himself can do nothing about this but as a member of the Cabinet, in the interests of this type of farmer, he can ask his colleague to do something about it.</P>
    <P>I conclude by asking the Minister to take an interest in what is happening in the soft fruit industry.  Unless something is done pretty quickly I believe soft fruit growing will be finished this <Col N="420" /> year.  Many growers have already burned their bushes, pulled up the strawberry plants and ploughed the lot after what happened last year.  This is the crucial year.  Perhaps the sunny lands of the EEC are able to grow fruit in such abundance and of such quality that Irish fruit will not be needed if and when we join the EEC but in the meantime those concerned in soft fruit growing&mdash;usually very small farmers and cottiers&mdash;should not be abandoned as they were, apparently, last year and if the stories I have heard are correct, as they will also be this year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I should first like to address myself to the matter of agriculture in the EEC and to the prospective evolution there of agricultural prices, the prospects in the UK, our major market for agricultural products, and to some conclusions that we may draw in regard to our agricultural future in the light of the EEC evolution. I do not want to couch it in offensive phraseology but elsewhere I have criticised the specific document put out in relation to our agricultural prospects in the EEC because I think that very many of the estimates in that document were rather lighthearted and arrived at by exercises on a sheet of paper.  They are not particularly significant in regard to our prospects.  I do not think those figures stand up at all. Beyond giving a general estimation of that document, I do not think it is worthy of a serious analysis.</P>
      <P>I notice that the Minister has criticised those who differ on the policy of the Government on the EEC.  He said:</P>
      <P>I refer to the unbalanced and distorted arguments which are promulgated by certain groups and personalities against membership.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should prefer not to talk in those veiled terms of certain groups and personalities. Perhaps the Minister does not wish to give publicity to any individual but if one wants to pick out sets of arguments it is well to name the source.  When the Minister talks about groups and personalities and says the arguments are unbalanced and distorted, the suggestion is that all who have reservations and doubts and worries about the future of agriculture in the <Col N="421" /> EEC are unbalanced and their arguments distorted.  He then said:</P>
    <P>The groups and personalities I refer to&mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash;not having referred to them&mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash;appear to be neither well-informed nor constructive and so far as agriculture is concerned, are completely out of line with the views of informed agricultural opinion in this country.</P>
    <P>There are all sorts of agricultural opinions.  You can get plenty of opinions by selecting different professional economists.  If we are trying to argue about this rationally, let us start out by saying that nobody, either by looking into his soul or by looking into his mind, without a very careful analysis of the facts, can reach a valid conclusion. Let us not damn anybody's position just because he happens to hold it.  Let us start off by saying it is a very difficult situation which presents problems as well as possibilities.  We do not advance the argument a bit simply by indulging in words like &ldquo;unbalanced&rdquo; and &ldquo;distorted&rdquo; which are essentially abuse rather than criticism. With the opportunity afforded to the Minister in having a large and expert Department at his back to look into this whole thing for him it would have been interesting if we had had in this speech a reasoned criticism of the objections that have been raised.  We have not got that.  We have such epithets as &ldquo;unbalanced&rdquo; and &ldquo;distorted. We have what seems to me abuse rather than argument.</P>
    <P>Last year we got a document from the Government in relation to specific agricultural aspects which is unworthy of discussion.  There is very little in it and what there is does not stand up to analysis.  We cannot base an argument on that.  In the hope of getting some argument about this, perhaps in the Minister's reply and perhaps elsewhere, we might devote a little time to considering the prospects for Irish agriculture in the Community.  I hope the Minister will not be able to find my observations distorted.  I have no hope that I will escape being considered unbalanced because from the way the term is used it presumably means anything <Col N="422" /> with which he disagrees.  If I stick to facts and reasonable suppositions I hope I can escape the criticism of distorting.</P>
    <P>To get a picture of the agricultural evolution in the Community we have to look back to the middle `fifties.  I do not propose to go back further, though one might validly do so.  If we look at the situation in the middle 'fifties we see a political aspect.  This has political causes in the end.  We can get political insights into the way agriculture will evolve.  The demographic situation in regard to farming in the Community was quite different from what Irish people are accustomed to see when they look abroad.  When we look abroad we see farming in the UK, or in the United States.  Through some of our emigrants and through a shared language and from reading magazines, we see, perhaps, farming in New Zealand and Australia.  All of these are countries with very large farms, in the case of the last three, recently developed in historical terms, and very efficient.</P>
    <P>The European scene was quite different.  Their structure of farm size was more disadvantageous than ours. They had more small farms.  Due to the operation of a legal scheme going back to Napoleon there was fantastic fragmentation. I remember seeing a farm in Brittany and hearing that before amalgamation a man who was, by French standards, a medium-size farmer, owned 77 separate parcels of land.  He admitted that he sometimes forgot some of them.  He had to look at the list.  He sometimes got a bonus when he discovered there was one he had forgotten about which belonged to him.</P>
    <P>It was more disadvantageous then in regard to structure than it was in Ireland and, as a result of the two wars and the depressed period in between, extraordinarily impoverished and extraordinarily miserable, and with the great problem of applying new techniques such as we have seen widely in Ireland.  They did not have quite the same demographic problem because they did not have the same loss of young cohorts as we had.  Apart from the emigration problem they had all the problems we had more acutely <Col N="423" /> than we had them.  They had an emigration problem to some extent.</P>
    <P>It was also a time of very great political instability, a time when the builders of the new Europe were convinced&mdash;or at least the ones who were looking to the future&mdash;that they could stabilise the agricultural community and provide them with a good living in the future on condition that farm sizes were much bigger, that they could generate the industrial growth which would provide jobs for these people in the cities without leaving their own country and that, in a peaceful way, and more or less in an organised way on the basis of the great industrial growth that has taken place in Europe, they could provide an evolution whereby these people would move to being urban workers without vast upheavals or miseries or injustices.  It is fair to say that this scheme, while far from being realised, is in course of being realised.</P>
    <P>With that conviction they were able to set the price of agricultural products very high, partly for political reasons and partly for other reasons. The result was that for a period even the small farmers did extremely well. They became politically stabilised and the leaving of the countryside was rather more orderly than it would otherwise have been.  The cost of these very high prices was that there were mountains of various products, of which the butter mountain is the most celebrated, but it is by no means the only one.</P>
    <P>It became clear that continuing high prices would have two effects.  One was the very great cost to the Community in financial terms and the other was that there would be stabilisation of a small farms structure which was contrary to the wishes of the planners of the Community.  The irony was that in the countryside there were enough workers to staff the factories in the burgeoning cities and yet labour was being imported from North Africa, Greece, Spain, Portugal and various places.</P>
    <P>In the middle 'sixties the thinking about agricultural prices was beginning to change and the change became faster.  We had the experience in <Col N="424" /> Ireland that we had made a previous application for entry and the arithmetic that was done then in regard to differentials between the price that Irish farmers got and the price that Community farmers got made a vast impression on the minds of Irish farmers. They were convinced that there was a bonanza for them if we had got into the Community.  I think it is true to say that in that conviction they were right. If we had got in in 1962 or 1963 there would have been a bonanza for us because prices then were very high indeed.  However, I feel we are misleading them if we suggest to them that the situation has not altered fairly drastically since then because with the emergence of the surpluses&mdash;if one interpolates one sees other surpluses emerging in the Community, the tendency of the Community to become self-sufficient in wide areas of its food and agricultural needs&mdash;and with the desire to reduce the agricultural population in a planned way which I shall refer to later, it was clear that agricultural prices were too high and a reduction was set about in the Community. Firstly, there were actual reductions such as the reduction in the price of butter 18 months or two years ago, a very substantial reduction percentagewise, which has had the effect of reducing the butter mountain to, at the moment, something of the order of 100,000 tons, just barely sufficient to cover needs.  The amount has faded away because of a drop in cow herds, a drop in milk yield and the increased consumption which has been engendered in the Community.  This in fact has been done as a result of price policy.</P>
    <P>Of course agricultural prices can be changed without doing anything dramatic that farmers' organisations and representatives can scream about. It is a perfectly simple technique of holding the price and letting all the other prices rise and allowing inflation to reduce the real price and in that way the farmers' profit is mopped up. What has been happening in the Community and what will continue to happen is that all the farmers' inputs have been rising very rapidly in price because of inflation which is worldwide and not a local phenomenon. <Col N="425" /> Machinery, fertilisers, fuels, chemicals are becoming rapidly dearer whereas the price of whatever the farmer sells is not getting less in whatever one's currency happens to be but is getting less in real terms.  Therefore his margin of profit is dropping quite sharply.</P>
    <P>One can have some opinions about the long term price planning in any large industrial community by looking at communities which have already industrialised and the trends in those. I do not propose a lengthy examination of this but if we are to form an opinion about what price trends for agricultural products in the Community are going to be, as distinct from what they have been, and I suggest there was a real change of opinion in the middle to late 1960's, then we can draw some information from the experience of the UK in the last century and from the experience of the United States.</P>
    <P>The UK in the last century was then the workshop of the world, a growing industrial power with a growing urban working class.  It was this development that made the UK the greatest importer of food in the world.  The British food producers, the estate owners, wanted the highest possible price for their products but the British manufacturers and the British workers wanted the cheapest possible food&mdash;the workers so that they did not have to spend much on it and the manufacturers so that their products would be competitive.  There was a tug-o-war which resulted in victory for the manufacturers and the urban working class with the free importation of grain from the cheap producing areas and the relative impoverishment of British indigenous grain producers.</P>
    <P>One can see in any country where the industrial sector becomes dominant and competition is intense that a cheap food policy is the one that is undertaken because on the end of the rope in the tug-of-war on food prices there are two opposing groups.  At one end of the rope is the farmers' group wanting as much for their products as possible and at the other end are both industrial employers and industrial workers.  The experience all over the world is that industrial employers plus industrial workers become stronger and <Col N="426" /> stronger in an industrialising country and the farms section, both through farmers' organisations and political representation, becomes weaker.  The farmers lose the tug-of-war.  They lost it in the UK in the last century and there is a cheap food policy still going on there though there are some signs of the beginning of an unwillingness for the British to continue their present system of price support.</P>
    <P>If we look to the future of the EEC we can draw some lessons from that. We can draw the lesson in regard to the long term.  The Taoiseach was talking last night about Ireland in the 1980s and I think we are entitled to use our political and our economic knowledge to have some thoughts about what the economic atmosphere will be like in the Community in the 1980's.  Industry will get stronger and stronger.  The industrial working class, as a percentage of the whole population, will get bigger and bigger.  The number of people on the land will get smaller and smaller.  The end of the tug-of-war rope, represented by the cheap food interests, will get stronger. The other end of the rope represented by dear food interests will get weaker. The general policy of the Community will be towards cheaper food.  This is a fair supposition.  I hope the Minister will not consider it unbalanced or distorted. He may well disagree with me but it is an opinion that is very widely held by people of all shades of political opinion inside the Community.</P>
    <P>In regard to the size of the rural community there seems to have been a distortion of Mansholt.  I regret that I did not anticipate getting into the debate tonight and I have not got the quotation with me.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>It is recognised that the size of the rural community must go down.  Everybody agrees that fewer and fewer people will live in the <Col N="427" /> countryside.  At page 19, paragraph 35 of the December 1969 document, Mansholt says:</P>
      <P>The rapid diminution of the agricultural population is a feature of the times&mdash;</P>
      <P>This is a truism.  It is so all over the world and nobody can decently argue about it.  He goes on:</P>
      <P>but if the living standards of farmers are to rise enough within ten years to make good the present leeway then the rate of decrease in the agricultural population must be greatly accelerated.</P>
      <P>It is clear on the basis of that quotation that the essence of Mansholt is not just the acceptance of a diminution which is world-wide but the planning and structuring and organising of a much more rapid diminution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>These are interesting and valid interruptions.  It is interesting for me to see if I have valid answers whether they will be interesting or not. My reading of what one might call Mansholt's parameters of efficiency is that his reckoning of where the thresh-hold of efficiency lies cuts off many of our smaller farmers as well as cutting off the Community's smaller ones.  My reading of this is that we cannot say he is referring to this matter because the <Col N="428" /> average size of farm within the Community is smaller than the average here.  He is referring to their very small ones which would hardly have any bearing on us at all.  It may bear on us a little less but I think it will bear on us very significantly.</P>
      <P>I was analysing the way in which we can expect prices to evolve within the Community.  I was suggesting that the period of high prices is over and that we are in for a decade or so of diminishing prices.  It will be possible to absorb the displaced labour from any country within the industry of that country and within the culture and environment of the displaced people.  That will happen within the Six but not necessarily within the Ten.  Within the Six it will be possible to structure the transfer in a humane way and to find funds to retrain farmers so that they will be able, inside their own language and cultural area, to find new jobs.  It will then be possible to get the farm size aimed at in this way by the working out of economic processes.  Real prices for the farmers' produce will increase very slowly, if at all.  The farmers' inputs will be dearer and, therefore, the rate of profit for farmers will be much less.</P>
      <P>Mansholt's argument, as I undestand it, is that provided the transition from agriculture is made easy, it is perfectly permissible, by economic measures, to squeeze the people out of agriculture. This is arguably true in the case of rich countries like Holland and Germany but we are in a totally different category. A number of us pressed Mansholt at a meeting in the Shelbourne Hotel on the question of regional policy and he told us that regional policy was for the individual countries.  It is clear that regional policy does not exist in a community way which will provide the industrial jobs for displaced Irish farmers within our own cultural and linguistic area.  It may provide the jobs for them in the United Kingdom but not within our own country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On this Estimate, I do not intend to pursue the sociological and economic arguments in relation to the Mansholt Plan but I want to make the point, I hope calmly and by some arguments, whether they be right or wrong, that we <Col N="429" /> again.</P>
    <P>cannot expect the continuing high prices to bring our farmers a bonanza. Their costs will increase dramatically also and prices, when considered in terms of cost and in terms of other outgoings, will not be so high.  Also, over an evolving period, we will not have a high cost food area in the Community such as we have had during the past decade.  Therefore, arguments based on the situation of the early 1960s are spurious and misleading. However, I do not wish to go further than that at this time.</P>
    <P>I want to consider now some of the points in the Minister's speech before I go on to make some suggestions of my own.  I am a little sorry that matters such as our future in the Community are not argued here a little differently. This is a listing to some extent.  Perhaps in a speech like this one simply lists things but there must be somewhere a detailed exposition of what the Government policy is.  It occurs to me that Government policy, all the time, faces in different directions at the same time.  An example of that would be the system of milk prices.  We say we wish to enter the Community and that we wish to prepare ourselves for Community conditions in regard to agriculture but quite recently we saw the introduction of a scheme which moved very sharply in the opposite direction.  I refer to the multi-tier price scheme for milk.  This scheme is entirely incompatible with existing Community schemes.  Also, it seemed to me to give some hope to a section of our milk producers who had no hope at all in the Mansholt atmosphere inside the Community.  Under the scheme, the price begins to decrease after a yield of 7,000 gallons.  Therefore for people with good cows, the price begins to decrease on the eighth cow.  According to Mansholt a producer is not really efficient unless he has 40 or 60 cows.  Therefore if we take an average of 50 good cows&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>A minimum of 40.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>We shall take 40 as an average.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>That, and the kind <Col N="430" /> of land and the kind of climate they have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Well of course they have every kind of land and climate but the point I am making is that we started making a differential which was less than beneficial to the milk producer when he got to the eighth cow. This is directly in conflict with the expressed intention of preparing us for the Community.</P>
      <P>In the very recent past, we have seen the beginnings of a departure from what seemed to me the awful wickedness of that multi-tier scheme. Perhaps I ought to say that I do not consider one-tier <i>per se,</i> to be awfully wicked.  I have argued in favour of a two- or three-tier system provided it is linked with other things.  Personally I do not belong necessarily to the flat-rate school which says every gallon must be paid for at the same price, as is the European idea.</P>
      <P>I can recall spending public money and the efforts of myself and others persuading people that, in relation to milk production, they should borrow, they should stock up and reach a certain yield.  The result of that scheme was a good deal of heartbreak.  I have no wish to embarrass anyone and I shall not mention any names but I will say that there were some admirable public servants who expressed privately their outrage and who found it difficult to continue their jobs.  I know very many farmers who took advice in regard to what they ought to do but who then found themselves clobbered by the introduction of sharply diminishing returns as their herds got bigger.  This is an example of what I said about the Government facing in two directions.  The scheme has begun to be dismantled in the very recent past.  It may be for a political reason it is not possible to say at this moment : &ldquo;We are sorry, but it was a great mistake. We did the wrong thing.  We are now abandoning it.&rdquo; There is now a movement away from the scheme.  It is a welcome movement but it still leaves one very confused as to what the precise intention of the Government is.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to detain the House very long because I am anxious to allow my colleague.  Deputy Dr. O'Connell, who is interested in this matter and put down a question on it, an opportunity of having his say as well.</P>
      <P>I was concerned that the Minister said to me across the floor of the House that I seemed to think it was a simple problem.   Nothing could be further from the case, and the Minister should be well aware of this. We discussed this in the House on 5th March last.  I took the opportunity on a Supplementary Estimate to raise the matter which was discussed here in an entirely constructive spirit.  I said on that occasion :</P>
      <P>The whole position has become very tangled.</P>
      <P>I went on to say:</P>
      <P>There has been fumbling and lack of generosity in the Department in their approach to this complex problem. I am not saying it is easily solved.  I almost despair of a solution at this stage.</P>
      <P>I then went on to suggest there was one way in which a solution might be found.  Therefore for anyone to say I think it is a simple problem, having heard me on the subject, is to misconceive my position without any justification. I said then and I believe now that you will not solve a problem which has been complicated by the mistakes made by the Department, the changes of mind, the self-contradictory positions taken up by the Department unless you go back to first base.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This was the point I made in speaking in this House in March.  The responsibility for solving the problem is that of the Department in a most peculiar and particular way.  It is not simply that this is an educational problem for which the Department are responsible.  The problem arises, first of all, because the Department appointed the Ryan Tribunal; secondly, because they accepted its recommendations, even where these recommendations were inept, if I may use the word in respect of anything coming from my distinguished academic colleague, Dr. <Col N="432" /> Louden Ryan.  Having done that, which was bad enough, they then undermined the Ryan Tribunal by making a settlement with the secondary teachers which went contrary to the principles of the Ryan Tribunal.  Then they went back on that settlement and tried to take the money back again in a particularly mean-minded way.  I do not know of any comparable case in the last five years of similar departmental ineptitude in handling a problem.  It is therefore up to the Department and the Minister to find a solution to it.  I cannot blame the Minister personally because he was not responsible for this matter throughout the whole period of the dispute, but it is his baby now and it cannot be solved by tinkering with it, and tinkering is what I am afraid the Minister has been doing, with the best will in the world.</P>
    <P>The Minister apparently got £500,000 from the Minister for Finance and was told: &ldquo;See what you can do with that&rdquo;.  However, the problem created by the Department is one that cannot be solved with £500,000 at this stage. It is going to cost the country&mdash;and I said this in my speech of 5th March &mdash;quite a lot of money to settle this problem, because you have created a situation where, in order to live up to the principles laid down in the Ryan Tribunal Report without actually cutting back on people's salaries and reducing their status you must bring others up to the level.  It is precisely the reluctance of the Department to do that which has caused the very problem we are facing now.</P>
    <P>Where can he find the bones of a solution?  I put it to the Minister then and I put it to him now: it is to be found in bringing together the two sides, the ASTI and the INTO, and putting to them a solution based on two principles which they have accepted. The ASTI have accepted the principle of the common basic scale.  They must be held to that.  It must be put to them that a solution has to be found within the context of what they themselves have agreed to.  The INTO have always accepted and have never challenged a points system in the remuneration for teachers, which does recognise that teaching at a higher level should <Col N="433" /> be remunerated at a higher rate.  Therefore, though at times they have seemed to object to this principle, they have in fact accepted it and have not challenged it in the operation of the salary scales.</P>
    <P>Given that the INTO accept the principle of higher remuneration for a higher level of teaching and the ASTI accept the principle of a basic common scale, it cannot be beyond human wit to devise a solution for this problem. The only reason a solution has not been found is the exceptional ineptitude with which the case has been handled.</P>
    <P>The solution is to be found in taking those two principles accepted in each case and to use their agreement to those two principles to build on that a solution which will involve a scheme, which is not just tinkering with the present scheme but which is fundamentally different, but founded on these two main principles.  I do not think this can be done easily by the Minister and the Department on their own.  I do not think, despite the Minister's interjection at Question Time today, it will be done by telling them to sit down together and work something out.  I think now and I thought then that here more than in almost any case we have had in recent years is a case for a mediator.  I admit there is a problem about mediation because the mediator would have to find a solution which by definition must cost more than the Minister is at present willing to provide.</P>
    <P>We have therefore a particularly complex position in which the Minister, the Department and the Government are reluctant to appoint a mediator because he can only do a good job if he is able to recommend a solution which will cost more, and the Government and the Minister are not prepared to provide the kind of money needed to pull this country out of the mess they have got us into in this matter through the way they have handled it.  It is up to the Government to appoint a mediator and to state their willingness to accept a solution which does not involve an unreasonable burden on public funds, which will involve some but which will satisfy the very proper concern of all the parties in this dispute to maintain the positions they have legitimately <Col N="434" /> secured over the years and which will correspond to these basic principles which each of them have accepted, even though with some reluctance, I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>I also said in that speech on 5th March:</P>
    <P>I know it cannot be solved unless people are prepared to change entrenched positions.</P>
    <P>This is probably true of everybody in the dispute.  It is true above all of the Department because more than anybody else they are responsible for the solution.  I went on to say why and how they were responsible and I shall not repeat that now.</P>
    <P>What have we got?  The Minister has moved from one entrenched position to another.  He produced a document in July last and apparently on this document he stands or falls.  He knows as well as I do that when this dispute is eventually settled it will not be on the particular terms in that document.  He knows that concessions will have to be made, that the solution will involve something different.  He knows that is the case.  Must we go to the brink?  Must we have this situation where parents are faced with this appalling worry of having their children deprived of education at a time when they are approaching in many cases within months of the examinations that matter so much to them and with no knowledge of how long it will last?  It is not as if they will be told it will be a strike for a week or a fortnight and they can plan for that. If there is a strike it could last for weeks or months, right up to the time of the examinations.</P>
    <P>Why should they be faced with that worry because the Department and the Minister's predecessor have created this situation?  It is not a situation created by the teachers.  The teachers were going along reasonably happily as they were until the Department decided&mdash;I think it was a legitimate decision&mdash;to move towards a common basic scale.  It was because they decided to move in that direction and took particular steps towards it&mdash;backwards and then towards it again&mdash;that we are in the trouble in which we now find ourselves.  It is not the fault of <Col N="435" /> the teachers; they did not start trouble. Certainly, it is not the fault of the parents or the children.  Because the Minister has decided he made an offer last July and that is that, all are to suffer on that account.  He knows as well as I do that before this is settled there will have to be further talks, remediation of some kind and eventually a solution.  Let us have it now. Let us not stand on dignity.  There is too much at stake.</P>
    <P>There is a rooted belief on the part of some Ministers&mdash;and I am disappointed that this Minister appears to have fallen into the trap&mdash;that Ministers must always be unyielding and never seem to change their minds.  I think all politicians are inclined to feel that, if we admit we have changed our minds in some way, it reveals a weakness of some kind.  Every party seems to feel it must stand over everything it has done over the last 50 years.  This is a uniquely Irish characteristic.  In other countries there is an agreed statute of limitation and parties do not have to justify what they did 50 years before, as we do here.  We all have this reluctance to change our minds. It is something in Government that we have to get over.  We have to be willing to admit at times that we have either made a mistake or that in an evolving situation it is necessary to change one's position; it is necessary to discuss and negotiate and not stand firm on a position that will eventually have to be modified.</P>
    <P>I am afraid the Minister when he is replying may reject it, carry on up to the brink, and over the brink until, eventually, disruption is caused and then some one will intervene, proposals will be made and a settlement will be arrived at which could have been arrived at long before on an equitable basis without that disruption.  I would ask the Minister to reconsider his position.</P>
    <P>I am not asking him to get up and say, &ldquo;Yes, you are right.  We shall do what you are saying.&rdquo; It would be asking too much of any politician.  I am sure that, if Fine Gael were in Government, we would not be inclined to react just like that.  I do think the <Col N="436" /> Minister could, in the light of what he has heard from me and from Deputy O'Connell, say he is prepared to consider the matter and discuss it further, that he does not believe in being intransigent and that he is prepared to go away and consider what might be done.</P>
    <P>There is a meeting of the Parent School Movement in Dublin this evening about this very matter.  The parents, who are not on one side or the other, are simply concerned about their children.  I should like to be able to go to that meeting and say to these people that in the Dáil this evening the Minister for Education did, after a brief debate, offer some hope of discussing the matter further.  If he can offer any hope of that kind I shall be more than willing to go to that meeting and say on his behalf that he is prepared to do his bit and help resolve the dispute.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">

      <P>I raised this question in the House today because of the concern of parents about their children's future.  Parents are both concerned and anxious about the fact that a strike is likely to take place.  This concern has extended to the children themselves, who feel that a strike is going to take place and their year in secondary school is going to be disrupted. I know, from discussing it with secondary school students, that this feeling of uncertainty is affecting their studies.  It is bad for children to feel that the intermediate certificate and the leaving certificate examinations may not take place.  There is justification for this because of the history of extended strikes by teachers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am concerned about the statement the Minister made today because from what I gather he is adopting an inflexible attitude.  He has decided that what he did in July must stand.  When it was suggested he might meet the teachers he said this had already been done. It is important that the Minister act now before these pupils go home for their Christmas holiday so that they can be assured that no strike will take place.  If the strike does take place it will go on for a long time.  Two or three months of the school year may <Col N="437" /> be lost and as a result these children will be deprived of the necessary certificate.</P>
    <P>There is a problem, but I do not think the secondary teachers are to blame.  The Minister's Department is to blame and the Minister must accept responsibility.  I suggest a body be set up in the same way as bodies are set up to deal with industrial disputes with an independent chairman, or mediator, as Deputy FitzGerald suggested, to which representatives from these different organisations could go to discuss the matter and find a solution.</P>
    <P>We would all admire the Minister if he said, &ldquo;All right, I shall look into this.  I realise it is important.  I realise parents are concerned. I realise pupils are concerned about the matter and I shall see to it that everything possible is done to avert this strike.&rdquo;  We all know the history of this and we must accept the threat of the secondary teachers to strike.  We must consider the children involved.  This is not a case for saying, &ldquo;I must abide by what I have said&rdquo;.  The Minister must be flexible.  He must realise there is more at stake.  We have had enough strikes this year.  Despite everything that was said the Government eventually had to settle the bank strike after so many months, and there can be no doubt that Government intervention finally brought it to an end.</P>
    <P>The Minister would be admired if he took the initiative, met these bodies and suggested to them that either a mediator or an independent chairman of an independent body be set up, and if he got assurances from them that whatever decision will come from this will be accepted and there will not be a strike.  If the Minister does this he will have the admiration of the parents, students and teachers.</P>

      <P>I should like to say that, as Minister for Education, and, as a parent, I am particularly anxious about the possibility of a secondary school teachers' strike.  As I only have ten minutes to deal with this matter I think I should give a brief synopsis of what has happened to date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="438" /> As Deputies are aware, the Ryan Tribunal was set up in December, 1967. Its function was to recommend a common basic scale of salary for teachers in national, secondary and vocational schools and also to recommend what appropriate additions might be made to the basic scale in respect of qualifications, length of training, nature of duties and so on.  The tribunal reported in 1968 and the Government accepted its proposals. Two of the teaching bodies accepted them but they were not acceptable to the ASTI.  Some time later the ASTI took strike action and subsequent to that, in March, 1969, an agreement between the Department and the secondary teachers was made.  As soon as news of the agreement became public the other two teaching bodies objected vehemently to it.  They pointed out that it cut across the proposals of Ryan and they threatened industrial action if the situation was not brought back to what it had been subsequent to the Ryan proposals.  The matter was then referred back to Professor Ryan and, in his reply in June, 1969, he stated that the agreement made in March of that year was in breach of his proposals and he stated also that the framework of his proposals could be restored by the process of erosion.</P>
    <P>It was about this time I became Minister for Education and I held numerous meetings with all the teaching bodies in an endeavour to find an acceptable solution.  I failed to find a solution and I then decided to ask Mr. Dermot MacDermott, the chief conciliation officer of the Labour Court, to come in and endeavour to find a solution to this very difficult problem. He met two of the teaching bodies in conciliation and he met the ASTI outside conciliation.  After a considerable number of discussions with the teaching bodies he, too, failed to find an acceptable solution.</P>
    <P>At this stage it became obvious to me that it was not possible to get an agreed solution from discussions with the various teaching bodies and it devolved on me, as Minister, to put forward my own proposals.  I studied all the notes that had been taken at the meetings I had had with the <Col N="439" /> different teaching bodies.  I also took into consideration the advice made available to me by Mr. MacDermott and, having taken a very considerable time in trying to find a solution which would be acceptable to the three teaching bodies, I ultimately put forward proposals to the teachers which were designed to produce a solution and stated that I intended to implement them.  The Government made available to me about another £500,000 and I cannot understand Deputy FitzGerald's remark that we dealt with this in a very mean-minded way because our salary scales here will, I think, compare very favourably with those in other countries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposals I put before the teachers were favourably accepted by the public, if one is to judge by the comments in the news media.  Two of the teaching bodies accepted the proposals, with reservations. The ASTI again did not accept. Recently I asked the ASTI to meet me and we had a further discussion.  I pointed out to them that, if I were to interfere in any way with the situation as it was, I would face very severe difficulties with regard to the other two teaching bodies; I would in fact be faced with a threat of industrial action by one or other of the two bodies or, quite possibly, by both.</P>
      <P>It has been suggested here that I should meet the secondary teachers again.  It would be of no value meeting any single group of teachers.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>Not at all.  The only way in which I could meet the teachers and try to change the proposals I put forward would be by meeting all three <Col N="440" /> groups together.  I have endeavoured to do this on many occasions and I have failed.  One of the most important points in relation to the whole problem is the impossibility of getting all the teaching bodies to come in together and discuss the whole matter with my Department as a body.  I pointed out to the secondary teachers that while I was asking them to accept something less satisfying to them than the original agreement offered, I was at the same time refusing to adopt the Ryan erosion proposals, as I had been pressed to do very strongly by the other two bodies.</P>
      <P>Deputy FitzGerald suggested that we should get back to first base.  The Deputy would need to ask himself whether we really could return to first base and, in fact, if he discusses this with some of the teaching bodies he will find that he will not be permitted to go back to first base.</P>
      <P>I am very concerned about the possibility of strike action and I would ask the secondary teachers to look again at the proposals I have put before them and, even if they have some reservations about them, as the other two teaching bodies have, I would ask them to accept these proposals.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not in the slightest degree inflexible but my problem is that I have to deal with three bodies and anything I do by way of changing what I have already proposed in one case will be vehemently opposed by the other two teaching bodies.  As I said, and I have said this on numerous occasions here, the only way in which it would be possible to get any sort of acceptable solution would be if the three teaching bodies would come together.  I put forward a new scheme of conciliation and arbitration.  I asked <Col N="441" /> them to take part in this; two did and the third body refused to take part. The only way in which the proposals can be changed is by having discussions with all the teachers as a body and within the limits of the money available to me.  But even if it were possible to make more money available, it would have to be given across the board to the three teaching bodies and it would not change the situation one iota <i>vis-à-vis</i> any one of them.</P>
      <P>Again, I would appeal to the secondary teachers to re-examine my proposals. While they may not be entirely satisfactory to them, nevertheless there are considerable advantages in them. I would ask them to reconsider the situation.  As I said, I am as concerned as anybody in this House that a strike should not take place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister says these cannot be changed except by the agreement of all three, is he thereby giving to two of the teaching bodies a right of veto over the salary position of the third?  Is it perhaps unwise to put it in that form?  I recognise the Minister's difficulty: would the Minister be prepared to receive a deputation from the Parent School Movement to see whether or not they might find some way of approaching the different teaching bodies to see if they could overcome the very real difficulties the Minister has?  They might talk to the different teaching bodies and see if they could come up with a way out which would relieve the Minister of his embarrassment.</P>
