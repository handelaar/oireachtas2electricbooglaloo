    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamLawlor" hpid="Mr. Lawlor Mr. Lawlor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lawlor</NameTxt>
      <P>I pointed out that this Bill should and will have a major impact on <Col N="1892" /> future housing policy.  As one representing a constituency where there is tremendous pressure as a result of building of housing plus future likely need I feel this Bill will go a long way towards addressing the issues confronting the housing area.  Deputy Quinn has spoken at some length on the matter and has put forward his party's viewpoint and a number of criticisms the bulk of which I reject.  In my experience of housing policy in the past ten to 15 years there has been far too much negative criticism. It is frustrating to hear a continual flow of negative criticism against housing policy starting with Dublin city where the most expensive local authority housing probably in Europe and worldwide has seen the rebuilding of Dorset Street, the South Quay, the north inner city, Clanbrassil Street and the Coombe, all high quality brick-fronted, local authority residential development.  In regard to the satellite towns, the continual criticism of these rapidly growing areas <i>vis-à-vis</i> the growth of housing is misinformed and very unhelpful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the inner city with its overcrowded, inadequate, unhealthy housing, the only positive practical solution to the problem was the major development of the new satellite towns two of which I have the duty and honour to represent.  A number of uninformed commentators who probably do not know Tallaght and have not toured it extensively criticise it continually. That is unhelpful and unwarranted. Again, the quality and quantity of local authority housing stock there in one of the finest amenity areas in the Dublin region, the foothills of the Dublin mountains, is excellent.  The planning cycle to provide the rest of the facilities has been slower than we would have wished, but factors independent of the planning cycle have not allowed the very substantial build-up to get the facilities and amenities these areas need so badly. However, the quality of the housing there is excellent and criticism of the peripheral social problems of unemployment, etc., levelled at these new satellite towns does nothing for the confidence the new communities there are endeavouring to instil <Col N="1893" /> into their areas and shows lack of knowledge of the subject.</P>
    <P>Consecutive Governments in many years have had a generous and elaborate local authority housing programme which was necessary and justified.  We had a substantial backlog to clear and we appear now in the greater Dublin area to have cracked the major problem.  I agree that Deputy Quinn outlined that the list may increase substantially again and I ask the Minister to look in great detail at aspects of future housing policy.  At the moment we are in a retrenchment period. We have spent millions on local authority housing.  There is a vast landbank for local authority housing in my constituency and in some cases substantial infrastructural investment is not being utilised.  These are areas of future housing policy that the Minister must address. The untapped resources in the Dublin region must be studied in great detail and as we are at the moment reviewing future plans for Dublin city and county the opportune time for that is now.  This legislation coming forward is very relevant to other major issues being addressed and should allow a coherent revision of housing policy to emerge.  I urge the Minister to address the situation in Dublin and I make one plea to him before I conclude.</P>
    <P>The Minister is familiar with the situation in Dublin to which Deputy De Rossa referred recently when speaking on the Order of Business regarding housing. In my constituency are two sets of local authority tenants.  People on one side of the road are paying their repayments or rents to Dublin Corporation who are responsible for that housing stock.  On the other side of the road people are paying to Dublin County Council.  There is duplication and triplication. Deputy Gay Mitchell will be very familiar with it.  The corporation have enough to do to represent and look after their own area.  Vast numbers of their former residents are now residing in the county, yet they have some oblique, arm's length responsibility to those people.  The council have not full responsibility because it reverts to the corporation and an understandable but <Col N="1894" /> undesirable position has developed which must now be addressed.</P>
    <P>The priority was to crack the housing list and get on with the job of providing necessary housing.  Now that is stabilised we must look at the administration and operation of housing policy as it is relevant to the greater Dublin area.  Because of financial constraints, the theoretical restructuring of local government in Dublin has not emerged.  We can appreciate the Minister's difficulties in that area. However, I ask that this aspect of the housing cycle be addressed as follows.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to consider transferring the Dublin Corporation owned local authority housing to the responsibility of Dublin County Council who then would have direct, everyday responsibility of looking after those homes, collecting the rents and maintaining the estates.  The overhang of unfinished estates and lack of taking in charge of estates owned by the corporation in the county is unacceptable.  It is understandable that the elected members of the corporation are not familiar with the details of these problems because they are not in their constituencies or electoral areas and therefore, they are not consulted by and do not meet the people concerned.  We in the county are relating back to City Hall even though we have no direct function or input into the workings of City Hall.  This position has emerged because of the tremendous growth in the past ten to 15 years.  Those matters can now be fine-tuned.  There is a lot of duplication involved in housing maintenance and in administration.  Often we have two teams administering from different locations looking after the same problem.  There is little point in tightening the lid on some of the inefficiencies and squeezing back on housing allocations, which is desirable, if we do not improve the service.  Deputy Boland, when chairman of Dublin County Council, fought hard to get some order into this.  At the time Dublin Corporation was the biggest house-builder in the county.</P>
    <P>The increase in the number of houses <Col N="1895" /> has caused many problems for local authorities and I should like to ask the Minister to address the housing policy at the first available opportunity.  I welcome the Bill but I would like to see more statistical information available concerning the homeless.  I do not meet many homeless people but housing is the biggest issue any public representative has to deal with at constituency level.  It is possible that the county is more fortunate than the city in that we do not have to face the same type of problems that the city has. However, we should have the capacity to help the homeless.  There are many service facilities available in the county and the potential for more houses.  If there is a crisis in regard to the less fortunate members of our society we should be innovative enough to address it.  We have addressed many other thorny problems such as that relating to travelling families and the county has had the capacity to absorb a lot of growth in recent years.  Houses have been provided for all classes of people and if the problem of the homeless cannot be dealt with in the city the county should be asked to play its part.</P>
    <P>As a society we should assist those who deserve help.  If we do not do so, we will be failing miserably.  We have heard a lot of talk about the need for this legislation and there has been criticism of it.  We have been told that it does not go far enough and that a lot of money will be needed to implement its provisions. Those issues will have to be addressed immediately because those affected do not have time on their side.  I hope the legislation will be given a speedy passage through the Houses of the Oireachtas and that we will see progress on this front.  I look forward to local authorities being able to do something tangible for the less fortunate in our society.  I should like to commend the Minister, and his officials, on bringing the Bill forward.  I hope it will be on the Statute Book within a short time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory Mr. Gregory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome any legislation that draws attention to the problems of housing, particularly the problem of housing in my constituency, Dublin Central.  I can safely say that apart from unemployment in my constituency housing is the biggest single social issue.  The Minister has been complimented by many Deputies, including the last speaker, for bringing forward the Bill and I am sure it is well deserved but in my view there are two specific reasons why the Bill is before the House.  The first reason is the campaign that has been waged by Senator Brendan Ryan and his colleagues in the Simon Community. There is no doubt that some sections would not have been included in the Bill were it not for that campaign.  Senator Brendan Ryan, and the Simon Community, should be congratulated.  They may find certain shortcomings in the Bill but I am sure they will welcome it.</P>
      <P>The second reason the Bill is before the House is a more serious one from my point of view.  I see it as an attempt to fill a vacuum, as a cover-up for the absence of Government policy in the area of housing. I should like to draw attention to some statistics to support that view.  Since the Government took office they have dismantled the housing programmes of all local authorities, specifically in Dublin.  I should like to refer to the housing capital allocation between 1982 and 1988.  In 1982, the housing capital allocation to Dublin Corporation was £76 million; it was reduced to £70 million in 1983 and in 1988 it was £4.4 million.  That allocation was not to build new houses but to complete schemes begun last year. In other words, Dublin Corporation have not been provided with any money to build new houses in the city centre.  Does the Minister envisage that the Government will continue with this policy?  Has the Minister decided not to build any more local authority houses in the city centre?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister may tell us that the housing waiting list of Dublin Corporation has been reduced in recent years and I do not deny that.  It has been reduced from an unacceptably high level to a level that <Col N="1897" /> continues to be unacceptable to me.  I should like to quote details from the current housing waiting list of Dublin Corporation which I received from the housing allocation officer of the corporation, Mr. O'Sullivan.  The number of applicants on the waiting list is 2,819 and of that figure 574 are senior citizens.  I understand that 2,245 families are on the waiting list and that there are 100 single persons on it.  That is unacceptable.  I must stress that I am referring to the need to build houses within the city limits and not dealing with Tallaght, Clondalkin and so on, although I accept that those areas have been overbuilt.  In my view, there is a need for facilities in those areas and not additional houses.  There are vast areas of the inner city, in particular the Sheriff Street area, where there is a desperate need for housing.</P>
    <P>The housing list I have quoted only conveys half the story.  There is also the transfer list.  Thousands of families live in overcrowded, substandard conditions in corporation flats.  Many families live in one-bedroomed flats and do not have bathrooms or proper washing facilities. According to the figures issued by the transfer officer of Dublin Corporation, there are 2,256 families in the inner city on the transfer list who are seeking accommodation that will meet their needs.  Of those 2,256 applicants, 421 are senior citizens.  Between the housing list and the transfer list there are almost 1,000 senior citizens in Dublin who are looking for adequate accommodation and there are in the region of 5,000 families looking for proper and adequate accommodation.</P>
    <P>It is in that context that the current policy of the Fianna Fáil Government is simply inexplicable.  If this policy continues, in the next three or four years a situation will develop similar to that which developed in the sixties when there was a housing emergency in Dublin and when people took to the streets, marched and demanded a proper local authority housing policy.  I have no doubt that that situation will develop in the next few years if the current housing policy of the <Col N="1898" /> Government continues.  It is appropriate when a Housing Bill is before the Dáil that we should be told precisely what the housing policy of the Government is.  Do they intend to continue to refuse the local authorities any finance to provide badly-needed houses?</P>
    <P>The Minister may well say that the new emphasis will be on refurbishment.  There are in the region of 1,270 flats in the Dublin city area which have no bathrooms and no proper washing facilities whatever.  That sort of statistic is almost incredible in 1988, but it is the official statistic from Dublin Corporation.  Families are living in one-bedroomed and two-bedroomed flats with no bathrooms and no modern washing facilities.  The Minister has started a programme of refurbishment on the north side of Dublin which, if it gets off the ground this year, will mean that eight flats in St. Mary's Mansions in Seáan McDermott Street will be refurbished.  I would take this opportunity to ask the Minister to check with the officials in his Department to see what is holding up even that tiny but badly-needed pilot scheme in St. Mary's Mansions. The corporation submitted plans some time ago and there seems to be some difficulty in even approving that small scheme in that very depressed and very disadvantaged area.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister might find it appropriate, when responding to this Bill, to announce a programme for the complete refurbishment of all 1,200 of those flats throughout Dublin city so that proper washing facilities would be provided for the people who are unfortunate enough to live there.  That is something that is long overdue.  It should have been done many years ago.  A small start has been made &mdash; any start is to be welcomed &mdash; but I hope that a programme will be announced that all of these flats will be refurbished within a particular period.</P>
    <P>The opening statement of the Minister of State last week was that this Housing Bill is a major social measure.  I am not too sure what is meant by that.  I do not see anything major in it.  The Minister was complimented last week by the Deputies who represent the Ballymun <Col N="1899" /> area.  I would love to be in a position, as a Deputy representing the Sheriff Street area, to be equally complimentary to the Minister but for the moment at least I cannot be so because I am not clear on what the Minister intends to do in Sheriff Street.  Much more importantly, nobody who lives in Sheriff Street is clear either. The people there are very anxious to know precisely what the Minister intends to do.  Despite all the hype, the talk and the hoped for development in the Customs House site, just over a wall from the Sheriff Street flats complex, in the last year in Sheriff Street the living conditions have deteriorated to an almost unbearable and certainly unlivable condition. Whatever hope the people there may have had when they heard of developments in the Customs House Docks site and when they saw new inner city houses being built in Seville Place and other areas, they have lost virtually any hope they had in the last year.  They have heard a great deal in the press about the possibilities that would present themselves but they have seen and heard nothing from the Minister.</P>
    <P>I wonder would the Minister take the opportunity today to let us know what he intends to do about the deplorable living conditions in the Sheriff Sreet flats complex. Does he intend to do what the people there have expressed in a very democratic and almost unanimous way, that is, to demolish the flats on a phased basis and rehouse the people who have lived here since the flats were built and who lived in cottages on the site before they were built?  Does the Minister intend to rehouse those people in the North Wall area?  If so, what steps have his Department taken to bring that about? Or does the Minister intend to sweep those people out of that area and, as some of the more cynical people who have watched the scene there would say, bring in the yuppie element and get rid of the traditional people who have their roots in that area?  I do not believe the Minister would envisage doing such a thing, but it is important that he publicly state what his intention is and what steps <Col N="1900" /> he is taking to bring about a solution to the deplorable problem that exists there. The longer Sheriff Street is left as it is, it will become, day by day, a social time bomb.  I do not think any Minister &mdash; I am sure the present Minister included &mdash; would want that situation to continue much longer.  As a local representative for that area, I have to take any opportunity I get, and this is one, to highlight their plight and to call on the Minister to respond to it quickly.</P>
    <P>I know that a working group from the Department, Dublin Corporation and the Custom House Authority have been examining this matter for at least six months, if not 12 months.  Some time ago I questioned some of those people and they said they were getting close to a recommendation.  I do not know whether that recommendation has gone to the Minister.  All I know is that he has not made any announcement on the matter. I am not sure if the Minister knows what he is going to do in that area.  I am saying as clearly as I possibly can that action is required and if the Minister does not take action I have no doubt that the people who live in that area will be forced to do so in their own way.  I get some hope from the statements that I have heard from the Deputies who represent the Ballymun area.  The Minister has been very active as regards that area and has responded to the needs there.  I hope that his next priority will be the Sheriff Street area and that he will turn to that priority now.</P>
    <P>One of the points made last week is common to many corporation flat complexes and defeats the whole new policy of refurbishment, that is, that, at a time when the Government and the Minister are talking about the need for refurbishment of flat complexes in Dublin city, the allocation that is made available to the corporation for the maintenance of flats schemes has been drastically cut, more than halved, in the last year or two. How can one proceed with a programme of refurbishment for the older flats while drastically cutting the maintenance allocation for the more modern flats?  By the <Col N="1901" /> time the older flats are refurbished the more modern flats will need refurbishment because of a lack of maintenance. What is spoken about on the one hand and the reality of cutbacks on the other does not make sense.  This is something which the Minister, who might not be as familiar with life in inner city flats as some of us, might spend a little time on to see what can be done to speed up the refurbishment programme and to provide a proper maintenance programme for the many thousands of tenants who live in the flat complexes in the city and elsewhere.</P>
    <P>I have already paid a compliment to the Simon Community and to Senator Brendan Ryan for their campaign to bring this Bill before the House and it is only right to look at their comments on the Bill.  In a document written by Brian Harvey they state:</P>
    <P>The 1988 Bill does not impose any duty on local authorities to provide accommodation for the homeless, and the absence of this is its most serious omission.  At best, the effectiveness of the legislation in ensuring that the homeless will receive help will depend on the willingness of individual local authorities to take positive steps and on the Minister introducing suitable regulations.  At worst, a local authority may choose to do very little for the homeless or it may pass the buck on to local voluntary organisations.  The Housing Bill is thus an enabling measure rather than a Bill which gives homeless people a right to housing.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, Brian Harvey states:</P>
    <P>If passed, the Bill will mean the homeless will be considered an essential element in local authority housing policy.  Two objectives of those who have campaigned for change will be achieved: the definition of a homeless person and the identification of the responsible public authority.  But the absence of a duty on the local authority will give a new lease of life to the uncaring or irresponsible housing authority.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1902" /> The homeless Bill will mean homeless people on the streets long after this particular manifestation of poverty could and should have been swept away; it will mean homeless people unsheltered and unhoused when they could have been provided with accommodation. This is the real tragedy of the Housing Bill: that is why it has to be changed.</P>
    <P>I wish to comment on the sentence: &ldquo;the absence of a duty on the local authority will give a new lease of life to the uncaring or irresponsible housing authority&rdquo;. Having been involved with Dublin Corporation housing department for the past ten years, I can safely say they are not an uncaring or irresponsible housing authority; if anything, they are the opposite. They fulfil their task with the greatest of care and a sense of responsibility and sensitivity to homeless people and the people on their housing list.  I do not feel that will be a major problem with Dublin Corporation, but what will be a major problem is the passing of this legislation without any allocation of resources to the corporation to provide the accommodation required.  How can they respond to the needs of the homeless and to the needs of the people on their housing and transfer lists if they do not have any accommodation?</P>
    <P>It has been said &mdash; and there is a great deal of truth in it &mdash; that the only policy that is providing vacancies for the corporation is that of the present Government which encourages emigration.  It appears to me from watching developments in Dublin that the one contributory factor that is providing accommodation for the homeless is the emigration of families. If that is the position, and I am certain it is, it is a disgrace.</P>
    <P>While I agree with the Simon Community that there should be a duty on the housing authority to house homeless people, there must be a duty on the Minister and the Government to ensure that the housing authority have the resources to provide accommodation for people on their housing list.  For all the reasons I have mentioned, that is not happening.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1903" /> From replies to questions I put to the Minister, I know he is of the view that there may be many empty houses and flats in Dublin city and that until they are inhabited he cannot see the logic of building new houses.  I went to the corporation and got an analysis of the vacancies in the city area.  These vacancies exist largely in three flat complexes.  The first is in Ballymun, where there are many empty flats which are not in a habitable condition and where a major refurbishment programme is required.  The second is in Sheriff Street, which I have already dealt with, and which appears to be in limbo.  Nobody knows, particularly the people who live there, what the future holds for them.  The third is in a complex on the south side which is undergoing a major programme of refurbishment, St. Teresa's Gardens.  The problem there is being dealt with at least, and once the refurbishment programme is completed there will be no empty flats there.  There are no vacant houses in Dublin city. Therefore there is no argument for not building new houses.</P>
    <P>There is the problem of empty houses in the county areas, such as in Tallaght. The last speaker referred to this &mdash; and his solution to that problem is probably the best one &mdash; but I am talking about the Dublin city area, and there are no empty houses in the Dublin Corporation area.  There is a very long list of schemes &mdash; I am sure it is available to the Minister so I will not go through them now &mdash; which have been before the Department of the Environment for the building of new houses in derelict sites in Dublin city for more than two years.  They have not been approved.</P>
    <P>More than most, I welcome the building of the new inner city houses over the last five to ten years, but the number of houses being built on the north side is just a drop in the ocean.  From listening to the last Government speaker one would get the impression that that programme had been completed.  It was merely started.  Half the north side of the city is still derelict and these sites are in the ownership of Dublin Corporation. <Col N="1904" /> Plans for building houses on those derelict sites by the corporation have been with the Minister for the past two years, but have not been approved.</P>
    <P>If the Minister has a commitment to do something about the housing position in Dublin and is to play a real part in resolving this problem, rather than introducing this type of a Bill, which we are told is a social measure, it would be more practical if he were to do two things: first, speed up the refurbishment programme of the substandard flats; and, second, continue, not dismantle, the inner city house building programme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not aware that I was restricted in time, but I thank you for reminding me.  Let me make one or two further points.  I compliment all previous Governments, Fianna Fáil and Coalition, on their inner city housing programmes. One of the schemes brought in by the last Government, which was one of the best schemes ever introduced but which has been criticised here, largely by Deputy De Rossa, was the £5,000 grant scheme.  It was criticised on the basis that the people who were most able in particular areas availed of that scheme and left that community, which suffered as a result of their departure.  Yet, in the same contribution last week Deputy De Rossa stated that it was not his policy, that he did not believe that it was right, to force people to go to areas which were not of their choosing.  I think that he was talking about people who wanted to live in a particular community in the centre of Dublin, for example, who he felt should not have to go to a house in Tallaght, or elsewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems totally illogical to hold that viewpoint and at the same time say that if you live in a particular area and a scheme is introduced which allows you for the first time &mdash; as the £5,000 grant scheme did for very many people &mdash; to buy a house of your own in an area of <Col N="1905" /> your own choosing, that you should not be able to avail of such a scheme.  To condemn people who merely have not sufficient financial backing to buy their own homes to live in an area where they are not happy is unacceptable.  I fail to understand the logic of the criticism made against that scheme.  It gave thousands of families an opportunity that they never thought possible to bridge the gap between the funds that they could put together and what was required to buy a house of their own choosing.  Also, it provided more vacancies to Dublin Corporation than at any time in their entire history for people on the housing list.  If any scheme should be brought back it is that scheme and it is mentioned in the Bill before us.  It was a major benefit to many families and many others were sorely disappointed when it was abolished and they missed out on the opportunity to do what everybody should have a right to do, to have a home in an area of their own choosing.  I support the viewpoint &mdash; and it seems the major criticism of the people who sought to bring about this Bill &mdash; that there should be a duty on a housing authority to provide accommodation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>There should be a legal obligation on a housing authority to provide accommodation for a homeless person or a homeless family.  With that legal obligation must go the absolutely essential requirement that the necessary resources be made available to that local authority to allow them to fulfil that obligation. I regret that that obligation is not included in this Bill.  It would be very simple for the Minister at this stage to include it.  It would not cause the problems that he is advised it would cause. These have been dealt with by other <Col N="1906" /> speakers and as my time is used up I shall not repeat those arguments.  He could have another look at that matter on Committee Stage and I hope that he will.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBegley" hpid="Mr. Begley Mr. Begley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Begley</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly, I welcome the Bill and support the very strong point made by Deputy Gregory just now.  It puts the whole Bill in question.  Will the Minister provide the necessary finances to implement this Bill?  If one is to gauge from the attitude of the present Government to local authority housing in general, one would have to say rather cynically that this Bill is just a public relations exercise.  For the record, I shall mention information received in answer to Parliamentary Question No. 129 which I put down to the Minister for the Environment on Tuesday, 3 May 1988 asking for statistical information regarding housing in County Kerry.  I was informed that there was a drop, which was most alarming, from £7,800,000 in 1983 to £1,588,000 in 1988.  If that is to be the guideline or the criterion of the Minister, one would have to take this Bill as a public relations exercise.  The Minister must get down to the real truth of the matter and provide the necessary resources to allow the local authorities to implement the legislation.  I am quite sure that he had an input into the Bill.  It is full of pious platitudes and vague generalities. Even though those who worked on the Bill mean well, if the finance is not put up front the Bill will be put one the shelf to gather dust as the years go by.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the situation in County Kerry, I would urge the Minister, perhaps on Committee Stage, when moneys might become available if somebody in the country strikes gold, to give a more positive role to our many voluntary organisations.  I hope that I am not leaving any organisation out, but would mention three specifically, the St. Vincent de Paul Society as far as rural Ireland is concerned, the Samaritans and the Simon Community.  Those people have provided a voluntary back-up service for years and their work has never been recognised.  Perhaps one could drop an <Col N="1907" /> occasional note to the local housing authority pointing out certain facts to them in this regard, but these people should have recognition.  I urge the Minister, if at all possible, that they be given some advisory role in the implementation of this Bill, if moneys become available.  Down through the years those organisations, and others that I am quite sure are active in the city but that I do not know much about, have played a very positive role. In the darkness of night and at the breaking of dawn, these people are out there, helping, advising and taking people into shelter.</P>
    <P>I am seriously concerned that resources might not be made available. In County Kerry there are over 600 people on the housing list.  As we will only be able to build something in the region of 70 houses this year, in comparison with other years when the number went up to 200, and 300 in one particular year, it is the least well-off who will suffer.  The people who are more eloquent and can present their case that bit better will get priority.  The homeless people, those that the Minister in his heart wants to look after, will fall by the wayside.  Much criticism has been made of local authorities with regard to the housing of itinerants.  In County Kerry we can say we have another all-Ireland, because we have only two Kerry families on the road.  Because of the lure of the road they wanted to get out, even though they were very happily situated in housing provided by the local authority.  This is an achievement and I would have to pay tribute to the county manager and our social workers in County Kerry. Homeless people will suffer.  The Minister has power and in the very near future there are great things in store for him. They say he will be the new Minister for Finance&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Begley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister would fill that position most admirably.  He has as much neck as any man who came out of Connacht.  However, I must get back to more mundane matters.  The Minister should bear in mind that abolishing the grants means that people in local authority houses will suffer.  Many of them own their homes but they will be put to the pin of their collar to keep up the repayments on their loans from financial institutions.  When local authority houses become dilapidated and shabby there will be no incentive to repair them.  Perhaps the Minister will consider introducing an incentive for local authority tenants who acquired their homes through the vesting scheme to enable them to maintain them.</P>
      <P>Deputy Gregory was quite right to say that managers in different housing authorities are responsible.  Local authority members have no say in allocating houses but sometimes the information they are able to give to the managers can be invaluable to the county manager when he is making a decision.  However, the manager's hands will be tied if the back-up services, particularly for the homeless, are not there.  If houses are built the necessary services must also be there, particularly water and sewerage.  Due to the new clampdown by the Department of the Environment there is no money for water or sewerage schemes.  There is no point in building houses if there are no back-up services.  The Minister should give priority to small schemes to accommodate the people about whom he is so concerned.  Recently, there was much ballyhoo by the Government about the redevelopment of urban designated areas and there were special incentives in this regard.  What about the small towns and villages that did not come under the umbrella of the Minister's novel idea?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1909" /> Some people never look beyond Dublin, but other small towns would be delighted if there was urban renewal in their areas. This could apply to Dingle, Listowel, Caherciveen, Castlebar, Claremorris, Ballina and many other places.  If there are derelict sites in these areas and their owners are not making an effort to improve them, they could be taken over for housing.  Recently, local authorities put compulsory purchase orders on the owners of such derelict sites and that is a very good idea.  However, there is no point in acquiring these sites if the necessary back-up is not available to finish the job.</P>
    <P>If local authorities in small villages and towns put a proper case to the Minister regarding derelict sites, the necessary back-up should be given.  I have no doubt that the Department of the Environment housing inspectors are conscientious civil servants and that they could earmark certain funds for these projects to clean up our towns and to tidy our villages.  The Minister knows enough about rural areas to know that there are many such sites in every area.</P>
    <P>Homeless people have been used for public relations exercises down through the years.  However, when a genuine effort is being made by county managers to house them many of the PR people run for cover.  The Minister must give power to the county managers to make a decision, because if they cannot implement the legislation the Bill is useless. Will the Minister say how much money he will allocate for this project? There is a shortfall of finance in every local authority at the moment.  There are 600 people on the waiting list for housing in County Kerry and I do not know what the number is in other counties.  It is only a matter of time before thousands of people will be homeless.</P>
    <P>If the local authorities do not look after people who are looking for homes I foresee stormy times ahead and many protest marches.  There will be a reason for all this discontent because the Minister cannot tell local authorities to build houses without providing money to do so. Where will all the young married couples <Col N="1910" /> live?  They are in mobile homes and caravans at present.  Unlike Pontius Pilate, the Minister cannot wash his hands of the problem and say that we will look after them in time.  The allocation to County Kerry in 1983 was nearly £8 million but this year that figure has dropped to £1.5 million.  Each local authority is facing a crisis and those living in mobile homes and caravans hope there will be a house available to them in one and a half years or three years down the road.  The Minister should stand up and tell us squarely and honestly that he wants local authorities to get out of housing altogether. That is the reality and the Minister should be big enough to say it.  Perhaps that was his intention when introducing that lovely new scheme which enables local authorities to sell off houses to their tenants but that is only a short term answer &mdash; a very short term answer.  If funds such as reconstruction grants and so on are not provided to maintain homes in a proper state of repair, we will have terrible problems in five years time.</P>
    <P>The Minister should direct county managers to write to everybody on a housing list to say that due to financial constraints no house is going to be built for them for at least ten years.  We cannot have 600 people in County Kerry and thousands of others in towns and cities around the country hoping the Minister is going to change his mind.  He is not going to do that.  He is doing exactly the same as the British Prime Minister is doing in Britain &mdash; getting the local authorities out of housing altogether.  Should the Minister tell us he is going to do away with local authority housing?  Perhaps that would be a more honest approach. While this is a tremendous Bill it appears that it only amounts to a public relations exercise on the backs of the poor.  That is all it will amount to if the Minister does not provide the funds to implement it.</P>
    <P>Senator Brendan Ryan as well as a number of Deputies in this House, particularly Deputy Kemmy, have been very vocal about the needs of the homeless. The Minister must face up to his obligations but I do not think he is going to do so.  He has said that bigger things lie <Col N="1911" /> ahead for him, that he is only passing through and that in a short space of time the bells will ring and he will be going to the Park for a different portfolio.  When the history books come to be written they will show that it was Deputy Padraig Flynn, while he was Minister for the Environment, who introduced the Homeless Persons Bill, but in years to come Deputy Flynn will say he was not Minister when he wanted to implement it, he was moved on.  He should not try to cod us in this House.  It is only when the Minister is prepared to give a solemn undertaking that he is going to put more money up front that I will believe him, as will a good many more.</P>
    <P>The Minister has been given a golden opportunity in this Bill to do something about run-down housing estates.  In section 12 he has outlined a scheme for remedial works to local authority houses but this will be of no use unless he is prepared to say to the local authorities that he will give them £200,000 specifically to refurbish local authority houses. Already, the walls and the timber railings around doors are beginning to deteriorate in many of those houses and they look terrible when they begin to rot.  The ball is at the feet of the Minister.  I hope for his sake he provides the necessary funds and that, he will not say in years to come that while he introduced the legislation he was not the Minister for the Environment when he wanted it to be implemented.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimKemmy" hpid="Mr. Kemmy Mr. Kemmy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kemmy</NameTxt>
      <P>Like all other speakers, I would like to say that I welcome this Bill.  It is a belated measure.  It does not go far enough but in so far as it goes it is a good measure.  Other speakers referred to the tremendous work which has been done in this area by Senator Brendan Ryan and Brian Harvey of the Simon Community and the Simon Community itself to make us more aware and conscious of the problems facing homeless people.  I, too, acknowledge the work which has been done by Senator Brendan Ryan and the Simon Community in this area.  I would also like to acknowledge the <Col N="1912" /> tremendous work which has been done by Sr. Stanislaus Kennedy and Focus Point who, equally, have been trying to make us more aware of our obligations as public representatives in this area.</P>
      <P>I do not know whether the Minister received in the post this week a copy of a document produced by Focus Point and Sr. Stanislaus Kennedy outlining some criticisms of the Bill, but if he has not received a copy I will send him one.  I will not quote at length from this document but merely try to summarise for the Minister the six main criticisms outlined by Sr. Stanislaus Kennedy and Focus Point. First, the Bill empowers local authorities to do something about the plight of the homeless but does not legally oblige them to do so.  In other words, it does not put any legal obligation on them to do so. Second, it fails to give full and clear recognition to the voluntary and co-operative housing sector.  Third, its definition of homelessness is not broad enough. Fourth, housing need assessment does not include important categories of people, for instance, young people leaving care.  Fifth, the assessment of housing needs is not due to be undertaken on a regular basis: in other words, it is too loose and too irregular.  Sixth, housing authorities will not be obliged to carry out an estimate of housing requirements in their area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the past we have adopted an out-ofsight out-of-mind attitude to the homeless in our society.  I admit it is a difficult and unpleasant duty for the Government, the Minister and the community to tackle the problem but it is one we cannot shirk or run away from.  In recent months I have received many letters from religious bodies and individual religious persons who pointed out my obligations as a public representative in respect of the homeless.  Mind you, I do not object to anyone writing to me to put pressure on me as a public representative to face up to my obligations in this respect because we have to learn to live with that kind of pressure.  Most of the letters I received were from nuns.  I also received letters from priests and brothers, many in my own constituency of Limerick East.  I <Col N="1913" /> would point out to those nuns, priests and brothers who wrote to me that there is also an obligation on them to look at themselves.</P>
    <P>If we take a close look at many of the religious orders in this country we will find that they are living in palatial houses and in lovely, spacious surroundings.  The same is true of cardinals, archbishops and bishops, and indeed parish priests.  While it is good that they should write to me &mdash; and I suppose being a socialist I should stand up and be counted on these issues &mdash; perhaps they should look at the mote in their own eye also.  They, too, are under an obligation to tackle this problem of homeless people.  I have no money or property but perhaps I could scatter my largesse among the community.  Some of those who have written to me, some of the religious orders, are wealthy people even though many of them have taken a vow of poverty.  I would not want anyone to go around like Matt Talbot living on herring soup and giving the herring to the cat.  I would not live in that kind of world at all.  They are living in conditions which are far from being poverty-stricken.  They also have an obligation to tackle the problem of homeless people.  It is an indictment of all of us &mdash; Governments, public representatives, the community at large, including religious people &mdash; that there should be anybody homeless in our society.  It is a grave reflection on all of us.</P>
    <P>The problem will not disappear but rather will intensify as society becomes more competitive, as more people become unemployed with resultant increasing poverty in society.  Many people homeless at present are people who found it impossible to survive in this competitive society; they could be described as casualties of the competitive society.  It appears to me from my dealings with them that many could not keep up with the pressures on them.  It is wrong that people should be abandoned or feel unwanted in our society.  We must make every effort to find a place for them, in every sense of the word, in our society. It is also wrong that some people should have two, three and four houses &mdash; some <Col N="1914" /> politicians included &mdash; while others have no home at all.  This is to be condemned totally.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister and Government will address themselves to the defects of this Bill as have been outlined by a number of bodies, such as the Simon Community, Focus Point and individual Members who have spoken about them. I hope the Minister will be big enough to take on board some of the very valuable suggestions made.  I hope he will see fit to amend the Bill in order to give expression to those suggestions.</P>
    <P>There are a number of key points I should like to make in relation to housing <i>vis-à-vis</i> the provisions of this Bill.  The once-off sale on a tenant/purchase basis of local authority houses is an attractive proposition to many people.  It allows houses to be offered to people at half their market value, less £2,000 in most cases.  I estimate that approximately one-third of the housing stock of local authorities will be sold before 31 December next.  That amounts to large number of houses being sold in one fell swoop.  We should remember that the sale of such a large number of local authority dwellings has other implications.  For example, it means there will be one-third fewer houses available for homeless people.  I do not blame people for not looking a gift horse in the mouth.  Most local authority tenants woud be sufficiently astute to avail of the provisions of that house purchase scheme and I would not condemn them for doing so.  However, we should remember the problems that will be encountered thereafter in relation to local authority housing stocks, something which cannot be escaped.</P>
    <P>Deputy Begley referred to the urban renewal programme in designated areas. In addition to private development in Dublin, Cork and Limerick, it is important that there be local in-fill schemes of public housing.  For far too long old people have been sent to outlying areas, to housing estates on the peripheries of our cities.  Such people are very vulnerable in such areas.  Many of them have been attacked, robbed and suffered from being alienated in such areas.  I contend <Col N="1915" /> that old people should be brought back to the inner city areas, those areas being rebuilt from their present derelict condition. I am thinking particularly of central city areas in Dublin, Cork and Limerick.  Unfortunately, Limerick city has a very bad image in this respect, with the central areas lying derelict, being pock-marked by ruined, derelict buildings which would be ideal sites for small, in-fill housing estates.  Unfortunately, the emphasis has been on private development. In the absence of private housing there is no reason priority should not be given to the building of public housing, especially for older people, in central city areas.</P>
    <P>I contend such a programme would have a three-fold objective.  First, it would give our cities a better image; second, it would enable older people to be brought back into the inner cities from outlying housing estates, leaving them feeling more secure and giving life and expression to urban renewal; and, third, it would give employment to building-construction workers.  It is a bad thing to turn our backs on our long heritage of building skills.  We should remember the vast emigration of our workforce, including apprentices, general operatives, craftsmen and others.  We can ill afford to have such people engaged on house building developments in Britain, the Continent and illegally in the United States.</P>
    <P>The strange thing about housing in Limerick is that three years ago there was a target drawn up for the building of 350 houses annually.  Yet this year there were only three dwellings built by Limerick Corporation, which is a disgrace on the part of any local authority.  In fairness, I should say that the Minister has given priority to the refurnishing of houses in St. Mary's Park.  Funds have been provided and the work is now proceeding. While the refurbishment of those houses in St. Mary's Park, built in 1935, is taking place, some hundreds of thousands of pounds worth of damage is being done to the flats at Ballynanty and the Hyde Road.  No later than Monday last <Col N="1916" /> approximately £50,000 worth of damage was done by young vandals who gutted flats in the Hyde Road shops complex.</P>
    <P>I have spoken about this matter at council level.  The Garda say it is very difficult to prevent such vandalism.  These vandals go to the flats, pull out such things as boilers, cylinders, timber and other fittings.  Their actions have devastated whole areas of the city.  The Garda come sometimes, when asked, but say they cannot do much about it, that such people are too nimble, have too many escape hatches.  I do not believe that at all; that is engaging in the politics of despair.  On the one hand, the Minister is spending some hundreds of thousands of pounds in another part of the city on the refurbishment of old houses while, on the other, the same amount is being wasted elsewhere on destruction and vandalism. We are using our Army and police force for the protection of money being moved between banks.  One sees daily security vans, squad cars and so on lined up on the streets of Dublin, Cork and Limerick. Yet those young hooligans can pull apart our homes and flats with impunity while the Garda say they can do nothing about it.</P>
    <P>As a democrat, a person with some intelligence and experience of life, I reject that attitude totally.  Surely we are paying our Army and police force to protect us and our property?  I contend that public property and money are as important as the private property and money. While the Garda give priority, in Limerick anyway, to the protection of public property, it is not being done in an even-handed manner.  I would invite the Minister to send an official of his Department to Limerick to see what is happening there at present.  It would be unreasonable of me to make a rash statement like that unless I could stand over it.  I can tell the Minister that the local fire brigade were called perhaps 20 times within the last two weeks to the flats in the Hyde Road shops complex, sometimes being battered and pelted by mobs of these young vandals, resulting in their having to leave the scene.  Even though they had worked valiantly to contain fires in those <Col N="1917" /> buildings, one would think one was in the South Bronx area of New York, so scary and frightening are these experiences. Again, I contend that it is engaging in the politics of despair to allow the wilful squandering of public money in that fashion.  If the Minister would send an official from his Department to Limerick I would undertake to accompany him and let him see what is happening there.  It is a matter of grave public concern and scandal.  There is no reason we cannot give priority to the housing of old people in the inner city areas of Dublin, Cork and Limerick.</P>
    <P>I might refer to the provisions of section 13 with regard to itinerants.  Many people would like the problems appertaining to itinerants and their settlement to disappear also, but the sad reality is that they will not.  It should be remembered that the itinerant population is increasing, unlike that of the settled community. Therefore, their problems will be intensified also.  There was a court case involving Limerick Corporation in recent weeks, the judgment in respect of which will have implications for all local authorities. That judgment contended that itinerants cannot be moved from temporary or unofficial halting sites unless one has an alternative settled site to offer them or one made available to them in advance.  That should be noted by everybody in this House because we have to deal with the problem.</P>
    <P>In the past the Minister was very generous in providing capital grants for local authorities so that they could lay out sites for travelling people.  Unfortunately because of pressures at local level and because local representatives were not strong enough to stand up to some of those pressures, the money has gone abegging almost every year.  Limerick is no exception and I do not want to be mealy-mouted about this either. During the past 20 or 30 years Limerick people have complained constantly about the 22 unofficial halting sites in the city. I always say to these people that we will have an increasing number of unofficial halting sites unless we have official sites <Col N="1918" /> to replace them.  That should be said loudly and clearly not alone in Limerick but elsewhere as well.</P>
    <P>In the past the Department have been very good in that respect, better than local authorities in trying to make us aware of our obligations towards the travelling community in the provision of sites and so on.  I have seen many television programmes on this subject and I have visited some of the sites.  Provision has been made for a site in Nenagh, for example which can cater for six to eight caravans, and much good work has been done in Tallaght.  There is no reason those prototypes cannot be copied by other areas.  I welcome that aspect of the Bill even though it does not go far enough. It does not push local authorities to go further than they are willing to go in that respect.  By and large, this is a good Bill. I want to be positive about the good aspects of it.  I hope that the Minister will take account of some of the points made by me and other speakers which I believe will improve the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MattBrennan" hpid="Mr. M. Brennan Mr. M. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on bringing this very good Bill before the House.  I should like to refer in particular to the voluntary housing schemes.  Recently the Minister approved money for the allocation of 19 houses in Carrownanty, Ballymote.  These voluntary housing schemes are tremendous. The St. Vincent de Paul Society in Ballymote deserve much credit for raising money for voluntary housing schemes. We have all heard of cases where the houses of elderly people living in rural Ireland have been broken into by greedy, violent and ruthless thugs.  The voluntary housing schemes are helping to bring people into towns like Tubbercurry and Ballymote.  Two years ago the St. Vincent de Paul Society built six houses for elderly people in Tubbercurry, and great credit is due to that voluntary organisation for raising money and organising the building of those houses.  I would encourage these voluntary housing schemes, and I thank the Minister for making the necessary funds available for these schemes because they are of <Col N="1919" /> tremendous value to the people of those areas.  I ask the Minister to ensure that there are no cutbacks in the provision of old people's homes.  We must look after elderly people, and the building of old people's homes in any village or town is a step in the right direction.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on the tenant purchase scheme which was introduced recently.  It is a very good scheme whereby over 40 per cent is taken off the value of a local authority house before it is offered for sale to a tenant.  That gives everybody a chance to own their own homes.  People should be encouraged to own their own homes and this scheme will ensure that they can do that.  It is a very good scheme and again I congratulate the Minister on introducing it.</P>
      <P>I also ask the Minister to make the necessary funds available for temporary housing accommodation for the homeless. I believe this Bill will do just that. Many people are practically homeless and county councils have to provide mobile homes or caravans to house these people.  The reason I came into the House today was to encourage the building of old people's homes and the continuance of the voluntary housing schemes for elderly people.  Finance should be made available to these people who have lived most of their lives in rural areas but who now want to move into towns and villages.</P>

      <P>In common with previous speakers I too welcome the Housing Bill, 1988.  It is an important document in so far as it contains a number of measures that are long overdue, especially the measures in relation to the housing of the homeless.  It is important also in that it affords an opportunity to have a comprehensive debate on housing legislation and related matters at this stage in the lifetime of the present Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill has been described by the Minister as a major social measure.  This is a description that will be difficult to defend.  A social measure it certainly is but a major social measure it is not at this stage, though it may very well become <Col N="1920" /> one if all the amendments that have been proposed on the floor of the House are taken on board and stitched into the Bill before it finally becomes law.  Much of the material in the Bill ought properly to be set out in the form of a White Paper on housing.  I urge the Minister to set about preparing a White Paper on all matters of housing as a matter of extreme urgency.</P>
    <P>Far too many unco-ordinated, well-intentioned but poorly planned measures in relation to housing policy have taken place in recent years.  One such example was the £5,000 surrender grant for local authority tenants who were prepared to hand back their houses to local authorities and house themselves in the private sector.  I have no doubt that this was a very well-intentioned measure but with the benefit of hindsight we must now admit that it left a horrendous legacy for local authorities in every part of the country.  At its inception it was widely welcomed by all right-minded people who support the principle of encouraging in every way those who wish to house themselves but because no provision was made for the after effects of the exodus that resulted in city areas, local authorities are left with a very severe legacy to cope with.</P>
    <P>Because of the absence of proper overall planning and the absence of resources at local authority level, no provision was made for the quick repair and reoccupation of the houses that were vacated under that scheme.  The result of this is that in the cities there are vast estates with scores of vacant houses lying idle waiting to be reoccupied.  Moreover the overall appearance of many of these estates has deteriorated rapidly.  As well as that there was the unprepared for result of a disintegration in community life especially in new housing estates on the verges of cities where community life was just beginning to burgeon and where families were just about to get settled in schools, to relate to one another and to form a natural community.  Suddenly all of that was disrupted because of this scheme, which was well-intentioned but whose implications were not properly <Col N="1921" /> seen through.  That is why I am asking the Minister not to allow this Dáil to pass without bringing before us a White Paper setting out in a co-ordinated and integrated fashion the direction in which housing policy must go in the next five to ten years so as to ensure that we will introduce a series of <i>ad hoc</i> measures that might solve one problem but might lead to another problem almost equally serious.</P>
    <P>In relation to the elements of the Bill which deal with homelessness, proper legislation is long overdue.  In common with other speakers, I pay tribute to Senator Brendan Ryan and others who brought this legislation before the Seanad and who helped in no small way to bring us to the point where we are considering the Minister's Bill this morning.  It is no harm to remind ourselves that in this respect we lag far behind other countries, countries which speak much less stridently than we about their Christianity. In matters of official provision for the homeless we have fallen sadly behind, and that is to our shame.  Our recognition of this must lend urgency to implementing the provisions of this Bill as quickly as possible.  Indeed, if it were not for the work of the Simon Community, religious orders and other voluntary bodies in our cities, many of the homeless would continue to live as outcasts.</P>
    <P>While I welcome the proposals in this Bill, they are too modest a response to the problem of homelessness on the scale on which it now exists.  Unless the amendments tabled by the Progressive Democrats and by other Opposition Members like Deputy Tony Gregory, who spoke here this morning, are adopted, the Bill will fall far short of meeting its stated objectives.  The greatest weakness is the failure to put a statutory obligation on local authorities to provide housing for the homeless.  This must be remedied.</P>
    <P>What is being proposed here does little more than give legislative recognition to what is already happening in many local authority areas.  In Cork city, for example, the local authorities have over <Col N="1922" /> the years assisted religious orders by putting in place day centres and night shelters for homeless mothers and children. They do that with great effect in conjunction with the efforts of the Good Shepherd Sisters in Sunday's Well, for example.  Cork Corporation also work in close co-operation with the gallant schoolboys of Share, who have over the years provided excellent accommodation for elderly people in Cork city.  This is being done by Cork Corporation in advance of this legislation.  Unfortunately, it is not being done with equal dedication in other areas and it will not be done at all unless this legislation is given teeth and unless a definite legislative obligation is put on local authorities. We know from experience that some local authorities at certain times will respond to appeals and will go out of their way to help the homeless while others will not.  Cork city, to their credit, have on their own housed a number of homeless people; but the efforts being made are not enough and they fall far short of what is needed now and what will be needed in the future, having regard to current trends in society.  Now is the time to put fairly squarely on the shoulders of local authorities the obligation to provide houses.</P>
    <P>I agree that local authorities on their own cannot meet all the needs of the homeless person.  The provision of a unit of accommodation is only a beginning to putting homeless people into homes and helping them to surmount the difficulties that led to their being homeless in the first instance.  But it is the first and most essential precondition.  The natural body to meet that precondition is the local authority.  The obligation to do so must be put firmly on their shoulders.  Having done that in law, the resources must then be provided to enable them to honour the law.  That will be our first amendment to the Bill and we see it as being a necessary precondition to making the Bill work.</P>
    <P>There are other changes we would like to make.  We would like to compile a list of homeless persons in every local authority area.  It is necessary for local <Col N="1923" /> authority members and management to know exactly the number of homeless persons in their area if they are to plan properly to house those people.  In this respect I welcome the provision in section 2 which sets out a definition of homelessness. It is a positive step in the direction of enabling us to identify clearly in law who is homeless and who is eligible to be housed under the new law.  During the course of section 2, however, the Bill says that the number of homeless people and the needs of the homeless will be reviewed &ldquo;from time to time&rdquo;.  That is too vague.  We need to put a time limit on &ldquo;from time to time&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>We should put an obligation on the local authorities to review this matter on a yearly basis so that they would approach this in a systematic way and would review progress at the end of any given year. This should not be just an aspiration that local authorities would have but would fail to honour.  There must be an obligation to review progress every year.  If that is done, and if other local bodies can be mobilised to rally around the objectives of this Bill, we will go a long way towards meeting what we want to do in this House.  The health boards must play their part.  There is no doubt that people who have been homeless for a short time need assistance in a number of ways to enable them to fit into the sort of community that comes from living in a home and which will enable them to reap the benefits of not being homeless any longer.  We must call on the resources of the health boards and get a commitment from them that they will work closely with the local authorities in the area of community care to deal with the urgent problem of homelessness.</P>
    <P>We must acknowledge in every way we can the great work being done by voluntary bodies in this area.  Without the ongoing work of voluntary bodies we would not be in a position in this country to achieve our objectives even with this new law in place.  I pay tribute to the work being done by voluntary bodies. Tribute has also been paid by Deputy Brennan and other who spoke before <Col N="1924" /> me in this House.  To these voluntary organisations I say: &ldquo;Carry on with your good work.  Work closely with local authorities, health boards and other Government agencies, because it is only by a combined effort, by all of us on the ground, that this challenge can be met effectively&rdquo;.  If that is done I have no doubt that the problems of the homeless can be tackled effectively and the Minister, and all of us in this Dáil, will have something to be proud of before this Dáil comes to an end.</P>
    <P>We have ample experience of what has happened in other countries in relation to homeless persons.  We received statistics from England only two days ago. Because of the kind of law they have put in place the problem of homelessness is on the increase in England.  The problem of homelessness is on the increase in almost every country in the world at present and that is due to a combination of factors very much beyond our control. Part of the reason may well be that people are taken out of institutions before a proper system of community care has been put in place.  That is one reason you will find people sleeping in subways, in railway stations and in telephone kiosks around the cities of the world.  We are not as bad as that in Ireland.  We do not want to go in that direction.  Because we have the opportunity to put this legislation in place and to make it work, please God we will never arrive at that situation. These are the welcome aspects of this Bill and I have no doubt that the Minister is serious about making this Bill work and that he will take on board the amendments that have been put in place.</P>
    <P>That brings me back to my initial argument regarding the need for a proper White Paper on housing.  I gave one example already of a housing programme which was well-intentioned but had very bad spin-off effects.  There are a number of others I could mention that have been taken on board over the years.  Many new houses have been built thus creating new satellite towns to the neglect of inner city areas where the services were in place, where the physical fabric of a community was in place and where schools, libraries <Col N="1925" /> and all other ancillary facilities were available.  Yet, we let that part of our housing fabric deteriorate to the point where in many cases it has now become almost derelict and unoccupied.  That was bad and costly planning.  It has cost the taxpayers of this country a lot of money. In many cases it has not given a great return in terms of community satisfaction, happiness and neighbourliness in estates.  Certainly, it has not helped the vitality of the inner city, and that must be redressed.  Inner city development and urban renewal is an area into which resources will have to be put, and put very systematically, in our housing programme in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>Equally, there are areas in our housing programmes that never seem to be addressed fully in terms of eligibility for housing under local authority schemes. We have framed our policies around the belief that every family consists of two parents and three children and the model for housing has become the three-bedroomed house with all the other rooms stitched in.  For years and years single persons and childless couples have been left out of the housing programmes altogether.  No provision has been made for them and few places have been found for them in local authority housing schemes.  This cannot continue.  That is something that must be remedied and should be addressed in the context of a White Paper.</P>
    <P>There is also the problem of the elderly and the vulnerability of elderly people which was mentioned with great effect by Deputy Brennan.  That is something for which provision must be made in the context of future housing programmes.  One way or another we have an opportunity now to put together a comprehensive plan.  That must be put in the form of a White Paper so that we can ensure that programmes do not go off on a tangent in conflict with one another as happened so frequently in the past.  From here on, all our housing programmes must take place against a background of an overall view of where we ought to be going and in tune with a properly planned integrated and co-ordinated White Paper <Col N="1926" /> plan.  I should like to say to the Minister that before his term of office is up &mdash; and I hope that will not be for a long time, even though there were predictions made by Deputy Begley that he was taking to more exalted fields&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I can assure the Minister that with his talents there is no place that would bear greater fruit than to stay with housing and to provide for the young, the families, the old, the sick and the homeless and to put in place the kind of plan from which they would all benefit and which would lead to greater human happiness in families and greater community development.  That is a task that any Minister would relish and I have no doubt that he will.  There are a number of other points which need to be made.</P>
      <P>There are two final points I wish to make.  First, do not allow this opportunity to pass without putting an obligation on local authorities to house the homeless. That is the key to meeting all the Minister's objectives.  Second, put in place a White Paper setting out all our housing needs and the ways and means by which these needs can be met.  What is happening in a number of our housing estates leaves a great deal to be desired.  In many cases it is leading to a lack of confidence in the manner in which we manage our local authority housing estates.  I will give one example.  There are a large number of vacant houses which can be seen around the estates of our cities.  People look at these houses, potential rent earners, vacant week after week, month after month.  If they were in occupation moneys would be coming into the local authorities and with those moneys the local authorities would be in a position to carry out badly needed repairs.  It is a vicious circle.  The local authorities will argue that they do not have the money to carry out the repairs.  Because they do not have the money to carry out the repairs the houses are vacant and therefore no money is coming in.  I would ask the Minister to get some device to solve that problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1927" /> As a Cork Deputy I pay tribute to the Minister in that he has put up a good deal of additional money for the refurbishment of the system-built houses which were erected in the sixties as a crash programme to house a number of people.  That is much appreciated.  That programme is proceeding with great effect.  It will make a great difference to the housing needs of the people of Cork and to the general perception that people have of housing programmes, housing authorities and of Ministers in general. Perhaps the Minister could see his way to putting more money into accelerating that programme.  This is the kind of work that makes good economic sense.  The houses which are now being bricked up are being sought after and are occupied very quickly.  They are potential rent earners in the community.  As well as making good social and good community sense, that programme is also making a good deal of economic sense.  I pay tribute to the Minister for his contribution to that programme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisFoley" hpid="Mr. Foley Mr. Foley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foley</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to join with the previous speakers in congratulating the Minister on his excellent Bill.  It affords us an opportunity to discuss housing in this House.  At the outset, I wish to compliment the Minister on his new tenant purchase scheme which he introduced some months ago.  It is already proving to be a very attractive proposition throughout the country.  It gives most of our local authority tenants an opportunity for the first time, to purchase their house on a reasonable basis because the price will be based on market value. There are attractive discounts of up to 40 per cent for a house built in the last 10 years and 50 per cent prior to that.  He also mentioned remedial works, and this is very worthwhile.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For many years the local housing programme was directed at the provision of new accommodation with little if any attention being given to the need to modernise and improve the existing rented <Col N="1928" /> stock, and that affected most local authorities, in particular Kerry County Council. In recent years, however, the easing of the pressure on demand for new construction has allowed additional resources to be provided for improvements to the existing stock.  In this way the State's investment in local authority housing can be protected and the loss of dwellings through the rented housing stock can be prevented.  In 1988 the allocation for this scheme has again been increased.  It is now £10 million compared with an expenditure of £7 million in 1987.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for his programme regarding urban renewal which, again, will create worthwhile employment. Already in Tralee, my home town, we have a new conference centre which will improve and supplement the economy of Tralee and the surrounding area.  Many other developments are taking place under that urban renewal scheme.</P>
    <P>I would like to deal with homelessness, a problem generally hidden in Ireland. People who wander the streets seem to merge into the background.  I have often passed people, particularly in Dublin, who seem to be treated as if they are not there at all.  People who are obviously drunk, either slumped on steps or in a doorway, are ignored.  People who are badly dressed, who smell, who beg for the price of a pint or a cup of tea are usually not noticed at all.  When I talk to some of these people I find they are no different in their hopes and fears from anyone else except that their fears and disappointments far outweigh their hopes.  Give them a little respect and for a while that can make a world of difference.  There is usually no problem in thinking of something to say; all one needs to do is listen.</P>
    <P>Who listen on the streets?  Many of these people find coping very difficult. Many drink and may simply compound a psychiatric problem, depression or family problems.  Some have places to go to but cannot cope on their own or with their home environment.  They may have families who still care about them but who cannot cope with them.  Some may have families who do not care or who are <Col N="1929" /> embarrassed by them.  For somebody in psychiatric care without follow-up or home, a hostel may be the only place to go but it is no substitute for proper rehabilitation.  People who work in hostels are mainly volunteers not trained to deal with problems of alcoholism, family breakdown, pressure or bereavement.  A homeless person may have been in the armed forces and after years in an institutional system cannot cope with retirement on discharge.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that the basic response by local authorities to the needs of the homeless remains the direct provision of accommodation but there will always be a limit to the accommodation available to a local authority.  The powers of local authorities to deal with the homeless need, therefore, to be expanded so that the smaller local authorities in particular who have very limited housing and very few vacancies can meet the needs of the homeless.  I welcome the powers provided in section 10 of the Bill.  They include a new power for housing authorities to secure accommodation for a homeless person with a voluntary housing organisation and to pay that organisation in respect of that accommodation so provided. In addition, housing authorities will be able to provide assistance, including finance, to a homeless person in order that that person may secure accommodation. Finally, a housing authority will be able to rent accommodation or lodgings for a homeless person.</P>
    <P>I welcome section 5 of the Bill which will provide an updated basis for development of the voluntary housing movement which can play an important role in meeting social housing needs.  As in many other countries, voluntary housing was the first organised response here in the 19th century to the appalling housing conditions of the poor.  However, the scale of the housing problem facing this country in its early years was such that the State through the local authorities began to see a greater role in meeting social housing needs.  For many years the potential and the need for an additional arm of social housing were lost sight of in the mistaken belief that the State could solve <Col N="1930" /> all these housing problems.  There is no doubt that local authorities are playing a major role at this moment, but I ask the Minister to seek the co-operation of the various health boards who have to an extent been co-operative but now due to limited finance are not in the same position as they were heretofore.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Housing Bill, 1988, of which eight sections relate to the homeless. It is gratifying to see the vagrancy law repealed.  I know the Minister will see this Bill through.  I suggest to him that the definition of a homeless person in section 2 be widened to include people threatened with homelessness, people living in hostels, women facing violence in the home and travellers who cannot part legally.  I ask that in section 9 local authorities be required to make an assessment of the needs of the homeless within a year and thereafter annually.  I seek in section 10 that local authorities be not only empowered to help the homeless but be required, even compelled, to do so. Under this section a local authority may exercise their power while inquiries are being made as to whether a person is homeless.  This is weaker than in the 1985 Bill which required arrangements to be made during the interim period.</P>
    <P>All provision for the homeless should be of a minimum standard and responsibility for such should be vested in the local authorities who should report annually on their progress in housing the homeless.  I know the Minister will see these points.  He has concern for the homeless and for housing in general. Again, I congratulate him on the Bill and wish him every success with it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The first aspect of this Bill I want to comment on is the £5,000 surrender grant scheme that applied in respect of local authority houses and the apparent strange method by which we are conducting our business in this House through the Departments.  The Minister pointed out in his speech: &ldquo;Although now terminated, expenditure continues to arise under the £5,000 surrender grant scheme&rdquo;.  Later he said: &ldquo;These schemes are being given statutory backing by <Col N="1931" /> sections 3 and 4 of the Bill&rdquo;.  I would like to pose the question here, what exactly are we about?  We are in here today giving statutory backing to a scheme which applied for a considerable period and which has already terminated.  Now, when the scheme has terminated, at this stage, is the time that in this House we are giving statutory backing to the scheme.</P>
      <P>What are we about here?  The time to give statutory backing to a scheme is before it starts.  The scheme ought to be debated here in this House and approved by this House before the scheme comes in.  That is a reflection on the previous Coalition Government as well as on this Government; it is a reflection on our system.  For the life of me I do not understand how substantial sums of public funds have been paid out for the past couple of years without statutory backing. Who is paying out these moneys and on what basis are these moneys being paid out if there was no statutory backing for it?  Now, at the end of the day, at the end of the scheme, we find in a Bill a provision that statutory backing should be given for it.</P>
      <P>There is something radically wrong here.  I thought the Comptroller and Auditor General saw to it that moneys were not paid out unless there was statutory backing for it.  This is a very dangerous precedent and I wonder where else it may be repeated.  Is it the Sir Humphreys who are organising things on this basis of just shoving a scheme on ahead and never mind whether Dáil Éireann and Seanad Éireann give statutory backing to it or debate it?  Is that where the real Government is taking place?  That is dangerous in any democratic country and we should have greater clarification and amplification about it.  If that £5,000 surrender scheme had been debated in advance in this House it might not have been implemented at all.  Dáil Éireann when they teased it out might have come to a view about that scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not doubt that the Minister for the Environment of the day was well intentioned and meant well when he introduced the £5,000 surrender grant <Col N="1932" /> scheme, but I am not alone in saying, perhaps with the benefit of hindsight, what many independent observers have said, that it was not a good scheme at all in that it wreaked havoc in many local authority estates, certainly on the outskirts of Dublin in my constituency and, no doubt, in many others up and down the country.  No doubt it benefited a few individual people in their personal capacity, but we have to look at the social aspects of housing, which is the thrust of this Bill, to, see whether a scheme is a good one and worth while.</P>
    <P>The psychological effects on many of the tenants in local authority housing estates in my constituency were nothing short of disastrous because only those who were in employment could avail of the scheme.  Many of those who availed of the scheme left the area.  They were the people who were needed to organise activities in the estates and weld them into good and viable communities.  As a result of the scheme there has been a high concentration of unemployed people in such estates.  It is only now that many of those areas are beginning to recover from that body blow inflicted on them.  The scheme should never have been introduced and I regret that the House did not have an opportunity to debate it.  It is ridiculous to think that when the scheme is almost at an end the statutory backing is being sought for it in the House.</P>
    <P>I should like to comment on the new sales scheme.  The Minister has said that under this scheme local authority houses will be sold to tenants for the open market value.  I do not think that is right.  It is not a fair description of the scheme.  I should like to suggest some variations to the Minister.  Under the scheme the open market price will be determined, ultimately, by the local authority and that body will have the final say &mdash; in other words, it will not be the open market price but the price determined by the local authority.  We are talking about two different things.  What the Minister is doing is giving to local authorities the right to fix the price of the house.  The local authority will say to a tenant that the price they decide is the open market <Col N="1933" /> value and it will not do the tenant any good to disagree with it because a tenant will not have any opportunity to do anything about the price under the scheme. A tenant may submit a valuation from a valuer and the local authority may take that into account.  The local authority may refer the matter to the Commissioner of Valuations who may have something to say about it, but at the end of the day it will be the local authority who will decide on the price.  They may say to tenants &ldquo;That is the open market price and, whether it is or not, you can take it or leave it&rdquo;.  That is not right or fair.</P>
    <P>If the sale price is to be the open market value as decided by a local authority then a purchasing tenant who disagrees strongly with the price should be permitted to refer the matter to an independent arbitrator to decide between the open market value suggested by the tenant and the price fixed by the local authority.  When disputes in regard to price arise it is not left to one party or another to have the final say, an independent person is called in to fix the correct price.  That essential element is lacking in the Minister's scheme, but it is not too late to do something about it. There is no reason why we should not establish an independent arbitration procedure to decide on the price of houses in dispute.  If all else fails, the Minister should ask the Commissioner of Valuations, acting independently, to fix the open market value of houses in dispute.</P>
    <P>Some local authorities may have an inflated view of the market price and they may not take into account special factors that may apply to a particular region that would lead to a lowering of the price. Local authority houses in some areas are virtually unsaleable and if a purchaser could be found would command a low price; but I cannot see local authorities accepting such a price or taking relevant factors into consideration.  I can see them insisting on a price that will not bear any realistic relation to the open market value.  If we are to have sales based on an open market value the Minister should <Col N="1934" /> provide for appeals to an independent arbitrator.</P>
    <P>The system of qualification has some unfair elements about it.  A qualified person will be a tenant as at 1 January 1988.  Many people, after being years on local authority housing waiting lists, were allocated houses after 1 January.  It is unfair to disqualify such people.  The scheme will throw up many anomalies. People who bought their houses under previous schemes may have paid a price that bore no relation to the open market value of the house.  Many people signed up a couple of years ago to buy local authority houses for £30,000 or £35,000 and the market value of such houses today may be £15,000.  Under the new scheme identical houses will be sold off for £15,000, or a little more.  That will mean that some unfortunate families who bought their houses two years ago will have for the next 30 years to pay on a mortgage based on a purchase price of £30,000 or £35,000 while their next door neighbour who avails of the new scheme will be carrying a mortgage of £15,000 or £16,000.  That is not right and the Minister should not stand over it.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister to consider this and give relief to those unfortunate people who through no fault of their own find themselves in that unenviable position.  Provision ought to be made for those people to surrender their mortgage under the old scheme and, if they so wish, to purchase under the new scheme at the correct open market value of the house as independently fixed. Otherwise, I can see very considerable aggravation developing among people who find themselves in that kind of situation.</P>
    <P>Another problem will arise with the Minister's scheme.  The Minister provides that the local authority is to have no liability under this scheme to put the house in proper condition or to carry out any repairs to it before the sale goes through.  The purchase price will take account of the condition of the house as it is.  At first sight that might appear to be a very fair and reasonable proposition, but there is a difficulty.  Many of these <Col N="1935" /> houses have appreciable structural problems. It might be rotting windows, dampness, no adequate heating system, a substantial roof problem or a combination of problems and it would cost, say, £4,000 to put the house into a proper, liveable condition, fit for reasonable human habitation.  The Minister says &ldquo;That is alright.  We will reduce the price of the house for you by £4,000 to take account of the fact that those structural items need attention&rdquo;.  The problem is: how will the tenant purchaser in such a case get the £4,000 to carry out these structural works?  The local authority tenants who would be buying out their houses would not have the financial resources necessary to put the houses into proper structural condition.  There is a fairly large number of people in this category that I am talking about.  It will not be possible for the tenant to raise the £4,000 or £5,000 and therefore it means that, in effect, he will be buying a house that is inadequate and structurally unsatisfactory. It puts him in a very difficult and awkward position.  If he avails of the scheme he will find himself in a house for which he would need £5,000 to put into proper condition and he has no hope of raising that money to get the house into reasonable condition.  This is a real problem under the Minister's scheme and something ought to be done about it at this early stage.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to consider seriously that in a case where essential structural repairs are necessary to a house it should be possible to provide the amount required for that purpose as an additional loan apart from the loan for the actual house.  That money could be spent on putting the house into proper and reasonable condition.  Otherwise, such a tenant will be in an impossible situation.  He will be in an impossible situation even if he decides not to avail of the scheme because the local authorities, certainly in the Dublin area, have never been well geared to carry out major works of that nature and in the present situation are even less so.  It is no secret that the number of people employed by <Col N="1936" /> the corporation is reduced and reducing and that the resources available to the local authorities to carry our essential repairs, even on day-to-day matters, are reducing by the week.  A very small number of dedicated workers of the local authorities are doing wonderful work, and I pay tribute to them, but they are fighting off the tide of repairs which they cannot cope with because the necessary manpower and resources are not available to them.  The question of housing that needs structural work will have to be addressed if this scheme is to be a success. It will have to be addressed also in the case of people who do not take up the scheme.</P>
    <P>The interest rate proposed is 9¼ per cent.  That is too high.  Interest rates have come down appreciably since the scheme was first introduced.  A figure of 9¼ per cent is too high and the Minister should consider it in the light of interest rates as they are at present and as they are forecast.  That figure ought to be revised downwards.</P>
    <P>Local authority rents are far too high under the present schemes.  The Coalition Government, and it is no credit to them, so organised their affairs in their closing years that very substantial increases occurred in local authority rents.  The Fianna Fáil Party at the time involved themselves in very heavy criticism of the Government of the day for introducing these rent increases, which caused serious hardship for many people.  One would have thought that, given the first opportunity on taking office, they would have reversed that position to implement the criticisms they were heaping on the last Government.  But did they do anything like that?  No, it was quite the reverse.</P>

      <P>Yes, the whole subject of housing is in the Bill.  The Minister introduced the Bill by saying that this Housing Bill is a major social measure. This is a measure that deals with housing, with local authorities and with the broad <Col N="1937" /> general subject of housing and rents. What I am saying is well within the ambit of the Bill.</P>

      <P>Did the Fianna Fáil Government do what they preached when in Opposition?  Did they tackle this question of local authority rents which had been increased in many cases by 100 per cent or more?  Not at all.  They quite happily, and with some enthusiasm, not only adopted and took under their own wing the increase in rent that had taken place at that time but brought in their own further rent increase of £1.50 a week.  It is interesting to note that there has not been much publicity about that increase.  There was plenty of agitation about the previous one.  The adoption of the Coalition's rent increase, coupled with the Fianna Fáil one on top of that, has made matters extremely difficult for many local authority tenants.  I put forward the general proposition that the methods of assessment and the rents in general for local authority tenants are too high.  The question of a reduction in those rents should be seriously considered by the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the strange ironies in the field of rents in general, not only local authority rents although it applies there also, is evident when one compares the position of tenants paying rent with that of purchasers of houses.  Purchasers of houses find themselves in a much more favourable position from an income tax point of view.  One of the strange anomalies that has never been addressed realistically is that people who make mortgage repayments when purchasing their houses are allowed income tax relief on the interest on the repayments whereas local authority tenants and indeed any other tenants, with perhaps one or two minor exceptions, get no such concession. Local authority tenants should be given some income tax concession on the rents they pay.  Many local authority <Col N="1938" /> tenants pay quite high rents.  It is totally unfair that those rents should have no income tax allowance whatsoever whereas a person buying his house, presumably in a stronger financial position and who will own his house at the end of the day, is favoured with an income tax concession.  This is one of those strange anomalies in our system under which the strong are favoured and the weak are penalised.</P>
    <P>I heard Deputy Gregory talking about Dublin Corporation and saying they were doing a fine job as a housing authority.  They certainly do a fine job in many respects, but I must highlight some of their shortcomings as a housing authority.  It is no secret that Dublin Corporation are a major housing developer in County Dublin, but I am afraid their record in County Dublin has not been as good as it appears to be in their functional area of Dublin city.  When they build houses in County Dublin it appears their responsibility ends there.  They build the houses, move the people from central Dublin to Tallaght, Clondalkin and places like that, and that is it.  They have no further responsibility for those people. I believe their obligation should go further. They should have, and should accept, an obligation to provide the amenities in these outlying areas &mdash; community halls, meeting rooms and so on. When we approach Dublin Corporation in this respect they are not quick to accept responsibility for the provision of these amenities.  I know their resources have been cut back, like everybody else's, and that at the end of the day the responsibility falls on the Minister.  But, as I said, when the corporation provide so many local authority houses in County Dublin they should be involved with the county council to a greater extent in providing basic facilities than they have done heretofore.</P>
    <P>Previous speakers referred to the level of vacant houses.  That has been a problem: but it is a lessening problem, in part due to the economic policies of this Government which are advising so many <Col N="1939" /> people to leave our shores.  If employment was provided for these people they would be occupying those houses; but, regrettably, we see no sign of that.  Therefore, let us not wonder why we have the problem of vacant houses.</P>
    <P>I want to say a brief word about travellers. We hear a lot of talk about the resettlement of travellers by local authorities, and excellent work has been done in many areas towards that end, but it is very far from adequate.  My feeling is that there is a lack of real will on the part of many local authorities to tackle effectively the problem of providing appropriate accommodation for travellers &mdash; be they hard stands to start with or group housing or whatever at a later stage.  Since I first became involved in political life in 1969 I have watched this problem and noticed that not much change has occurred in all that time.</P>
    <P>For example, in the Dublin County Council area there are many travellers on unauthorised sites.  The county council brought in a plan which they adopted before the last local election.  This plan would have provided a number of sites and made appreciable inroads into the problem; but, unfortunately, after the local elections that policy was reversed under some hare brained scheme introduced by the Fianna Fáil members on Dublin County Council saying that on every estate they would have a site for four or five travelling families.</P>
    <P>The Minister for the Environment will have to take a much more interventionist role in providing much-needed housing accommodation and stands for the travelling community.  I do not think at this stage we can leave it solely within the realm of the local authorities.  That has been tried and has been only a partial success.  Much more needs to be done and an intervention at ministerial or Government level is essential if we are to make any serious and realistic inroads into solving this very human problem.</P>

      <P>I realise time is at a premium but a comment by Deputy Foley prompted me to come into the Chamber to contribute to this debate.  He congratulated the Minister for the trojan work he has done by way of capital allocation for housing in various parts of County Kerry.  I wonder if I am living in the same country as Deputy Foley when it comes to capital allocations for housing, because in County Laois there will be no local authority housing starts in 1988. This is very regrettable when one considers the trojan work which has been done by all Governments in tackling the very lengthy housing lists over the past ten or 15 years.  It is sad that there will be no new starts this year.</P>
      <P>All sides of the House are prepared to give this Bill a cautious welcome, because it contains a number of positive approaches towards solving our housing problems.  I am concerned that the Bill does not go far enough in that it does not place an obligation on local authorities to accommodate people who are in desperate need of housing.  There are a number of questions we must put to the Minister.  How does he propose to deal with a local authority who say they cannot house the homeless, or who decide that there is not an onus on them to tackle this problem?  In my view, the Bill lacks teeth because it does not oblige local authorities to take action in this area. Perhaps we might consider addressing this problem on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over the years it appears the policy in the Department has been that we should build, build and build again, and look after our housing stock.  Success was based on the number of houses built in any area.  It is time for us to look at the needs of the community rather than think in terms of housing numbers.  I would like to see greater emphasis on maisonettes in housing estates or on the periphery of local authority housing estate.  There is no need for a single person or a married couple without a family to be given a local authority house with three or four bedrooms.  That is a waste and everyone will agree this aspect must be tackled. <Col N="1941" /> The social acceptability of the maisonette, the small one-bedroomed house, is that it is more than sufficient to meet the needs of many people in our community.</P>
    <P>In times of stringent cutbacks, greater emphasis must be placed on the concept of the rural cottage.  Again, in capital allocations for housing, where they have not been drastically cut, we see emphasis being placed on urban housing to such an extent that rural cottages are becoming a thing of the past.  In my own constituency people have been on housing lists for rural cottages for something like eight or nine years.  The Minister, and certainly the junior Minister who represents the same area, understand this problem.  I would ask them to take the necessary action.</P>
    <P>The Minister made reference to the need to tackle the problem of itinerants. Time will not permit me to elaborate on that, but I hope on Committee Stage we will be able to tease out the various problems.  There are certain difficulties in so far as the courts will not take action to move on itinerants from parking in an arbitrary manner on the roadside.  They have put the onus firmly back on the Government.  I would like greater moves made towards expanding the number of halting sites and, indeed, housing facilities for the itinerants, that local authorities could work in tandem with the social facilities available through the health boards, as mentioned by the Minister.</P>
    <P>It is a question of funding.  If we must accept the fact that we cannot possibly have the same amount of funding this year and next year as in the past, I should like greater use made of the paltry resources in the Department of the Environment to ensure that there will be no waste.  We must look at the amount of money spent by local authorities on repairs.  A move could be made to take out of the ambit of the local authority responsibility for each and every item of repair.  From that point of view, the tenant purchase scheme is a good one.  It is just a matter of monitoring how many tenants will take advantage of that <Col N="1942" /> scheme.  I am sorry that I have not sufficient time to go into the Bill in greater detail.  I am prepared to give it a cautious welcome and hope the Minister will address at the earliest opportunity the very real problems that exist.</P>

      <P>First, I should like to thank all the Members who contributed to this debate on Second Stage for the considered way in which they approached the subject.  They raised so many issues it would be impossible to deal even with a minimum number in the time available to me.  At the same time, I should like to make reference to some of the matters raised and perhaps specific items can be dealt with on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>The welcome has been general and that is appreciated by me considering that it has taken quite some time for this legislation to come before the House.  That is a good Bill.  It deals effectively with many of the problems that have arisen in so far as matters related to housing are concerned. It also deals with many items other than homelessness.  Many of those items were neglected on Second Stage because the matter of greatest concern to those who contributed was the question of homelessness.  However, it must be remembered that other matters are dealt with also and are of considerable importance in the whole question of housing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill takes note of the changes that have occurred in housing circumstances. We have changes in population, in family structures, in social and economic structures and they must be reflected in the way in which housing legislation is contemplated. We also must take due notice of the fact that there is a large diminution in the demand for housing.  It is incumbent upon me, as Minister, to see to it that we make the most efficient use of our existing housing stock and that is what is proposed.  That is why increased moneys are being made available in support of the remedial schemes that have been applied to many of the older blocks of apartments and some of the low-cost housing that was started many years ago and now needs to have much money spent <Col N="1943" /> on it to bring it back to a habitable condition.</P>
    <P>We will make more efficient use of the existing housing stock.  I am a great believer in having new ideas with regard to the design of housing schemes and planning for the special needs of special types of people and special groups in society.  I make no apology at all for the termination of some of the bad schemes which were in place when I came into office.  Some of them have been referred to by some Deputies who are shedding no tears for the termination.  Some new items have been introduced which have helped out enormously, for instance, new arrangements for SDA funding and, in particular, the new tenant purchase scheme which has received a general welcome from everybody who spoke about it here.</P>
    <P>Many suggestions were made and it appears there will be some amendments tabled concerning matters raised on the Bill.  I shall give consideration to any amendments that are put down and I welcome the input of any Deputy who feels it necessary to put such amendments down for discussion at a later stage.</P>
    <P>I welcome the broad support that Deputy Boland gave to this legislation and to the basic thrust of the Government's approach to the problem of homelessness. That is not the only item dealt with in this legislation, but it seems to have triggered off most of the comments at this stage.  Deputy Boland was quite generous in his welcome for the additional resources we have been able to commit to the provision of voluntary housing accommodation for the homeless. I was taken by the Deputy's honesty in recognising the difficulties posed by a statutory obligation such as contained in the 1985 Bill.  He expressed regret that in his period of office more resources could not have been channelled to the voluntary housing organisations, as the Government are now doing.  Many references were made to the question of the statutory obligation and if I get an opportunity I shall deal with that at <Col N="1944" /> greater length, but I must deal with it on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>We should finally put to bed the whole question of the background developments regarding the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill of 1985.  On 19 March, 1983 Senator Brendan Ryan introduced his Bill which included a statutory obligation on housing authorities to secure accommodation for homeless persons and persons threatened with homelessness. I was taken by Deputy Quinn's long contribution on Second Stage and his discreet and muted reference to the shambles in the Seanad during the debate on the legislation introduced by Senator Ryan.  It will be remembered that on 9 November 1983 quite some time after Senator Brendan Ryan introduced the Bill in the Seanad, the Government decided to oppose its Second Reading, tabling an amendment to Senator Ryan's motion.  The Government amendment at that time could not be moved because the Labour Party refused to support it and the then Minister of State, Deputy Quinn, gave an undertaking that he would introduce as soon as possible legislation to define clearly the question of homelessness and what constituted being homeless.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan's Bill, even though it was unacceptable to the Government, could not be defeated in the Seanad and it passed Second Stage in July 1985, some time after its introduction.  The then Minister for the Environment &mdash; Deputy Kavanagh, a party colleague of Deputy Quinn &mdash; subsequently introduced a Housing Bill in 1985, about two years after it had been promised in the Seanad by Deputy Quinn.  The Second Stage debate began in December 1985 and resumed in January 1986.  It finally passed Second Stage in November 1986.  This is the legislation which had been talked about years before that.  There was Labour Party involvement in Government, Labour Party spokesmen on housing and a Labour Party Minister for the Environment and they failed to get the matter dealt with.</P>

      <P>The Bill lapsed on the dissolution of the 24th Dáil without reaching Committee Stage.  Therefore, it ill behoves Deputy Quinn to criticise as inadequate the serious and positive approach of this Government to the problems of the homeless when the Government on whose behalf he professed to give this undertaking in the Seanad so long ago failed to have their own Bill enacted in the period between the date of its undertaking and the dissolution of the Dáil in January 1987.  Deputy Quinn makes a good case when arguing on the Opposition benches, but he had a great chance to do something when he was dealing with this matter.  He did not even have to deal with a partner in Government from the other side; he could have dealt with his own party, a member of which was in the position which I now hold.  But, collectively, they failed to deliver the goods on something about which they had been preaching far too much.  I have yet to hear any explanation from Deputy Quinn as to why the Bill promised in 1983 and published in 1985 could not have been enacted before 1987. His contribution to the Bill was predictable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It might be helpful to sketch briefly, for the benefit of some Deputies, the more enlightened statistics on local authority housing.  I had not intended to do this but I must reply to Deputy Taylor and others.  Rental income in 1987 was estimated at £51 million from local authority lettings or just 70 per cent of the cost of maintenance and management of our rented housing stock.  The average rent of local authority dwellings is just over £8 per week.  The cost of providing a new local authority dwelling is somewhere between £71 and £75 per week.  I take some exception to Deputy Taylor casting aspersions on the Government by saying that there is not enough money for maintenance and so on when he should recognise that there was a shortfall last year, between rental, maintenance and management expenses, of £32 million.  At the end of last year some 1,700 local authority houses were vacant.  I accept that some vacancies are obviously <Col N="1946" /> unavoidable; and many Deputies will know from their own experience that the problem of vacant and vandalised local authority houses has increased in recent years.  Dublin Corporation have about 650 dwellings which they regard as unlettable due to vandalism.</P>
    <P>The number of unoccupied dwellings and those vandalised over the past number of years should be a matter of considerable concern.  There is no argument &mdash; except in very special cases of special categories in special locations &mdash; for spending large sums of money building new schemes when there are so many unoccupied houses available.  I request general support in the House for a way of dealing with that before we build new housing schemes and leave the old houses to be vandalised.  That is not the way forward.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>There are many provisions in the legislation dealing with homelessness. I will refer to them now because, if I do not, it will be said that I dodged the issue.  Section 2 says that a person shall be regarded by a housing authority as being homeless for the purposes of this Act if there is no accommodation available which, in the opinion of the authority, he, together with any other person who normally resides with him or who might reasonably be expected to reside with him, can reasonably occupy or remain in occupation of, or if he is living in a hospital, county home, night shelter or other such institution and is so living because he has no accommodation of the kind referred to in paragraph (a), and the is, in the opinion of the authority, unable to provide accommodation from his own resources.</P>
      <P>Simon hostels are regarded as night shelters and there is no difficulty in regard to the definition.  It can certainly be expanded, but I have gone as far as it could be reasonably expected of me, in so far as the resources available to me are concerned, in dealing with the question of homelessness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under section 9 homeless persons will <Col N="1947" /> have to be specifically taken into account in assessing housing needs.  This is a big advance and should be welcomed here. An assessment will have to be carried out within one year of the commencement of the legislation and further assessments will be on the direction of the Minister. There are certain elements in the legislation where the Minister can, where he feels that a local authority is not complying with the word or the spirit of this legislation, step in and direct them accordingly.  That will apply to other Ministers for the Environment when I am long gone.  The power is being put in to enable any Minister to move in a particular direction if he is not satisfied that fair play is being given to the homeless in so far as the sections of the Bill are concerned.</P>
    <P>Housing authorities will have to give notice of the making of an assessment to adjoining housing authorities, health boards and bodies concerned with the provision of accommodation, shelter or welfare.  I regard that as important, it was left out of housing legislation in the past and there did not seem to be co-ordination between the other agencies such as health boards and so on.  This will enable those bodies to bring to the attention of the housing authority the person in need of housing accommodation and he will then be considered for inclusion in the assessment.  That is a vital element of this legislation.  Section 10 goes further because it will empower housing authorities to make arrangements with voluntary bodies for the provision of accommodation for homeless persons and to provide assistance, including financial assistance, to homeless persons. If necessary, they can rent accommodation, arrange lodgings or contribute to the cost of such accommodation or lodgings.  I have gone quite some distance &mdash; perhaps even further than what was contemplated on a previous occasion &mdash; to take on board all the possibilities where local authorities might need to activate themselves to deal with instances of homelessness.</P>
    <P>There is a provision for the recoupment <Col N="1948" /> of all or part of housing authority expenses under section 10 and a provision of £400,000 has been made available this year to cater for that purpose in 1988.  I have provided money to deal with every single element of housing that I contemplated or undertook since I became Minister.  The money element was always talked about and money was always provided, as it is under the provisions of section 10 of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Under section 11 housing authorities will be empowered to set aside some of their accommodation for homeless persons. As far as I am concerned, this is a big breakthrough and this provision is being specifically introduced so as to ensure that local authorities cannot dodge their responsibilities in dealing with the homeless.  They will have to set aside some of their accommodation for homeless persons.  Once again, if the Minister is not satisfied that the local authorities are not taking their responsibilities seriously in this regard he can direct a housing authority to amend their scheme.  First of all, they will have to set aside some of their accommodation for homeless persons and if they are not providing accommodation from their available housing stock the Minister can direct them to amend their scheme.  This power could be used to ensure that a local authority makes adequate provision for the homeless.</P>
    <P>I regret that I cannot spend more time in dealing with this legislation.  It is fundamental legislation and there is some fundamental thinking behind it.  I would have liked to have had the opportunity to put on record the reason why I cannot recommend a statutory obligation being put on the local authorities.  I do not believe that it is the right way in which to proceed.  A very solid and convincing case could be made in support of my position and perhaps I will get the opportunity on Committee Stage to do so.</P>

      <P>First of all, I would like to say that we have no objections to amendments Nos. 1 and 3 being discussed together.  Can the Minister of State advise the House why the definition of &ldquo;aerodrome&rdquo; is being deleted from the Bill and indeed why the definition of &ldquo;policy of insurance&rdquo; is being deleted?  Can the Minister of State tell us what the definition of &ldquo;aerodrome&rdquo; is now going to be? <Col N="1952" /> I am not too worried about the definition of &ldquo;policy of insurance&rdquo; as that stands for itself and we can find definitions elsewhere.

    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment is designed to correct a drafting flaw in the Bill.  It deletes the special definition of &ldquo;aerodrome&rdquo; from section 2 because that definition conflicts with the definition of &ldquo;aerodrome&rdquo; in the Air Navigation and Transport Act, 1936, namely, any definite and limited area, including water, intended to be used wholly or in part for or in connection with the landing or departure of aircraft.  That definition applies for the purposes of all Air Navigation and Transport Acts, 1936 to 1986, and of this Bill.  This Bill and those Acts are to be construed together as one Act as provided for in section 1 (3) of the Bill. The intention behind the special definition of &ldquo;aerodrome&rdquo; in section 2 of the Bill was to confine the application or provisions of the Bill to Irish civil aerodromes and so exclude its application to Irish military aerodromes.  The intention is best served by the new section 5 which is being proposed for insertion in Part II of the Bill by way of a separate Committee Stage amendment.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister of State for his reply.  Perhaps at a later stage following consultation with his advisers he could come back and answer that query.  Is the Minister of State satisfied that the definition of &ldquo;aircraft&rdquo; in the 1936 Act is sufficiently wide to cover helicopters?  My understanding is that the definition in the 1936 Act is more restricted and narrower.  Can the Minister of State tell us whether all forms of aeronautical craft are covered by the definition of &ldquo;aircraft&rdquo; as contained in the 1936 Act, such as gliders, hand gliders, helicopters and so on, and that the definition is not confined to &ldquo;aeroplane&rdquo;?  That is one aspect of the definition contained in the 1936 Act which concerns me and I ask <Col N="1953" /> the Minister of State to tell us whether he has considered it.</P>

      <P>There is now developing in the vicinity of the city, along the Liffey bank, a small area designated for the purpose of helicopter landings.  This follows from the debate on the definition of &ldquo;aerodrome&rdquo;.  We are now aware that helicopters are more prolific and their usage more frequent around the city. <Col N="1955" /> They are capable of landing often within the perimeters of factory premises, at some people's homes, on their lands but, more particularly, in public areas such as those along the banks of the Liffey.  Is the Minister happy that the definition of &ldquo;aircraft&rdquo; in the 1936 Act is sufficiently wide to include helicopters?  If so, then by definition would an &ldquo;aerodrome&rdquo; include public areas &mdash; I know there is one if not two &mdash; along the banks of the Liffey?  I know it is envisaged that in time there will be a heliport facility at the Custom House Docks site.  Will such areas be covered by the legislation and its requirements? Will the Minister have control over the regulation of their safety?  Furthermore, will the provisions of the legislation have any control over the facilities available on privately-owned lands?  Such facilities are not confined to helicopters. I understand that many land or factory owners have private airstrips to facilitate the landing of aircraft, be they aeroplanes or helicopters.  I am interested to ascertain whether under the provisions of this Bill the Minister would have authority to control and regulate traffic to and from such areas and to stipulate the safety regulations to be complied with?</P>

      <P>As I see it, there are two definitions of usage or status that <Col N="1956" /> can be applied to airstrips, aerodromes, heliports or whatever, ones to which the public would have access.  For example, Weston is one that immediately springs to mind &mdash; an aerodrome that is busier <i>vis-à-vis</i> its daily traffic than is Cork Airport. For that reason the provisions of this Bill are welcome.  It is quite clear that the provisions of this Bill are designed primarily to deal with the development of the commercial-type aerodrome, airport or heliport.  I am interested to ascertain the position <i>vis-à-vis</i> the increasing number of exclusively privately-owned facilities.  It is a matter of public knowledge, for example, that many of our better equipped stud farms incorporate an airstrip or heliport facilities.  Ostensibly they are used exclusively by their private owners.  I want to ascertain whether they will be subject to the provisions of the law and regulations as defined by the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am somewhat worried about the definition of &ldquo;aerodrome&rdquo; used here in the sense that it is almost a circular definition.  For example, an &ldquo;aerodrome&rdquo; means something to which this Act applies.  One then asks: what does this Act apply to?  The answer is: it applies to an &ldquo;aerodrome&rdquo;.  What is an &ldquo;aerodrome&rdquo;? The answer is: whatever this Act applies to.  In fact, there is no definition of an &ldquo;aerodrome&rdquo;, as far as I can ascertain, in the Bill except that it says in section 2:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1957" />&ldquo;aerodrome&rdquo; means any aerodrome to which the licensing or authorisation requirements of the Air Navigation and Transport Acts, 1936 to 1986, apply...</P>
    <P>It appears to me that if one wants a proper definition one should say: an &ldquo;aerodrome&rdquo; means a place where aeroplanes or other forms of transportation by air land and take off, as are specified under this Act from time to time, or whatever.  There is no actual definition at all of &ldquo;aerodrome&rdquo; in the Bill because the reference, in lines 4 to 7, inclusive, on page 5 does not really constitute a definition of &ldquo;aerodrome&rdquo;.  That merely refers one to the relevant Acts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 5, before section 5, but in Part II, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;5.&mdash;This Part applies to aerodromes other than aerodromes under the control of the Minister for Defence.&rdquo;. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>We are dealing with amendment No. 3 in the Minister's name <Col N="1960" /> which proposes to insert a new section in the Bill.  The amendment states:</P>
      <P>This Part applies to aerodromes other than aerodromes under the control of the Minister for Defence.</P>
      <P>I should like to hear the views of the Minister and the other Deputies in the House on this amendment.  Amendments Nos. 6, 7, 8 and 9 are in some ways related to amendment No. 3.  The potential strategic importance of many of our civil aerodromes must be considered by us when we are passing legislation to regulate their future control.  Because we are a neutral nation we must be in a position if it is ever necessary to actively defend that neutrality by ensuring that none of our airports or other facilities are made available or usable by an alien invading force.  One may think this is all very much by the way but if one looks at the position of active neutral nations in Europe such as Switzerland one can see that they take an active consideration and interest in ensuring that all of their ports, airports and other facilities are defendable or can be made unusable at very short notice.</P>
      <P>In this Bill the Minister is taking a step away from having any say or control over aerodromes which are currently used by the Department of Defence.  I anticipate that the answer to this is that there would be a conflict of interest and that those aerodromes in the control of the military are the property and responsibility of the Minister for Defence.  I should like to hear from the Minister why he thinks his Department should not have a say in the regulations on the safety, control and security of these facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Workers' Party take the view that in regulating our civil facilities a dimension of defence must be included.  For example, it might be security in terms of erecting a perimeter fence to keep out wandering cattle so that aircraft or humans are not interfered with or endangered. We must look at the regulation of these facilities on a national basis and towards a specific end.  I believe that the end is one of active neutrality and being in a position to defend that.  The most <Col N="1961" /> effective way we, as a small nation, can defend that neutrality against incursion is to make our facilities, including military facilities, unusable.</P>
    <P>I am not happy that the Department and the Minister in promoting this Bill are standing away from regulating or having any say or involvement in the facilities that are under military control and authority. I should like the Minister to tell us why that decision is being adopted.</P>
    <P>The other point I wish to make in relation to the definition of &ldquo;State&rdquo; has been referred to briefly. The Minister referred to the legislation covering &ldquo;State aerodromes&rdquo; and I understand he was talking about State civil aerodromes. Further on the Bill refers to &ldquo;State aircraft&rdquo; and here I believe the Bill is addressing State military aircraft.  I would be concerned about that because other craft do not fall into the category of either State military aircraft or State civil aircraft. I am anxious to know how they are to be regulated and what functions the Minister envisages he and his Department will have in regard to them.  I mention those now because they will tie into later remarks.  I am not entirely happy about this comprehensive useful legislation not being made applicable to militarily-run or owned aerodrome facilities. I would like to have the Minister's reasons.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason for the inclusion of this new section arose during Second Stage debate here and in the Seanad.  The purpose is to specifically exclude aerodromes under the control of the Minister for Defence, because the Minister for Defence has responsibilities in relation to defence matters, including military facilities.  There is no justification for involving the Minister for Tourism and Transport in defence and security. Deputy McCartan at the beginning of his contribution anticipated some of the sections and amendments further on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1962" /> This new section is to differentiate between the responsibilities of the Minister for Defence relating to security and defence and the responsibilities of the Minister for Transport and Tourism.</P>

      <P>This amendment relates to aerodromes that come under the control of the Minister for Defence. As I understand it, the only other Minister who has control over aerodromes and flights to and from aerodromes, is the Minister for Tourism and Transport. Is that correct?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason I raised this is because this relates to helicopter services to offshore installations, and the State agency Eolas are required under section 2 of the Irish offshore installation licensing terms on behalf of the Department of Energy to inform operators who come into this country of the services available for servicing offshore installations. In a letter to me they have confirmed that the Department of Communications confirmed to them that two helicopter companies had licences with class C unrestricted authorisation to service offshore installations.  Will the Minister comment on that?  The letter from Eolas confirmed to me that the two helicopter companies are Irish Helicopters and Celtic Helicopters and that Celtic Helicopters were given authorisation to service offshore installations, as far as Eolas are concerned, on 29 February last.  On the other hand, a reply from the Minister for Tourism and Transport in March, which is a month after the Eolas letter, confirms specifically that the holder, meaning Celtic Helicopters, were not permitted to perform offshore services to offshore installations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister can see the degree of confusion there.  I would like clarification as to whether the Department of Communications have any involvement in issuing licences.  Why is it that Eolas are representing Celtic Helicopters as having class C unrestricted authorisation to service offshore installations, and a month <Col N="1963" /> after confirming that in writing to me, the Minister in reply to a question confirmed that they were specifically not licensed to service offshore installations?</P>

      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 5 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>This section enables the Minister to force someone running an aerodrome to comply with requirements with regard to public order and security and also with regard to the security and safety of the aerodrome and the security and safety of persons using that aerodrome, and the Minister may give directions. I take it that these directions would have to be complied with at the expense of the person running the aerodrome and that there would be no question of the <Col N="1964" /> State contributing to the cost of the requirements laid down.</P>
      <P>I recognise that in the final analysis there must be power for the State to prevent aerodromes being places of public disorder or places where there is a potential threat to order and to the defence of the State.  These are necessarily subjective terms.  What constitutes public order is not defined in any way in the Bill and I do not expect that it should be but given that the Minister is taking power to set requirements for those running private aerodromes by imposing excessive requirements which have to be complied with at the expense of the person running the aerodrome, he could essentially close them down if he wanted to.  There is no requirement that the Minister be consistent in the requirements he imposes on one aerodrome as against another.  If the Minister wished or was malicious enough, he could apply more severe requirements on one aerodrome than on another.  This could have the effect of closing it down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I accept that the Minister must have powers with regard to the security and safety of the aerodrome and the security and safety of persons and aircraft using that aerodrome, I question whether he should also have power to impose requirements with regard to public order and security which are separate and in addition to the security and safety of the aerodrome itself, or the security and safety of persons and aircraft using that aerodrome.  General public order and security is a separate ground on which the Minister can impose requirements, quite apart from the safety of the aerodrome itself and of those using it.  The question arises, why is that necessary? In what circumstances does the Minister envisage that would be used?  What does it mean?  Does it mean for the purpose of defence that the Minister would wish to require people to have methods quickly available to blow up the runway at short notice if there was a danger of somebody using it for a hostile purpose?  Does it mean simply putting wire fencing around the aerodrome to prevent people getting in and having unauthorised parties in the <Col N="1965" /> vicinity where the aircraft are landing? What does the Minister envisage?</P>
    <P>The Minister has excluded the aerodromes which are being used by the Defence Forces on the grounds that, as he said, he is the Minister for Tourism and Transport and they would involve the Minister for Defence.  If that is the case, he is not the Minister responsible for public order and security and yet he is taking powers to close down aerodromes on grounds of public order and security.  There should be some system whereby the Minister for Justice, who is responsible for public order and security, should be involved.  If that is the ground that is being used to certify in some fashion that such a requirement is necessary, then it should not be a matter for one Minister to make such an order.</P>
    <P>Under section 3, I take it that that order would apply straightaway without there being any discussion in the Dáil. It could be imposed straightaway by a Minister.  If you close down an aerodrome for 21 sitting days you may as well close it down forever because the losses that would be incurred in that period would be such as to stop the aerodrome being a commercial enterprise.  Those who presumably want to see private money involved in the building and operation of aerodromes &mdash; that seems to be the policy of the present and previous Governments &mdash; should be given some assurances that this section regarding public order will be used in a predictable fashion and not capriciously.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to Deputy Bruton's query, I should point out that in these matters the Minister is always guided by the national civil aviation security committee.  He is right when he says the Department of Tourism and Transport are not responsible for security. The Minister has available to him the national civil aviation security committee whose advice he would seek in such matters as those raised by Deputy Bruton.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not an answer to my question.  I thought I had explained it but I will try again.  There are two <Col N="1966" /> grounds under this section whereby duties are imposed on those running aerodromes: first, to comply with the requirements for the security and the safety of the aerodrome itself and those using it and, secondly, requirements of public order and security in general; in other words, separate from the running of the aerodrome.  That opens a very wide field which would be outside the remit even of the committee to which the Minister has referred.  They are only concerned with the second part of the clause which is the safety of the aerodrome and those using it.  The other issue of more general public order and security is a matter for the Minister for Justice.</P>
      <P>I would have thought it might be more appropriate to redraft the section to read: &ldquo;requirements of (a) public order and security after consultation with the Minister for Justice and (b) of the security and safety of the aerodrome and the security and safety of persons and aircraft using that aerodrome&rdquo;.  The latter is one in which the Minister is the competent Minister without any doubt but the former, relating to the public order and security in the general sense, as distinct from that relating solely to aerodromes and aircraft and users thereof, is a matter for the Minister for Justice.  This is to provide a greater degree of clarity that this section would not be used other than in a proper fashion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Transport and Tourism authorises licences.  He has the responsibility to ensure that aerodromes operate properly at all times, particularly as regards security and safety.  I would like to point out &mdash; and I mentioned this in my earlier reply &mdash; that the national civil aviation security committee which advises the Government on civil aviation security is chaired by a senior official of the Department of Tourism and Transport.  The committee's terms of reference are to advise the Government and the civil aviation industry on security policy for civil aviation, to recommend and review the effectiveness of security measures and to provide for co-ordination of the various interests <Col N="1967" /> involved.  Representation on the committee include as well as other representatives from the Department of Tourism and Transport, representatives of the Departments of Foreign Affairs, Justice and Defence, the Garda Síochána, the Defence Forces, Aer Lingus, Aer Rianta and the Irish Airline Pilots Association.  That committee is very wide in its membership and the terms of reference are sufficiently broad to advise the Minister on the security and safety of aerodromes.  On that account I do not consider it necessary to include any more in section 6 than what is already there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a case of the Minister taking more powers than he needs.  It seems to me that it would be sufficient to impose requirements on these aerodromes in respect of the safety and security of the aerodrome itself and of those using it.  Why is he taking powers in regard to general public order?  What guarantee is there that these powers cannot be abused in a discriminatory fashion, given that the Minister might like one operator more or less than he likes another and he could impose more requirements on the one he did not like than on the other?</P>
      <P>There should be a reference in the section to say that these requirements shall be imposed in a uniform way as between different categories or types or individual aerodromes rather than in a discriminatory fashion.  I think also the committee to which the Minister refers, if it is to take those type of decisions should contain representation from the operators of the aerodromes.  Why have the Irish Airline Pilots Association, which is a private body, been represented on this committee and involved in these decisions if the people on whom the requirements will be imposed, that is, those running the aerodromes, are not represented on the committee?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept that section 6 should have anything more in it than what is already there.  If it was required we would have had an amendment down. <Col N="1968" /> I had hoped my elaboration of the security committee, and those represented on that committee, would allay any fears that there would be more favourable consideration shown to any one operator more than the other.  The committee that advise on the national civil aviation security are sufficiently broad to ensure that the same criteria would be used for each operator and I do not see any need&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's contention was that the Minister, and he alone, decides on aspects in relation to the security and safety of aerodromes.  I am pointing out that the Minister has available to him the civil aviation committee who advise him on matters of security at aerodromes. The Deputy mentioned in his last contribution the question of local security committees.  Of course local security committees work at all airports through which international, regular air services operate, namely, the airports of Dublin, Shannon, Connacht, Waterford and Carrickfin.  The local security committees report to the national committee on their deliberations and the standards they wish to ensure.  Is the Deputy still not satisfied that he is adequately empowered&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to prolong the agony.  I would prefer if public order and security matters were done after consultation with the Minister for Justice who should be mentioned in this and that the other aspects of security and safety of the aerodrome itself should be clearly the responsibility of the Minister himself or the Minister of State.  Some reference should be made here to the requirements being as uniform as may be reasonable in their application to different aerodromes. Obviously, the Minister must have a final degree of freedom, if he feels one aerodrome is more prone to public order problems than another, to impose greater requirements there, but some reference to uniformity of treatment in the <Col N="1969" /> section with a sort of let-out phrase for exceptional cases would be useful in removing any cause for concern that the section might be used in a discriminatory way.  Would the Minister be prepared to look at that between now and Report Stage?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>I have to reject the implication that the Minister would act in the manner the Deputy suggests.  There is no experience as far as I am aware, and hope the Deputy has no such experience, of the Minister acting in the manner he is suggesting.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry.  The Minister must recognise that the function of the Oireachtas is to frame legislation which removes any temptation or opportunity from the Minister to act in such a fashion.  That is not to suggest that the present Minister or any other previous Minister might have been so tempted. That is not the point.  We try to draft legislation so as not to create any such opportunity in future for other Ministers. The Minister should not bring that into it. It is a question of getting legislation here that is waterproof.  Would the Minister agree that I am not making any implications about himself or his colleague, the Minister, Deputy Wilson?  Accepting that, would he be prepared to look at the points I have made on what I would regard as improvements to the section between now and Report Stage?</P>

I have no evidence, and I am sure the Deputy has no evidence either, of the present or previous Ministers abusing the responsibility they have.

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister might bear in mind that private aerodromes are a relatively new phenomenon.  They have not been in operation for very long in this country, at least on a commercial scale. Therefore, the need for legislation of this kind is relatively new in regard to private aerodromes.  I could envisage, for instance, Aer Rianta in competition with a private aerodrome for business.  Aer Rianta are owned by the Minister and they might make representations to the Minister that they want to keep these competitors of theirs under control and they feel the Minister should require them to have four fire tenders and 17 layers of security fence or whatever, and all sorts of things they would have to pay for themselves which could have the effect of closing down that competitor. Therefore, we have the inherent conflict of interest with the owner of the shares in one set of aerodromes, that is those operated by Aer Rianta, making the regulations that will govern the rest of them not owned by Aer Rianta.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am concerned that there should be provision in the section which would ensure within reason that the Minister would not abuse his powers in this regard. I am not suggesting he would do so out of any bad motive.  Aer Rianta could be in financial trouble and say to the Minister they were going to have to look to him for money from the Exchequer to bail them out and he would have to go to the Minister for Finance unless he could do something to channel more business their way.  They could say they were getting terrible trouble from this private aerodrome in Knock &mdash; let us say &mdash; and they felt that unless they could divert some of Knock's business to some of their aerodromes they would be in trouble and would have to look for even more money from the Minister and surely the Minister <Col N="1971" /> does not want to go to the Minister for Finance looking for more money.  They would give him a package of things that should be done and say they were looking for fair play.  They would require all sorts of things to be done to these private aerodromes, some of which might be necessary but others might not be necessary. The Minister can use these powers for that purpose.</P>
    <P>All I am suggesting is that there should be (1) a requirement of uniformity of treatment; (2) a requirement, where general public order is being used as a criterion as distinct from public order at the aerodrome, that the Minister for Justice should be involved in it.  I do not see what is wrong with that or why the Minister is rejecting it.  It seems to be entirely consistent with what I imagine are the Minister's objectives in this matter.  I feel the Minister is interested in seeing privately operated aerodromes prospering. Indeed, some members of his party have been quite prominent in being photo-graphed at private aerodromes such as the one at Knock.  Therefore, I cannot see why the Minister is worried.</P>

      <P>FÁS, which combines the three former agencies AnCO, YEA and the NMS, have a total staff of 2,363.  As a result of the integration of the three agencies, the early retirement package has been offered to all employees of FÁS and to date 147 applications have been approved.  The implementation of the package is a matter for management by FÁS.</P>

      <P>Early in 1988 I directed FÁS to adopt an extremely critical approach to all spending.  This direction was given with a view to providing the best possible quality service to the greatest possible number of job seekers with limited resources.  A number of steps have been taken by FÁS including curtailment of overheads and reallocation of staff from support functions to areas like the Jobsearch programme. I am confident that these changes, allied to the benefits of integration, will lead to a more cost effective service for the client.</P>

For instance, if there are three accountants there will not be a need for them when the amalgamation takes place.  Staff have been moved from administration to work in direct training and employment activities, in particular the Jobsearch scheme.  In addition, FÁS have undertaken an extensive regionalisation programme which will result in better use being made of the time of the officials involved.

      <P>I am aware of what arose following the amalgamation of the agencies but I should like an assurance from the Minister that there will not be a reduction in the number of personnel employed on training programmes.  Will the Minister assure me that there will not be a reduction in the number of placement staff?</P>

      <P>The intention is to have a more streamlined and efficient service. We want to deploy staff to the regional offices.  The concentration will be on direct training and employment activities with practical emphasis on training schemes and the Jobsearch programme. I will bring the Deputy's views to the notice of the Minister for Labour and ask him to ensure that they are taken into account.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>To what extent has the Minister for Labour been seeking to achieve a degree of flexibility within the organisation so that if vacancies occur in the area of direct provision of services people can be redeployed to that area from the administrative side?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>My information is that there <Col N="1974" /> has been a general improvement in services, including the provision of a computer-based information service such as that installed in D'Olier House in Dublin. There will be more emphasis on self-service facilities, providing a better allround service for the people.  Through the regionalisation programme people in local areas will be able to benefit from a much improved service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. Birmingham Mr. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's reply has dealt with the quality of the service but my question was more specific.  As I understand it, the package is available across the board and my anxiety would be that if the package is taken up by those engaged in the provision of services, whether training or placement, it should be possible to redeploy people from other areas of the organisations to see to it that there is no disimprovement in quality of service but, in fact, an improvement while still achieving the objective of reducing the overall number.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Labour his views on whether there is an element of discrimination in relation to situations where a married man participating on a social employment scheme is entitled to the single person's rate in respect of same without any allowance for dependent children while his wife, who is in receipt of social welfare, is entitled to a single person's allowance with only half the rate for the dependent children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>The normal weekly wage payable to participants on the social employment scheme is £60, with an additional allowance of £25 payable to persons who, immediately prior to joining the scheme, were in receipt of an <Col N="1975" /> adult dependant's allowance from the Department of Social Welfare and were certified to that effect.  Allowances for child dependants are not payable under the scheme.  However, individuals are free to work for the remainder of the week without loss of wage.</P>
      <P>As I said to the Dáil on 10 March in response to a question on the social employment scheme, he has undertaken to review the level of payments under all employment schemes.  In the context of limited Exchequer resources, any increase in the level of allowances would, of course, mean that fewer people can be accommodated on programmes.</P>
      <P>Payment of social welfare allowances is a matter for the Minister for Social Welfare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree, allowing for the fact that resources are limited and the danger of reduced numbers in the scheme, that this represents a classic example of the doubleedged sword?  Will he accept that there is most unfair discrimination and severe hardship being imposed on people?  I should like to point out to the Minister that 18 months ago a married person who qualified for the social employment scheme was eligible for £85 per week and if the spouse was on disability or unemployment benefit they could qualify for the child dependant's allowance.  Now. if a married man with three children applies for benefit under the social employment scheme he receives the single man's rate of £60 per week while his spouse receives £18 representing a net loss of £43 per week.  Will the Minister agree that that cannot be justified?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to quote an example which is the best way to respond to the Deputy's questions.  That example is of a husband and wife with two dependent children.  On social welfare the husband would get £32.50 and the wife would get £32.50, half of the married rate, and the two children £19.20, making a total of £84.20.  That is the long-term unemployed urban rate.  Under the SES there <Col N="1976" /> will be a payment of £60 per week plus £37.80 unemployment assistance for a wife and £9.60, half the child dependant rate, making a total of £107.40.  Under social welfare a husband and wife and two dependent children would receive £84.20 while under the SES they will receive £107.40.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that in this case he is comparing social welfare and social welfare against social welfare and the social employment scheme?  In real terms, as distinct from 15 or 18 months ago, there is a loss of £43 a week.  Surely there is a case for one of two compromises &mdash; either give the social employment scheme applicant, the married person, the full married rate or else give the spouse, the wife in this case, the full child dependant allowance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's policy in relation to allowances is that no one should lose financially by participating in the programme.  That is the policy which the Minister has outlined in the House on previous occasions and this is taken into account by the FÁS placement officers.  As I have said, increases in the allowances, when finances are limited, relate directly to a reduction in the number of people who can participate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that the Minister present is answering on behalf of his colleague and my question to him is couched accordingly.  Would he not agree that unless the balance of the gap between the level of payment to participants in all the employment schemes, including the social employment scheme, and the recipients of long-term social welfare benefits, particularly unemployment assistance, is maintained in constant terms, the attractiveness of the scheme will be reduced?  In the Minister's reply he seemed to imply that the amount of money is fixed and that any proposal to increase the rate of payment for participants in the scheme would result in a reduction of the numbers.  Surely, as a member of the Cabinet, the Minister <Col N="1977" /> recognises that there would be compensating savings on the Social Welfare Vote that would more than justify and offset the increases in the allowances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to mislead the Deputy in any way.  The position is as I have outlined in the reply.  The Minister has indicated, and I am repeating it here today, that he is reviewing the level of payments under all employment schemes.  Of course it would be desirable, in as far as funds are available, to ensure that the maximum amount possible will be paid.  It is the Minister's intention to ensure that there is no big differential&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister have available to him information as to when that review of the levels of payment will be completed?  Will it be co-ordinated with the increases in the long term rates of social welfare payments?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister had a recent meeting with the trade movement on this issue and he undertook to review the level of payments under the scheme.  In particular he wants to secure some linkage between the schemes and the social welfare compensation rates.  The question of paying an allowance for dependent children would also be part of that <Col N="1978" /> review.  I cannot say at this stage how quickly that review will be completed but I assume it will be completed as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>The tabular statement circulated with this reply gives information on the programmes which do not involve payment of Social Welfare Class &ldquo;A&rdquo; PRSI rate &mdash; primarily training programmes and the social employment and enterprise schemes.  The table also gives the number on these programmes and the estimated percentage of participants who were on the live register prior to the programmes.</P>
      <P>For a number of reasons it is difficult to estimate how many people would have been on the live register had they not gone on a manpower programme.  There is no certainly that if a person had gone on a FÁS programme he or she would have remained on the live register.  The following information is therefore the best information that can be given to the question.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister and the House not recognise that the hotels federation in particular fought their way out of the amalgamation into the body of FÁS on the grounds that they would maintain the effectiveness of CERT as a separate body?  Does the Minister not further recognise that the hotels group in particular have benefited substantially from taxpayers' money in the form of heavily subsidised training and that they are continuing to evade their commitments and their responsibilities in this regard?  If he is prepared to make an admission of that kind, will he not agree, and can he not now tell the House, that the hotels group will pay in 1988 the £500,000, which is the same kind of contribution that the rest of the industrial sector pays for similar type training?</P>

Is he aware that the Minister for Labour has, on a number of occasions, accepted that if the scheme does not come into operation early in the year the decisions will have to be much more severe because it will be more difficult to collect the money over a shorter period.

Would the Minister not agree that what the hotel federation and the associated bodies are doing is ripping of the taxpayer, because effectively they are getting a £3 million to £4 million superb service for which they are currently paying less than £50,000?  This House is requesting the Minister to ensure that that money will be collected as promised in this year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have indicated previously, my priority in this area is to bring forward legislation to give effect to the main recommendations of the Barrington Commission of Inquiry on Safety, Health and Welfare at Work.  This will provide for new comprehensive legislative and structural systems relating to the safety and health of workers.</P>
      <P>The Barrington Commission themselves recognised that their proposals would need to be supplemented by an exercise of training, information and education. An important aspect of this process is the development of a multi-disciplinary approach to accident and injury prevention at the workplace.  The Department of Labour are co-operating with An Bord Altranais, the Faculty of Occupational Medicine, the Institute of Occupational Safety and Health and the Occupational Hygiene Society in the running of a common core multi-disciplinary course in occupational safety and health. This type of initiative accords with current international thinking such as expressed within the European Community and the International Labour Organisation.</P>
      <P>This year the Department are implementing a targeted programme for reducing accidents and ill health at work in four high risk areas, namely, construction, glass manufacture, meat and fish products and milk processing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In preparation for the designated European Year Against Cancer in 1989, I have asked my Department to organise a programme to coincide with the European Community's initiative.  It is intended that there will be co-ordination <Col N="1985" /> of activities and liaison with other national bodies leading to the development of a programme aimed at ensuring protection for the workforce from cancer creating substances at work.  The programme will run in co-operation with the National Industrial Safety Organisation and the Irish Cancer Society.  Preparatory activities have commenced and will be completed within the current year.</P>

Can he not arrange to introduce on an interim basis emergency measures dealing with such matters as protective clothing, gloves, goggles and so on, without waiting a long period before anything is done to provide these safety measures?</P>

The Barrington report set out in great detail a range of areas which needed attention, covering a much wider remit than the safety in industry legislation already covers.

    <P>Officers of the Department are participating in work within the European Community designed towards the introduction of improved standards of protection for workers exposed to carcinogens.

It is expected that this work will be completed to coincide with the designated European Year against Cancer in 1989.

      <P>asked the Minister for Labour (a) the regulations which have been made under section 28 of the Employment Equality Act, 1977 to assist persons in obtaining information required to enable them to decide <Col N="1994" /> whether they should pursue a complaint of unlawful discrimination (b) whether the use of the prescribed form is obligatory (c) the time limits which are specified for its return by the respondent (d) whether the Labour Court and the Employment Equality Agency have recommended changes in the questionnaire procedure; and the action he proposes to take in the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10 and 16 together.</P>
      <P>The Employment Equality Act, 1977 (Section 28) Regulations, 1977, prescribe forms to be used by a person who proposes to refer a dispute under section 19 of the Employment Equality Act to the Labour Court and who wishes to ascertain from an employer the reason for an act believed to be discriminatory.  The regulations prescribe a time limit of 21 days for the completion and return of the form and an employer is required to comply with this requirement.  The use of the form is not essential in referring a claim under the Act.</P>
      <P>The form is available on request from the Labour Court, the Employment Equality Agency and from my Department.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, I have recently circulated proposals for the amendment of a number of Acts, including the employment equality legislation, and my Department are at present considering submissions from a wide range of interests, including the equality officer service of the Labour Court and the Employment Equality Agency.  Any action necessary in relation to section 28 of the Act and the relevant regulations will be considered in the context of the amendment of the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister satisfied that the regulations made under section 28 answer the reason for the forms being introduced in the first place?  Is the form a resource for people who wish to decide whether they should pursue a complaint of unlawful discrimination?  Will the Minister agree that dissatisfaction has been registered in regard to amending <Col N="1995" /> the Employment Equality Act by submissions received by him?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not familiar with the precise details of the submissions received by the Minister and I do not have them here.  However, I assure the Deputy that any positive suggestions that she or anybody else wish to make in regard to suggested changes in the guidance notes accompanying the forms or the questionnaire which would enable people to check the employers' reasons for discrimination will be welcomed and taken into account by the Minister in the present review.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>When will the amending legislation be introduced to the Houses? Will it be by the end of the year?  Will the Minister also consider a further dissemination of the prescribed form when it is amended so that claimants will be much more aware of it and can use it to their advantage?</P>

He has sought submissions from various people, including the Labour Court and the Employment Equality Agency.  I do not know when discussions will be completed but, as the Deputy is aware, the use of the form is not essential in filing a claim under the Act.  I wish to repeat that suggested changes are welcome and will be taken into consideration by the Minister when decisions are made about the proposed changes.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Labour if his attention has been drawn to reports of the difficulties encountered by Irish persons, recruited as <i>au pairs</i> to work in the United States, who on some occasions have been forced to work unreasonably long hours for very small amounts of money, and have in <Col N="1996" /> some cases had their passports confiscated by employers; if he intends to strengthen the regulations regarding recruitment of persons in this country to work abroad as <i>au pairs</i>; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of reports concerning difficulties experienced by young people who have gone to the US as <i>au pairs.</i></P>
      <P>Since assuming office I have repeatedly advised young people who may be contemplating seeking work experience abroad to get information and advice about how to avoid risks before deciding to travel.  Towards that end I arranged for FÁS, of which the former National Manpower Service is now part, to publish a booklet entitled <i>Working Abroad</i> which contains a list of suggestions about how to avoid pitfalls.  The most important advice I would give to any young person contemplating emigrating is to use the information, advice and counselling service which I introduced last year and which is available in any FÁS office.</P>
      <P>Many young people who travel abroad to take up positions as <i>au pairs</i> do so on the basis of personal arrangements between themselves and the host family who may have advertised for an <i>au pair.</i> My advice to them is to get as much information as possible on the host family from a reliable source such as a relative or friend beforehand.  In the case of agencies and organisations who arrange the placement of <i>au pairs</i> with families in the US, I would urge that anyone considering going to the US should ensure that the agency is reputable and the conditions offered are satisfactory.</P>
      <P>I would also stress the importance of having a valid visa before entering the United States.  Young persons who do not hold the necessary visa for the activities they wish to engage in put themselves unnecessarily at risk of exploitation.  The enactment of the Immigration Reform and Control Act, 1986, makes it possible for the US authorities to take legal action against employers of staff not legally entitled to work in the US.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Employment Agencies Act, 1971, <Col N="1997" /> governs the activities of agencies which seek, on behalf of others, persons who will give or accept employment.  <i>Au pairs</i> are not generally regarded as employees and, on that basis, their placement, either here or in the US, does not come within the scope of the Act.  The concern about recent experiences of Irish nationals in the US is being taken into account in a review of the Act.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his detailed reply.  Is he aware of any prosecutions taken against any persons in the United States who have seized young people's passports?  I refer to those who have gone to work as <i>au pairs.</i> How many cases have been brought to the attention of his Department where young people who have gone to work as <i>au pairs</i> in the United States have had their passports seized, have not been paid the amount agreed before they went and have also had their return tickets seized?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>Generally speaking, the responsibility for dealing with problems in this area rests with the Department of Foreign Affairs.  I do not have precise details of prosecutions but I will ask the Minister to send any information of this nature to the Deputy.  Where problems arise with Irish citizens working in the United States, they should contact the consul service who will take immediate action to deal with any problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister must be aware that one of the major problems in regard to people working in the United States as <i>au pairs</i> is that they do not normally have their correct visa.  They are very much in fear when their passport is seized and threatened with being reported to the authorities as they do not know their rights.  Is there any international convention or protocol on <i>au pairs</i> and the conditions under which they should be treated by the host country? If so, is Ireland a signatory to such a convention or protocol?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>From the information at my <Col N="1998" /> disposal there does not appear to be any such protocol in that area.  Let me repeat what I have said already in reply to another supplementary question from Deputy De Rossa, I will endeavour to get whatever information the Minister has available to him and supply it to the Deputy.  As I have already pointed out, the Deputy should really address his questions to the Minister for Foreign Affairs as it is he who is responsible for dealing with the problems of Irish citizens abroad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that most of the cases which have been brought to my attention in this regard have arisen out of advertisements appearing in the newspapers, particularly the national newspapers, would the Department consider placing on a regular basis advertisements in the employment columns of these newspapers warning young people of the risks involved and what they would need to do before going abroad to work as <i>au pairs</i>?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>The best possible advice which we could give at this stage is that young people who are interested in going to the United States to work as au <i>pairs</i> should avail of the advice being provided by FÁS.  Such advice is available through all their regional offices.  The best possible advice which we could give is that young people before going abroad should first get all of the information available from FÁS and cross-check through some reliable source the families they propose to work for to ensure that they are reliable and that they are not going to be walked into any undesirable situations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. Birmingham Mr. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister referred to the employment agency legislation and indicated it was only applicable to a very limited extent, or perhaps not applicable.  Let me ask him two supplementary questions in that respect. First of all, the Minister indicated that that legislation is under review.  What stage is that review at and when might it be concluded?  Secondly, would the Department pursue the extent to which <Col N="1999" /> the legislation as it exists could be used, because as far as I can recollect when a complaint was raised in the House by Deputy De Rossa on a previous occasion some years ago it was indicated that it was possible to deal with a particular agency which was causing concern under that legislation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have said, <i>au pairs</i> are not generally regarded as being employees and are not covered under the Employment Agency Act, 1971, which I indicated is currently under review.  I am not aware what stage that review is at now or when that review is likely to be completed, but pending the outcome of that review and in view of the fact that there are some reports of <i>au pairs</i> finding themselves in difficulty in the United States and other places, the best possible advice which the Department could give at this stage is that, before a person goes abroad to work in such a position, they get all of the information available and avail of the services being provided &mdash; only provided in the last year or so &mdash; and that they cross-check before they travel with some reliable source in the United States or elsewhere the families which they intend to work for.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>At the Council of Social Affairs Ministers meeting on 5 June 1986 a resolution was adopted deferring furthere consideration of the draft Vredeling Directive until 1989 at the earliest.  The Council resolution was clarified in July 1986 to allow that when consideration of this matter is resumed it will be on the <Col N="2000" /> basis of either the draft previously submitted by the Commission or of any alternative proposal which the Commission might choose to put forward.</P>
      <P>It is accordingly for the Commission in the first place to consider all of the proposals to date, including that of the Redmond <i>Ad Hoc</i> Working Group, and to decide whether or not to incorporate them into the draft Directive for resubmission to the Council at a future date. Vice-President Marine during a visit to Dublin in recent weeks stated that a new draft Directive relating to information and consultation of workers about the introduction of new technologies was being considered by the Commission.</P>
      <P>Ireland's position in relation to any new proposals for information and consultation of workers emanating from the Commission will be determined when the text of such a proposal has been examined and evaluated.</P>

      <P>Grants from the Department's Vote for the provision of State assistance to voluntary organisations concerned with the welfare of Irish emigrants are paid only on the recommendation of DÍON &mdash; the London based committee which advises me on matters relating to emigrant welfare generally.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, the application for financial assistance in respect of the Kerry London Association has been forwarded to the chairperson of DÍON so that the committee can consider it in the context of all applications which have been made and the committee's grants budget of £250,000 for 1988.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I request the Minister to advise the Minister for Labour that the Kerrymen's Association are providing a very essential service for young emigrants from County Kerry and the rest of the <Col N="2001" /> country in London at present.  Is the Minister aware that they intend to extend their present accommodation to cater for 40 people?  They are already providing a very useful advice service at their hostel. They are also providing counselling facilities and information on employment opportunities in London.  I would like to remind the Minister that the resources of DÍON are stretched as it is and their budget of £250,000 is grossly inadequate to cater for the needs of emigrants in London at present.  I appeal to the Minister for Labour to increase the amount of money allocated to DÍON for the coming year, 1989, so that applications for grant aid from organisations such as the Kerryment's Association can be met to some degree.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me make one final point.  In view of the fact that it is going to cost in excess of £400,000 to provide this hostel, I ask the Minister to seriously consider providing some aid towards this centre.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is aware of the work being done by the Kerry London Association and is aware that they are proposing to provide a new hostel for young Irish emigrants.  He is also fully aware that the association already run another very good hostel in London and of the work they have been involved in. As I have already pointed out, applications are forwarded to DÍON as they are the organisation who evaluate the applications.  Aid is usually provided in cases where urgent and emergency help is required by young Irish emigrants.  As of now support is mainly provided to cover the cost of employing welfare staff rather than providing capital grants towards expenditure on projects such as the one the Deputy has outlined.  I am aware that the Minister visited Camden in London at the end of May and met various organisations and bodies.  As I have said, the Minister has limited finances at his disposal and the application in <Col N="2002" /> respect of the project which the Deputy is interested in is being forwarded to the chairperson of DÍON who advise the Minister in relation to expenditure in this area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that this type of development, in addition to that visualised in Question No. 19 is compelling?  No doubt the Minister will have discovered, when he visited London, that 61 per cent of emigrants who travelled there last year travelled alone, that 34 per cent had less than £30 with them on arrival; that 70 per cent had less than £100 with them; that 57 per cent had made no definite arrangements for accommodation; that 17.5 per cent spent their first night there sleeping rough; and that 79 per cent became unemployed two months after arrival.  Would the Minister agree that the least we might do is provide short-stay, basic accommodation for young Irish people who go there totally unprepared?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is also aware that a similar application has been made by the Mayo Association.  On his recent visit to Camden Town he met some of the people involved in these organisations and is fully aware of the position obtaining.  The present policy of the Department of Labour in relation to young people emigrating is twofold: first, the provision of pre-departure information and advisory services and the provision of skills and training for young people in order to dissuade them, if possible, from emigrating and to endeavour to find employment opportunities here. The Minister is fully aware of the very valuable and important work being <Col N="2003" /> undertaken by both the Mayo Association and the Kerry/London Association.  He is fully cognisant of the need to develop the services there.  But the concentration to date has been on dealing with urgent and emergency help for young people there rather than the provision of capital expenditure for the type of welfare projects the Deputies have in mind.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. Birmingham Mr. Birmingham">

      <P>Given that the resources available to DÍON are so limited, given that there would be complete agreement on all sides of the House that the major problem facing young Irish emigrants in London is that of obtaining accommodation, would the Minister consider the possibility of looking for alternative resources of funding, including, for example, discussions with his colleague in charge of the national lottery to ascertain whether assistance could be given to these voluntary Irish organisations?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PearseWyse" hpid="Mr. Wyse Mr. Wyse">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that neither FÁS nor the Department of Social Welfare keep a register of the thousands of young people unemployed who have yet to complete their apprenticeship? Furthermore, is he aware that such young people are considered to be half-backed apprentices with little or no hope of obtaining employment?  I had hoped that the compilation of such a register would give employers some incentive to help those thousands of young people to complete their apprenticeship period, when they could then at least compete equally with everybody else by way of employment.  I am amazed that the Minister is telling me that no such register is available in the Department of Labour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not tell the Deputy that.  What I said was that the information sought by the Deputy was concerned with the day-to-day activities of FÁS and that it should be ascertained directly from them.  In fact FÁS do maintain a register of unemployed apprentices.  Therefore the information should be readily available from FÁS.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that FÁS will take on a young boy or girl as an apprentice for one and a half years, and then they are asked to seek sponsorship to complete their apprenticeship? Would he agree that that is most unsatisfactory for such young people, that FÁS should provide them with three of their five years apprenticeship or, alternatively, should not take on such young <Col N="2005" /> people at all.  It is an injustice to them.  I know there is no register of such young people either in FÁS or the Department of Social Welfare.  I asked the same question of previous Governments and I was told that that information was not available. Would the Minister not agree that it is a pity that thousands of young people, half-baked apprentices, are allowed to stray around the country, and find themselves at a total disadvantage when they apply for employment?  Would the Minister convey my sentiments to the Minister for Labour in the hope of having such a register compiled immediately?</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 6, line 8, after &ldquo;security&rdquo;, to insert, &ldquo;defence&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I agree to the Ceann Comhairle's suggestion that we take amendments Nos. 4, 6, 7, 8 and 9 together as they relate to the same issue.  The Workers' Party propose that, in addition to the areas of concern the Minister may regulate for with regard to aerodromes, we want to include the concept of defence and defence measures attached to those facilities.  I have already touched on this briefly in earlier remarks with regard to the Minister's proposal to take responsibility from his Department for any facilities under the control of the Minister for Defence.  That matter has now been agreed to by the House but without the support of The Workers' Party.  This says very specifically that the Minister in dealing with civil facilities should be in a position to recognise the potential military significance of these facilities and for that reason should be able to deal with matters that might arise or affect that potentiality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is conceded that in the Bill as drafted the concept of security and safety is there, but if one takes them together, the intent under those terms as the Bill stands, is to deal with aspects of civil security and safety surrounding the aerodromes.  We are concerned about our position as an active neutral nation.  At all times we <Col N="2038" /> should be in a position to defend that neutrality by ensuring that any civil or military facility cannot be readily available for use by hostile or invading forces. We expect a Minister with primary responsibility for civil aviation, recognising the potential value of civil facilities to hostile or invading forces, to have the authority to lay down standards and directions with regard to defence and we are proposing the addition of the word &ldquo;defence&rdquo;.  It may not add to the current intent of the Government but it helps to clarify and make it possible for the Minister to act in the area of ensuring that whatever directions or standards he or his Department seek to make can and would include the concept of defence in the context of our neutrality.  I hope the Minister will accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment is unacceptable, as indicated earlier in relation to another amendment.  The Deputy's amendment would require the Minister for Tourism and Transport to become involved in matters which are the direct responsibility of the Minister for Defence.  Defence matters are also outside the remit of the National Civil Aviation Committee established to advise the Government on civil aviation security. To include &ldquo;defence&rdquo; would take from the Minister for Defence his responsibility in defence and security matters.  The Minister for Transport and Tourism has the power only to provide for civil aviation and not for military aviation.  It would not be wise to accept this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to pursue this further for the purposes of clarification of the issue.  Will the Minister advise the House whether a Minister for Defence can regulate on defence issues or matters appertaining to the civil aerodromes or the civil airports?  If one accepts the argument that civil installations have a potential use for invading or hostile forces which would not discriminate between a civil and military airport, can the Minister for Defence regulate the potential defence aspects of civil airports?  If the <Col N="2039" /> Minister cannot, I am happy with the situation and I will concede the point: otherwise, I would suggest that this legislation is dealing with civil installations it should be open to the Minister for Tourism and the Minister for Communications with specific responsibility for the regulations of the aerodromes to say that he wants to direct that an aerodrome be made safe not just from the civil point of view of the security of people using the aerodrome but also from hostile or invading forces.  If the Minister says that the Minister for Defence has authority to impinge upon civil facilities and institutions to direct that works can be carried out, I will be happy.  I am not talking about the erection of military-style installations. In visiting abroad one often sees on major roadways along aerodromes physical barriers which would prevent aircraft landing.  When talking about ports there is often the facility to lay mines quickly or to erect barriers for the purposes of making them unusable.  I am not talking about the building of battlements or gun posts but just those facilities that can be readily made available to make an airport unusable to anyone who wishes to use it with adverse effect on the national security.</P>
      <P>The Minister's argument that refusing the amendment in the name of The Workers' Party is to preserve a division between his Department and that of the Minister for Defence could be applied equally to the Minister for Defence in another context.  If we were asked to look after civil institutions he could say that he did not want to trespass on an area that was the remit of the Minister for Tourism and Transport.  If I can be satisfied about this position I will be happy to leave it but otherwise it is something to which the Minister might give more consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Defence may impinge in civil areas but only when it applies to general defence and security. I can give the Deputy that assurance.  If general defence and security requires the involvement of the Minister for Defence <Col N="2040" /> he can become involved.  If the Deputy wishes to know how that procedure can be accommodated I would refer him to the advisory committee which comprises the Department of Foreign Affairs, the Department of Justice and the Department of Defence.</P>

      <P>It is a matter that should not await general issues of defence.  It is something we should deal with on an ongoing basis, on the basis that we maintain a certain neutrality.  If we are neutral we should not be available in any shape or form to a superior power that would seek to utilise us.  That is the general drift of my argument.  However, I accept what the Minister has said in clarifying the matter and I do not propose to press the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 6, subsection (1), line 14, after &ldquo;writing&rdquo;, to insert &ldquo;but not less frequently than each year&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is to insert into section 7 a requirement that the reporting in writing to the Minister of measures taken to comply with the directions in section 6 should be not less frequent than once a year.  The Workers' Party are concerned about this because we recognise the very important development that this legislation represents nationally and the incredible proliferation of aerodromes or air facilities around the country.  Given the earlier comments of the Minister this morning clarifying the definition of aerodrome to include heliports and all forms of aircraft and air traffic, including all facilities that would be usable, publicly or privately in this area, and given the incredible workload on the Department that this will now represent, we suggest that an obligation <Col N="2041" /> be placed on the proprietors of aerodromes to report on an annual basis to his Department on the measures and works undertaken by the aerodrome owners to comply with the directions of safety and security that he will issue.</P>
    <P>In the Bill, as I understand it, it is proposed as an initiation process to have a general declaration circulated to all aerodrome owners and proprietors to tell them that the legislation is now in place and to set down minimum standards and requirements.  It would be greatly in ease of the Minister and his officials if they could be assured of receipt on an annual basis at least of a report as to what is being done to implement it.  The work that will be required on our aerodromes &mdash; I do not know whether this is fully appreciated, &mdash; particularly in the private end &mdash; will be considerable to make them safe and have them standardised within the regulations envisaged, and for that reason will not be completed in a day, a week or in a year.  The amendment is drafted in such a way as to ensure that should the Minister require more frequent reports he can avail of them.  We are simply saying that at least every aerodrome facility in the country would be required to update and report on an annual basis what is being done to comply with the regulations.  If the Minister indicates that he is now satisfied that the requirements have been complied with, obviously the necessity of ongoing reports does not arise.  For that reason I think it is a sensible and workable amendment and I hope the Minister will accept it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry to disappoint the Deputy.  In my view this amendment is not required and it should not be pressed.  The obligation on any aerodrome operator to report to the Minister for Tourism and Transport under section 7 of the Bill only arises where the Minister had to issue a direction to the aerodrome operator under section 6 of the Bill as to the standards of security and safety to be complied with by that aerodrome. Section 7, as it stands, allows the Minister to require such a report as and when <Col N="2042" /> he considers it necessary to check that required action is taken on foot of the direction given under section 6.  Indeed, the obligation proposed in The Workers' Party amendment could involve the making of a nil report where no report was called for.  I hope the Deputy will accept that the Minister can request and require a report at any time, and that should be sufficient.  That is why I indicated at the outset that the amendment is not required and I hope he will not press it.</P>

      <P>This section is rather loose and does not apply a uniform or standardised approach to aerodromes in general.  The discretion left to the Minister is such that one must be concerned at the degree of variation that could arise in the Department's approach to the various aerodromes.  I would be concerned about the lack of a time limit in the actual furnishing of a direction and the furnishing of a report.  It is a report in such form and within such time and at such intervals as the Minister may specify in writing.  It is very much at the discretion of the Minister.  In the interests of overall safety and security of aerodromes, throughout the country, perhaps the Minister would consider a more specific approach in this area.  As my colleague, Deputy Bruton said when speaking on section 6, a rather loose approach is being adopted.  It is important that this House would have legislation enacted that would not give the same discretion to the Department as is suggested in the Bill. There are inherent dangers in the Bill.  I ask that the Minister would examine this section with a view to bringing in something on Report Stage so that there would be a more standardised and uniform approach and that all aerodromes would be required annually to furnish a report in writing to the Department regarding their safety regulations and everything the Minister considers fit.  There should be regulations under which annual reports could be requested from them. Perhaps the Minister would consider that for Report Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>Lest there be any impression that there are serious shortcomings in aerodrome security or safety, I would like to indicate that there are not, but even if there were we are now legislating, through this Bill, to ensure that any of the shortcomings referred to by members would not arise.  Subsection (1) imposes a specific duty on every aerodrome operator to report to the Minister for Tourism and Transport when required.  Subsection (3) makes it an offence for a person to refuse or fail to report to the Minister for Tourism and Transport when required or to give false statements in such a report.</P>
      <P>I would also point out that the maximum penalties for such an offence are provided for in section 27 of the Bill. If it is necessary I will put on the record the extent of these finds.  A person shall be liable on summary convinction to a fine not exceeding £1,000 and or a term of imprisonment not exceeding six months, or, on conviction on indictment, to a fine not exceeding £50,000 and or a term of imprisonment not exceeding three years. I suggest to the Deputies that this legislation, in all its sections, is providing for any doubts or misgivings that Members may have.  The Minister at all times is answerable to this House and if at any time Members feel that the legislation or regulations are not being effected there are procedures here in the House whereby such matters can be raised. Members can be satisfied that this legislation provides for whatever reports are necessary.</P>
      <P>I have indicated that the Minister is empowered to look for a report at any time.  If we put into this section that aerodromes are only obliged to submit an annual report and if a report is required before that annual report is due, then the Minister's hands are tied.  We would not be able to request the report.  The terms of the Bill are much stronger by leaving out the proposal in The Workers' Party amendment for an annual report. If it is left as it is, the Minister can ask for a report at any time and he does not have to wait for an annual report as has been suggested.</P>

      <P>How would the Minister under this legislation or at present decide when to ask for a report? Is it because of a hunch he has or some definite information?  Is there not some protection there?  There must be something continually coming to the Department giving the information.  Unless some limit is provided within legislation the Minister may not ask for a report from some aerodrome for ten years and maybe five years from another.  Could he not provide for at least an annual report in the interest of safety and security? How do the Minister and his Department decide when the report should be furnished to them and on what grounds should it be furnished?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>All aerodrome operators are, on a continuing basis, subject to the Departments inspectorate and if the inspectorate see the need for a report or are not happy with some area of activity, the obvious procedure to be followed is that the inspectorate would bring to notice some misdemeanour occurring in some aerodrome and on the basis of the inspectorate's report the Minister would pursue the operator in question under the terms of this legislation.  I am happy that the legislation is adequate to meet all the contingencies that might occur or seem to be creating some sort of doubt in Deputies' minds.  I assure them that the inspectors within the Department are monitoring each aerodrome and each activity on an ongoing basis.  There need be no doubt that if there is seen to be or even a doubt about any transgression at an aerodrome the Minister would act quickly on the basis of the strength he has in this legislation which is updating all the previous Acts and strengthening legislation in many cases.</P>

      <P>Given the decrease in public service staff and the increase in the number of aerodromes, would the Minister not see it as of assistance to him and his Department if something was built into the legislation which would require at minimum an annual inspection and an annual report so that <Col N="2045" /> the Minister for Finance would be compelled to provide him with the staff necessary to do that work?</P>

      <P>I have made the point that the obligation required in The Workers' Party amendment could involve the making of a nil report.  On the point the Deputy is making about the Civil Service and the public service generally, why should we load them with reports that in many cases would not be necessary if nil reports are coming in?  Is it not sufficient to require, request, demand, to ensure that the report is provided when one is necessary based on the continuous monitoring of the inspectorate within the Department?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to come back on a number of points.  I ask the Minister to have regard to the wording of the amendment which is: &ldquo;but not less frequently than each year&rdquo;.  Consequently the amendment in no way ties the Minister's hands or makes it difficult or impossible for him as Minister to require reports as frequently as he feels is necessary or desirable.  The purpose of the amendment is simply to recognise the importance of the legislation and ensure the Minister would have the statutory basis of requiring of all aerodrome operators an annual report, even if it amounts to a nil report.  I see an advantage in the Department getting a nil report even if it tells that the aerodrome is alive and well and reporting and that no progress has been made on specific works required, and alerts one to the fact that all is not moving as it should be in that area.  I would not worry about the fact that a report says, &ldquo;We are reporting for the purposes of the Act and advising that matters have not progressed beyond the last time&rdquo;.  That might alert one to all kinds of problems appertaining to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment does not tie the Minister's hands in any way and it is wrong of him to suggest it does.  If the Minister tells us the amendment is superfluous and unnecessary and of no ease, that will not break our commitment to the legislation or cause a division.  Nevertheless it is <Col N="2046" /> there for a good reason and the Minister should look carefully at it before he rejects it.</P>
    <P>An aspect of the Minister's response that worries me a little is the suggestion that all things are well and good in the aerodrome.  I do not believe that is the case.  I accept fully that our three major aerodromes under the authority of the State at Cork, Shannon and Dublin are excellent at working as well as they can within the confines of resources available and they have an excellent safety record, but this legislation is primarily, I understand, to ensure that all other civil and privately owned air facilities are brought under the legislative control of the Minister and that all aspects of international treaties will be applicable to them.  Why then, if all things are rosy and happy, are we legislating at all?  The third busiest aerodrome in the country works out of a farmyard at the west side of this city.  As a visitor to it, let me say it does not instil in me confidence that all the best facilities of safety and security are working there. I am saying that as a civilian with no expertise on the area and perhaps I should not say it at all.  Perhaps that facility is working as well as anyone could ever hope, but the impression is that it is not.</P>
    <P>If one goes down the Liffey one finds a heliport on the side surrounded by palisade fencing and I understand helicopters can come and go there at will.  There seems to be no facility for advising someone using the heliport of the dangers of wind on the river or any independent controls keeping members of the public back.  From my unaided, unspecific observation that does not convince me that all is right and well there.  It may well be and someone may tell me so, but I wonder why we are legislating at all if things are as good and happy as is implied.  I understand in the context of this legislation that a great deal of work had to be done in bringing our facilities and aerodromes up to standard, regulating them, policing them and seeing that things are good.  If I am wrong about that I would be happy for the Minister to tell me so.  I understood that for much of <Col N="2047" /> the work that would be necessary time would be required and it would be of assistance to the Department that at minimum in all instances an annual report be prepared of progress being made.  In no way as the amendment is drafted does it impinge on the Minister's authority.  If he felt the thing should be done in a shorter period than a year &mdash; and he should be told as a matter of urgency &mdash; the Minister can order so.  This mechanism seeks to link all aerodrome facilities and have them reporting to the Department on work being undertaken to make them comply with the regulations. If the Minister says he does not think the amendment is necessary I will not press it but I felt it important to make my point.</P>

      <P>I should like to assure the Deputy that all amendments are given careful consideration.  When I say that the amendment is not required it is important to add that that decision was not taken lightly.  The contributions of Deputies are of immense value so that we can get on the record what we are aiming to achieve through the Bill. Section 7 is designed to enable the Minister to monitor the extent of compliance with directions given by him under section 6 regarding the security and safety measures to be met at aerodromes and to determine whether there is a need for further directions to be given under that section.  Deputy Taylor-Quinn suggested that there should be an annual report.  To specifically state that we would require an annual report is not the ideal way to deal with this matter and I would respectfully suggest that the amendment be withdrawn.</P>

This is the first occasion I have seen wording similar to that contained in section 11, &ldquo;any article having the appearance of a firearm&rdquo;.  The existing firearms legislation includes the words &ldquo;imitation firearm&rdquo;. They may amount to the same thing but for the purpose of ensuring that the provision is enforceable we should use the same phraseology.  I would see some difficulty arising if a prosecution took place under section 11 and if a court was asked to define &ldquo;any article having the appearance of a firearm&rdquo;.  A court does not have a <i>corpus</i> of decided precedent law because all the precedent law that exists relates to &ldquo;an imitation firearm&rdquo;.</P>

The words, &ldquo;or any article having the appearance of a firearm&rdquo;, internationally include not only imitation firearms &mdash; for example, cap guns &mdash; but any other article which in the circumstances has the appearance of a firearm.  Obviously, the section should provide comprehensively against such articles being brought unlawfully into aerodromes.  It is because I am of the opinion that the wording in the Bill is stronger than that in the amendment that I consider the amendment unacceptable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am at a loss to understand how the words in the Bill are stronger than the words in the amendment. The courts, in interpreting an imitation firearm, do not confine the interpretation to something that is made up to look like a gun.  For example, on occasions the courts have construed a piece of pipe concealed up a sleeve with the barrelend protruding as an imitation firearm because in the circumstances it was capable of that definition.  The wording amounts to the same thing and would cover all eventualities.  However, I am anxious to point out that our <i>corpus</i> of judge-decided law in interpreting what is an imitation firearm is based on the wording in the firearms Acts and from the point of view of consistency we should stand by those words.  If the Minister does not accept that view, and realising that Report Stage must be concluded by 5.30 p.m. this evening, there is little point in me suggesting that he should consider the matter again.</P>

      <P>In page 8, subsection (2), lines 11 and 12, to delete &ldquo;or reasonable excuse&rdquo;. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>The import of this amendment should be explained.  The section allows for reasonable excuse as a possible defence for a person found carrying an article that is a prohibited article under the legislation.  The Minister's amendment which seeks to delete &ldquo;or reasonable excuse&rdquo; makes it what is known in law as a strict liability offence. The person who is found driving with too much alcohol cannot rely, if arrested, upon &ldquo;reasonable excuse&rdquo; by saying he had to get home because his mother was ill or because he got an urgent phone call. It is a strict liability offence if somebody is behind the wheel and has taken excess alcohol and no excuse will exonerate him. This is what the Minister is seeking to do by the deletion in his amendment of &ldquo;or reasonable excuse&rdquo;.  Why were the words inserted in the first instance and what has changed since?  Given that this Bill has been subjected to very close scrutiny and that we have had the benefit of a very good debate on it in the Seanad, why are the words now being taken out?  Instances can occur where persons, through inadvertance or through any number of reasons, could be found in possession of something that they should not have.</P>
      <P>For example, the carrying of weapons in America is constitutionally guaranteed. There have been instances of tourists from this country being found to be carrying weapons here and innocently believing that there was nothing wrong with it. In my years of practice I have seen a number of cases of young people going to Britain or the Continent where air pistols are easily purchased and thinking it would be a great thing to have one for the open fields at home.  They are subsequently found in their possession.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2052" /> There are a great number of instances in which a person in innocent circumstances has a reasonable excuse and he should be allowed use it as a basis for a defence to a charge.  The Bill, as it is currently worded, is reasonable and fair and should be allowed stand as it is.  I am interested to hear the compelling reasons from the Minister for withdrawing the words now.</P>
    <P>We are opposed to the idea of imposing on a defendant in proceedings the onus to prove matters of which he is accused &mdash; in other words, we want the deletion of the words &ldquo;the proof of which shall lie on him&rdquo;.  Certainly, if the Minister's amendment is successful in deleting &ldquo;for reasonable excuse&rdquo; then these words should also go.  The section provides that a person shall not have a prohibited article without lawful authority or reasonable excuse.  The general principle in criminal law is, and should always be, that he who accuses proves and that the onus rests on the prosecution to make their case. Where they allege an offence, I am opposed in principle to the concept that proof or part of the proofs in the case should rest on the shoulders of the defendent. Where it is alleged that a person is in possession without lawful authority or reasonable excuse, that is a matter for the prosecution to prove and the State should be in a position to do so.  The State should, without any difficulty be able to prove that a person does not have lawful authority to have the prohibited article. That would be no difficulty whatsoever. If the Minister's amendment to delete the words &ldquo;or reasonable excuse&rdquo; go, then there is no reason why a defendant should be put to the proofs of establishing lawful authority.  It runs contrary to general principles and certainly would impose no undue onus on the prosecution to establish to the court's satisfaction that lawful authority did not exist for the possession or carrying of the weapon in question.  I urge a twofold approach on the Minister: to allow the amendment to stand as it is with the words &ldquo;or reasonable excuse&rdquo; standing; or, in the event that he is disposed to pressing his amendment, as I presume he is, to accede to the suggestion that the additional words &ldquo;the proof of <Col N="2053" /> which shall lie on him&rdquo; should also be deleted, as is proposed by The Workers' Party amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy McCartan asked why we propose to change the wording now.  The advantage of having a Second Stage debate and views being expressed by people here and in the Seanad is that it shows that we are not immune to taking suggestions.  We acknowledge that when we further examined the various aspects of the Bill, in view of the various contributions and the ongoing study, we found that in this case the original words we had used were included in the UK Act of 1982.  On reflection, we came to the conclusion that by leaving in the words &ldquo;or reasonable excuse&rdquo; it would undermine the prohibition on having dangerous articles in aerodromes or on aircraft etc.  The purpose of the amendment to sections 11 and 17 is to correct a defect which could have undermined that prohibition on unlawfully having firearms or other dangerous articles at aerodromes or in aircraft.  The reason for the change is to strengthen the wording further by removing &ldquo;or reasonable excuse&rdquo;&mdash; in other words, we are not prepared to take any excuse.</P>
      <P>In regard to the Deputy's amendment No. 16, he uses the parallel that if we must leave in one set of wording why not treat the wording in this amendment in the same manner.  I will prefix my comments by saying that this amendment is not acceptable.  In order to copperfasten the prohibition on unlawfully having firearms and so on in aerodromes, a person claiming lawful authority for having a firearm or an explosive in an aerodrome must be required to produce proof of such authority.  That is another parallel that the Deputy drew with other countries.  This subsection includes all the items listed in section 11 of the Bill.  The amendment, as suggested by the Deputy, is unacceptable for the reasons given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the reasons the Minister has advanced.  Section 11 (1) (d) is drafted in a very wide-ranging way to cover virtually any article and not just <Col N="2054" /> a firearm.  I gave an example of a person coming from America where it is constitutionally safe to have a firearm or from the Continent where it is so easy to obtain them.  The drafting of that paragraph is very wide.  It covers any article which is made or is adapted for use for causing injury to or incapacitating a person.  For example, a stick, a knife, a pen-knife or even an umbrella is capable of that.  A person could take off her stiletto shoe and turn on her next door neighbour and she could be accused of being in possession of something that is capable of causing injury to property or person. The wide-ranging base of that wording requires a defence of reasonable excuse.</P>
      <P>The section is good and is reasonably balanced as it stands.  But I believe the Minister is tilting it much too far into the area of unanswerable conduct.  It makes it virtually impossible for a person to comply with the section as the Minister proposes to amend it.  I suggest to him that he leave it as it is.  If he decides not to do so, I will not press the matter; but I think it is grossly over-borne in the amended form.</P>

      <P>The Workers' Party are concerned about this provision which allows for the hearing of proceedings <i>in camera.</i> The wording of the section is &ldquo;in the interest of public order or security&rdquo;. We make the proposition that it is inconceivable that public order could be in any way thwarted or impinged upon, or could national security be impinged upon, by proceedings being heard openly in the context of this legislation particularly as we have been told by the Minister that <Col N="2058" /> nothing in this legislation shall have any bearing on military aerodromes or any facilities under the responsibility of the Minister for Defence.</P>
      <P>On the basis that we cannot envisage a situation arising where the interest of public order or security would ever be such as to require the time honoured principle of proceedings to be heard in open court, where people are openly accused and have the opportunity in the presence of the public to be heard in their own defence, to be departed from.  This is a piece of civil legislation dealing with the civil regulation of civil facilities. There should be a need for any court proceedings to be heard <i>in camera.</i> It is a time honoured and golden principle of our criminal and civil law that all matters be heard as far as is practicable in public and open to public access.  For that reason we are opposing the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>This section was amended after the debate in the Seanad.  Section 19 empowers the court, on the application of the Minister for Tourism and Transport, to hear proceedings or part thereof <i>in camera</i>, where warranted by reasons of public order or security, in relation to the exercise of any power by the Minister under Part II of the Bill, that is, provisions to promote security and safety of civil aviation and other provisions in relation to aerodromes and aircraft.</P>
      <P>This section is so worded as to enable the High Court, for example, to hear <i>in camera</i> any appeal, or part of an appeal, against the exercise by the Minister or any of his powers under Part II of this Bill.  Deputy McCartan mentioned people's constitutional rights.  There is an automatic constitutional right to appeal to the High Court against the exercise of the statutory powers and, therefore, no separate provision for such appeals is required in the Bill.  With all due respects to my legal and learned friend, is this section being misread?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is not acceptable.  It would preclude the court from hearing <i>in camera</i> proceedings, or part of proceedings &mdash; that is important &mdash; concerning the exercise of functions by the <Col N="2059" /> Minister under Part II of the Bill even if the court were satisfied that such a course was desirable in the interest of public order or security.  Considering the amendment, the earlier debate on it, and the section in its entirety, I can only come to one conclusion and that is that the amendment is not acceptable and I hope the Deputy will understand why from my explanation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to amend the section; I am opposing it in its entirety because I do not believe there are conceivable circumstances where, in the interest of public order or security relating to the civil facilities of our aerodromes, proceedings should be heard behind closed doors.  I ask the Minister specifically if he could give us an instance that would require such a very fundamental departure from the principle that proceedings of all civil or criminal cases be heard in public.</P>
      <P>All judges sitting have residual authority with regard to the conduct of their proceedings in court.  If an unusual circumstance arose in any case and a judge felt it was desirable that the court be cleared, he has the authority to do so.  To lay it down in legislation that it is the right of a Minister, who would be the moving party in this procedure, to elect to apply to a court to close the doors to the public is not a safe principle.  It is not tenable that I, or the Minister, could think of a circumstance where this would apply.  I do not see where public order could require our courts to be closed.  We are not a nation of security seekers.  We do not have that type of worry and, in any event, the Minister has excluded all aspects of security from his aegis or authority and, in addition, has excluded all military aerodromes from the operation of this legislation.  What effective security aspects has the Minister in mind?  Can he instance the desire or the need for this departure from a fundamental principle?</P>

      <P>I shall give one example. If a person or persons were charged before the courts in connection with a <Col N="2060" /> hijacking and if we reported the evidence given to the court, we would be writing a book on the procedure for the carrying out of a hijack for people to follow.  I hope that evidence of that sort would not be made public, in order to prevent the education of others in the carrying out of hijackings.</P>

      <P>Let me put a proposition to the Minister.  Would he then advocate that all armed robberies be heard <i>in camera</i> simply because the dissemination of the evidence as to how one robbery took place would equip all other potential robbers with the details of how to go about it?  There is a problem.  I put it as a challenge.  No other jurisdiction in which the principle of open courts and open hearings exists carries out this type of proceeding <i>in camera.</i> There might well be a different argument in other jurisdictions where military importance is given to installations.  I think the section has been borrowed rather quickly from legislation prepared in other jurisdictions that have different considerations.  I am not convinced by the Minister's example or by the arguments as to why we should depart from the time-honoured principle with regard to the conduct of criminal proceedings.  It is all too easy to decide to make all offences a strict liability to be heard behind closed doors.  Where would we go from there?</P>

The legal argument having taken place, the courts would then decide whether all or part of a case will be heard <i>in camera.</i> I indicated earlier, with all due respects to my learned legal friend, that it may be that the section is being misread.  It states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In any proceedings which relate to the exercise by the Minister of any power conferred on him by this Part, the Court may, on the application of <Col N="2061" /> the Minister, if it is satisfied that it is in the interests of public order or security so to do, order that the whole of the proceedings, or such part thereof as the Court considers appropriate, be heard otherwise than in public.</P>

He and the Minister for the Environment can consult and prohibit certain uses of land in the event of their deeming it to be necessary.  What is meant by &ldquo;for other purposes which are likely to attract a large number of birds into the area&rdquo;?  We all understand that tipheads attract a large number of birds. Could a circumstance be foreseen in which the Minister would issue an order prohibiting a farmer from sowing grain in his lands adjacent to an airport?

      <P>The closing of a tiphead is the function of another Department.  This section provides for a serious gap in the law in order to eliminate danger and disruption to air navigation by flocks of birds.  If common sense does not prevail, I am sure the Minister for Tourism and Transport would be required to apply the law to eliminate the danger to navigation. Our function is to ensure the safety of our aircraft and that is what this section deals with.</P>

The Department will use the powers under this Bill and section 27 deals with the <Col N="2064" /> dangers and their elimination as they arise.  If dangers arise from this tiphead &mdash; or any other tiphead &mdash; the legislation provides for the elimination of such dangers.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This section gives powers to authorise officers to have persons removed from aerodromes.  Section 31 (4) requires that a person who is ordered by an authorised officer to leave an aerodrome or part of an aerodrome or who was removed from an aerodrome or part of an aerodrome by an authorised officer shall not, on the same day, return to the aerodrome or <Col N="2065" /> the part of the aerodrome which he was ordered to leave or from which he was removed, as the case may be.  That is an unduly restrictive section.  The authorised officer may well have good grounds, for a variety of reasons, for asking a person to leave an aerodrome but it may be that that person has to leave the country on the same day.  Perhaps there would not be a flight which would suit him on the following day.  In this amendment, we are asking that the person may not return without the permission of an authorised officer.  In other words, if he approaches the authorities at the aerodrome and gets permission from an authorised officer to return then he should be enabled to do so.  It seems extraordinarily restrictive to apply the section as it stands.  It is a reasonable amendment and I ask the Minister to accept it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>The effect of the amendment is to allow a person to gain admittance to an aerodrome with the permission of an authorised officer on production of proof of identity on the same day as he or she was ordered out of or removed from the aerodrome by an authorised officer for failure to produce proof of identity, for example, to have forgotten a passport, airline tickets or baggage.  The amendment is acceptable provided that a comma is inserted before and after the words to be inserted.</P>

A month after the date on which Eolas were given that information the Minister for Tourism and Transport stated specifically, replying to a question, that Celtic Helicopters were not so licensed and that the restrictions on them still applied.

    <P>I should like to record my appreciation to the House for its prompt endorsement of this important Bill and the terms of the 1988 Montreal Protocol to the Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts against the Safety of Civil Aviation throughout the world.  The enactment of this Bill will clear the way for Ireland to be among the first states to ratify that Protocol.  Ireland co-sponsored the 1986 <Col N="2074" /> resolution of the International Civil Aviation Organisation which led to the preparation and settlement of the 1988 Protocol.  Its early ratification by Ireland should encourage all other states to ratify it without delay, all in the interests of security of international civil aviation. Ireland, therefore, will be urging the widest possible application of that Protocol.</P>
    <P>As the House is aware, Irish civil aviation has developed remarkably over the past year or so as a result of the dynamic policies of the Government and my Department.  The industry is now poised for even more significant growth with the commitment of further substantial public moneys to aviation infrastructures.  The greater responsiveness of airlines to customer needs, quality, reliability and security of air services are all of paramount importance.  All persons involved in the industry have a part to play in the achievement of the requisite high standards on all of those counts.  The Bill, when enacted, will empower the Minister for Tourism and Transport to vigorously pursue those issues vital to all aspects of Irish civil aviation.</P>

      <P>That Dáil Éireann approves the terms of</P>
      <P> (1) the Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer, 22nd March, 1985,</P>
      <P>(2) The Montreal Protocol on Substances that deplete the Ozone Layer, 16th September, 1987, and</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(3) the Protocol of 26th March, <Col N="2075" /> 1986, amending the Convention for the Protection of Marine Pollution from Land-Based Sources, 4th June, 1974 by the inclusion of provisions on the prevention of transatmospheric pollution,</P>
    <P>copies of which were laid before Dáil Éireann on 6th May, 1988.  </P>
    <P>These three international agreements have the common purpose of limiting air pollution of the kind which does not respect national boundaries but can have regional or even global effects.  Air pollution of this kind has been the subject of extensive discussion and regulatory activity in recent years.  At EC level action has been taken to limit air pollution from industrial plants and motor vehicles.  At the level of the Economic Commission for Europe in Geneva the emphasis has been on the reduction of overall national sulphur and nitrogen oxide emissions.  More recently, and because of the global nature of the problem, the United Nations Environment Programme UNEP has become involved and, under its auspices, the Vienna Convention and the Montreal Protocol, both of which are concerned with the protection of the ozone layer, have been negotiated.  I propose to deal first with these agreements which the Dáil is now being asked to approve.</P>
    <P>There has been growing concern over the past few years about the depletion of the ozone layer.  The discovery by scientists of a hole in the ozone layer over Antarctica each spring has been graphically illustrated in satellite images and shows the threat facing the earth's atmosphere. The main substances implicated are chemicals called chlorofluoro-carbons, commonly referred to as CFCs.  These are widely used as propellants in aerosols, in refrigerants and in the manufacture of foam plastics, such as the packaging used in the fast-food outlets.</P>
    <P>Ozone is a gas comprised of three oxygen atoms.  It surrounds the earth, protecting it and its inhabitants from the direct effects of the sun's rays.  Ozone is <Col N="2076" /> most dense in the atmosphere at level of 20-25 kilometres above the earth in a layer known as the stratosphere. However, even there, only one molecule in 100,000 is ozone.  It has been estimated that if all the ozone were collected at the earth's survace it would form a layer less that three millimetres thick, roughly one-tenth of an inch.  It is obvious, therefore, that even small changes in ozone concentrations could have major effects for life on earth by reducing the extent to which we are screened from the harmful ultraviolet rays of the sun.  It is this ultra-violet radiation which gives our skins a tan in summer.  As is now widely recognised, excessive exposure can result in increased skin cancers and eye diseases such as cataracts.  Animal health can also be adversely affected and crop yields reduced.  Increased ultraviolet radiation could also contribute to global warming, or the so called &ldquo;greenhouse effect&rdquo;, which could result in dramatically altered weather patterns, shifts in deserts and fertile regions and a rise in sea levels.</P>
    <P>Ozone is produced naturally from oxygen, high in the atmosphere, where strong radiation from the sun breaks up oxygen molecules.  Natural forces also break down ozone, with the result that the gas is being constantly created and destroyed.  The speed at which these reactions occur determines how much ozone is naturally present in the atmosphere at any given time.  But we now know that the presence of certain chemicals in the atmosphere can speed up the destruction of ozone.  In the early seventies researchers in the United States suggested that certain man-made long-lived compounds containing chlorine &mdash; in other terms CFCs &mdash; would penetrate the stratosphere and decompose; this would release chlorine, which in turn would speed up the destruction of ozone and deplete the ozone layer surrounding the earth.  Research and monitoring since the early eighties has shown the validity of the theory of the effects of chlorine on the ozone layer.  While some changes can be explained by seasonal and natural factors, it is clear that the release of CFCs to the atmosphere is the main problem.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2077" /> As I stated earlier, CFCs are used as propellants to force substances through the nozzles of aerosols.  They are also used as the refrigerant for refrigerators and air-conditioning systems, foam blowing for take-away cartons, and in insulation materials, including the foam used for cavity insulation in houses.  Some CFCs are also used in fire extinguishers for specialist uses, such as computer and electrical systems, and as solvents in the electronics industry.  These chemicals are released to the atmosphere during the manufacturing process, when aerosols are used, when fast-food containers are crushed, and when refrigerants leak.  As they are inert, they remain in the atmosphere for a long time.</P>
    <P>Research has already shown a reduction in the ozone layer surrounding the earth.  This reduction is mainly concentrated over Antarctica, but monitoring has indicated reductions in the Northern hemisphere as well.  High altitude aircraft, fitted out with special instruments, have been measuring the constituents of the upper atmosphere and analysis of the results has revealed an abundance of chlorine.  This supports the link between the presence of chlorine and the depletion of ozone, but many uncertainties remain to be resolved. What particular factors cause Antarctica to be most affected?  How exactly does chlorine affect the chemical processes in the atmosphere?  Valuable international research is continuing on these and other issues.</P>
    <P>Changes in the ozone layer will have effects throughout the world, changes which will not be limited by national boundaries.  It is essential, therefore, that countries co-operate extensively with one another in international efforts to resolve the problems.  In 1985, the Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer was concluded under the auspices of the United Nations Environmental Programme.  The Convention is essentially a framework one; in other words, its obligations were expressed in general terms but it envisaged more specific measures being negotiated as Protocols <Col N="2078" /> to it.  The Convention provides for international co-operation in research, monitoring and exchange of data, and it obliges states which are a party to it to adopt legislative or administrative measures to control, limit or reduce activities found to have adverse modifying effects on the ozone layer.</P>
    <P>Within the Convention framework, the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer was concluded in September 1987.  The Protocol contains measures to control the use of the eight substances regarded as having the greatest potential for depleting the ozone layer.  The substances involved are five CFC's and three halons, compounds which also contain chlorine.  The controls on these substances apply to their production, consumption, import and export.  As regards CFC's, the main measures involve stabilisation by 1989 of consumption at 1986 levels, a reduction of 20 per cent on these levels by 1993 and a reduction of a further 30 per cent by 1998.  Consumption of halons must be stabilised at 1986 levels by 1992.  Parties to the Protocol will be prohibited from importing the controlled substances from third countries and parallel controls will apply in relation to the production of CFC's and halons.</P>
    <P>Ireland must support the aims and objectives of both the Vienna Convention and the Montreal Protocol. Ireland did not sign the Convention during the limited period it was open for signature because the enactment of the Air Pollution Act, 1987, which contained extensive statutory powers for the control of air pollution was then imminent. However, we are now committed to completing all the procedures necessary to allow us to accede to the Vienna Convention and sign and ratify the Montreal Protocol in the autumn.</P>
    <P>The Air Pollution Act, 1987, provides all the statutory powers necessary to meet our obligations under the Convention and Protocol.  It contains a general provision in section 24 requiring the use of the best practicable means to limit and if possible to prevent emissions.  In <Col N="2079" /> addition, section 23, dealing with the prohibition of certain emissions, was drafted specifically with the Convention and Protocol in mind.  It enables the Minister for the Environment, by regulations, to prohibit the production, treatment, use, import, placing on the market, distribution or sale of any substance, other than a fuel, which may cause air pollution. The general provisions of the Act in regard to research and monitoring are also relevant.  In addition to statutory measures, the option of administrative measures is available; indeed EC decisions of 1980 and 1982 on a reduction in the use of CFC's in aerosols were implemented effectively here by a voluntary agreement with industry.  I look forward to, and indeed confidently expect, the co-operation of industry in the implementation of the international agreements, the terms of which I am now asking Dáil Éireann to approve.</P>
    <P>As the world's major producer of CFC's, responsible for some 57 per cent of total world output, the European Communities, represented by the Commission, played an important role in the negotiation of the Montreal Protocol. Indeed, the Protocol provides that the required controls may be observed jointly by the EC as a whole rather than at the level of individual member states.  A draft regulation has now been proposed by the Commission limiting both Community imports of controlled substances and the quantities of these substances which may be produced within the EC for Community use.  This would gradually restrict the supply of controlled substances within the EC and encourage the speedier development of alternative products. The proposed regulation would bear directly on producers and users of CFC's within the Community and, save perhaps for technical measures to facilitate inspection and enforcement, would satisfy the control requirements of the Protocol for the Community as a whole, without the need to use national legislation. However, as I said earlier, adequate national measures could be developed, if needs be, by regulations <Col N="2080" /> under section 23 of the Air Pollution Act, 1987.</P>
    <P>CFC's and halons are not manufactured in Ireland and our overall use of these substances is small.  For example, our 1986 annual consumption of CFC's was about 1,200 tonnes or only about 0.4 per cent of EC consumption.  Use of CFC's for aerosol manufacturing here has continued to decline since 1975 and Ireland has more than observed a 30 per cent cutback enjoined in the EC decisions of 1980 and 1982.  Some 95 per cent of the CFC's and halons used in Ireland are imported from Community countries, principally the UK and the Netherlands.</P>
    <P>I do not anticipate that implementation of the convention and Protocol will pose particular problems for Ireland.  The fact that controls will apply on a world-wide scale should encourage the timely development of alternative substances to replace diminishing quotas of the CFC's and halons regulated by the Protocol and thus avoid real problems for industry.</P>
    <P>I believe that the Montreal Protocol can most effectively be implemented within the European Communities by means of the binding regulation now proposed. For this reason, I strongly supported the Commission's proposals in this regard at the last Environment Council meeting in March.  I was pleased that there was general support for the Commission proposal although some of the details remain to be ironed out.  The Council will be considering the regulation again at its meeting on 16 June in Luxembourg and today's debate in this House, is, therefore, a very timely one.</P>
    <P>It is the intention that the Montreal Protocol would come into force on 1 January 1989.  However, for this to come about, the Vienna Convention must be in force and the Protocol must have been ratified by at least 11 countries representing two-thirds of the 1985 world consumption of the controlled substances. The Environment Ministers of the European Communities have committed themselves, therefore, to completing all necessary national and Community procedures so that the EC and all its member states can ratify the Vienna Convention <Col N="2081" /> and Montreal Protocol this autumn.  It is important, therefore, that I should be in a position to tell my colleagues in Europe that the Irish Parliament has approved of the terms of this important Convention and Protocol.</P>
    <P>When the EC regulation has been adopted, as I expect it may be at the next Environment Council meeting on 16 June, I will be able to complete the remaining procedures to allow for Ireland's participation in these international agreements.  As I stated already, most of the obligations arising are likely to be dealt with under the EC regulation but some ancillary action may be necessary here.  I expect also that research and monitoring will be developed in Ireland. Already some research is being carried out at UCD and UCG, and I am anxious that this should be continued and developed.</P>
    <P>I am aware of calls for banning the use of CFC's in aerosols.  I believe, however, that the controls on production and consumption to be introduced under the Montreal Protocol will lead quickly to CFC's being used only for purposes for which alternatives cannot be found. Accordingly, I am confident that the decline in the use of CFC's in aerosols will accelerate as alternative substances are developed.  Public awareness of the issues will help to accelerate this decline in consumption and I intend, therefore, to devote some attention to this aspect in the coming months.</P>
    <P>There have also been calls for the labelling of aerosols containing CFC's.  This would be difficult to apply unilaterally in Ireland as the majority of aerosols used here are imported.  However, I welcome recent statements from some multinational manufacturers of their intention not to use CFCs in their products and to label their products as CFC-free.  At the Environment Council in March, the Commissioner responsible for environmental issues stated that the Commission was examining the possibility of introducing a Community label for CFC-free products.  I believe that this would probably be the most effective way forward, given that most of our aerosols are <Col N="2082" /> imported.  I will, however, keep the situation under review and if there are no early developments at Community level, I will be considering other possibilities.</P>
    <P>Environmental protection should not be dependent solely on Government regulation.  As individuals we are all responsible for the quality of our environment and in our daily lives we should exercise the options which are favourable to the environment.  Therefore, I would strongly urge all my colleagues in the House and all consumers to consider whether or not they really need to buy certain products in the form of aerosols which use CFCs.  Many toiletries are available in formats other than aerosols. Where the consumer prefers to buy an aerosol, he or she should ask if it is CFC-free and thereby help to create demand for such products.  Many aerosols, such as furniture polish and hairsprays, are available CFC-free.  This is one of the areas where we can take responsibility ourselves for the quality of our environment.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the Convention for the Protection of Marine Pollution from Land-Based Sources, commonly known as the Paris Convention, which was concluded in recognition of the need for concerted international action to protect the marine environment.  The Convention requires contracting states to take action under a number of headings.  There is a general obligation to take all possible steps to prevent pollution of the sea from land-based sources through the introduction by man, directly or indirectly, of substances or energy which cause hazards to human health, living resources and marine ecosystems, or damage to amenities, or interference with other legitimate uses of the sea.  In particular, measures are required to be taken so as to achieve the elimination, if necessary by stages, of pollution caused by certain persistent and toxic substances and the reduction of pollution by other less noxious substances. In addition, contracting states are required to forestall, and as appropriate, eliminate pollution by radioactive substances, including wastes.</P>
    <P>With the growing awareness of the <Col N="2083" /> effects of transboundary air pollution, it was decided that the Paris Convention should be amended to include measures on the prevention of marine pollution from the atmosphere.  Accordingly, a Protocol was adopted in April 1986 extending the provisions of the Paris Convention to the prevention of marine pollution from atmospheric sources.  The Protocol is in the nature of a framework agreement and was signed on behalf of Ireland in June, 1986.  It allows the Commission which administers the Convention to develop proposals and carry out research to protect the marine environment from pollution from atmospheric sources and, together with the original Convention, will enable comprehensive measures to be taken to protect the marine environment from pollution from all sources.  The Air Pollution Act, 1987 enables us to meet our obligations under the Protocol.</P>
    <P>Since the Protocol was agreed in 1986, work has been concentrated on research projects on atmospheric inputs to the sea. There is no evidence that Irish emissions contribute to any significant extent to acid deposition in other European countries and this is also true in relation to atmospheric imputs to the sea.  It is likely that any specific measures which may be adopted by the Paris Commission under the Protocol will be closely aligned to the provisions of the air pollution directives already adopted by the EC and implementation here should not create difficulties.</P>
    <P>This motion is before the House today because of the requirements of Article 29, sub-article 5.2, of the Constitution under which the State shall not be bound by any international agreement involving a charge upon public funds unless the terms of the agreement shall have been approved by Dáil Éireann.  A charge on public funds arises indirectly from these international agreements and relates only to our proportionate contributions to the cost of administering the agreements. The annual liability in the initial years is likely to be of the order of £3,000 in respect of the Vienna Convention and <Col N="2084" /> Montreal Protocol, and about £2,000 in respect of the Paris Protocol.  These payments will be financed from the Environment Vote.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The need for the motion before the House today serves well to bring home to us the fact that so often what we regard as normal activity or development can have a harmful effect on the environment.  We in the developed world can be quite uncaring about the effect of our activities on the environment of the wider world.  It is interesting that until recent times very few people using aerosols or the inert gases in the various ways which the Minister described would have realised that they were contributing towards the inevitable break-up of the earth's atmosphere.  In the past few years it has been coming home to all of us that the use of what have come to be regarded as normal everyday household goods are a source of pollution and that everyone who uses them contributes to that pollution with its disastrous effects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister in this introductory remarks referred to the fact that the European Commission have concerned themselves primarily in recent years with the question of transboundary pollution from national sulphur and nitrogen oxide emissions.  Whilst the debate this evening is not primarily concerned with these matters, the fact that the Minister referred to them and that they have been the subject of some debate in this House merits the point being made that despite our contention that this country's overall contribution to the European level of pollution from sulphur and nitrogen oxide <Col N="2085" /> emissions is relatively small, the example given in relation to the ozone layer is a salutary lesson for us.  Despite our contention that the emissions from Moneypoint and our national emissions represent only a minuscule amount of the emissions in the EC generally, we are nonetheless a contributor to that pollution. I wonder about the validity of our excuse or explanation that as we are by far the smallest contributor in European terms there does not devolve upon us the same obligation that ought to fall on the more heavily industrialised nations.</P>
    <P>My remarks are particularly appropriate in the context of any further development at Moneypoint.  I know that the estimated cost of eliminating atmospheric pollution from Moneypoint is regarded as being prohibitive but it is fair to say that the technology in relation to combating atmospheric pollution is improving and changing rapidly.  There are now steps which can be taken which fall short of the ideal and they are less costly.  In that regard it behoves us to see, in relation to any further development at Moneypoint, that it is obligatory &mdash; bearing in mind the sort of debate we are now engaged in &mdash; that the highest possible standards are built into the costings for Moneypoint or any similar development, and that we progressively endeavour to retrofit or to use different types of fuel at Moneypoint which would reduce the levels of sulphur emissions which occur there at present.  At least in relation to those emissions we know that they contribute in a deleterious way to atmospheric pollution and that our contribution represents a small part of the general pollution of the atmosphere over the greater Europe.</P>
    <P>I saw recently a contention that Swedish sources claimed that a major part of their atmospheric pollution, from the point of view of acid rain, had been traced by them to a source somewhere in Southern Ireland adjoining the Shannon. Regarding the validity of that claim, I cannot comment; but it is interesting to speculate on the geographic location which they had pinpointed and the proximity of that location to Moneypoint. <Col N="2086" /> Despite our contention that our emission in relative terms is quite small, it is interesting for us&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>We should endeavour to give a lead to our more industrialised colleagues in Europe by taking advantage of the fact that we produce in overall terms a relatively small level, about 76,000 tons, of sulphuric emissions annually. We should address ourselves to that problem and progressively try to have it eliminated.  I must confess that during my time in Government it was a source of some concern to me that we endeavoured as it were to fight, mainly on behalf of the ESB, a rearguard action to protect decisions which they had made and which they now claimed would represent an excessive cost to rectify.  From my recollection I think the suggestion was that to absolutely eliminate the emissions from Moneypoint would represent an overall increase of some 15 per cent in the cost of electricity.  It was difficult to deny that that was factually correct.  It was equally difficult to understand why that costing had not been taken into account when the decisions were being made in relation to the siting and building of Moneypoint in the first instance and why measures to combat that degree of pollution had not been built into the overall costings and the projections as to the <Col N="2087" /> effect on electricity prices.  It is an expensive lesson for us and our European colleagues to have learned.  I would earnestly counsel in relation to any further developments of that type or at that site that we should learn from them. There is an onus on the incumbent in the Custom House to ensure that in any proposed or projected developments far more stringent standards are applied in the future.  Perhaps the lesson of the damage to the ozone layer, which was not apparent until recently, and perhaps was not so apparent when Moneypoint was being built in relation to those types of emissions, would come much more to the forefront of our minds and that we would realise that things which we have now come to take for granted in the developed world are of themselves contributing to the inexorable damage of our worldwide environment.</P>
      <P>It is difficult for us in Ireland to envisage the concept of this extraordinary ozone layer, this skin which stretches right around the entire global ball and which is of such a sensitive&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and delicate nature that emissions from aerosols and refrigeration plants and, indeed, from such apparently simple things as the foam containers used to pack take-away fast foods could collectively contribute in such a way that the nations of the world have suddenly realised that all of us have contributed to the damage of this skin.  The Minister suggested that this ozone layer represents a skin around the world of less than one-tenth of an inch in diameter and through what most of us would have regarded as simple everyday activities the world has collectively damaged that skin in a way that apparently cannot be repaired, but is permanent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The collective attempt through the adoption of the Conventions and the Protocol is to limit any further dangers or damage, not to rectify what has been done, but to try to contain and prevent that damage becoming any greater, <Col N="2088" /> damage which would result in an effect upon human and animal health and plant life and upon the environment in various countries of the world.  It is interesting to reflect that we should be discussing the adoption of this Convention and Protocol a week after the world powers had met and congratulated themselves on taking steps to try to eliminate the threat to the world through the military activities of the world powers.  Yet in a far greater way the ordinary everyday activities of individuals, sponsored by the consumer society, has in many respects created a greater danger to the world than the threat posed by the military activities and developments of world powers.  It brings home to us again that all of us are contributors to the environment in which we live and all of us are contributors to the interference with or damage or danger to that environment.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that the Air Pollution Act, which was eventually implemented by the Government last year and which had originally been sponsored by the previous Government, had made provision, as the Minister referred to, for, if necessary, statutory regulations to be made which would allow for certain Government moves to prevent activities which foster emissions such as this.  It is equally pleasing to note that there was previously a voluntary agreement regarding the use of aerosols.  I cannot help wondering, in relation to the Minister's remarks, if the mandatory labelling of aerosols which are CFC free should be given greater consideration. I would have thought that because we are a relatively small community we would have a relatively simpler task in informing that community of dangers or opportunities.</P>
    <P>It might well be that our best contribution to reducing the level of CFCs used in this country would be through a relatively inexpensive &mdash; I am talking in terms of a couple of hundred thousand pounds &mdash; public information campaign which would bring home to people through the use mainly of the visual media, television and radio, what damage can be caused by ordinary everyday items.  I would have thought that <Col N="2089" /> there was an opportunity in this country to carry out such a public information campaign perhaps more readily and successfully than in larger countries.  The answer may be given that because we are smaller we contribute less to the problem, but each of us has our relative responsibilities; and, if we can carry out ours, we can perhaps with a clearer conscience demand of larger polluters and larger colleague countries that they in relative terms carry out their responsibilities too.  The Minister ought to pursue the idea of promoting an EC sponsored label which would indicate aerosols which are CFC free and I urge him to pursue that actively at European level.</P>
    <P>In relation to the final Protocol regarding the prevention of marine pollution from land-based sources, which is the last subject of the motion, although the Protocol refers to marine pollution from atmospheric sources originating from land-based sources, it is difficult not to reflect upon the Paris Convention and this Protocol and the great difficulties and dangers we face in relation to levels of pollution in the Irish Sea &mdash; carried out to a large extent by our neighbouring country.  I remind the Minister of the very clear and categorical undertaking which he and his colleagues gave when in Opposition to ensure that any further pollution of the Irish Sea from Britain, and specifically from nuclear plants emitting waste water into the Irish Sea, would be prevented, stopped and eliminated by his party upon assuming power.  We have seen just how little has been achieved in that area in the last year and a half.</P>
    <P>In the adoption of a Protocol regarding marine pollution from land-based sources it is relevant that we ask the Minister to explain to the House just what level of success the Government have had in persuading the British authorities to desist from the continuation of the operation of Sellafield at its present level of pollution and its present rate of discharge into the Irish Sea, because very clear undertakings were given by his colleagues and, I suspect, by himself when the Minister's party were in Opposition.  Now after a <Col N="2090" /> reasonable time has elapsed it is appropriate to ask to what extent the Government have lived up to those undertakings solemnly given in relation to Sellafield and other sources of marine pollution of the Irish Sea emanating from the other side of the water.</P>
    <P>The effect of the Minister inviting us to agree to the adoption of this motion is to bring home to us the great advantages of technology and how technology has assisted, changed, promoted and made our lives easier; yet, on the other hand, that technology and its introduction and inventions that have assisted us often can have a detrimental effect upon our environment and way of life in a way we might not easily or lightly understand.  The example of the use of aerosols, so much an everyday matter, and now the knowledge and realisation of the dreadful effect they have had progressively on the ozone layer surrounding the earth, brings home to us that in many respects things we take for granted, or which when criticised we are inclined to defend and insist have no harmful effect whatsoever, are not always as simple as they might seem and perhaps we should be more questioning and careful and consequently more caring about our environment and the world around us.  Often something we may do here may not affect us but may affect some neighbouring country or a country quite some distance away and perhaps for that reason we may have the idea that it is of no great relevance or concern to us.  If all the world and its individual countries adopted that attitude, of course the effect upon each country of the world through the ignorance or uncaring attitude of their neighbours would be disastrous.</P>
    <P>This country in its legislation has in recent years an admirable record of care in relation to environmental protection. It behoves us to see this motion adopted and to pursue at European and UNO levels the goal of ensuring that all countries are aware of and make their individual people and citizens aware of the precious jewel a clean, healthy environment is and how important it is that each of us at individual, national and <Col N="2091" /> international level contributes to ensuring that is so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I commend the Minister for introducing this measure this evening and for taking the opportunity which arose on the Order of Business to have this matter dealt with and have the terms of the Convention and Protocol approved.  As the Minister has outlined, the issue is extremely serious and I hope our approving of the measures involved will assist in galvanising public interest here and making a contribution to galvanising international public interest in relation to environmental matters generally and particularly this extremely serious issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, the Minister might take the opportunity of going a little further. Although he is reluctant to go as far as introducing a ban on the sale or importation of aerosol sprays and foam based packaging which incorporate chlorofluorocarbons, he should consider such.  It seems unreasonable to continue by act or omission to endorse the sale of these sprays and various forms of packaging containing this gas when they are contributing to the depletion of the ozone layer.  The Minister might take on this issue not merely in terms of endorsing an international agreement in a retrospective and supportive manner but by giving a lead and saying we in this country <Col N="2092" /> believe that it is not acceptable or desirable to import such goods or market them for sale and any goods we so import or sell should be free of CFCs.  I think that is not an unreasonable suggestion and I recommend it to the Minister as an avenue of approach.</P>
    <P>Rather than a worthy but very limited appeal such as we are hearing here this evening, late on a quiet Thursday afternoon, perhaps his appeal to consumer organisations and the Irish Housewives Association and other might be more fulsome and broad based.  I suggest he might invite in for a discussion the Consumers' Association of Ireland and the Irish Housewives Association and ask them to co-operate with him in educating their members to avoid wherever possible purchasing such products and in heightening awareness so that effectively there is a consumer boycott of such products. However, that can be done only if the Minister grapples with the issue of insisting on there being a labelling requirement on such products.  That labelling requirement is applied to a range of other products more usually by his colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, but most of our goods are imported and the practicalities of labelling do not impose insuperable problems for the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>
    <P>I see no reason in principle why we should not insist here that the consumer is educated and able to make an informed choice by seeing on the shelves preferably only the CFC free product.  Where the other product is on the shelf at least one of them should be labelled so that the consumer can make a choice.  The Minister recommended that the consumer ask which was which.  The average retailer will not be able to answer that question if there is not such a label and accordingly the appeal will fall on deaf ears.  In an area like this is it not unreasonable to ask the Minister, and the Government to give a lead.  I would be interested in hearing the Minister's reaction to my suggestion that he should invite to meet him the major organisations representing consumer interests and put it to them that they should join with him in doing what <Col N="2093" /> they can to lead the public interest in this respect.</P>
    <P>It is my belief, because of the enormity of the international problem involved, that the Government should give a lead internationally.  Ireland still has a marketing edge in the environmental area. The country is still seen as a leader environmentally.  There is a wonderful opportunity for the Minister not just to ban, reduce or contain the problem within our own shores but to raise his voice in a vehement way at every international forum available to him on this and other environmental issues.  I have no doubt he would be listened to.  We should use all opportunities, whether it is the agenda of the Anglo-Irish Agreement in relation to Sellafield, or the various European institutions, to highlight an issue like this.  We should not lose sight of the potential of our involvement at various levels to push forward the frontiers of environmental improvement, education and awareness internationally. We are not pursuing those opportunities at present.</P>
    <P>The seriousness of the problem is not fully understood by the public.  The most recent scientific research shows that the likelihood of a sharp increase in the incidence of skin cancer is very serious due to damage caused by CFCs in weakening the atmosphere's ozone layer which shields us from excessive ultra-violet radiation.  There is international scientific alarm &mdash; alarm is not too strong a word &mdash; at the discovery in recent years of ozone holes at the Arctic and Antarctic circles.  That hole is growing at a rapid pace and that is extremely worrying from the point of view of the future of human and other forms of life on the planet. That would be the logical and inevitable extension of what we are talking about.</P>
    <P>Indeed, scientists tell us that if there was an immediate cessation of all production and sale of CFC products it would still take 100 years before the effects of the present ozone depletion would be healed or remedied.  In some respects we are approaching the outer limits of the <Col N="2094" /> planet's environmental capacity for self-regeneration and that is a frightening thought.</P>
    <P>The Minister, and the Government, could have had this Convention and Protocol before us earlier than today.  The Minister advanced the Air Pollution Bill as the reason for the delay but it is fair to point out that some 50 other countries found no difficulty in signing this international agreement before now.  We have yet to sign the agreement and ratify its conditions.  That is regrettable.  Instead of being dragged in at the tail-end of a list of countries, we should try to be to the forefront particularly where we can give a clear and unambiguous message by virtue of our own industrial record.</P>
    <P>I am told that last year we imported in excess of 700 tonnes of CFCs and that our next door neighbour produces an estimated 700 million aerosol cans each year, two-thirds of which contain CFCs. Unquestionably, in the context of these islands, there is a serious and sigificant problem to be faced and contributions are being made to this systematic undermining and devaluation of our environment. It is one that has to stop.</P>
    <P>The Minister might consider making direct approaches to Irish-based subsidiary companies, representing multinational corporations, engaged in the manufacture of CFC.  I have every expectation that there is &mdash; I would hope an Irish entrepreneur or manufacturer &mdash; a person who will develop a CFC -free aerosol.  We should give every encouragement and assistance to such an entrepreneur so that we can in our own way not make just a legislative but an industrial contribution to redressing the problem that confronts us.</P>
    <P>The problem is one of a series of facets of environmental issues with which we are confronted.  Unfortunately, being on the periphery of a large industrial bloc and being relatively powerless in numerical or economical terms, we are getting more than our fair share of adverse spinoff from the point of view of industrial pollution and environmental degradation whether it is in the context of the <Col N="2095" /> depletion of the ozone layer, the dumping of toxic waste around our coast, the dumping of radioactive materials in the Irish Sea or the attempt by the Spanish Government to incinerate at sea off our south-west coast.  There is a serious risk to this country and somehow we will have to ensure that our voice is more forceful and is heard at international fora.  In that context the Minister should entertain the possibility of approaching countries of a similar size that may have to deal with similar problems to see to what extent, with as much political and economic clout we can muster, we can unite in a campaign to counteract environmental degradation. We should try to take on some of the economic giants of the world.  Certainly, standing alone our voice would be relatively puny but if we co-operate with other countries who face similar challenges we could get places in this respect.</P>
    <P>A range of scientific and medical experts have told us in detail about the problem of CFCs and the atmosphere and those interested in this matter should check out their reports.  There is no doubt we are dealing with a serious problem.  I have been told that the number of parts per billion of CFCs in the ozone layer has increased by 50 per cent since the early seventies.  In other words, there has been a 50 per cent reduction in the protective shield that encompasses the earth since the early seventies and I presume that that rate of degeneration has increased. Unfortunately, each 1 per cent loss of that ozone layer yields, we are told, a 5 per cent to 7 per cent increase in the incidence of skin cancer.  This is not just a question of medical effects or of skin cancer.  The truth is it is unlikely we could have anticipated that we would have this problem but is is probably the case that there will be other by-products or medical side-effects arising from the wanton and widespread use of such processes.  I can see serious implications for animal life, for the food chain and other aspects of the environment in which we live and on which we depend.</P>
    <P>The Government should lead an international environmental campaign to seek <Col N="2096" /> the outright banning of the international manufacture of CFCs unless they are absolutely essential and non-replaceable in certain key areas.  Frankly, I do not believe that that is the case.  If we are serious about this we can provide the scientific ingenuity to replace them with products that will not cause such damage. We do not have the right to inflict such fundamental environmental damage on a thin envelope which protects this generation, and generations yet unborn.  We do not have the right to use up the scarce resource which would shield and nurture future generations but unfortunately, we are doing that.  Any action on our part which contributes to that is morally wrong and should be politically corrected at the earliest opportunity.</P>
    <P>I am very pleased that we will be a signatory to these Protocols.  I am concerned that the necessary regulations to give effect to the implications of some of these Protocols may not be put in place quickly or readily enough.  I am aware that, as the Minister said in his speech, the Air Pollution Act, 1987, provides all the statutory powers necessary to meet our obligations under the Convention and Protocol.  It contains a general provision, in section 24, requiring the use of the best practicable means to limit and if possible to prevent emissions.  He also stated that it enables the Minister for the Environment, by regulations, to prohibit the production, treatment, use and so on of various products.  The Act facilitates the Minister in making regulations; but, if the regulations are not made, then the Act is obviously pointless and will not be effective.  I was struck by the fact that it took 14 years before regulations were made in regard to the Planning Acts.  I would like a commitment from the Minister that because of the seriousness of this issue the regulations necessary to give effect to the collective wish of this House, and I am sure of the people in this respect, will be made forthwith.  Every possible action should be put in place to ensure that we achieve as rapidly as possible the intent of the Convention and Protocol involved.  Otherwise, it will be a pointless exercise.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2097" /> There are other issues, which we may discuss on another day, in relation to the alleged greenhouse effect on the environment of the various matters that we inject into the atmosphere, including the heat content and so on, which have serious and scientifically verifiable consequences for all of us on this planet.  There is nothing more fundamental than what is at the heart of this issue.  All other economic and social issues recede into relative insignificance when you are confronted with a fundamental global challenge of taking every step possible to protect the very fragile life-raft on which all of us depend.  If this mini debate and the Minister's intiative this afternoon helps to take us a little way along that path, then I welcome it, particularly if the Minister follows through by making the appropriate regulations, by galvanising public opinion and by taking whatever action is open to him to discourage or outrightly ban the sale of these products immediately.  Above all, he should do everything he can to alert anyone who is purchasing or retailing them that we do not need this kind of product and that on the contrary the sale or purchase of such products is a contribution to the degeneration of a very limited and a very finite resource.</P>

      <P>I will start by complimenting the Minister and the Department of the Environment for bringing forward this item and for availing of the time that became available to deal with it.  I thank the Minister for the very comprehensive speech he has prepared for us.  There is no division in this House on this matter and the Labour Party will be supporting the three items set out in the Minister's motion.  I am not going to repeat what has been said already.  Spaceship Earth is the only ship that most of us are going to travel upon, and for those of us who do not think that we are going anywhere else after we end on this ship it is particularly important&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>There are a number of ozone layers under threat at present and the political ozone layers of a few parties in this House is also under threat.  I am going to be very brief because other speakers wish to contribute.  By virtue of my spokesmanship on behalf of the Labour Party I have been called.  I congratulate the Minister on his initiative in this area.  I would like him to be in a position to be able to say categorically and authoritatively on 16 June at the Environment Council that he has the full and enthusiastic support of this House for an effective prohibition or ban or whatever is deemed to be the most efficient way possible of reducing the CFCs.  This is a rich man's disease.  The products of CFCs are effectively the products of a consumer society.  We are rich enough within the European Community to deal with this problem.  I do not think you can deal with these matters with national measures.  Increasingly, as we approach 1992, the option of looking for national measures will be severely reduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I would favour a banning, I recognise that within the context of the Community the most efficient and effective way such a banning can be put into place is through the harnessing of the energies of the Environmental Council. All the concerns that I and the Labour Party share in relation to the vulnerability of the earth's atmosphere and the fact that the rich countries of the world are now the major threat to its survival are already on the record.  In many respects, as Deputy Boland has said, the real threat posed daily by the pollutant use of CFCs in other atmosphere is far more real <Col N="2099" /> in its damage than the threat that the possible use of nuclear weapons might pose.</P>
    <P>In recognition that there are other speakers in the Chamber who wish to contribute, in conclusion I compliment the Minister and wish him well on 16 June.  I hope that he will have time in the Dáil, either on his return or in the autumn, to report comprehensively on how he proposes to use the Air Pollution Act, 1987, to administer in part the provisions set out in the three Conventions and Protocols we are adopting.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I wholeheartedly welcome this debate.  There is an obvious all-party consensus on it.  In the spirit of the debate so far, I will not detain the House too long.  It is quite obvious that this is a serious matter when the United Nations have become involved.  Through their environmental programme they brought about the Vienna Convention in 1985 and the Montreal Protocol, both of which have been negotiated.  It is absolutely essential that the Dáil approves the terms of this Convention and Protocol.</P>
      <P>Every young child is aware of the hole in the ozone layer over Antartica each spring and that indicates the awareness, in this country in particular, of this issue and the dangers that will result if action is not taken globally.  To follow on what Deputy Quinn has said, the solution lies in acting as a Community because it is a Community issue.  We are all aware that the cause of the problem is the substance known as CFCs.  That is a very common substance, as has been pointed out by Deputy Boland.  It includes aerosols, refrigerants and plastic fast food containers. I propose, and I presume it would have agreement, that we harness this awareness by following up with a very comprehensive educational programme in our schools.  As I have said, young children are aware of this issue and we must simply follow through with a positive environmental educational programme in our schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on the scientific nature of his address.  Much work has <Col N="2100" /> gone into this speech.  It is one of the most comprehensive speeches I have heard in my short term in this Dáil.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>This whole issue deals with life itself.  As we know, small changes in the ozone layer can alter weather patterns and that in itself points up how serious this matter is.  There are practical measures that we can take.  Under the Montreal Protocol parties are prohibited from importing controlled substances from third countries and parallel controls will apply to the production of CFCs and halons.  The bottom line is that, had we not introduced the Air Pollution Act, we could not follow through with this Convention and Protocol and the Paris Convention.  Again, I compliment the Minister on bringing to the Dáil the Air Pollution Act, 1987.  We can now meet our obligations under the Convention and the Protocol.  The co-operation of industry is obviously most important in implementing the agreement and I welcome the progress to date in that area.</P>
      <P>It is a frightening statistic to see that the EC are responsible for 57 per cent of the total production of CFCs.  That points out the urgency of acting as a community to tackle this problem.  Under the Protocol controls may be observed jointly by the EC rather than by individual countries. It is time we started looking, as a Community, to alternative products.</P>
      <P>When we had the nuclear debate we talked about an EC inspectorate.  This is something I have advocated for a long time.  This must be followed through by the EC, because obviously the British nuclear industry are not listening to us. Only this morning I read in <i>The Irish Times</i> three or four different stories on the dangers and developments in the nuclear industry along the west coast of Britain.  This shows that, unless we get our act together as a European movement to tackle this problem, whether it be in relation to the ozone layer or the nuclear industry, which are obviously related, we will get nowhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We do not produce CFCs or halons in <Col N="2101" /> this country.  That means we are in an ideal position to lead in Europe.  I have often said that we have not taken advantage of our clean environment.  Looking across this Chamber I know many Deputies who have waited for this debate and have taken a very keen interest in protecting and developing our environment. The Minister has done a lot of good work to ensure that our rivers and lakes, as well as our atmosphere are kept clean. With the positive image we are creating abroad, backed by action at home, we are in a very fortunate position when it comes to speaking at a meeting of an environmental council and leading in this issue.</P>
    <P>I too, support the proposal to label aerosols containing CFCs.  We are told the Commission are examining the possibility of introducing a Community label for CFCs.  That would be a very positive step forward.  I support Deputy Quinn's proposal that the Minister go to Europe with the backing of the House as a whole.</P>
    <P>The Paris Convention is particularly important.  As an island nation we have a keen interest in protecting our marine environment, but there has been much double talk at European level on this issue.  At European level Governments have spoken about the need to protect our seas, yet industrialists continue to fill our waters with industrial waste.  If people do not accept the health argument, they should look to the economic argument.  If Irish people are not convinced that it is important to protect our land, seas, rivers and lakes from a health point of view, they should look to the economic argument, which I hope will make sense to them.  From our point of view there is an economic argument in protecting our natural resources.  I am thinking particularly of the effects a clean environment has on the tourist industry.</P>
    <P>At European level it is important that we cut the emissions of sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxide from our power stations. A number of countries have spoken about the need to introduce catalytic convertors on all new cars, but they have not been fitted.  Within the next ten years CEGB, for example, will clean three of <Col N="2102" /> their power stations.  That is an insult to the people of this country.  In Sellafield, nuclear dumping still goes on.  Nuclear submarines are moving around our coasts and there is still incineration at sea.</P>
    <P>There is much to be done in this area, but I hope this debate will unite this Parliament in presenting a strong voice in Europe.  There were similar debates in this Parliament in relation to Sellafield and we were unanimous in the steps we wished the Minister to take.  This was noted outside the House.  I hope there will be a greater awareness to protect the ozone layer, our invironment and our atmosphere as a whole as a result of this debate.</P>
    <P>The survey of the British Forestry Commission revealed an alarming and systematic deterioration in the condition of British trees.  In 1986, 26 per cent of the Scots Pine older than 50 years surveyed were severely damaged, dying or dead.  In 1987, the survey showed that the proportion of the trees in this category had risen to 40 per cent.</P>
    <P>Whether it be acid rain, the ozone layer, pollution or incineration at sea, there are many worrying trends which the Dáil should address.  Again, I commend the Minister for bringing this motion before the House.  I only heard about it 30 minutes before the debate began.  I was very pleased I contributed and I thank the House for giving me this opportunity because normally a Government backbencher would not get an opportunity to contribute to such a debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias de Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other speakes, I welcome the motion in relation to the Convention and Protocol.  Over recent years environmental issues have become the topic of daily conversation.  Not too long ago if one were to raise an issue like the ozone layer one would be marked as a crank involved in science fiction.  It is <Col N="2103" /> significant we have reached the point that this House agrees it is important that we produce a motion to implement a convention which will to some small degree help to protect the ozone layer.</P>
      <P>The ozone layer is not the only part of our atmosphere, important as it is, which is under attack.  Almost on a weekly basis there are incidents of our rivers and lakes being polluted.  We have a constant outflow of sewage into our rivers and seas; we have a constant outflow of radioactive waste from Sellafield into the Irish Sea and the incineration of waste at sea, and a range of deliberate steps are being taken to pollute our environment.  Why, despite all the public concern about the environment, do these things keep happening? It is not too strong to say that to deliberately destroy the environment would make you out as a lunatic, yet it continues.  It has to be said that part of the reason is the constant desire for finding ways of using modern technology to produce the greatest possible profit. Another element is the constant desire to find the cheapest possible way of disposing of waste, in many cases waste arising from the use of this technology.</P>
      <P>It is clearly a matter for the Government to intervene because the environment is no longer the responsibility of the individual.  What happens to the environment is a collective responsibility. By &ldquo;collective&rdquo; I mean collective internationally, not just individuals in this State.  More and more it is being borne on us how dependent each individual is on the other right around the globe.  That is why it is important that these Conventions are being brought before us today.  While not being an expert on these Conventions, the fact that pollution and attacks on the environment continue to such a large extent indicate that, despite the development of these Conventions and Protocols, they lack teeth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We do not have sufficient powers to prevent the kind of problems we have been discussing here today.  The Minister said earlier he does not see it being feasible <Col N="2104" /> for us unilaterally to require products brought into this country to be labelled as containing CFCs and that an alternative might be to have voluntary labelling of products indicating that they do not contain CFCs.  If we are serious about tackling this problem we should give a lead. Being a small island country with a relatively small population it should be possible for us to say that unless products brought in here are clearly labelled as to their contents we do not want them, they will not be allowed in.  That would give some muscle to other countries to do likewise.  The Minister seems still prepared to allow this whole question of the environment to be left to the goodwill of those who have the power to stop onslaughts on it, the polluters themselves. We should be taking a far stronger line in this regard.</P>
    <P>To what extent can any of these Conventions protect that part of the world which is not what we euphemistically call developed?  I am speaking about those countries outside the EC, those that are underdeveloped in terms of comparison with the EC countries.  To what extent are they becoming victims of our great strides towards eliminating pollution of our atmosphere?  It is quite common to hear reports of transational companies shifting their operations out of the more industrial countries where there are laws restricting effluent and so forth and into those less developed countries that have less developed laws in relation to pollution. To what extent will the pressures exerted by these Conventions simply mean a shift out of our own country, Britain, France and other such countries towards those areas that are under-developed and do not have the protection with which we seek to provide ourselves. This is an area we would need to examine. We should try to ensure that if transnational companies are shifting their operations out of Ireland or other places in order to continue with their industry which is creating the pollution and there is some way in which we can stop that by refusing to handle their products, we should look to how that might be done.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2105" /> Another aspect in which I was interested was the Minister's reference to research being carried on in UCD and TCD and his hope that that would continue. Again, it is not sufficient for us to express hopes in this regard.  I would like to hear the Minister announce some measures which would assist in that kind of research, in the development of alternatives and research into the effects of the various products on our environment.</P>
    <P>The question of the hole in the ozone layer in Antarctica mystifies me.  One would have thought that that hole would have occurred above areas where there was the greatest use of the aerosols about which we have been talking.  However, it would not seem to be working that way. I do not know if the Minister has the answer, but perhaps if he has he could let us know why the hole has come above Antarctica.  Has it something to do with the cold climate there?</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be very brief.  I welcome wholeheartedly the motion before the Dáil this evening to approve the Convention and the two Protocols. In my area of responsibility it is particularly the Convention for the Prevention of Marine Pollution, or the Paris Convention, and the Protocol to it on which I am going to address a few short remarks. However, the Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer and the Protocol relating to same must be welcomed by any of us who are concerned about the environment and our future generally.  If we continue to use and abuse the use of chlorine compounds, mainly in the form of aerosols, we will exacerbate the existing breaches of the ozone layer and increase the risks, through increased ultra-violet rays to the earth's surface, of cancers; we will affect crop yields and, as the Minister pointed out, there will be possible effects on and changes in weather patterns, or what is known generally as the greenhouse effect will be with us. We welcome the Bill.  A unanimous front can be expected, and I am sure the Minister expects that, in relation to support for the motions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to question whether we <Col N="2106" /> are really serious as a country in relation to our commitment, not just to the Paris Convention or the Oslo Convention, if I might mention it in passing.  To date our record has not been great.  Only last week I tabled a parliamentary question to the Minister for the Marine asking what our views were in relation to certain aspects of the Paris Convention meeting which is due to take place this month. There is also an Oslo Convention meeting this month and a joint meeting of the Paris and Oslo Conventions.  Up to last week my three line answer from the Minister of State at the Department of the Marine was that we were still considering our position.  It was on 2 June I asked this question and apparently we could not be told, or apparently it was not yet known what our position was in relation to certain aspects coming up at meetings this month of the Convention about which we are talking today.  If that is a headline as to our commitment as a country to environmental and to marine matters particularly, we need to have another think and another look at it.  Adding another Protocol to all the legislation that now exists, if we do not intend to pursue it and act in the spirit and the letter of the law, is a futile exercise.  I would appreciate if the Minister could give a commitment that we will be working along with all the member states for the ideals and achievements that we hope and wish for from the Paris Convention and the Oslo Convention.</P>
    <P>In relation to bringing a transboundary air pollution aspect to the Paris Convention, I support that wholeheartedly. However, I have fears as to whether we will get the support of other countries, of other North Sea states, for example, when it comes to sitting around the table at the Paris Convention meeting.  We were not prepared up to last week to state whether we supported the other North Sea states in their various motions relating to pollution of the North Sea.  We could not give them the commitment for which they were asking, or our support. We expect support from the other countries and North Sea states for our stand on Sellafield, for instance, and the potential <Col N="2107" /> transboundary air pollution effects that a major accident could pose for this country from Sellafield and the other nuclear power stations on the west coast of Britain.</P>
    <P>If we are looking to Europe to support our position and the threat we see from these stations, the least we can do is to take a stance in relation to their proposals to the Paris Convention and their fears of pollution in the North Sea.  We should share their fears; we should not have to be asked or cajoled into supporting their line.  We should be out leading the pack and not, as somebody mentioned earlier, involved in a rearguard action.  If we want the support of Europe and the other North Sea states against environmental threats to our nation, both of a transboundary nature and concerning the seas surrounding us, we must be prepared to put our money down and support them in their moves to protect an environment which should be equally as important to us as it is to them.  I am not convinced of the bona fides of the Department of the Environment.  I was junior Minister to that Department not too long ago and know the many difficulties and sides to every argument and the number of solutions to every problem that will be presented to the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>We are here discussing issues vital to the future of Ireland and of the globe.  There is no dissension among any party concerning what the Minister is proposing here today. However, I doubt the commitment in regard to implementing what we are talking about and going the whole way in terms of supporting other countries in their problems.  We have always had a particular difficulty about whether the Department of Energy or the Department of the Environment is the head of the dog, and that difficulty arose in some of the issues today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Power stations were mentioned and <Col N="2108" /> the whole issue of whether scrubbers should have been installed in the emission stacks.  The cost of electricity going up by 15 per cent was also mentioned and whether it would have cost too much in relation to our contribution in regard to pollution of northern Europe generally. We manage to hedge our bets, there are ifs and ands, we get ourselves into all sorts of positions and we manage to justify, to a certain extent, the position we take. However, we expect higher standards from others and we criticise them when they threaten us or are a potential threat to our environment.  We are inconsistent in how we follow through and in how we wish to protect our environment on those issues when we are in the international area.</P>
    <P>Recently I read a report where the acidity along the east coast has increased relative to the rest of the country.  We are now receiving the effects of transboundary air pollution on the east coast and we need to get to terms with those affecting us.  Before we demand standards of others we must be sure that we are implementing those standards in our own country and we must be prepared ultimately to put our money where our mouth is in relation to this.  The Minister for Finance imposed a 5 per cent VAT charge and the money collected from that amount would implement the scrubbers in Moneypoint.  In two or three years we would have the money which is needed to protect our environment there.  The argument does not follow directly but if we were willing, if the intention was there and if the Department of the Environment, in the person of the Minister, banged the Cabinet table, he would not let the Department of Energy Dictate policy, particularly when environmental issues are concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, metaphorically, the Minister should start banging the table, as there are ways and means.  I have very limited experienced in that regard but it is sufficient to know that you must stand up <Col N="2109" /> for your own area.  If you believe in it, you can achieve it.</P>
      <P>I very much welcome the motion and the Minister's speech, it went into great detail and it was worth the length of time it took to deliver.  For too often, we give scant attention to environmental matters or perhaps we just take the headline grabbing aspect and do not get down to discussing thoroughly the detail of what is involved.  Generally, our environment is under threat through the disposal of increased waste loads, for example, increased agricultural production and industrial and commercial output.  The disposal of such waste loads causes a dilemma in many areas.</P>
      <P>We are all interested in the development of the economy and we hope that there will be room for our children to work here if they choose to do so.  We also hope that jobs will be created and those of us who are interested in development of that kind must never feel threatened by any conservation or environmental protection measures. Environmental protection is not the enemy of development nor should developers feel threatened by conservationists. In all our development plans for the future we must integrate conservation policy in water, waste, air and litter management and indeed in the new Coillte Teoranta Bill.  The development of forestry should not feel threatened by those of us who are interested in the amenity and scientific aspects that must be protected in that legislation. Right through any development proposals, we must integrate conservation measures and, if we start at the drawing board, there will not be difficulties later. These difficulties are now given as excuses, for example, the non-installation of the scrubbers in Moneypoint.</P>

    <P>We support what the Minister is trying to do but I am not convinced of our commitment when it comes to sitting down at the table of the Paris and Oslo Conventions.  Are we prepared to go the whole hog and support our European colleagues in return for their support for our point of view?  We must take our place at the European table and not be <Col N="2110" /> afraid to stand up for environmental matters. We should not be afraid to be called conservationists because we should be the playground of Europe.  Our tourist industry should be second to none because we are still perceived as an environmentally pure and clean country. Our agricultural products are second to none in Europe but if we do not protect our environment and if it is not perceived to be clean and pure we will all be the losers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to add my contribution to a critically important motion before the House.  On planet earth we live in a very delicate ecological environment and very often people go through their everyday lives ill concerned about just how delicate that balance is.  That is not surprising as we all have a busy life-style but we go about our everyday work not considering what type of environment we will leave for future generations to inherit.  Herein lies the most important aspect when we consider any part of this great, finite resource, which is planet earth.</P>
      <P>We are just the temporary custodians of this planet, the certainty is that we will leave it but the lack of certainty is in relation to leaving it in a better way than we found it.  It is critically important to realise in environmental matters that it is a race against time, perhaps in many different aspects of the environment but critically so in relation to the few decades that we have to secure protection against any type of atmospheric pollution that is causing damage to the surface of the planet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The damage to our rain forests, the seas and the air we breathe is very difficult to comprehend in perhaps what future generations might term an uncivilised generation that inhabits this planet. Ireland can, or course, give a very forceful lead and, in our role as parliamentarians, we are obliged to make sure that we do.  Unbridled progress in industry, without an inherent commitment to preserving the environment, should not be tolerated.  Those who strip the rain forests and who cut away our <Col N="2111" /> natural resources are causing untold damage which will take perhaps centuries to correct.</P>
    <P>The key to all this lies with future generations. Environmental studies have now reached the stage, certainly in the public mind, where consideration should be given to making this a subject on the syllabus in secondary schools.  It should be structured within the educational system for at least six years, it could even be started in primary schools.  It could then be inculcated into the minds of children that it is necessary to protect our environment, the seas, land, rivers, the quality of air and many other aspects of the environment.</P>
    <P>The ozone layer is of critical importance and there is a lack of information on how this layer is starting to break down.  It could well be caused by the huge increase in air transportation and gaseous matters left in the atmosphere.  It could also be caused by the indiscriminate use of aerosols which are breaking down the delicate balance of the air.  I have noticed that the Minister is taking his brief very seriously as far as the natural environment is concerned.  Perhaps the Minister could try to add some weight to the argument that this goes beyond appeals, beyond rules and regulations and abiding by Conventions.  We must get it into people's minds, and start from a very early age, that this is important.</P>
    <P>My own children, having watched television programmes on the subject, find it incomprehensible how people can cause untold damage to the rain forests of West Africa and South America in the cause of progress in industry.  These youngsters perhaps will be making the rules and regulations in the future; but they will not think of it in terms of rules and regulations <i>per se.</i> They will feel there is a duty on them to behave in a certain manner.  I do not think the present generation feel that they are under such a duty &mdash; progress, yes; but progress with protection.  It is interesting to note that recently in a remote country where forest trees were being cut down at an alarming <Col N="2112" /> rate the women of the rural villages literally lay in front of the tractors moving into the forests and the developers endeavoured to buy these women off by offering them money and extra material wealth and comfort.  But their answer was &mdash; and we are speaking here about people who do not have the education we are privileged to have &mdash;&ldquo;What good is all of this to us if we have no forest trees to protect us or to build our homes from?&rdquo; Therefore, they were not prepared to trade off in the cause of making progress of this kind.</P>
    <P>Ireland definitely and decidedly lost a most important part of its environmental awareness in permitting the Moneypoint plant to operate without sulphur dioxide recovery apparatus.  I remember that a few years back the Electricity Supply Board issued figures which were quite alarming on the cost of fitting these so called scrubbers at the plant in order to abide by EC regulations and it seemed as if it would be impossible to provide that kind of money.  Since then substantially less expensive equipment has come on the market and it is imperative that Moneypoint is put in order.  Even though the authorities will state that the acidic levels are very slight and the levels of sulphur dioxide are insignificant in the European context, that belies the argument. As the previous speaker said, and I agree wholeheartedly with the point she made, it is very difficult to appeal to our neighbours for restraint in the face of the potential risk of major pollution, which could clear millions off the face of this planet, and at the same time engaging in the type of pollution being caused by Moneypoint.  Apart from the delicate balance of the neighbouring Burren in County Clare which could be wiped out by perhaps a change of wind direction, this uncontrolled emission of 70,000 tons of sulphur dioxide can be spewed right across our country and travel upwards towards the Scandinavian countries, with which we have great ethnic ties.  I appeal to the Minister to see if funds can be provided from the EC Regional Fund or in some other way for the plant at <Col N="2113" /> Moneypoint, because this is all wrong and should not be allowed to happen.</P>
    <P>I would now like to refer briefly to a question which has great importance for our capital city and which has a direct bearing on atmospheric pollution and that is in relation to the recent availability of unleaded petrol.  Perhaps the Minister should provide some incentive to the public to use unleaded petrol rather than leaving it to the commercial interests to brand their products.  The Minister has made a very definite impact in his contribution to protecting the natural environment and this is one area where he could give a lead.  It would be a start if the Government decided to use unleaded petrol in State cars and Members of the Oireachtas also decided to use unleaded petrol in their cars.  It is that type of lead which would act as a catalyst and incentive for other people to use this brand of petrol to prevent this killing disease in young people &mdash; those who pollute at night-time, those who break the law indiscriminately &mdash; are very hard to identify.  They should be isolated and fined very heavily for any transgressions.</P>
    <P>Once again, I compliment the Minister on the speech he made to the House this evening and we are all at one in wholeheartedly endorsing what he said. We need leadership from the Department, some marker, in facing up to the tremendous threat being posed to this country by an ill concerned, selfish and what will now become a commercial nuclear industry not too far away from us.  How can we expect to get much consideration from our neighbour, Britain, in our protests against Sellafield when she shows scant regard for the people living within even her own frontiers?  The great challenge is to convince those living in Britain that they are facing just as large a threat as we do on this island a short 100 miles or so away.</P>
    <P>I welcome this motion.  I wish the Minister well in his endeavours to ensure that our island remains to the fore in the area of conservation and protecting our delicate natural environment.</P>

      <P>I thank all Deputies who contributed to what I regard as a very important motion.  Indeed, I am somewhat flattered by the level of interest shown this evening, the number of Deputies who remained and the number of important contributions made.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe that had we had advance notice of this issue there would have been an incredibly large number of Members interested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy knows, it is not easy to get a matter like this on the Order Paper at all and, when the opportunity presented itself I grabbed it.  The interest shown indicates the new awakening of special interest in environmental matters among the community at large and their representatives.  It is flattering to me to observe so many people displaying an interest at this time.  For so long there was apathy on the part of the general public and in here with regard to environmental matters, all of which seems to have been swept away in the past couple of years.  I do not know what sparked it off but certainly those who express an interest in environmental matters will receive a willing hearing on the part of this Minister.  I have always felt that we are all individually responsible for the condition of our environment, that we all have a responsibility not just to what we found when we came into this life by way of the condition of the environment but by way of what we propose doing about its improvement and preservation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take the point about awareness.  The whole question of developing that awareness of the environment must have an educational dimension.  In the recent past I have been talking on a number of occasions to my colleague, the Minister for Education, concerning the matter raised by Deputy Gerard Brady.  We are at present talking about a little programme. I take the point made about second-level education but I feel it is better to begin this type of educational process early.  I contend that the primary level is the place to begin environmental <Col N="2115" /> awareness programmes in the schools curricula.  We shall be seeing something done about that before too long.  I have always believed that the general public are very responsive when they understand exactly what is afoot and what is expected of them.</P>
    <P>Deputy Brady will also be very pleased to know that today we had the first meeting of the steering committee to deal with the promotion and the wider usage of unleaded pertol.  The various oil companies, motor manufacturers and distributors, Departments and tourist interests were all present at the inaugural meeting which I addressed earlier today. I know there was not much media coverage &mdash; it is an internal matter &mdash; but we did begin the process today.  We feel we can make a very big impression in so far as getting a better, more balanced and widespread distribution network of unleaded petrol established in the near future.  There are at present 26 such outlets. Many of the motor cars of foreign motoring tourists can use only unleaded petrol and there is that incentive to help us develop our tourist potential.  Of course I would be particularly concerned that the level of emissions from leaded petrol would be very much reduced over the next couple of years.  The committee that began its business today in that regard will help to make the choice more readily available to individuals.  It is all a question of choices, anyway.  One must always have alternatives available before one can request or press people to do something that is in their best interests.</P>
    <P>I take the point on board concerning the whole question of awareness programmes. I am tempted to say something that is going to happen in the not too distant future in that regard.  I am not saying it by way of a sort of throwaway remark, hoping that somebody will ask me about it but I want to refrain from referring to something that will happen, in a major way, in so far as that whole area of awareness of the environment is concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister knows we <Col N="2116" /> will not give him a minute's peace until we find out what that is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that.  I should like to refer particularly to the question posed by Deputy Doyle about the Paris and Oslo Conventions in so far as the North Sea is concerned.  What the North Sea states decided in relation to the North Sea as far as I am concerned is totally acceptable to us.  The decisions taken there were based on scientific studies in relation to the North Sea.  We must now decide whether those decisions are relevant to the Irish Sea, based on the scientific studies of that sea.  When the repeat of the ICES study is available to us shortly we will be able to take quite a big step forward to enable us to consider, in co-operation with the United Kingdom, what steps of a similar nature must be decided on.  Those steps that will have to be taken and applied now to the North Sea that are relevant and should be extended in so far as the Irish Sea is concerned will also be considered.  The matter is not being given any kind of lateral treatment.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister have a word with his colleague, the Minister for the Marine, about it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not answer for him <Col N="2117" /> because we are talking about something different here this evening.  At the same time, I take the Deputy's point.  She will find that following publication of the report of the ICES study there will be some movement to the betterment of that area also.</P>
      <P>I am glad to note all the awareness concerning all of the matters referred to this evening.  Mind you, much more than just the ozone layer was talked about. The increase in parliamentary questions on environmental matters in recent years is an indicator of exactly what is happening. For example, there were 46 questions tabled to me yesterday for oral reply, 14 of which had a direct relationship and relevance to environmental matters. That is not so bad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the consensus in the House on the need to protect the ozone layer. It is high in the stratosphere and is essential in order to protect us from the harmful ultra-violet rays of the sun.  We are now aware of the link between overexposure to sun and the increased incidence of skin cancers.  Deputy Doyle referred to that matter.  We are also advised to take measures to protect ourselves in strong sunlight, such as the wearing of sun hats, the usage of tanning lotions, protective balming creams or whatever.  The scientific view is that the risk to skin cancers will continue to increase if the depletion of the ozone layer continues.  The sad aspect about it is that the depletion of the ozone layer is spreading.  It is not just a hole in Antarctica; it is spreading up into the Northern hemisphere.  The most alarming aspect &mdash; I have no way of substantiating this but I believe it to be true &mdash; is that it is unlikely that we can ever replace the ozone layer that has been depleted.  I know there is conflicting evidence about it, that in perhaps 100 years it might close back or develop itself.  But there is now conflicting evidence available that with the rate of depletion taking place there is no possible way, even over centuries, that that slack can be picked up even though the ozone layer might have the facility to regenerate itself.  The pace of regeneration is not sufficient to <Col N="2118" /> catch up on the depletion that is taking place.  It is highly technical and there are conflicting views on it.  The point is anyway that we are at present at risk.</P>
    <P>Of course, the depletion of the ozone layer is linked to man's activities.  There is now widespread agreement that it is the emissions into the atmosphere of man-made chemicals, CFCs that are mainly responsible for the destruction of the ozone in the upper atmosphere. National measures alone cannot reduce this threat to the world's environment.  It is through the co-operation of all countries involved in producing and consuming these substances that the ozone layer can be protected.  That is why I welcome the Vienna Convention For the Protection of the Ozone Layer and the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer.  The Montreal Protocol involves controlling production and consumption of CFCs and halons.  It requires, first of all, a stabilisation by 1989, of consumption and production at 1986 levels.  By 1993 those levels must be reduced by 20 per cent with a further reduction of 30 per cent being required by 1998.  Thus, the amount of CFCs available for all purposes will be reduced drastically. The effect of the reduction of the availability of these substances will be to confine their use to areas where alternatives are not available.  I believe that to be the most effective procedure to deal with the matter.</P>
    <P>The view has been put forward that the use of CFCs in aerosols should be banned and that this would have a more beneficial effect on the environment.  Deputy Keating was strong on that point.  However, it is the total amount of CFCs emitted to the atmosphere and not its particular source that affects the ozone layer.  The Montreal Protocol will deal with all CFC uses.  The use of CFCs for purposes other than aerosol is growing throughout the world and this must be controlled.  We are not talking about aerosols only but about everything that affects the atmosphere.</P>
    <P>Since the Montreal Protocol was agreed in September last, a number of <Col N="2119" /> large companies &mdash; and this is very pleasing to note &mdash; in the aerosol business have decided to move away from using CFCs in their products.  Quite a number of the huge manufacturing concerns involved in that business have decided on that course.  The effects of consumer organisation campaigns are also very evident. We should get consumer awareness here because nothing stops the manufacturers of CFCs quicker than the fact that their products are not being requested by the multinationals for their shelves.  In Britain the largest manufacturers have announced their intention to discontinue using CFCs except for specialist medical and chemical purposes.  I welcome that move.  Many of the aerosols used in this country are imported from our nearest neighbour so due to no special effort on our part our usage will be reduced annually.</P>
    <P>That is not to say we should not give a small lead internationally in our concern. One of the pleasing aspects of taking this debate this evening, as a result of the good fortune that other business had run out, is that I will be able to go to Luxembourg on 16 June and take a lead with our European partners and say that not only are we concerned but that we have given this concern prominence in our national parliament.  I will also press the point, which was well made by Deputy De Rossa, that preaching about this in Europe and at home and reducing the usage will be of little comfort if we transport or transfer it to another location in Africa where it will be manufactured and sold, thereby creating the same depletion of the ozone layer in a different locality. Deputy De Rossa's point is well taken and it will be stated in that way at Luxembourg on 16 June.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the announcement by the multinational companies of their intention to label their products &ldquo;CFC-free&rdquo;. That is important.  It will be no good if the people buying the products do not understand what it is all about, so the awareness aspect has to be entertained also.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>No, the date for the launch has been set and I am not going to tell the Deputy what it is.  There is an EC Commission proposal on the possibility of introducing a Community label for CFC products.  I will raise this matter on behalf of all of us at the Environmental Council meeting next week.  I will keep this matter under review and we can consider what action might be required if there is no progress at Community level. That is the way we should look at these matters.  If they do not support us in what we want to do we will have to go on our own.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course, CFCs are not manufactured in Ireland and our use of the substance has declined considerably.  Our trade statistics now show that 95 per cent of our imports of CFCs come from EC countries. The largest volume comes from the United Kingdom and the Netherlands; <Col N="2121" /> smaller amounts are imported from France and the Federal Republic of Germany; and most of the 5 per cent imported from non-EC countries comes from Switzerland, with small amounts coming from the United States and Sweden.  We should at least know where we buy these CFCs from.  Detailed statistics are not available on the use of CFCs within the country.  In implementing the Protocol, consideration will be given to its statistical and reporting requirements and any consequential amendments or improvements needed to our own data collection system.</P>
    <P>Deputy Boland, who has left the House, referred to the Irish emissions of sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxide and their contribution to transboundary pollution in Europe.  Many people made similar references.  I did not intend to deal with this subject during the course of this debate but because it was raised I think I should answer it.  International research conducted under the auspices of the European Economic Commission shows that the Irish contribution to transfrontier pollution is negligible.  That is the advice we have received.  We import more air pollution than we export.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>

      <P>Would the Minister agree that we cannot demand standards of others that we are not prepared to implement ourselves?  This is my fear.  I know it is very little relative to the other states but does that justify it continuing?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I spent some time at European level on the SO 2 emissions so far as the large combustion plants are concerned. This issue has come up at every single meeting we have had and it is very difficult to settle.  Sometimes it is very difficult for me to preach about it because they say &ldquo;You have no problem&rdquo;.  The <Col N="2122" /> big problem comes from the highly industrialised states such as Germany, the UK and Spain.  One can get agreement on certain matters but some member states will say &ldquo;We have been doing a lot, so why are you preaching at us?  We are doing the best we can from a very high level&rdquo;.  I am starting from no level.  If we were to reduce our percentage in the same way as they reduce theirs this would cause us terrible problems because we would be starting from a different base line.  However, that has not prevented me from making the case that what is happening in Europe is affecting us.  We are suffering from transboundary emissions which are coming our way.  On the last occasion I felt that there was a real consciousness about this at Commission level but there will be huge economic problems attached to doing something positive about it.  I believe we are close to reaching a decision on that issue.  We managed to agree that Irish SO 2 emissions would be stabilised at 124,000 tonnes.  That will have to be achieved by the greater use of low sulphur fuels.</P>

Valuable points were made on a range of issues and it is a pity that more time could not be found for a much wider discussion on a range of environmental matters.  If we had more time I believe we would get the awareness needed, not just here but outside also through media coverage.  Perhaps that will come too.  It is my intention that our policy on the protection of the ozone layer will be kept under regular review and that the measures needed to ensure its effectiveness will be taken.  We have just moved away from being called &ldquo;élitist, late sixties idealists&rdquo; so far as environmental matters are concerned. That is a big step and I look forward to the continuing support in a unanimous way for the measures put before us in this motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to have this opportunity to get a response from the Minister to what I consider to be a most important issue to this country.  I raised this matter on the Order of Business and was properly ruled out of order.  I also tabled a Private Notice Question today to ask the Minister for the Environment in view of the critical importance to our environment of a speedy response by the Government to the proposals by a British company to create a concrete dump for radioactive nuclear waste around Rockall, if he will ensure that this proposal <Col N="2124" /> which is likely to significantly affect our environment will be the subject of an environmental impact analysis under the EC directive on environmental impact assessment before any decision is made on its merits.  This Private Notice Question was tabled in my name and in that of our spokesman on Energy, Deputy Richard Bruton.</P>
      <P>Through fishing interests here, it has been brought to our notice that a British company have applied to dispose of radioactive nuclear waste by effectively forming a concrete doughnut around Rockall.  This raises many questions which need to be answered fairly urgently.  In relation to the jurisdiction of Rockall, what claims have we to Rockall and where do our claims stand when put side-by-side with the British claims?  Any proposal to dispose of nuclear waste at Rockall, or any other proposal concerning Rockall, must as a precursor have the resolution of the problem as to who has the jurisdiction of Rockall.</P>
      <P>Apparently a planning application for this proposal was submitted to the Council of the Western Isles in Scotland on the assumption by the privately owned Nottinghamshire-based company that Rockall is within the jurisdiction of the Council of the Western Isles.  This is not the Irish assumption.  Will the Minister clear up what rights we have to Rockall and the whole problem in relation to the jurisdiction of Rockall?  Having assumed that we have at least as much a say as the British Government, if not more &mdash; and that remains to be decided &mdash; can we insist that we are a party to the decision-making process in relation to this proposal? I have been pursuing the whole area of how we will implement the forthcoming EC directive on environmental impact analysis which will be part of our armoury of legislation after 1 July.  The Minister told me on other occasions that annex 1 of that directive will be mandatory and that certain aspects of annex 2, those likely to significantly affect our environment, will also be effectively mandatory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We will not argue or disagree with the contention that there is every likelihood <Col N="2125" /> that a nuclear radioactive waste dump around Rockall is, at the very least, likely to significantly affect the environment.  I would like assurances from the Minister, today if possible, that as far as the Irish Government have a controlling say and an input into this decision we will insist that an environmental impact analysis on the proposal will be carried out.  We do not even have to look to annex 2 of this directive because under annex 1 subsection 3 those projects which are subject to the article include installations solely designed for the permanent storage or final disposal of radioactive waste, which is effectively what this proposal is all about.  Will the Minister say quite plainly to his colleagues in the British Government that we would like an analysis under this EC directive to be carried out on this proposal?  We need not go into the details of the problems and the potential environmental hazards until we examine the merits of the proposal.</P>
    <P>It is very easy when nuclear waste, or nuclear power stations or reprocessing plants are mentioned, to resort to hyperbole of one kind or another.  We saw examples of that in recent years.  It is far harder to take a cool, clinical attitude to what has been proposed, to analyse it and find out exactly what environmental hazards may be implicit in any proposal such as the one before us.  I have faith in the new EC directive concerning environmental impact analysis and I hope my faith is upheld in the years to come.  As a member of the European Community we now have a European procedure for assessing any proposal that might significantly affect the environment and I would like to see that procedure invoked in relation to this proposal.  I await the Minister's assurances that that will be done.</P>
    <P>The company concerned, Merrick Allen of Nottinghamshire contend that they informed the Irish Government in September 1987 of this proposal.  At the time they also informed the Icelandic and the UK Government and the Danish Government.  The Minister's colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Pat Gallagher, at the Department of the Marine, <Col N="2126" /> was slightly ambiguous in his recent references to this issue.  Having first confused the issue as to whether any Government Department or agency knew of this proposal, and implied that they did not, the article in question was subsequently corrected to say that the Department of the Marine were informed a month ago.  The company contend that our Government were informed in September 1987.  We have had the bones of eight or nine months to investigate this and to find out what the proposals are intended to contain.</P>
    <P>I accept that the Minister present is the Minister for the Environment and not the Minister for the Marine, but he will appreciate how important Rockall is to Ireland from a fishing point of view. Apart from the demersal fish, haddock, cod and so on, it is a very important prawn fishery and indeed the most highly valued fish of all, squid, is to be found in this area.  Some months ago the Minister may recall the outcry which was expressed in this House as well as outside, concerning proposals to dump sewage sludge some 100 miles off Rockall.  We objected very violently.</P>
    <P>Apart from the scientific analysis and even apart from an environmental impact analysis based on scientific conclusions as to the likely affect of any such proposals, we have another major factor we must consider in this company, and the Minister for the Environment will appreciate this.  The future of our economy very much depends on the perception of Ireland and Irish waters as being environmentally pure.  It is not sufficient for the scientific facts to be there that we have clean air, waters and land.  The perception abroad must be that they are clean and pure.  Our agricultural industry and our food industry depends in the future on a perception of a clean green environment when it comes to our land.</P>
    <P>Our fishing industry which has been undeveloped for years, and which in theory we are prepared to invest in, has such potential that it depends on the perception as well as the reality that our seas are pure and clean.  Regardless of the facts which will emerge over the coming <Col N="2127" /> months, before any decision is made on this proposal, I contend that there will be a perception that there is a risk to the marine environment if this proposal to have a radioactive nuclear waste concrete dump in a doughnut around Rockall goes ahead.  We will have a very difficult job in convincing people there is not a potential threat to the environment.  The reality may turn out to be that there will not be a potential threat to the environment when the scientists and the technical people get down to analyse it.  I am afraid that enough damage will be done to harm our marine industry, particularly the important fisheries around Rockall, by the perception that there is something amiss if this project goes ahead.</P>
    <P>You have the reality on one hand and the perception on the other.  It is an awful thing to say, but the perception is nearly more important than the reality; because, if the reality is that all is well and the perception is otherwise, we are going nowhere.  Ironically, if the perception is that all is well and the reality is otherwise, we are still going somewhere.  That, unfortunately, is as the facts are before us.  Ideally the perception must match the reality in terms of the type of environment, both land based and sea based, we have in this country.  That is what I would want for the country.</P>
    <P>My contribution will be brief and, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, perhaps Deputy Keating could have a few minutes if I do not use up my 20 minutes.  The whole issue of Rockall was exacerbated in recent months and years by the fact that Irish fishing vessels within the 12 mile limit have been boarded by their British colleagues and counterparts and, to put it at its gentlest, have been hassled.  There is a very strong difference of opinion in relation to the jurisdiction of Rockall.  The most important aspect of what we are talking about here today is that we resolve very quickly the whole problem about who has jurisdiction over Rockall.  When that is resolved we then decide whether it is ourselves or the UK Government who will be analysing the merits of the particular proposal to create <Col N="2128" /> this radioactive dump surrounding it.  I do not want our country to be left out of the decision-making on this particular proposal.  I would like him or his colleague, the Minister for the Marine, to seek assurances urgently from his UK counterpart that we will be party to any decision that is made on this aspect.</P>
    <P>It is rather sad that this issue had to come to our attention from a communication from Scottish fishermen to Irish fishermen and had eventually to make its way to the Houses of Parliament &mdash; to Dáil Éireann &mdash; this evening.  This matter was communicated last September to the Irish Government along with other Governments.  I would have expected that we could have had an open and frank discussion on it.  I believe that, if the cards are put on the table in relation to issues that are potentially contentious such as this, you can defuse a lot of fears and hyperbole that subsequently may result.  When people find out covertly, or from under the table, that something is going on and that there is a proposal there that somehow, perhaps, we were not meant to know about until it was too late to do anything about it, then tensions are heightened and we get reactions that perhaps are not justified and perhaps they are.</P>
    <P>I will end by quoting the Minister's own words in answer to a recent parliamentary question of this week when he was referring to our waste disposal policy.  This is a matter concerning waste disposal.  Whether it is a UK problem or our problem we do not yet know, but we will need to determine that very quickly. The Minister said that the object of waste disposal policy is to ensure that &mdash; I presume he would include radioactive waste in that and particularly any hazardous wastes which call for special disposal arrangements, as would radioactive nuclear waste &mdash; are always safely disposed of without risk to public health or to the environment.  I would add to that that, even when the scientists and the technocrats have analysed in depth different proposals and, given the limit of present day knowledge, they come to the conclusion that there is not a risk to <Col N="2129" /> public health or the environment, even if there is a perception that any proposal could or may in the future damage the environment, we should be very loath to travel the road with or to accept any such proposal.  Our environment is too valuable to us as a commodity for marketing this country in the future &mdash; our land based and sea based environment &mdash; and nothing should be done to harm the reality or the perception that we are an environmentally pure and clean nation in relation to our land, air and surrounding waters.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Doyle for allowing me to join with her in this brief discussion and, indeed, commend her for raising this matter.  I had a similar intention in mind this morning but, unfortunately, I was elsewhere on a somewhat sad duty.  First, from my point of view any proposal to store radioactive waste in the waters adjacent to Ireland is essentially repugnant as being not just in conflict with the concept of proper ecological management but being likely to pose a serious threat to life in these islands, both Great Britain and Ireland.  Second, in regard to recent revelations in relation to the handling by British Nuclear Fuels of workplace practices in Sellafield, compounded by the fact that the Irish Sea is the most radioactive stretch of water in the world, and on which the British Government conveyed assurances to us, there is a fundamental doubt from my point of view about any from of assurance emanating from that quarter in relation to the handling of issues such as this.  I am far from assured that we can simply accept the word we receive for one reason or another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Third, it would be helpful, in order to avoid the unfortunate tensions which could arise between our two countries in this kind of issue, if there was some form of clarity as soon as possible regarding the jurisdiction of Rockall, the ownership of that area of water and, indeed, the rock itself.  If it was helpful it might be <Col N="2130" /> useful for some from of formal declaration to be approved of in this House asserting our rights in that respect because of the possible environmental and fishing interests which arise.  We see in this case how easily it is assumed that it is simply a matter for local jurisdiction in Britain.  We, Deputy Doyle and her party and, I am sure, the Minister and his party, categorically reject that assumption and believe that we have rights in the matter.  If there is any action this House can take by means of formal declaration or otherwise, that should be taken.</P>
    <P>I am very interested to know whether the Government were informed in September 1987 of this proposal.  I will not be surprised if that is not the case, but I hope the Minister will be able to tell us. If they were it underlines, once again &mdash; as did a recent incident where the Department of Agriculture found themselves unable to communicate to the public the rejection of some container loads of radioactively contaminated food by the Dutch Government &mdash; my basic belief that it is high time we had a freedom of environmental information Act to ensure that the public have the right to know and that it is not just a matter of an arbitrary decision by a Minister, no matter how well intentioned, in matters like this which are of such fundamental importance to all of us.  There should be put in place as soon as possible some form of access by the public to essential matters such as this.</P>
    <P>Finally, it is clear that there is a growing international perception that this country, its environment and the waters around it are somehow the last resting place of the refuse of the world.  We know that nuclear material of various kinds is reprocessed and so on at Sellafield from around the world and ultimately, unfortunately, leaks its way into the soils and the environment in that area with tragic consequences &mdash; as we have seen in various reports this very day &mdash; and into contamination of the sea.  I am convinced from the discussion we had earlier in <Col N="2131" /> relation to the Convention for the protection of the ozone layer and, indeed, other discussions we have had on environmental matters, that this Minister would be very willing, and I am sure would be assured of the support of everyone here, if he would lead an international campaign to overturn that growing impression that you can dump or incinerate your waste off the south west coast, dump your radioactive material into the Irish Sea or plant it in some form of temporary &mdash; that it what it would be &mdash; container in the Rockall area, that Ireland is a place to go when you want to get rid of your dirt.  It would be most unfortunate if that international perception was to grow.  It is the case at the moment and I would like the Minister, if he can, to engage in some form of campaign.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gerard Brady made a good point in his contribution earlier and we should re-echo it.  Perhaps ultimately in order to deal with issues like this we will have to awaken the attention of the British public as well who are as much at risk from an environmental tragedy in this area as anyone in this country.  Perhaps ultimately the people of both islands will have to take action to ensure that the British establishment and the British Government will wake up to their responsibilities on this issue.  Again I thank Deputy Doyle for allowing me to make these few remarks and I join with her in hoping the Minister can offer some assurances in this respect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I want no more or less for our country as a pollution-free area than Deputy Doyle or Deputy Keating does or, indeed, many of those who contributed earlier this evening here.  My opinion has always been that the environment is under threat from within and without and has been increasingly so for a number of years.  I think the climate is coming right to reverse that trend.  Only in the past few years, maybe in the recent few years, has the level of concern come to be expressed in the way it is being expressed now maybe because of our involvement with Europe and at EC Council meetings where one begins to get a very good window on exactly what has happened in other bigger jurisdictions where the environment has ceased to exist as pollution-free and where great damage has been done to the natural and economic environment.  Consequently, one is now pushing an open door as far as public opinion is concerned, so may be the time is coming when we can reverse a trend that has been gaining apace over the years.</P>
      <P>I think it would be useful if I outlined briefly the nature and purpose of environmental impact assessment normally referred to as EIA because Deputy Doyle has raised it on a number of occasions. In essence, EIA is a formal procedure for ensuring that adequate consideration is given to the environmental aspects of proposed major developments in decision-making processes.  It involves the carrying out of a study of the likely effects of a development on the environment and the taking into account of the results of the study in the making of decisions about the development.  EIA is now recognised as one of the key elements of preventive environmental policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy will be aware, prevention of pollution at source has been one of the underlying principles of EC action programmes for the environment, <Col N="2133" /> and is now incorporated into the Community Treaties by the Single European Act.  A related objective of Community environment policy has been to ensure that the effects of projects on the environment are taken into account at the earliest possible stage in all technical planning and decision-making processes. It is these concerns that led to Directive 85/337 on environmental impact assessment, generally called the EIA Directive.</P>
    <P>This Directive requires the carrying out of assessments of the likely effects on the environment of certain public and private development projects, and the taking into account of the results of such assessments in decisions about the granting of development consent to projects. The Directive relates to two classes of projects.  The projects listed in its First Annex must in all cases be subjected to an assessment of their environmental effects.  These include major developments such as crude oil refineries, integrated chemical installations, motorways, airports, ports and waste disposal installations for toxic waste.  Projects listed in the Second Annex must be subjected to an assessment where member states consider that their characteristics so require.  Annex II is very wide-ranging and includes projects in such areas as agriculture, mining, energy, chemicals, food, textile and metal processing industries, etc.</P>
    <P>Among the projects listed in the First Annex of the Directive is installations solely designed for the permanent storage or final disposal of nuclear waste.  Any such project must accordingly be subjected to an assessment of its environmental effects in accordance with the provisions of the Directive.</P>
    <P>I believe that environmental impact assessment can play an important role in safeguarding the environment and I am accordingly anxious to see full and effective implementation of the Directive at the earliest possible date.</P>
    <P>The Directive is, however, one of the most significant and wide-ranging initiatives by the EC in relation to the environment. Giving effect to it will require the making of detailed provisions and <Col N="2134" /> statutory provisions will be required.  Proposals for giving effect to the Directive are currently being developed in my Department, and the aim is to bring it into operation just as soon as all of the necessary arrangements can be made. These arrangements will, in accordance with the provisions of the Directive, provide for the assessment of any project of a type mentioned in the Directive's First Annex, including nuclear storage and disposal facilities.</P>
    <P>In relation to the matter which Deputy Doyle and Deputy Keating raised, I understand that, while such a project has been mooted by private interests named by the Deputies, there are no official proposals to proceed with such a development. I would assure the Deputies that my colleagues, the Minister for Energy and the Minister for the Marine, will take a keen interest in any proposals in this area, particularly in the context of obligations on member states of the EC under the Euratom Treaty.</P>
    <P>Specifically, Article 37 of the Euratom Treaty requires that any definite proposals for the disposal of radioactive waste must be submitted to the EC Commission for its opinion on compliance with that Treaty.  Consideration of the matter which is the subject of this debate is clearly at a very early stage in the UK. It remains to be seen whether it develops. In so far as my Department's responsibilities are concerned, I do not wish to anticipate the arrangements which will be made to give effect to the Directive or what action may be taken under those arrangements in future.  The situation will be kept under review and appropriate action will be taken where necessary.</P>
    <P>Deputy Doyle referred to the need for international consultation about the proposed development at Rockall.  I would like to point out that under Article 7 of the EIA Directive a member state will be obliged to consult other member states about developments likely to affect them and take account of any of the views expressed by any of the members states. Therefore, they must do certain things under two international headings.  That gives us ample opportunity to deal with <Col N="2135" /> the matter when it becomes a really live issue.  This, of course, is without prejudice to the more fundamental question of sovereignty in so far as Rockall is concerned. Deputy Doyle raised the question about the jurisdiction out there.  I must tread carefully here.</P>

However, the figures published by that office do not differentiate between official and unofficial disputes. Estimated figures prepared by my Department indicate that 23 strikes began during the first three months of 1988 and that three strikes were carried over from the final quarter of 1987.  Of the new strikes monitored during the quarter, 18 (78 per cent) were official and the remaining five (22 per cent) were unofficial.  It is estimated that approximately 54,000 days were lost through strikes during the quarter.  Official strikes accounted for 53,000 (98 per cent) of the days lost and unofficial strikes for the remaining 1,000 (2 per cent).</P>
      <P>Estimated figures for the corresponding three month period of 1987 show that 22 strikes began during the quarter and that seven strikes were carried over from the final quarter of 1986. Of the new strikes monitored during the quarter ten (45 per cent) were official and 12 (55 per cent) were unofficial.  The total number of days lost through strikes during the first quarter of 1987 is estimated to be approximately 135,000, of which 118,000 (8 per cent) were accounted for by official strikes and 17,000 (13 per cent) by unofficial strikes.</P>
      <P>I might add in general terms that an overall decline in days lost is clearly discernible. The number of strikes in 1987 was the lowest since 1967 and the number of days lost the lowest since 1973.  The number of strikes and days lost due to unofficial action have also shown a declining pattern as a percentage of the total.</P>

      <P>A number of Romanian nationals engaged on aircraft maintenance for Ryanair are employed in this country for varying periods of time on the basis of work permits dating from 1986.  They are employed on a contract basis and do not hold permanent jobs.  In all, Ryanair holds 46 permits in respect of aircraft mechanics and also employs a number of Irish nationals for aircraft maintenance.</P>
      <P>In 1986, Ryanair advised my Department that they proposed leasing jet aircraft from a Romanian airline, and that it was a condition of the leasing arrangement that Romanian nationals would be seconded to Ryanair for maintenance purposes.  On the basis of this arrangement, a number of work permits issued to Ryanair.</P>

      <P>Female apprentices account for 0.84 per cent of registered apprentices.</P>
      <P>At my request FÁS introduced in 1987 a system of reserved places for female participants.  The take up of these places has been disappointing.  On the other hand, female participation in training programmes generally has increased from 11 per cent in 1975 to 33 per cent in 1987.</P>
      <P>I have asked employers' and workers' organisations to promote equality in traditional skills areas and through the FÁS Industrial Training Committees employers are being encouraged to sponsor female apprentices.  The FÁS Apprenticeship Review Committee will also consider how female apprentice numbers can be increased.</P>

    <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the provisional figure for the first three months of this year is 578, as compared with 407 and 570 for the corresponding period in 1987 and 1986 respectively.  They have also informed me that the preliminary indications are that the figures for April and May of this year will show a slight decrease as compared with the same months last year.  I should point out, however, that statistics relating to the incidence of crime over short periods of time are only a very limited value as indicators of long-term trends.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if his attention has been drawn to the increasing number of local authority mortgagees who are experiencing difficulty in meeting mortgage repayments; if he will consider amending the regulations for the purpose of allowing local authorities to restructure loans with particular reference to SDA mortgages for the purpose of bringing them into line with current favourable interest rates; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <P>Where a loan has been advanced at a fixed interest rate, that rate applies for the full period of the loan in accordance with the terms of the mortgage agreement.  The question of altering the interest rate in such cases does not, therefore, arise.  I would point out that the interest rate charged by the local authority on a loan is determined by the rate at which they, in turn, borrowed the money to fund that loan.</P>

      <P>No such standards have yet been <Col N="2025" /> set.

In the meantime, I have asked local authorities to give special attention to the operation, management and maintenance of sewage treatment plants and to review the situation at such plants regularly to ensure that the effluent discharged does not adversely affect the quality of receiving waters.</P>

      <P>Implementation of the directive in question is an ongoing process based on programmes, commencing in 1987, which are reviewable at least every four years in the light of both technical progress and changing economic circumstances. The initial Irish programme was presented to the EC Commission in February 1987 and was the first submitted by any member state.  Details of the programme (if any) of other member states are not available in my Department.  A comparison of programme elements and strategies would probably have little relevance in any event since Irish consumption and packaging patterns are known to differ radically in many respects from those of other member states.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irish programme is a phased one with provision for ongoing study of further possibilities for achieving the objectives of the directives.  There are a number of targets and one of these, which is directed towards significantly increasing the level of glass retrieval in the <Col N="2026" /> Dublin area, is already well on the way to attainment.</P>

      <P>The Deputy was informed, in reply to the question which he asked on 15 December 1987 about this project, that it was not possible then to advance the architectural planning of the proposed additional accommodation for the Ballymote national schools, County Sligo.  Since then my Department has reassessed the position from the standpoint of additional classroom requirements and in the light of amalgamation proposals, and experts in the near future to be able to discuss with the school authorities a suitable revision of the original proposals.</P>
