      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach whether the Government have had an opportunity to consider the view expressed by the Chief Justice and other members of the Supreme Court in a case (details supplied) to the effect that legislative regulation of the respective rights <Col N="2" /> and duties of the State, owners of land and finders of objects of historical or archaeological value, with regard to ownership or reward for the finding of such objects would appear to be desirable; and whether legislation on this matter may be expected in the near future.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In consultation with the National Museum, the Office of Public Works and the Attorney General's Office, my Department are drawing up the heads of the legislation required to deal with this complex matter.  I hope to present to Government in the near future the detailed proposals for this legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach the total legal costs incurred by the State in the High Court and Supreme Court cases concerning ownership of the Derrynaflan Chalice; if he will confirm that the amount awarded to the finders of the hoard was roughly the same as was recommended by the National Museum in the first place, but payment of this was overruled by his Department; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The total legal costs incurred by the State in the Derrynaflan case have not yet been costed.  I do not think it is in the public interest to give details regarding the negotiations for such awards.  In the Derrynaflan case, the negotiations go back to 1980-81 when my Department were not responsible for the National Museum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach accept that the ongoing negotiations were <Col N="4" /> the concern of Governments, not excepting his Government for all of the time, that it appears that at the end of the day the figure awarded by the court was what was looked for on the one hand and offered on the other, but a Government Department intervened to do down those negotiations?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said, I do not wish to disclose the ins and outs of the development.  This matter went on over a long time with many comings and goings. However, the Deputy will appreciate that the Department's concern is always to try to have regard to the public purse and they cannot be as generous or flaithiúlach perhaps as people in the private sector would be.  Departments are always under that limitation when they are negotiating in a matter of this kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret the Taoiseach will not confirm or deny the import of the question, but would he at least accept that the whole case points up the need for this House to get its act in order in this area and not have to await, particularly in clear instances such as the Derrynaflan affair, costly proceedings to be told what it should be doing by another body?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am inclined to go along with the Deputy and I think most Deputies in the House will be in agreement that the present situation is very unsatisfactory.  We have all been disturbed about developments which have taken place with regard to particular items of our national heritage.  On the other hand I think none of us anticipated that somebody who went in and trespassed on somebody else's land would be able to go to the courts and receive such an enormous award as was granted in this case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach confirm that when the Derrynaflan hoard was <Col N="5" /> found in 1980 the finders were illegally present on the land of another man, they were illegally excavating on a national monument site which is forbidden, they were using metal detectors, the owner of the land got a very reasonable reward and was satisfied with that, and an amicable solution was reached with him?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Most of what the Deputy says is in accordance with the facts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>In addition to the points implicit in the questions from Deputy McCartan and Deputy Nealon, I would like to express the hope that the Taoiseach will also take the view that the very large reward paid to the landowners is also not necessarily in accord with natural justice or the public interest, particularly since two of the five Supreme Court judges expressed the opinion they should have been entitled to nothing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a fairly valid point of view.  On the other hand, the Deputy will agree that in this whole area it is important to keep a balance.  We would like to see the State's rights fully adhered to and fully implemented at all times.  On the other hand, we should have some incentive for people to come forward with these very important objects.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will outline the proposals for the establishment of a museum of modern art in the Royal Hospital, Kilmainham, Dublin 8; if, in respect of such proposals he will indicate the exact size of the collection which would be housed there; the location within the hospital which would be permanently assigned to the collection; the method of the administration that would be allocated to the museum; the appointments, if any, which have been made in relation to personnel who would be involved in the administration <Col N="6" /> of the museum, and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have recently established an advisory committee to advise on the permanent arrangements to be made for the establishment and running of the new National Gallery of Modern Art at the Royal Hospital, Kilmainham. I have asked the committee to report to me in a matter of weeks on the various issues to be considered, including administrative structure, funding and staffing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Taoiseach outline the composition of the membership of that committee?  May I assist him with a couple of supplementaries and he might like to answer all of them together?  Does membership of that committee contain people who are other than civil servants? Are such a committee prepared to accept recommendations and proposals from other groups?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the last part of the question is &ldquo;certainly&rdquo;.  I emphasise that this is only an interim committee to look into this situation and decide what sort of arrangement should be made.  A totally different body, I hope, will be put into place to manage and run the gallery.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is really a technical committee with Pádraig Ó hUigínn, Secretary of the Department of the Taoiseach; Mr. Pat Murphy who, as the Deputy knows is a member of the Arts Council and Chairman of ROSC; Mr. Gordon Lambert, businessman, art collector and former member of the Arts Council; Miss Dorothy Walker, art critic, Noel de Chenu, Principal Architect, OPW; Mr. Kearney, assistant director, the National Gallery of Ireland and Mr. Tony Cronin, arts adviser to the Department of the Taoiseach.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Taoiseach if, in the broad thrust of the inquiries some representations will be sought <Col N="7" /> from Dublin Corporation with regard to the transfer or involvement of the Municipal Gallery of Modern Art at Parnell Square?  There has been concern expressed and interest shown by the members of that gallery in the proposal for the establishment of a national gallery of modern art with a view to alleviating some of the overcrowded conditions which exist in that gallery particularly by reason of their more recent modern acquisitions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the demarcation difficulties which could arise and the possible duplication of effort, would the Taoiseach consider advising this committee that in making their recommendations they should suggest that in the future running of the National Gallery there should be some membership at least from the existing royal hospital committee.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4 to 7, inclusive, together.  As a visit by me to Australia for St. Patrick's Day was not definitely decided upon at any stage there is no question of its being postponed.</P>
      <P>It is my intention, depending on circumstances, to visit Australia later this year but, as with my official visits abroad generally, it is not the practice for security and other reasons to give details too far in advance.  The House can be assured that while abroad on official business, each member of the Government avails of every opportunity that presents itself to improve relations, increase our export trade and to promote the image of Ireland in the host country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Taoiseach give some details to the House of the areas in which he would expect increased trade between Ireland and Australia consequent on the visit of Prime Minister Hawke to Ireland or consequent on the Taoiseach's visit to Australia should he succeed in going there during his tenure of office?  What areas of trade does he see developing?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree that ethnic tourism, as we call it, has formed an integral part of the business of tourism in this country for many years and would he, therefore, think that it would be useful if during his visit, he could arrange for the 400,000 Australians who annually come to Europe on holidays to be facilitated by way of the integral price of their ticket including travel to Ireland?  Would he undertake that as one of the areas of real economic benefit that could be explored between Ireland and Australia?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will give details of the separate offices established for some Ministers of State; if he will outline the powers, duties and responsibilities of said Ministers of State; and if he will also outline the resources made available to their respective offices in terms of finance and personnel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The separate offices established for some Ministers of State are as follows: Department of Agriculture and Food, (i) Office of the Minister for Food, (ii) Office of the Minister for Horticulture; Department of Industry and Commerce, (i) Office of the Minister for Science and Technology, (ii) Office of the Minister for Trade and Marketing and Department of Energy, (i) Office of the Minister for Forestry.  The statutory powers, duties and responsibilities of the Ministers of State are set out in the relevant delegation of ministerial functions orders which have been laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since there is no separate Vote for each office, the resources made available to <Col N="11" /> the offices are agreed between the Ministers and the Ministers of State concerned having regard to the delegation of functions involved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>In the light of the fact that it is purely by way of delegation of functions, as applies with other governments, for specific purposes, how does the Taoiseach see that these changes, which seem to be cosmetic rather than anything else, are to achieve the objectives he outlined in that famous document issued before the election a year ago?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be a combination of factors.  First, much will depend on the calibre of the Ministers concerned and I am very happy about that.  Secondly, establishing an office gives a clear indication of focus and emphasis on the area concerned and indicates the Government's intention to pursue vigorously development in these sectors.  Already, the results of these changes are apparent. We are achieving progress in all these areas and I am satisfied that the changes have been beneficial.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that in the food sector, apart from the high growth in drink concentrates, output declined in 1987?  Therefore, when he talks about results does he not think it premature to be talking about good results at this stage?  Without in any way taking from the high calibre of the people involved &mdash; I certainly would not cast any personal aspersions on them &mdash; can the Taoiseach say how the necessary growth in these areas can be achieved by the Minister of State in these separate offices without direct access to such Exchequer funding as is available for the promotion of these areas?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>These offices have succeeded in pulling together in a concentrated way all the different functions relating to the different sectors.  The Deputy knows for instance, that in the food sector, until this office was established there were a whole lot of diverse <Col N="12" /> operations and functions in place.  One of the main purposes of the offices is to put all these things together so as to concentrate directly on job promotion, for instance in the food industry.  In addition the Minister of State, in agreement with his Minister in Government, will have specific funds allocated to him over which he will have control and he will be able to relate the expenditure of these funds specifically to the targets he has in mind for the sector concerned.  The Deputy will also accept that one of the problems that a Minister of State had, and before that a Parliamentary Secretary, was that they were very often in a Department which was largely used in a kind of haphazard way by the Minister.  In trying to put some focus onto the work of these junior Ministers our approach has been helpful and beneficial.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Mr. S. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 19 and 61 together.</P>
      <P>The position in relation to the financial arrangements involving Allied Irish Banks and the Central Bank is set out in the statement made by the Central Bank on 4 October 1985.  There has been no change in these arrangements nor is any foreseen.  The latest audited accounts of the company published by the administrator showed a net balance sheet deficiency of £120 million at 31 December 1986 after the £100 million advance from the banking sector is taken into account.</P>
      <P>The administrator intends to publish the 1987 audited accounts of the company in March 1988.  The accounts are likely to confirm the continuing profitability of its ongoing business.</P>
      <P>While permission has not been sought from either myself or the Government for the sale of ICI, the question of disposal is, of course, being kept under continuous review.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister indicate to the House what exactly is the position in regard to the £18 million or so which was, I understand, put up by the Central Bank for the benefit of Allied Irish Banks arising out of this matter?  Is there any prospect of that money being refunded or what arrangements are in place to have <Col N="30" /> the taxpayers' funds recouped from the AIB?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me remind the Deputy that of the £100 million advanced, £70 million was advanced by Allied Irish Banks with the remaining £30 million coming from Central Bank funds. That was the arrangement entered into by the previous Government and it is one we are standing over.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that they may be standing over it but what is the position regarding the money in the Central Bank?  Is this gone forever or does this agreement hold out any prospect of recoupment to the Central Bank of the money owed to it?  What exactly is the position in the light of the improved trading position of ICI?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me remind the Deputy that the arrangements involve the advancement of £100 million for a period of 15 years.  This money was lent to the Minister for Finance for onlending to the Insurance Corporation fund which, as the Deputy is aware, subsequently went to the ICI administrator under the supervision of the High Court.  Therefore, I do not foresee any great change in the situation.  The present position is that a 15 year loan has been advanced. This loan was negotiated by the previous Government, it is in place and it is holding its course.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course we are pleased to see the company making a profit on its ongoing business and those profits in so far as they are available will accumulate on the balance sheet.  As I <Col N="31" /> said in my reply, the balance sheet still shows a deficiency.  Therefore, those funds will obviously improve the quality of the balance sheet and, as the Deputy has rightly said, the shareholder is the State.  Therefore, at the end of the day the State is responsible and owns those funds.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he proposes to initiate any further task-type bodies or agencies, similar to SFADCo, to assist with regional or local industrial development, which would have a limited lifespan, but which would be able to concentrate their attentions and resources on key problem areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose at this time to establish any further bodies or agencies to assist with regional or local industrial development.  I am satisfied that in a country the size of Ireland the existence of agencies like the IDA, SFADCo and Údarás na Gaeltachta more than adequately fulfil needs in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The operations of SFADCo and Údarás na Gaeltachta and the regionalisation of the IDA's small industries programme ensure that State services are available to the entrepreneur in a unified and clear way at local level.  The IDA's regionalisation programme has led to a <Col N="32" /> significant improvement in communications between IDA project executives and their client companies at all stages of a project's development.</P>
    <P>Finally, the Deputy will be aware that in the current budgetary climate the thrust of this Government's policy is to rationalise and streamline the activities of public sector bodies.  I believe the creation of additional industrial development agencies at a regional level would run counter to this policy and represent a serious retrograde step.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 21 and 50 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputies will appreciate, the attraction of replacement industries to particular locations and the negotiation of terms and conditions is a matter for the IDA.  Following the closure of the Hyster plant last July and IDA, in accordance with their normal practice, undertook a search for an appropriate replacement industry.  Last week they reached final agreement with Thermo King Europe of Galway to take over the former Hyster <Col N="33" /> factory at Blanchardstown and expand their production there.  The plant is expected to be in operation in April.  The project is expected to create 207 jobs by 1990.</P>
    <P>I feel sure that Deputies will agree that the IDA are to be commended for their achievement in this matter and I see no reason at this stage to suggest any change in the well tried and proven practices for attracting replacement industries followed by the IDA in cases such as this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOMalley" hpid="Mr. P. O'Malley Mr. P. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the fact that a replacement industry has been found for the Hyster plant.  It is an area where there is high unemployment. There have been many spectacular failures, unfortunately, in the Snugboro Industrial Estate and apart from Hyster, the Trilogy and Mostec Corporations also went into receivership.  I hope the incoming industry will last much longer in that estate.  In relation to the Hyster plant what steps are being taken to recover the £15 million which was paid out by way of grants to the Hyster Corporation? Is there any security for the moneys which are still outstanding or do we just join the queue of other creditors and approach the liquidator at the end of the line?  Can the Minister tell us also whether the ownership of the R &amp; D work which was done has been established and who now has the beneficial ownership?  If ownership has not been established, what steps are being taken to establish it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the final part of the question, I can tell the Deputy from the information available to me that the question of the ownership of the R &amp; D work which took place there has not been finalised.  I can also inform the Deputy and the House that some of the Hyster assets and liabilities have been transferred to Thermo King.  Much of the machinery which the new company will be using is very compatible with the machinery which is already in place.  The negotiations between the promoter and the IDA are confidential.  The detail of such negotiations is never given out here <Col N="34" /> but I can assure the Deputy and the House that the IDA are pursuing the parent company to recover the outstanding balance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the number of jobs which will be created, I was somewhat disappointed with the figure of 207 jobs to be created by 1990. I understood from the statements issued in the past couple of weeks that approximately 200 jobs were to be created by the end of this year and perhaps even double that figure by 1990.  Will the Minister confirm that 207 jobs are to be created by 1990?  In view of the fact that engineering jobs, similar to those of the last firm, will be created using the same plant and machinery, I should like to know if the Minister has pressed Thermo King to re-employ those previously employed by Hyster?  I suggest that the Minister press the new concern to employ those people in view of the fact that there is huge unemployment in the area and that the area has suffered the loss of Mostec and Hyster in the past four years.  Will the Minister recommend to Thermo King that they re-employ the engineering staff who were engaged by Hyster?</P>

I have had discussions with the company in regard to the possibility of employing many of the <Col N="35" /> employees of Hyster and I understand that recruitment advertisements will be appearing this week.  I have no doubt that the new employers will take the experience of Hyster employees into consideration but, at the end of the day, we must leave it to the company to recruit their staff.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if his attention has been drawn to the recent controversy in relation to the grant-aiding of a soap factory in County Wicklow; whether or not there are guidelines and criteria in place in relation to such matters as public safety and international human rights, in the context of grant-aiding potential industrial development applications; if he will lay a copy of such criteria in the Library of the Oireachtas; when such matters were last revised; and whether or not the Government, as opposed to the Industrial Development Authority itself, have any specific policy or interest in these matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the industrial project referred to by the Deputy. In considering proposals to locate in Ireland, the IDA takes into account all of the relevant legal requirements, both national and international, including those relating to the environment, the rights of the workforce and the safety of <Col N="36" /> users of the products.  In so far as the work of the IDA is concerned, I am satisfied that a policy change is not required.</P>
      <P>Relevant Acts and regulations are the responsibility of the Ministers who exercise the appropriate function.  For example, the Ministers for the Environment, Health and Labour are responsible for regulations covering the areas that I have already mentioned.  Such regulations are available in the Library of the Oireachtas.  Questions related to the review of specific measures covering the areas indicated in the question should be addressed to the particular Ministers concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is missing the point of my question.  That question was not so much about the aspect of compliance with legal requirements or regulations but whether there are criteria in place, based on the policy of the Government, to guide the IDA, whose work we all commend, when making judgments about the type of proposals they should sympathetically consider or whether it is Government policy to facilitate any type of enterprise from any part of the world regardless of the social or economic implications here or in Third World or other countries.  I am certain there has not been any breaking of the law or regulations in regard to this but I am anxious to know if the Minister has a view that goes beyond that, particularly in view of the implications of the proposal for the Third World.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>This grant approval was subject to the conditions that the product and premises were to receive any necessary regulatory approvals from the relevant authorities such as, for example, the National Drugs Advisory Board, the Department of Health and the relevant bodies as regards the protection of the environment and the health and safety of workers.  That is the regulatory position and the grant was subject to it.  Production was to commence on 1 October 1987 and employment was to rise from 35 in year one to 60 in year three.  The <Col N="37" /> IDA have entered into legal commitments to the company as regards the grant and some 30 people are now employed there.  The environmental impact study has been completed and is satisfactory.  The Department of Health initiated procedures to determine if a manufacturing licence needed for the manufacture of this product under the health Acts could be issued.  The company have now obtained such a licence having been cleared by the Department of Health.  When the plant is operational the factory inspectorate will have to be satisfied that the regulations for the protection of people at work are fully met.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy raised a question about Third World countries and I should like to point out to him that the EC have reached agreement on a directive concerning the export and import of certain dangerous chemicals. Legislation will enable a Third World country to prohibit the importation of certain products prior to them being exported from the Community.  As far as the IDA are aware that directive will not pose significant problems for the project, as they understand it.  When that directive is in place, any Third World country can refuse such products.  They can give prior notice to the EC and ban the export of such products from the Community by that action.</P>

      <P>I recently received Government approval for a series of measures aimed at assisting Irish firms to realise their full potential on the domestic <Col N="39" /> market.  The measures are primarily aimed at public sector purchasing because that sector is the largest single purchaser of goods and services here.</P>
      <P>My Department are currently putting these measures into effect in a way that is consistent with our international obligations.</P>
      <P>It is intended to examine and clarify in detail the size and nature of public purchases so as to assist indigenous entities to compete, with a good prospect of success, for the business involved.</P>

      <P>The abolition of complicated or obsolete statutory rules, regulations or information requirements is a matter for the individual Ministers who have functional responsibility for the work of their Departments or agencies and the regulatory requirements administered in that regard.  As I indicated in my reply of 21 May 1987, too many rules and regulations contribute to costs in industry.  I have had an examination of this matter carried out by the Industrial Costs Monitoring Group and have circulated proposals for a co-ordinated Government programme of action to all Government Departments.  I shall be seeking Government approval for this programme shortly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if, in view of its newly acquired overall responsibility for industrial development in the mid-west, SFADCo will: (a) be locating <Col N="40" /> additional staff overseas; (b) be arranging overseas industrial promotion visits by Ministers on its own account; (c) be offering the full range of grants now offered by the IDA and taking sole responsibility for assessing eligibility of firms for such grants on its own account without requiring the consent of the IDA in any circumstances; and (d) be establishing sectoral advisory committees, similar to those advising the IDA on grants to particular sectors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Following its newly acquired overall responsibility for industrial development in the mid-west, I understand that Shannon Development will locate three additional staff officers overseas.  Two of these will be based in the United States and will be in addition to the two existing employees of the company who currently operate from the IDA offices in New York and Boston.  In addition, one person will be based in Germany and will work from one of the IDA offices there.</P>
      <P>As in the past, Shannon Development executives will be working closely with the IDA in promoting Ireland as a key location for industrial investment with personnel from both agencies arranging site visits to Ireland by potential investors. I can assure the Deputy that I will be carefully monitoring the situation to ensure that there is no disruptive competition between the two agencies in the locations where both are represented.  In addition, I should stress that SFADCo's action in this regard will result in no net addition to the number of staff promoting Ireland, from an industrial point of view, located overseas.</P>
      <P>I am informed that from time to time, Shannon Development will be arranging overseas industrial promotion visits by Ministers.  Full co-ordination with the Industrial Development Authority will, of course, take place to ensure that the maximum potential, from a national viewpoint, is exploited from such visits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As has been the case to date, Shannon Development will continue to implement national industrial policy as outlined in the Industrial Development Act, 1986. <Col N="41" /> In doing so it will, as in the past, provide the full range of grants now offered by the IDA.  Shannon Development will continue with its existing practice of assessing the eligibility of firms for such grants in accordance with the criteria laid down in section 21 of the Industrial Development Act, 1986.  IDA representation on the board of Shannon Development and the Industrial Buildings and Grants Committee of the company provides for continuous coordination between the two development agencies in the practical application of industrial policy.</P>
    <P>In addition, the recent appointment of a SFADCo representative to the board of the IDA will further strengthen the very close working relationship between the two bodies.  IDA representation on SFADCo boards provides a mechanism which enables the IDA to have a direct input into decisions on the provision of grant packages to firms located in the mid-west region and west and south-west Offaly.  In addition, a detailed Memorandum of Understanding will set out the precise principles which will govern the provision of grant assistance to companies to ensure that practice in the mid-west is consistent with national practice.</P>
    <P>By sectoral advisory committees, I assume the Deputy is in fact referring to the IDA's International Service Committee, Research and Development Committee and Enterprise Development Committee.  The position is that R &amp; D projects in the Shannon zone will continue to go to the specific R &amp; D committee already in operation under SFADCo's aegis.  R &amp; D projects for the rest of the region will continue to be processed, as in the past, by the IDA R &amp; D committee for the present.</P>
    <P>Enterprise development projects will, as in the past, be considered by SFADCo's Industrial Buildings and Grant Committee.  Equally, international services projects have in the past been submitted to the board of Shannon Development.  It is intended that this practice will continue.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will appreciate, of course, that the changes have only just been <Col N="42" /> implemented &mdash; beginning on 1 January in fact &mdash; and it would be unrealistic to expect that SFADCo will not adapt its policy in regard to these committees should circumstances warrant.</P>

      <P>The dispute which began on Friday last relates essentially to the voluntary retirement of 16 firemen, half of whom were in the officer grade.  Several days of intensive discussions, under the chairmanship of an industrial relations officer of the Labour Court, failed to resolve the dispute. I would emphasise that discussions continued in the Labour Court right up to the morning on which the strike commenced. I have been keeping in constant touch with events.  It is my understanding that there is still a considerable gap between the parties to the dispute which has resulted in a complete stalemate at present.  I would stress that the services of the Labour Court remain available to the parties to the dispute should they wish to avail of them.  In view of the seriousness of the dispute I should repeat that, should the parties wish to enter into discussions, an industrial relations officer of the Labour Court will be available immediately to assist them.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister accept that the dispute puts in very sharp focus the Government policy of trading jobs for pay increases since it appears that the cost of the pay agreement in the fire service will amount to approximately £370,000 while the savings achieved by these redundancies will amount to only £180,000?  Would he accept that that appears to be a less than realistic way in which the fire service should develop?</P>
      <P>Might I also ask the Minister what he was up to in the hours leading up to the commencement of the dispute?  Is he aware that the suggestions that he was operating in the background were a source of some amusement to people involved in the negotiations on both sides&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Because this problem has arisen on account of a Government-imposed redundancy scheme and that the Minister for the Environment gave a specific undertaking in this House that essential services would be excluded from this scheme &mdash; that fire services in particular would be excluded from the provisions of this scheme &mdash; would he not accept that he, as Minister for Labour, has an obligation now to intervene to assist Dublin Corporation in alleviating the very genuine fears held by the fire service staff as a result of the reduction in staffing?</P>

      <P>Arrangements have been made, in consultation with the Minister for Defence and with the co-operation of other agencies, for the Army to provide an emergency fire and accident service. Additional communications systems are in place.  The necessary fully-equipped fire tenders, and vehicles to deal with road accidents, have been strategically located in the Dublin area with suitable back-up if required.  The Army personnel who are manning these appliances have undergone special training in firefighting, including the use of breathing apparatus, road traffic accident techniques, etc.  An effective substitute service has been operating satisfactorily for the protection of life and property since the strike started at 9 a.m. on Friday last.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the Government's scheme of voluntary redundancy-early retirement, local authority managers were authorised to offer the terms of the scheme to all grades of eligible staff, other than key staff or those required to maintain essential services.  The question of deciding on the specific applications to be accepted is a matter for each manager to be taken <Col N="48" /> against the background of the authority's financial situation including Exchequer funding for 1988.  I understand from Dublin Corporation that they were satisfied that the small number of redundancies-early retirements they decided to accept in the fire brigade would not have a significant effect on the efficiency or effectiveness of the service.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister accept that the current emergency arrangements amount to all services being centred at one barracks in the city centre area, that all initial calls to the emergency number are first investigated by the Garda to establish the extent of the problem and then relayed to the fire service that must travel from that one central location?  In particular is the Minister satisfied that in one incident in regard to the Dublin docks area, the current emergency services are totally inadequate to deal with any difficulty that might arise there in the context of a fire outbreak?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The emergency services currently in place are adequate to deal with the situation at present.  It is not true that all the equipment is at one location. At each of two barracks, McKee and Cathal Brugha, there are three fire appliances located.  Santry Garda station and Tallaght Garda station have one fire appliance and Gormanstown Camp has also one appliance.  In regard to communications, a very effective means is in place and all emergency calls are being routed through the Garda control centre at Dublin Castle.  They are then verified and rerouted to the Army control headquarters which is in Collins Barracks. Then the normal alert takes place and Garda escort is provided for the appliance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. MacSharry)</NameTxt>
      <P>In the Budget Statement last March, I emphasised the need to give a sense of direction to the economy.  It is generally recognised that in the ten months since then this has been done successfully. Exchequer borrowing has been greatly reduced.  Interest rates and inflation have come down, the outflow of capital has been halted and business confidence has been restored.  Above all, there is now a belief both at home and abroad in the ability of the Irish Government to break out of the cycle of debt and depression that has been characteristic of recent years.</P>
      <P>There will be no change of direction. Government policy has been focussed on the closely-related objectives of improving the public finances and revitalising the economy.  These objectives will continue to be pursued.  Already there are signs that self-sustaining economic activity is growing and this will lead to increasing opportunities for employment. The estimates of expenditure, which were published in October, underlined the commitment to the improvement of the public finances.  Today's budget confirms this commitment and at the same time focuses on the importance of a developmental approach to the economy. It also incorporates major changes in our taxation system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The <i>Programme for National Recovery,</i> which has been endorsed by the major social partners, is the basis on which policies for the economy will be implemented over the next few years. This budget is in harmony with its terms and provides for implementation this year of several specific initiatives included in it.  The general support from different sectors for a programme based <Col N="260" /> on the necessity to live within our means, while successfully exploiting our resources, reflects a new realism.</P>
    <P>
      <i>The Economy</i>
    </P>
    <P>I am today publishing separately my Department's latest assessment of economic developments in 1987 as well as an outline of the forecast for 1988 on which the budget projections are based.  These take account of the revisions to the balance of payments statistics published last week and the effects of this budget.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Review of 1987</i>
    </P>
    <P>Last year there was a strong economic recovery based on a major advance in exports, substantially improved tourism and a big increase in agricultural incomes. Economic growth, at over 3½ per cent, was significantly better than envisaged early in the year.  The balance of payments on current account moved into modest surplus for the first time since 1967.  The trend in inflation continued downwards with consumer prices rising by little more than 3 per cent, the lowest rate for 20 years.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Prospects for 1988</i>
    </P>
    <P>There is general agreement that underlying growth prospects for 1988 are relatively constrained.  The international environment, reflecting the imbalances between the major world economies, will be less favourable than in 1987.  Besides, the necessary curtailment of spending in the public sector will affect domestic demand.  There should, however, be a signicant increase in investment in plant and equipment.  With inflation set to decline further to about 2½ per cent, and the personal tax reliefs, of which I will give details later, also improving disposable income, personal consumer spending could show a small increase.</P>
    <P>Exports should again achieve a substantial rate of growth, although not on the scale of 1987.  Both the trade surplus and the overall surplus on the current balance of payments should increase further. Real GDP growth in 1988 is projected to lie in the range of ½ to 1 per cent. The trend in GNP growth will depend <Col N="261" /> on the level of net factor outflows, the outlook for which is subject to major uncertainties.  If these flows were to show the same trend as in 1987, there would be positive GNP growth.  Should there be a reversion to previous trends in these flows, GNP would do well to maintain its 1987 level.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Framework for Economic and Financial Policies</i>
    </P>
    <P>I indicated in last year's Budget Statement that our general approach to economic and social policy would be based on the principles set out by the National Economic and Social Council in their report entitled <i>A Strategy for Development 1986-1990</i>.  The <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> closely follows this blueprint and sets out the framework of the Government's economic and budget strategy for the period to end-1990.</P>
    <P>The programme recognises that a fiscal policy which faces the financial realities is crucial to putting the economy back on the path to sustained economic growth. The Government are committed to stabilising the National Debt/GNP ratio during the period of the programme, a commitment which requires a reduction in the Exchequer borrowing requirement to between 5 and 7 per cent of GNP. Policies to control and curtail public expenditure will have to be continued to achieve this.  However, this must be done in the context of a comprehensive strategy for economic recovery, which includes maintaining a stable exchange rate within the European monetary system, while improving competitiveness through pay moderation, and changes in structural and incentive policies.  In parallel, practical measures are being intensified on a sectoral basis to exploit the economy's potential and to create new job opportunities.</P>
    <P>On a wider plane, the programme also commits the Government to pursue reform of the tax system, in order to achieve greater fairness and to promote economic development.  Furthermore, it confirms greater social equity as a prime objective of Government policy.  This budget will represent a major instalment <Col N="262" /> in meeting the Government's commitments under the programme, and in the implementation of our plans for the economy.</P>
    <P>Improved competitiveness is a key element in the strategy for recovery.  The private sector pay agreement associated with the programme will make a substantial positive contribution in this direction. Given our pressing employment needs, the low level of price inflation now prevailing and the significant income tax relief envisaged, there is no justification for pay increases higher than the level provided.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Budget Policy</i>
    </P>
    <P>The outturn on the 1987 budget targets was most satisfactory.  When these targets were announced, considerable doubts were expressed about the ability of the Government to achieve them.  The results for the year confounded the critics.</P>
    <P>The current deficit at £1,180 million was £20 million inside target and Exchequer borrowing at £1,786 million was £72 million inside target.  In terms of GNP, the current deficit of 6.8 per cent was the lowest since 1980 and Exchequer borrowing of 10.3 per cent, the lowest since 1977.  The 1987 results showed significant progress on 1986.  The 1987 current deficit was down by £217 million or 1¾ per cent of GNP on that for 1986 while Exchequer borrowing was down by £359 million or by nearly 3 per cent of GNP.</P>
    <P>The approach for 1988 remains unchanged.  There is no choice but to continue to reduce dependence on borrowing. The main emphasis must be on reducing public expenditure and already Government policy on this has been clarified.  The only other course would be to increase taxation substantially but this is not a practical option.  The reductions in expenditure are being made over a wide range of public services so as to minimise the impact on individual services and to achieve as fair a distribution as possible.  They are essential and overdue. The economy is already responding to the improvement in the public finances. I am confident that we can look forward to further progress towards our <Col N="263" /> goals this year.  This is the only basis on which our ambitions for economic growth and employment can be achieved.</P>
    <P>
      <i>1988 Opening Budget Position</i>
    </P>
    <P>The opening current deficit, based on the published 1988 Estimates of Receipts and Expenditure, is £1,111 million, after allowing for the deduction of estimated departmental balances of £23 million. The opening Exchequer borrowing requirement on this basis is £1,490 million.</P>
    <P>As explained in the notes to the 1988 Estimates of Receipts and Expenditure, these figures take account of increases in pay under the public service pay agreement; lump sum and related payments under the public service early retirement &mdash; voluntary redundancy schemes; the transfer of Exchequer funding of some house purchase loans to the private sector, and technical changes arising from the enactment of the Local Loans Fund (Amendment) Act, 1987.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Central Fund Services and Debt Management</i>
    </P>
    <P>The estimate for expenditure on Central Fund Services this year is £2,500 million of which £2,173 million is in respect of debt service payments.  The comparable outturn figure for debt service in 1987 was £2,091 million, so that the 1988 provision represent an increase of less than 4 per cent.  This is one of the lowest increases for many years but it is, nevertheless, an increase.</P>
    <P>The low rate of increase has been made possible by the reduction in borrowing, the beneficial effects of the fall in domestic interest rates, favourable developments in international interest and exchange rates and the savings generated by the increasingly active debt management programme which my Department are pursuing.</P>
    <P>The debt management programme has included:</P>
    <P>&mdash;the issue of new instruments in the domestic market, such as the ECU bond and tax-exempt bonds for <Col N="264" /> multinational companies, and the issue of short term notes in foreign markets, all of which have produced savings in funding costs for the Exchequer;</P>
    <P>&mdash;the continuation of the programme for prepaying and refinancing foreign loans at lower cost;</P>
    <P>&mdash;the extension of the programme of interest rate swaps which, especially as regards the foreign debt, is resulting in sizeable savings this year;</P>
    <P>&mdash;an increase in the volume of Exchequer Bills sold because of the lower borrowing costs compared with gilts; and</P>
    <P>&mdash;the promotion of the small savings schemes as a stable source of funding for the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>It is my intention to ensure that small savers will continue to be provided with attractive investment opportunities and I look forward to an increasing contribution from this source to the financing of the borrowing requirement.  My Department will be constantly searching for other ways to achieve more diversified and more flexible funding opportunities and to reduce the cost of managing the national debt portfolio.</P>
    <P>Despite the progress already made, debt servicing costs continue to be a major drain on the public finances.  The burden is evident from the fact that debt interest payments in 1987 absorbed 30p in every pound of tax revenue compared with 19p back in 1977.  The only realistic solution to this problem is to continue on the present course of reducing Exchequer spending and borrowing.</P>
    <P>The 1987 Exchequer funding programme was highly successful and resulted in a sizeable credit balance which is being brought forward to finance the 1988 Exchequer borrowing requirement. Given this favourable funding position, and the further reduction in the level of borrowing which will result from today's budget, the Government are in a position <Col N="265" /> to continue to exert downward pressure on the still excessive domestic gilt yields and to help create the conditions for further falls in the general level of interest rates.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Departmental Spending 1988</i>
    </P>
    <P>During 1987, the Government carried out the most comprehensive and farreaching review of State spending programmes ever undertaken.  The continuing justification for every major programme was called into question. Where programmes were seen to have insufficient justification they were curtailed or, in some cases, terminated.  The results are to be seen in the 1988 Abridged Estimates Volume and summary Public Capital Programme which were published last October and which for the first time in 30 years show a reduction in the absolute level of State spending.  No previous Government have been able to publish their spending plans so far in advance of the financial year.</P>
    <P>By doing so we have enabled programme managers and spending agencies to plan for orderly management of their finances this year.  I am glad to acknowledge the contribution of management in Government Departments to the review of spending programmes and their assistance, in conjunction with the managements of their respective agencies, in ensuring that budget allocations are observed.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Non-capital Supply Services Expenditure 1988</i>
    </P>
    <P>I have already referred to certain adjustments which have been made to the 1988 Estimates volume total for non-capital supply services.  Also, having assessed the end-year Exchequer returns for 1987, I am making some further adjustments to the published 1988 allocations to reflect the most up-to-date information available to me on expenditure trends.  Details of these adjustments are set out in the &ldquo;Principal Features of the Budget&rdquo;, copies of which are being circulated separately.</P>
    <P>Taking account of all these changes, <Col N="266" /> the adjusted opening figure for non-capital supply services is £5,620 million or £5,597 million after allowing for estimated departmental balances of £23 million. This supersedes the figure of £5,649 million published in the 1988 White Paper on Receipts and Expenditure.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Social Welfare</i>
    </P>
    <P>Public expenditure in the social welfare area will exceed £2.6 billion in 1988. Despite this huge demand on available resources, the Government intend to honour their commitment to social equity and to protect those who are less well off in our society.</P>
    <P>Last year, the Government brought forward the annual increase in welfare allowances from November to July to protect fully the real value of all such payments.  Likewise this year a general increase of 3 per cent in personal and adult dependant rates of welfare payments from late July 1988 will at least maintain the overall value of social welfare benefits for the 12 month period from mid-1988 to mid-1989.  Similar increases will be given to those in receipt of health allowances.</P>
    <P>In line with our commitment in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> to consider special increases for those on the lowest payments, the personal rates of unemployment assistance and supplementary welfare allowance &mdash; which are the lowest social welfare weekly payments &mdash; will be increased by significantly higher amounts.  The personal rate of long term urban unemployment assistance will be increased by an overall £4.20 to £42 per week, with <i>pro rata</i> increases in other personal rates of unemployment assistance and supplementary welfare allowance.  This is equivalent to an increase of over 11 per cent.  Child dependant allowances, payable with these payments, will be increased by 6 per cent, that is, the general increase of 3 per cent plus a special further increase of 3 per cent.  Where an adult dependant allowance is payable, that allowance will be increased by the general 3 per cent rate.</P>
    <P>At the same time, we are making a <Col N="267" /> start on the rationalisation of the rates of child dependant allowances payable with social welfare weekly payments.  The rate for the first and second child is being averaged; the rate for the sixth and subsequent children will be the same as that payable for the third to fifth children. These rationalised rates will then be increased in line with the general increase of 3 per cent, with an additional 3 per cent where appropriate, as I mentioned above.  These increases will cost the Exchequer an additional £44.8 million this year and £101 million in a full year.</P>
    <P>The proposed increases in social welfare payments will result in the following improvements:</P>
    <P>&mdash;a single person on long duration unemployment assistance living in an urban area will, as I have said, get an extra £4.20 a week, giving a total of £42.00, while a married couple will benefit by £5.00 to bring them up to £70.00 a week;</P>
    <P>&mdash;single persons in rural areas who are long term unemployed will receive an extra £4.10, bringing their weekly payment to £40.70, and a married couple will get an extra £4.90, thus providing them with £68.10 a week;</P>
    <P>&mdash;a contributory old-age pensioner who is under 80 will get an extra £1.70 a week, bringing the pension to £56.80 a week;</P>
    <P>&mdash;a non-contributory old-age pensioner who is under 80 will get an increase of £1.40 a week, bringing his or her maximum pension to £48.50 a week;</P>
    <P>&mdash;where a married couple are both of pension age and under 80, the new rates of contributory pension will mean an increase of £2.90 a week, so that their total pension will be £99.10;</P>
    <P>&mdash;the contributory pension of a widow under 66 will be £51.00 a week, an increase of £1.50;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="268" />&mdash;a widow under 66 with a non-contributory pension will benefit by £1.40, giving her a maximum of £47.60 a week; and</P>
    <P>&mdash;the flat-rate unemployment or disability benefit rate payable to a single person will rise by £1.30 a week, while a married couple will get an extra £2.10, giving them a new total of £71.80 a week; these payments may, of course, be topped up with pay-related benefit.</P>
    <P>While the structure of our social welfare system is being maintained and, indeed, extended to provide social insurance for the self-employed, steps will be taken to strengthen the controls already in force to reduce fraud and abuse of the system.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Jobsearch Programme</i>
    </P>
    <P>The Government have decided that the successful Jobsearch programme should be continued in 1988.  Since the programme began in April last, 141,500 unemployed persons were interviewed and 40,400 were placed on either Manpower schemes, AnCo training courses or Jobsearch courses.  A total of 4,200 found employment directly as a result of Jobsearch interviews, while 12,700 left the register voluntarily when invited to avail of assistance under the programme.</P>
    <P>During 1988, a further 50,000 on the live register will be interviewed under the programme and schemes and course opportunities will be provided as in 1987. It is expected that in 1988 a further saving of some £10 million will arise as a result of the programme.  These savings are already reflected in the adjusted opening position for non-capital supply services.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Equal Treatment</i>
    </P>
    <P>Equal treatment alleviating payments were introduced initially in November 1986 to ensure that the full implementation of the EC Directive on Equal Treatment did not result in hardship for those categories of beneficiaries adversely affected.  These alleviating payments were due to end last November <Col N="269" /> but, in order to avoid hardship for a vulnerable section of our community, were continued by the Government in the meantime.  The Government have now decided that these alleviating payments will be continued until the end of 1988. There will be an additional cost this year of the order of £20 million arising from this decision.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Employee Social Insurance</i>
    </P>
    <P>Despite rising expenditure from the social insurance fund, there will be no increase this year in contribution rates to that fund.  The current rates will continue to apply for the tax year 1988-89, subject only to the increase in the income ceiling from £15,500 to £16,200 which underlay the published Estimates.  The ceiling for the health contribution will also be increased, from £15,000 to £15,500.  The increase in the income limits for a hospital service card will, as usual, be announced by the Minister for Health at a later date. I am concerned about the solvency of the occupational injuries fund which is maintained entirely by employers' contributions. It is likely that a small adjustment to the contribution rate to that fund will be required in order to maintain its solvency.  The details will be announced in due course by the Minister for Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Statutory Sick Pay</i>
    </P>
    <P>The Government established an interdepartmental committee to examine the various issues arising from the introduction of a statutory sick pay scheme under which employers would be responsible for paying employees for the first 13 weeks of illness.  The committee consulted the interested parties and their report is currently under consideration. The Government are committed to the introduction of a scheme as soon as practicable.</P>
    <P>
      <i>PRSI for the Self-Employed</i>
    </P>
    <P>Last July, the Government decided in principle to extend social insurance to the self-employed, including farmers.  That decision was affirmed in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>.  Arrangements are <Col N="270" /> now going ahead to implement the decision as from 6 April of this year.</P>
    <P>The absence of a system of social insurance for the self-employed in Ireland is in contrast with the situation in other European countries.  This means that the less well-off self-employed and their dependants here must rely on the social assistance schemes when their incomes are adversely affected by age or death.  The cost of these assistance schemes is met directly out of general taxation and was over £300 million last year.  Given the current budgetary situation, the Government concluded it was essential that the self-employed, who account for some 230,000 persons or well over a fifth of those at work, should be required to contribute directly to the financing of the social welfare system under which so many of them benefit. The Government also believe that it is important to improve the quality of income maintenance cover for the self-employed by providing them with pensions as of right and reducing their reliance on means-tested pension schemes.</P>
    <P>The detailed provisions as regards contributions, qualification conditions and benefits of the social insurance scheme to be introduced for self-employed will be the subject of legislation to be brought to the House by the Minister for Social Welfare.  I wish, at this stage, to advise the House of the main features of the scheme as decided by Government.  The benefits to be extended to the new contributors will be old age and survivors' pensions.  Qualification for those pensions will be subject to broadly the same conditions as regards contribution record as apply to existing contributors generally.</P>
    <P>The National Pensions Board calculated that the appropriate rate of contribution should be 6.6 per cent.  In the Government's opinion, the imposition in one step of a charge of that size would be unduly harsh.  Accordingly, we have decided to phase in the charge over a period of years.  This will be provided for in the enabling legislation.  The initial rate that will apply from April of this year will <Col N="271" /> be 3 per cent, subject to a minimum contribution equivalent of £4 per week. I believe that this rate will not give rise to serious difficulty for any of those who will be liable.  Moreover, in the case of persons who have been notified by the Revenue Commissioners, on the basis of information furnished, that the scale of their operations is such that liability to income tax will not arise unless circumstances change for such as small farmers, their contribution will be limited to a flat rate of £2 per week.  Farmers an smallholders' unemployment assistance will not be liable for any contribution.</P>
    <P>The income to which the contribution rate will apply will be the same as for the health contribution and the employment levy, with capital allowances being deductible for levy, social insurance and health contribution purposes from 6 April.  The same annual income ceiling of £16,200 will apply for PRSI for the self-employed as for PRSI contributors generally.  I estimate that, as a result ot these changes, there will be a net £12 million gain to the Exchequer this year, reflecting a £14 million gain on the expenditure side of the budget, offset by a reduction of £2 million in tax revenue. Details are given in the <i>Principle Features of the 1988 Budget.</i></P>
    <P>The Government recognise that this initial level of contribution from the self-employed will not be adequate to finance the social insurance benefits to be extended to the self-employed.  I have already mentioned the cost to taxpayers generally of over £300 million a year in providing non-contributory pensions, which largely go to former self-employed persons.  Equity rules out any question of an additional Exchequer liability arising from the social insurance benefits for which the self-employed will in future be eligible.  Indeed, it is the Government's intention that the extension of social insurance to the self-employed will bring about a more equitable sharing of the cost of social welfare services as a whole. Consequently, it is important that the 3 per cent rate of contribution should be widely recognised and accepted as an <Col N="272" /> initial rate and one which has to be increased not only to finance the extra benefits to be provided but to ensure that the cost to taxpayers in general of providing pensions for former self-employed persons will not actually be increased.  The Government have therefore decided that the 3 per cent rate for the tax year 1988-89 will rise to 4 per cent in 1989-90 and to 5 per cent in 1990-91.</P>

      <P>The percentage rate of PRSI contributions payable by self-employed persons will be collected by the Revenue Commissioners.  In the case of directors who are on PAYE but are not otherwise liable to make social insurance contributions, the collection will form part of the present PAYE-PRSI collection system.  For other self-employed persons, the collection of contributions will be integrated with the new collection system for income tax for the self-employed and for corporation tax which I will further describe when I come to deal with taxation.  The health contribution and employment levy will also be collected by way of this revised system as from 6 April 1988.  In order to facilitate the introduction of this new, integrated collection system, income-related PRSI contributions, health contributions and the employment levy payable by self-employed persons will be calculated from the beginning of the tax year 1988-89 onwards on the aligned definition of income to which I have already referred. Liability for health contributions and employment levy in respect of earlier periods, and which was calculated on gross income, will remain unchanged.</P>
      <P>Arrangements for the collection of the new flat rate social insurance contributions from the self-employed will be announced by the Minister for Social Welfare shortly.  When I come to deal with taxation, I will outline measures which will have the effect of reducing further the Exchequer subvention to the Social Insurance Fund by £6 million.</P>

      <i>Drugs Refund Scheme</i>
    </P>
    <P>The 1988 Estimates had included a reduced provision for the community drug refund scheme and the long term illness scheme, both of which are operated by the health boards.  The Government have reconsidered this matter and have decided that the reduction contemplated would impose undue hardship on the handicapped and long term ill. Accordingly, we are providing an additional £11 million to be added to the Health Vote to ensure the continuation of these schemes at their present levels.</P>

      <i>Disabled Drivers</i>

    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Revenue Commissioners have operated schemes whereby indirect taxes on motor vehicles adapted for use by disabled persons may be refunded.  They have also operated a scheme for refund of excise duty on petrol in respect of such vehicles.  In addition, there is a scheme of remission of road tax, operated by the vehicle licensing authorities, in respect of cars suitably adapted for disabled drivers.</P>
      <P>The administration of these reliefs to the disabled has been cumbersome and unsatisfactory and it has been decided to make an improvement in this area.  It is considered that the most appropriate bodies to administer a revised scheme are the health boards.  In order to ensure the continuation of assistance for the promotion of mobility among disabled persons, a sum of £2.8 million is being added to the estimate for the Department of Health in 1988.  The full year cost of the existing schemes is £3.3 million.  The Minister for Health will announce shortly a new scheme to be administered by the health boards and he will finalise the details in consultation with representatives of disabled drivers.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Tourism</i>
      </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In their preparations for this budget the Government, while continuing to deal effectively with the imbalances in our public finances, have also pressed ahead <Col N="274" /> with their plans for revitalising the economy. The <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> recognises the existence of considerable potential in tourism for increased employment and economic growth.  The tourism sector in this country has largely missed out on the expansion of tourism experienced internationally in recent years.  The programme sets out ambitious, but realisable, targets for the industry.  Last year was a turning point for tourism in Ireland. The measures taken by the Government, especially in the area of access fares, have been acknowledged by the industry as an important contribution to the recovery in 1987.  In addition, the stimulation of tourism-related investment by the extension to tourism of the business expansion scheme, announced in last year's budget, should have effect in 1988 and subsequent years.</P>
    <P>It is widely acknowledged that the full realisation of Ireland's tourism potential requires new initiatives, especially in the marketing area.  Taking account of the recommendations from the recent tourism forum, the Government have decided to introduce another package of special measures for tourism in 1988 and to allocate £4 million for this purpose.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Fishing and Aquaculture</i>
    </P>
    <P>Fishing and aquaculture are other areas where the Government are determined to exploit fully the potential for employment creation and economic development.  BIM have prepared a draft development strategy for the industry which is at present the subject of urgent consultations with the Departments and other State agencies involved.  An objective of the strategy will be to improve the industry's capacity to increase fish supplies to the processing sector which will provide additional employment onshore and will facilitate a further expansion of our fish exports.  It will also aim at accelerating the development of aquaculture based on high value species of which there are limited supplies from wild fisheries.</P>
    <P>The development of both sea fishing and aquaculture will be assisted by the <Col N="275" /> establishment of a marine institute which will bring together for the first time all activities relating to marine research and technology which are at present carried out by a number of different bodies. Expenditure arising from these initiatives this year will be met from the existing allocation for the Marine Vote.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Adjustments to Non-Capital Supply Services</i>
    </P>
    <P>The net impact of the changes which I have outlined above is to add almost £63 million to non-capital supply services this year, bringing the total to £5,660 million.</P>
    <P>Details of the adjustments to the allocations for individual Votes as published in the Abridged Estimates Volume are set out in the <i>Principal Features of 1988 Budget</i>.  They will also be incorporated in the revised post-budget Estimates volume to be published shortly.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Capital Expenditure</i>
    </P>
    <P>The 1988 public capital programme published last October totalled £1,406 million.  As in the case of non-capital expenditure, this figure has to be revised to take account of developments subsequent to the publication of the programme. These changes are also detailed in the <i>Principal Features of 1988 Budget.</i> The most significant is a switch of funding for house purchase and improvement loans from the public to the private sector.  On this basis, the opening position for the 1988 public capital programme is £1,367 million.</P>
    <P>I now propose to make the following additions:</P>
    <P>(a)  <i>Education</i></P>
    <P>An additional allocation of £6.5 million over and above the figures originally published is being made available for the primary and post-primary school building programmes. This addition will be devoted mainly to school building in rural areas where the existing stock is in poor condition and most in need of replacement, extension or improvement.  The effect of this additional allocation will be that the <Col N="276" /> total amount for the national schools building programme will be £18.875 million and for the post-primary building programme, £23.625 million.  Allocations to individual school projects will continue to concentrate on the provision of classroom accommodation which is urgently required.</P>
    <P>(b)  <i>The Homeless</i></P>
    <P>The problem of homelessness has reemerged in many developed countries in recent years.  A solution to this problem will require commitment and cooperation from public sector and voluntary agencies.  The Government have approved a special allocation of £3 million over the next three years to finance the provision of accommodation for homeless persons by voluntary housing organisations.  I am including £1 million in this year's budget for this purpose.  Further details of this new initiative to tackle the problem of homelessness will be announced by the Minister for the Environment. A special grant of £50,000 will also be made available in 1988 to &ldquo;Focus Point&rdquo; towards the cost of a project already under way to provide accommodation for the homeless in Dublin.</P>
    <P>(c)  <i>Young Farmers Installation Aid</i></P>
    <P>Under an EC Regulation member states may pay grants to young farmers who are installed on their farm for the first time.  On the basis that these grants encourage the transfer of land to the younger generation, I have decided to re-introduce them for young farmers who have obtained the required educational qualifications.  For this purpose, I am providing £1.4 million in the Vote for Agriculture and Food.  The EC will recoup 50 per cent of this expenditure one year in arrears. Additional stamp duty on land transfers of £0.4 million is expected from this measure in 1988.  The revised total for the 1988 Public Capital Programme is, therefore, £1,376 million.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Non-Programme Outlays</i>
    </P>
    <P>I have decided to reduce the provision for non-programme outlays announced <Col N="277" /> in the summary public capital programme by £10 million to £40 million.  Essential allocations for financial restructuring of commercial State-sponsored bodies as well as certain other miscellaneous capital payments will be met from this provision. The Government will continue to insist that commercial State-sponsored bodies should manage their affairs in accordance with the best commercial practice.  Such bodies must not expect the Government to cushion them against failure in the marketplace.</P>
    <P>
      <i>ESB Capital Repayments</i>
    </P>
    <P>In earlier decades considerable sums were advanced on a repayable basis to the ESB.  Some of these moneys have still to be repaid and at the beginning of this year the total outstanding was more than £31 million.  In the normal course of events some £2 million, together with interest, would be repaid by the board to the Exchequer in 1988.  Following completion of the Moneypoint power station, the board's borrowing requirement is reduced.  In addition, their cost base has improved because of favourable movements in interest and exchange rates and major capital works are unlikely to be required for several years ahead.  It has been agreed, therefore, to repay all outstanding Exchequer advances in the current year.  The total of £31.385 million to be repaid will provide the Exchequer with an additional £29.33 million over and above what might normally have been expected from this source in 1988.</P>
    <P>Taking account of the additions to the Exchequer funded capital programme and the capital resources available to the Exchequer, the 1988 Exchequer borrowing requirement for capital purposes will stand at £332 million.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Employment in the Public Service</i>
    </P>
    <P>I announced in my Budget Statement last year that there would be a complete embargo on recruitment to the public service, except for certain key posts which could be filled with the consent of the Minister for Finance and the Minister for the area concerned.  This policy will <Col N="278" /> continue in 1988 on the same basis as last year.</P>
    <P>The Government also decided in the course of our review of public expenditure that it was necessary to reduce the numbers of public servants, and the cost of the pay bill, more rapidly than could be achieved by relying on natural wastage. They therefore introduced last July a scheme of voluntary redundancy offering attractive terms to public servants in areas where staff numbers were surplus to requirements in health boards, local authorities, the Civil Service and other areas of the public sector.  Since then the scheme has been offered on a general basis to employees aged 50 or over in the Civil Service, health boards and noncommercial State-sponsored bodies.  In the period to the end of 1987, over 1,100 people have left the public service under the scheme.  The redundancy terms will continue to be available during 1988.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that the combined effect of the embargo on recruitment and of the redundancy package during 1987 will have been to reduce the number employed in the Exchequer-financed public service by about 3½ per cent or 7,000.  This year, numbers employed in the public service are expected to fall by some 9,000.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Public Service Pay</i>
    </P>
    <P>For the first time in the preparation of a budget it has been possible to address the issue of public service pay against the background of a comprehensive three year agreement with the public service unions, negotiated as part of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>.  The agreement provides for moderate increases in pay in each of the three years up to 1990, and allows for the orderly conduct of industrial relations in the public service.  The size of the agreed increases is consistent with the Government's objective of stabilising the National Debt-GNP ratio.  Because public service pay developments can be clearly forseen up to 1990, the agreement will greatly facilitate the Government in their management of the economy over the period.  It also provides <Col N="279" /> the basis for a prolonged period of industrial peace.  The first increase under the agreement became effective in the public service from 1 January 1988, six months after the expiry of the 25th round agreement.</P>
    <P>The cost of even these moderate increases is, however, considerable.  The Exchequer pay and pensions bill will amount to £2,913 million in 1988, including £70 million in respect of the costs of the Public Service Pay Agreement and an exceptional provision of £80 million for lump sum early retirement payments.</P>
    <P>The Review Body on Higher Remuneration in the Public Sector, in November 1986, recommended an interim increase of the order of 15 per cent payable from 1 December 1986 for the categories within their remit, including the Judiciary, chief executives of State bodies, top level civil servants and holders of parliamentary and other offices.  In their main report, submitted in December 1987, the review body recommended further increases of varying amounts to be applied on a phased basis from a date not earlier than 1 July 1989.  The Government have had discussions with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and other interested parties about the reports.</P>
    <P>The review body are independent and impartial, and the Government accept that their recommendations were based on a careful and expert examination of all the facts and had regard to the Exchequer's present financial difficulties and public sector pay policy.  The Government also accept that the morale, quality and commitment of the people at the top in the public service must be maintained.  They recognise that serious pay inequities are arising, with higher staff being paid less or only very marginally more than those reporting to them.  Implementation of the review body's recommendations will have to be grappled with at some stage.  This year, however, is a crucial year if we are to get the public finances firmly under control and it is a year in which all groups in <Col N="280" /> society are being asked to make sacrifices.</P>
    <P>The Government regret, therefore, that they can give no commitment to any payment in 1988 on foot of the reports. They undertake, however, in the spirit of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and the Public Service Pay Agreement, to have further discussions with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions not later than 1 May 1989 with a view to arriving at an acceptable solution to the problem of implementation.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Decentralisation</i>
    </P>
    <P>In 1987, I announced that the Government intended to revive the decentralisation programme.  This has been done and over the next week or so contracts for the four centres in phase 1 of the programme &mdash; Ballina, Galway, Cavan and Sligo &mdash; will have been signed. Building work will start shortly thereafter. There has been widespread regional interest in decentralisation and the Government decided last November to proceed immediately with phase 2 of the programme, covering a further eitht centres originally selected in 1980.  These centres are: Athlone, Limerick, Ennis, Nenagh, Killarney, Letterkenny, Waterford and Dundalk.</P>
    <P>The programme is a major undertaking with very desirable regional and social consequences.  It involves the construction of new, purpose-built office accommodation in the 12 regional centres mentioned and the transfer of over 3,000 staff, or one-seventh of the total Civil Service at present located in Dublin.  It will provide an opportunity for those who wish to return to work in their home areas to do so.  It will also provide significant local employment during the construction phase and, when complete, there will be a lasting increase in trade for local businesses.</P>
    <P>
      <i>National Lottery</i>
    </P>
    <P>The national lottery although it has been in operation for less than a year has already exceeded our most optimistic expectations.  Its success has enabled the <Col N="281" /> Government to undertake major spending initiatives in the areas of sport, youth and recreation, arts and culture, the Irish language and community health and welfare. Spending on these projects is now getting under way.  As the lottery continues to grow, it is the Government's intention to provide support for further new projects in these areas.</P>
    <P>This year I expect spending from the lottery on foot of projects which have already been approved by the Government to amount to £60 million &mdash; £34 million on capital projects and £26 million on current expenditure.  This includes expenditure on new projects and also on items which have been financed heretofore by the Exchequer.  In line with the Government's policy that spending in areas such as sport, youth affairs, the arts and community care should be borne by the lottery, the above figures include further items totalling some £10 million which are now to be financed by the proceeds of the lottery.  These are identified in the <i>Principal Features of the 1988 Budget.</i></P>

        <i>Non-tax Revenue</i>
      </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>I mentioned earlier the re-organisation of the Local Loans Fund and the cost of the public service voluntary redundancy &mdash; early retirement schemes.  These developments have a similar impact on the revenue side of the accounts.  A sum of £275 million of circular interest payments is being eliminated from non-tax revenue as a result of the re-organisation of the Local Loans Fund under the Local Loans Fund (Amendment) Act, 1987.  The 1988 estimate also includes, in addition to the normal Central Bank surplus income, an <Col N="282" /> exceptional £80 million of advance surplus income to finance the lump sum payments arising from the voluntary redundancy and early retirement schemes.</P>
      <P>As I have already informed the House, this advance together with the £8.4 million advanced last year will be fully repaid by 1993.  Repayments will be financed out of the annual savings to the Exchequer from the redundancy and early retirement schemes.  The exceptional lump sum payments will not, therefore, increase the National Debt or the cost of servicing it.  With expenditure on national lottery-financed projects now expected to be of the order of £60 million this year, the lottery surplus included in non-tax revenue has been increased from the £36.5 million in the 1988 White Paper on Receipts and Espenditure to £60 million.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Taxation</i>
      </P>
      <P>Our tax structures and administration are in need of considerable overhaul. Large scale changes are desirable but the room for manoeuvre is restricted by budgetary requirements.  While a cogent case can be made for substantial reductions in the level of taxation in some areas, we cannot set aside budgetary realities.  Within these constraints, however, progress can be and will be made.  The general thrust of Government policy is towards a broader base for tax liability and much more effective collection. The Government have looked carefully at various taxation options over recent months.  The individual changes which I am announcing today add up to a balanced package from which every taxpayer will benefit.  They will improve the distribution of the tax burden and give an extra impetus to economic activity.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Income Tax</i>
      </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> the Government gave a commitment to introduce income tax reductions to the cumulative value, over the next three years, of £225 million, including increases in the PAYE allowance costing £70 million. The Government also undertook to make significant progress towards having <Col N="283" /> two-thirds of taxpayers on the standard rate.</P>
    <P>To honour this commitment, tax reductions costing just over £30 million this year would be sufficient.  I propose, however to go very much further than this and to provide for tax reductions costing £91 million in 1988 and £152 million in a full year.  In short, the Government are providing tax reliefs which cost three times what is required in order to fulfil the first year commitment in the programme.  The proposed changes are as follows:</P>
    <P>&mdash;the personal allowance is being increased from £4,000 to £4,100 for a married couple and from £2,000 to £2,050 for a single person, with comparable increases in the widowed, single parent and widowed parent allowances;&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <i>(Interruptions.)</i>
    </P>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>Save your breath.</P>
      <P>&mdash;the PAYE allowance is being increased from £700 to £800;</P>
      <P>&mdash;the standard rate tax band of 35 per cent is being widened from £9,400 to £11,400 for a married couple and from £4,700 to £5,700 in the case of a single person;</P>
      <P>&mdash;the 48 per cent rate tax band is being increased from £5,600 to £5,800 for a married couple and from £2,800 to £2,900 for a single person; and</P>
      <P>&mdash;the general tax exemption limit is being increased from £5,300 to £5,500 for a married couple and from £2,650 to £2,750 for a single person; there will be comparable increases in the age exemption limits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a result of these measures, 93,000 taxpayers who would otherwise be liable at the 48 per cent rate will pay tax at 35 per cent in the 1988-89 tax year.  In addition, 55,000 taxpayers who would <Col N="284" /> otherwise be on the top rate of 58 per cent will now have a marginal rate of 48 per cent.  Sixteen thousand taxpayers will be taken out of the tax net altogether, while a further 5,000 will become entitled to marginal relief.</P>
    <P>These measures mean that nearly 63 per cent of taxpayers will be paying tax at the standard rate in the 1988-89 income tax year.  This represents substantial progress towards the Government's objective of having two-thirds of taxpayers on the standard rate.</P>
    <P>Let me give some examples of the impact of these changes on different categories of taxpayer:</P>
    <P>&mdash;a single person on PAYE with a salary of £9,000 will gain £200;</P>
    <P>&mdash;a married couple with a very low salary in the region of £5,500 will gain £120; and</P>
    <P>&mdash;a married couple with a salary of £16,000 will gain £280.</P>
    <P>Further details of the income tax changes, showing the impact on different income categories, are contained in the <i>Principal Features of 1988 Budget.</i></P>
    <P>The PRSI tax allowance is being renewed at an estimated cost of £50 million in 1988.</P>
    <P>No change is being made in the terms of the mortgage interest relief.  This relief was reduced last year by 10 per cent. However, the subsequent fall in interest rates &mdash; brought about in great part by firm Government action on the public finances &mdash; has had a very beneficial effect on mortgage holders.  I would point out that, at budget time last year, ten months ago, the building society mortgage interest rate was 12½ per cent; it is now 9¼ per cent.  This represents a saving of £530 a year on the repayments on a £20,000 loan with a 20 year term.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Withholding Tax</i>
    </P>
    <P>The list of accountable persons for the purposes of the withholding tax on professional fees is being extended to include the Voluntary Health Insurance Board. The intention is to make provision so that payments made by the board in respect <Col N="285" /> of the fees of medical personnel will also be subject to the tax.  This will require legislation and the expected yield this year is £6 million.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Tax Administration</i>
    </P>
    <P>In my Budget Statement last year, I stressed that further improvements in tax administration were essential.  The <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> reiterated this objective.  An intensive examination has been carried out to determine what is required.  As a result, the Government are making a number of fundamental changes in tax assessment and collection procedures.  Taken together, these will constitute perhaps the most radical improvement in the administrative system since the introduction of PAYE.</P>
    <P>The broad objectives are to simplify tax assessment and collection, to eliminate the arrears which have built up over the years and, for the future, to make life significantly more difficult for the defaulting taxpayer.  There is considerable public unease about the effectiveness of tax collection. While this is in part due to misunderstandings, it is a fact that many of those who have tax liabilities fail to meet their responsibilities.  Among the most glaring examples of this is the late payment &mdash; and, in too many cases, the nonpayment &mdash; by some employers and traders of PAYE and VAT which they have collected from their employees or customers on behalf of the State.  This has got to stop.  The other main problem is the time-consuming and often ineffectual collection of income tax and levies from the self-employed.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Self-Assessment</i>
    </P>
    <P>I said last year that the Government favoured the principle of self-assessment and that this would be given priority.  The Government's commitment was confirmed in the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i></P>
    <P>Self-assessment requires radical changes in procedures both for the taxpayers concerned and for the revenue authorities. It must be phased in over a period, but the initial key steps are being put into effect this year.  These will apply <Col N="286" /> to income tax for the self-employed and to corporation tax.  The collection of the levies and PRSI from the self-employed, other than directors who are on PAYE, will also be integrated into this new system.  The changes involved in the new system for 1988 are quite complex and I cannot review them in detail in this statement.  A detailed account of the changes is being sent to interested bodies and a summary is given in the <i>Principal Features of 1988 Budget.</i></P>
    <P>The key new developments are:</P>
    <P>&mdash;first a requirement that, in general, taxpayers must make returns even if they do not receive demands to do so;</P>
    <P>&mdash;secondly, new, simplified procedures for making initial estimates of tax by the inspector of taxes;</P>
    <P>&mdash;thirdly, replacement in the first instance of the inspector's estimate by the taxpayer's own estimate of tax due accompanied by payment, pending the taxpayer's return of income; and</P>
    <P>&mdash;fourthly, appeals confined to cases where the taxpayer's return of income is not accepted by the inspector.</P>
    <P>These arrangements will put greater responsibility on each individual taxpayer to meet his tax obligations and, combined with the surcharge on late returns, should speed up considerably the collection process. In future, inspectors of taxes will as a general rule estimate tax due by reference to previous agreed tax payments and this should eliminate the problem of overstated outstanding balances. The volume of appeals should be reduced very significantly.  The necessary legislation for these changes will be incorporated in the Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>In addition to these arrangements for a phased move towards self-assessment, self-employed and corporate taxpayers will have the option of a fuller, voluntary form of self-assessment this year.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="287" /> The objective of these changes is twofold:</P>
    <P>&mdash;the complying taxpayer will have his tax liability settled faster and in a more realistic way; and</P>
    <P>&mdash;the non-complying taxpayer will face a much stiffer collection regime, with a much higher proportion of Revenue's resources concentrated on non-compliance.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Attachment</i>
    </P>
    <P>An essential ingredient of a successful tax collection system is a speedy and costeffective response to default.  At present, the Revenue rely mainly on the interest charges applying to late payment but this is not an effective deterrent where the taxpayer has little intention of paying on time or at all, and where the interest charge is itself extremely difficult to collect.</P>
    <P>The Government have, therefore, decided that a power of attachment is necessary.  This means that persons owing money to a defaulter and persons holding financial assets of a defaulter may be directed by the Revenue Commissioners to pay over such moneys to them.  Attachment would apply only to the extent necessary to meet tax, interest and penalties legally due by the defaulter.  This power is in operation in a number of countries operating self-assessment and was recommended by the Commission on Taxation.  It will complement the existing procedures of sheriff enforcement and actions through the courts for fines, penalties and judgements.  The Revenue Commissioners will continue to rely on their existing access to information in operating the power of attachment.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Tax clearance for grant applicants</i>
    </P>
    <P>I announced last year that arrangements were going ahead for the introduction of a requirement whereby applicants for grants from State and public authorities would be obliged to give their tax number and confirm that their tax affairs are in order.  These arrangements are being finalised and <Col N="288" /> instructions will be issued to the authorities concerned shortly.</P>
    <P>These measures, together with the appointment of Revenue sheriffs and the special task force, the imposition of a surcharge on late returns, the pressure from Revenue to eliminate the backlog of appeals and so on, can leave the non-complying taxpayer and the tax evader in no doubt that the climate has changed and changed permanently.</P>
    <P>There may be a lingering hope on the part of defaulters that these measures will not be fully applied and they may decide, on this basis, to opt for a &lsquo;wait and see&rsquo; approach.  I want to state categorically that, not alone are these measures being introduced, but it is the firm intention of the Government that all existing and new powers and procedures will be enforced stringently, and without exception, by the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>The emphasis underlying all these changes is on bringing tax payments up to date, and avoiding the build-up of arrears in the future.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Incentive to bring tax affairs up to date</i>
    </P>
    <P>To encourage taxpayers to bring their tax affairs up to date now, it has been decided to offer them, on a once-off basis, an opportunity to settle outstanding tax liabilities without payment of certain interest or penalties.  These terms will be available in relation to income tax, PAYE, PRSI, VAT, corporation tax and capital gains tax liabilities due on or before 31 December 1987.  There will be a further short interest moratorium of some weeks after which interest will begin to accumulate. Tax must be agreed and paid not later than 30 September 1988 to qualify for these incentives.</P>
    <P>A key feature of the arrangements is that, to benefit, a taxpayer will have to pay, on or before 30 September 1988, all the relevant liabilities including current liabilities of the taxes and levies in question. The arrangements will apply to sums with the sheriffs for enforcement and to instalment arrangements for the payment of arrears.  There will be a number of exceptions.  Full details will be published <Col N="289" /> by the Revenue Commissioners and the main elements are outlined in the <i>Principal Features of 1988 Budget</i>.  I expect these measures, together with a number of other operational changes in the Office of the Revenue Commissioners, to yield £30 million in 1988, of which £6 million relates to PRSI arrears and the balance to taxation arrears.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Corporation Tax</i>
    </P>
    <P>I announced last year that major changes in the structure of the corporation tax code were being considered.  A full review has been undertaken and the Government have decided to reduce the free depreciation and initial allowance provisions whereby up to 100 per cent of capital expenditure can be claimed against tax in the first year; there will be a parallel reduction in the standard rate of corporation tax.  The details are outlined in the <i>Principal Features of 1988 Budget</i>.  In summary, accelerated capital allowances on new investment from 1 April onwards will be phased down by 1 April 1989 from 100 per cent to 50 per cent, which is still a generous provision. The standard rate of corporation tax will be reduced over the same period from 50 per cent to 43 per cent.  Special lower rates of tax, other than the 10 per cent rate, will be abolished for virtually all companies.  The reduction in capital allowances will not apply to qualifying services companies in the International Financial Services Centre and in Shannon Customs-free Airport, or to the special building incentives in the designated areas for urban renewal.  Expenditure under contracts already signed will be eligible for the existing allowances, as will expenditure on projects which are negotiated with the industrial development agencies and approved for grant assistance before the end of 1988.</P>
    <P>Losses incurred on activities which qualify for the 10 per cent tax rate will be eligible for group relief only against profits from other such qualifying activities.</P>
    <P>Provision will be made whereby dividends earned abroad by Irish companies may be repatriated free of tax on certain <Col N="290" /> terms.  This is intended to encourage more repatriation of profits earned abroad for investment here.  Companies who wish to opt for repatriation free of tax will have to show that the moneys in question are intended to be used here for specified investment purposes.</P>
    <P>It is proposed to terminate the primary fund arrangement which requires that, in the case of companies having profits with a mix of tax liabilities, profits subjects to the 10 per cent rate of tax must be distributed to shareholders prior to other profits.  Following the introduction of advance corporation tax at the full rate, this requirement is no longer necessary.</P>
    <P>These measures, which are designed as an integrated package, represent a major reform of the corporation tax code.  This reform is in line with recent trends in several other countries.  The reality is that the changes are well overdue.  Our incentives have been exceptionally generous and, while these incentives remain unchanged, there is no prospect of reducing the standard corporation tax rate, which is desirable for economic reasons. The excessively high reliefs for investment have favoured investment in fixed assets at the expense of jobs, contrary to the needs of the community.  A broader-based tax, with less generous reliefs and a lower standard rate, will improve economic efficiency and will be fairer than the present system.  This approach is in line with the recommendations of the Commission on Taxation.</P>
    <P>The yield from corporation tax is low by international standards.  The changes which I am proposing today will not result in any additional revenue in 1988. The Exchequer will benefit, however, for some years thereafter.  In the longer term, as the impact of the reduction in accelerated capital allowances diminishes, the scale of benefit will decrease.</P>
    <P>The tax contribution from profits in the banking sector continues to be very small in relation to such profits.  The bank levy was introduced to compensate in part for this but, even taking the levy into account, the contribution is still inadequate. In the meantime, the scale of banking profits has continued to grow. <Col N="291" /> Accordingly, the levy is being increased by £5 million to £30 million for 1988.</P>
    <P>There is at present a £10 annual duty on credit cards and charge cards.  This duty is being extended to automated teller machine cards.  The extension will provide an extra £6 million in revenue this year.</P>

        <i>Pension Funds</i>
      </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>Funded pension schemes enjoy a very favourable tax regime in respect of pension contributions, investment income and lumpsum benefits.  Pension funds have in recent years earned exceptionally high returns on their investments.  Investment income is estimated to have totalled in the region of £325 million in 1987.  Virtually all of this income enjoys tax-free status.  Despite the recent drop in share values, there is every expectation that the funds will continue to achieve high returns.  In view of the excellent performance of recent years, it is appropriate that the funds should make a contribution to tax revenue.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, it is proposed to impose a tax on pension fund investment income on a once-off basis.  The tax will apply to gross investment income, including realised capital gains, in respect of the year 1988.  The tax will be at the rate of 6 per cent on such income.  Income in the form of interest which is liable to retention tax without any right to repayment will not suffer a double charge in respect of retention tax and the new tax. The first payment, which will be an estimated 90 per cent of total tax liability, will be due by 30 November 1988 and the balance will be payable by 30 June 1989. The expected yield from this tax in 1988 is £15 million.  I would like to emphasise that this is a tax on income only and not on assets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a special concession, designed to exclude smaller funds which have low income, there will be a threshold in the <Col N="292" /> case of self-administered schemes below which the tax will not apply.  This threshold will be fixed at a level of £5,000 gross investment income.</P>
    <P>
      <i>International Financial Services Centre</i>
    </P>
    <P>One of the success stories of the past year has been the establishment of an International Financial Services Centre to be located in the Custom House Docks Area in Dublin.  The 10 per cent rate of corporation tax has been provided for companies setting up in the centre, subject to a certification procedure.  To date, some 11 projects have been approved in principle and two of these have been processed to the point of formal certification. This is outstanding progress in the relatively short period since the Government took office and it bodies well for the future of the centre.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Shannon Services</i>
    </P>
    <P>Certain non-manufacturing enterprises established in the Shannon Customs-free Airport are currently exempt from taxation.  I propose to introduce a provision in the Finance Bill to enable these companies to qualify, subject to the normal certification procedure, for the 10 per cent rate of corporation tax when this scheme of exemption ceases in 1990.  This measure will guarantee the continued commitment of the companies in question to the Shannon region.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Stamp Duty on Houses and Lands</i>
    </P>
    <P>The stamp duty thresholds on houses and lands have remained unchanged since the mid-1970s despite increases in property values in the meantime. Because of the big cost involved, there is no prospect at this time of any major downward adjustment in the duty.  I am particularly concerned, however, at the rather drastic impact of the transition from the 4 per cent rate of tax to 6 per cent at the threshold price of £50,000.  I am, therefore, introducing a rate of 5 per cent for houses and lands in the price range £50,000 to £60,000.  This modification will cost the Exchequer £700,000 this year.</P>

      <P>There are now good prospects of recovery and, as an incentive to further development, I propose to restore for a three year period the tax incentive previously known as the &ldquo;section 23 relief&rdquo;.  This will provide that expenditure incurred on the construction of modest residential accommodation for renting will be an allowable deduction against total rental income.  I believe that this will encourage more construction of residential accommodation for renting and at the same time reduce rent charges in the private rented sector.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Urban Renewal</i>
      </P>
      <P>A number of changes will be made to the urban renewal scheme.  The boundaries of the designated areas in Dublin and Limerick will be extended on a very restrictive basis.  Also, because of its unique social and economic importance, an area in and around the Tallaght Town Centre will be designated for the urban renewal incentives.  In addition, the time limit applying to qualifying expenditure in the designated areas in the five county boroughs will be extended from 31 May 1989 to 31 May 1991, to bring it into line with that applying in the nine additional recently-announced designated areas.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Other Reliefs</i>
      </P>
      <P>The threshold on capital allowances and allowable running expenses in respect of motor cars required for business purposes is being increased from £4,000 to £6,000.  This will cost £600,000 this year but the full year cost, by 1990, will be £14 million.  This will reduce motoring expenses connected with business and it will also be of significant benefit to the motor industry.</P>

      <Col N="294" /> Stock relief for farmers will be continued on the present basis for a further year.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Indirect Taxation</i>
    </P>
    <P>Proposals are under discussion at the EC for harmonisation of indirect taxes with a target date of 1992.  We welcome, in principle, movement towards harmonisation and acknowledge that substantial benefits can flow to the Community as a whole from the abolition of fiscal frontiers.  The adjustment required of us, however, would result in a substantial revenue loss which would be difficult to contemplate, and we must look for countervailing measures at Community level to enable us to absorb the impact on our public finances.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Value-Added Tax Electricity</i>
    </P>
    <P>With the benefit of falling oil prices and interest rates and also favourable exchange rate movements, there is scope for a reduction of 5 per cent in electricity prices.  However, as electricity is now the only fuel which does not attract VAT, I propose to absorb the potential price reduction by the imposition of VAT on electricity at 5 per cent.  There will, accordingly, be no increase in consumer prices.  In fact, commercial customers who are able to recover the VAT element in their bills will be paying less for electricity as a result.  This will enhance the competitive environment for Irish business. The additional revenue yield to the Exchequer this year will be £10 million.</P>
    <P>
      <i>VAT Refund to Farmers</i>
    </P>
    <P>Last year, as part of the revised arrangements for taxation of farmers, the flat-rate VAT refund to unregistered farmers was reduced from 2.4 per cent to 1.7 per cent.  I indicated subsequently that a further reduction would have to be considered unless there was a big improvement in payment of arrears of tax-related levies by farmers.  I regret that there has been no such improvement and consequently the flat-rate refund will be reduced from 1 March 1988 to 1.4 per cent.  This will yield extra revenue of £7 <Col N="295" /> million this year.  I will consider restoring the rate to 1.7 per cent next year provided the problem of these arrears is resolved satisfactorily through the co-operation of farmers and the range of measures to improve collection which I have already set out in this statement.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Excise Duties</i>
    </P>
    <P>Recent falls in oil prices have had a beneficial effect in reducing fuel costs. The Government propose to absorb some of this reduction at the retail level by increasing the excise duty on petrol and auto-diesel.  The increases, including consequential VAT, are as follows:</P>
    <P>Petrol &mdash; 8p per gallon;</P>
    <P>Auto-diesel &mdash; 4p per gallon, but this will not apply to scheduled road passenger services.</P>
    <P>There will be no increase in the duty on auto-LPG.</P>
    <P>I propose also to increase the level of excise duty on tobacco as follows (the increase includes consequential VAT):</P>
    <P>Cigarettes &mdash; 4p per packet of 20 cigarettes in the most popular price category, with <i>pro-rata</i> increases for cigars and other tobacco products.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>In this European Year of the Environment, it is appropriate that the Government should act to promote a more healthy and clean environment.  Lead pollution from petrol has been a serious environmental concern, especially because of its dangers to the health of young children.  Unleaded petrol has been widely promoted in many countries and the EC requires that it should be readily available in all member states by the end of 1989.  I have decided therefore that there should be no price disadvantage attaching to the use of lead-free petrol and consequently I am proposing a concession in the excise duty applicable to this fuel, which will put it on a par with premium leaded petrol at <Col N="296" /> the pumps.  The cost in 1988 will be minimal.</P>
      <P>Another matter which the Government have had under consideration is the introduction of smoke control measures in the Dublin area.  They have decided in principle to make a start in this area in the current year.  Towards this end, £250,000 will be provided from within the existing allocation for the Environment vote this year.  The Minister for the Environment will announce full details of the proposed measures in due course.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Budget Targets</i>
      </P>
      <P>The measure of success in improving the public finances is the reduction in the borrowing requirement.  The target for 1988 for the Exchequer borrowing requirement is £1,457 million or 8.2 per cent of GNP which is the lowest since 1973/74 and is a reduction of 2.1 percentage points on the 1987 outturn.  In 1986, the comparable percentage was 13.2 per cent.  The estimated current budget deficit for this year is £1,125 million, which at 6.3 per cent of GNP represents a reduction of 2.3 percentage points on the outturn for 1986 and is the lowest percentage figure since 1980.</P>
      <P>These targets show that further significant progress will be made this year towards reducing our dependence on borrowing. They also indicate that the Government are firmly on course to stabilise the public finances by 1990.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Medium-Term Outlook</i>
      </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The recent independent review by the ESRI of medium-term prospects for the Irish economy confirms the validity of the Government's economic and financial policies.  This review showed that, with financial discipline, improved competitiveness and a stable external environment, we could aspire to sustained economic growth of 3 to 3.5 per cent once the public finances have been corrected. The ESRI assessment was, of course, dependent on adherence to the Government's economic and budgetary strategy in 1988 and on the maintenance of financial discipline thereafter.  Given, in particular, the risks of a deterioration in the <Col N="297" /> external environment, the ESRI suggested that it would be prudent to recognise that further budget adjustment may be necessary beyond 1988.  The OECD takes a less sanguine view than the ESRI of the medium-term prospects for growth and, therefore, of the further need for budget adjustment.  While the formulation of precise budget plans for 1989 must await a more detailed and up-to-date assessment, the Government will not baulk at the task of making further significant savings should this be necessary.</P>
    <P>It is clear, however, that the resolution of the budgetary problems, which have for so long dominated the life of our nation, is within sight and that economic recovery is within our grasp provided there is no deviation from the path now being followed.  The successful implementation of the 1988 budget strategy which I have announced today is a critical precondition for bringing about that recovery.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Conclusion</i>
    </P>
    <P>It is just ten months since we came into Government and in this relatively short period we have made great headway in restoring confidence, initiating new projects for development of the economy, and tackling longstanding problems on the tax front.  It takes time, of course, to reap the benefits of this in terms of substantial increases in economic activity and new employment.  It is most encouraging however to be able to report that productive investment in plant and equipment is on a steady upward trend, and that we are becoming more competitive. <Col N="298" /> These are the essential preconditions for higher economic activity and better employment.</P>
    <P>Budget control has to be maintained. Borrowing is still much too high and the burden of debt continues to have an unduly depressing impact on the economy. Curtailment of public spending is unavoidable at this time.  The alternative is still higher taxation which would further damage the economy and increase dissatisfaction with the tax system. Spending reductions have been widely distributed to minimise disruption and to spread the burden as evenly as possible, but with the exercise of a reasonable degree of restraint, a real improvement in the tax burden is possible as this budget demonstrates.</P>
    <P>At last, there are solid grounds for optimism.  For several years there has been a prevailing lack of confidence which was essentially due to the belief that we did not have the capacity or the discipline to correct our public finances, and protect and develop the economy properly in the face of severe difficulties. This Government have demonstrated their determination to manage the economy better.  They have maintained a fair and consistent approach in the face of strong pressures.  There is now an acceptance that the Government will maintain a steady course and continue to make improvements.  This, in turn, is reflected in an increasing confidence which is long overdue.  Let us now build on our achievements and move forward sensibly. The rewards will come gradually in terms of higher economic growth, more employment and better living standards.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Neither did the Minister mention the 30,000 emigrants, but they were written out of the Government's plans a long time ago.  This is a dull uninspired unimaginative budget introduced by an administration totally bereft of ideas.  It is a budget which follows a one-item agenda of controlling the national debt and it will neither inspire confidence nor establish the type of national consensus which is necessary if we are to tackle our problems.  It is a budget based on an optimistic prediction of a zero growth rate in 1988 and it will not spur any growth in future years.  The budget has failed to reform the tax system and it does not deal with the major structural problems of our economy, which inhibit growth by making us uncompetitive. This budget has missed a major opportunity&mdash;&mdash;</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> In this budget there has been missed a major opportunity to write a new agenda for the economic development of our country which would result in jobs in future years. This is a budget of addition and subtraction when the nation is interested in multiplication and growth rates which would lead to jobs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fianna Fáil are the last real party in this House to be converted to the idea that progress cannot be made here until the current budget deficit is reduced, until <Col N="310" /> the Exchequer requirement is reduced and until the GNP ratios are stabilised. Things were not always like this.  I would remind the Taoiseach that on 29 June 1984, he said that in his view the failure of the then Government had been significantly contributed to by the invasion of the corridors of Government of a coterie of professional economists preaching defeatist monetarist doctrines and peddling unrealistic and unacceptable policies.  Every year, on every major economic debate in this House, the Taoiseach attacked the Thatcherite policies of the Coalition Government; he attacked the monetarist policies of the Coalition Government.  It is pleasantly ironic to be on this side of the House now and see a budget which is based on the continuation of just these policies.  The Taoiseach has come a long way over the past couple of years.  His conversion was rapid but it is also welcome.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach is like a man who having learned a new tune can now not sing any other song.  There is a consensus in this House that we must continue to tackle the problem of the national debt.  This is the prerequisite for economic recovery but the debt-GNP ratio will not be stabalised without an annual growth rate of between 3 and 4 per cent.  Following a one-item agenda which reads: &ldquo;Reduce the debt and all will come right&rdquo; will not achieve this.  There is life after debt.  We must plan for it and plan to get there.  We must extend the agenda and the Government today failed to do so.  They missed a major opportunity at this point in the life of the administration to set the extended agenda which was necessary to stimulate growth in the economy.</P>
    <P>I propose in the later stages of my speech to suggest how this should be done.  Deputy Dukes, Leader of Fine Gael, speaking to the Tallaght Chamber of Commerce on 2 September 1987 laid down the conditions for Fine Gael support for the 1988 budget and I quote:</P>
    <P>If in 1988 the Government produces a budget which&mdash;</P>
    <P>1.  opens the way to a reduction in <Col N="311" /> taxes and particularly to a reduction in personal taxes;</P>
    <P>2.  brings about a significant reduction in the current budget deficit below the figure targeted for this year;</P>
    <P>3.  holds out a strategy for real employment expansion in future years; and</P>
    <P>4.  does not add to the burden of debt service cost in future years.</P>
    <P>I will not oppose the general thrust of its policy.  I intend to measure our support for today's budget against these criteria.</P>
    <P>Last year's budget, introduced by Fine Gael and presented to the people in the course of the 1987 general election campaign, was subsequently modified by Fianna Fáil and reintroduced.  That budget makes significant progress in reducing the debt.  The outturn for 1987 gave us a current budget deficit of 6.8 per cent of GNP and an Exchequer borrowing requirement of 10.3 per cent of GNP.</P>
    <P>The Government publication of Estimates for 1988 in mid-October of last year signalled that further progress would be made in debt reduction.  We welcomed the Estimates at the time and supported the overall thrust of Government policy. We in Fine Gael want to find successful and sustainable ways of expanding employment, of stimulating economic growth, of eliminating deprivation in our society and removing inequities from our economic and social system.  Reducing the debt, we have always said, is a prerequisite to this.  We believe, and know, that these objectives cannot be achieved until the debt-GNP ratio is, first, stabilised and subsequently the national debt is reduced.  We welcome the progress made by the Government today to further reduce both the EBR and the current budget deficit.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance hopes to achieve an outturn for 1988 which will reduce the current budget deficit to 8.2 per cent of GNP, the current budget deficit to 6.3 per cent of GNP and the Exchequer <Col N="312" /> borrowing requirement to 8.2 per cent of GNP.  He will achieve these targets if the policies which yield the cuts in public expenditure are maintained, or alternative policies producing equal savings are substituted and if his predictions for tax yields from today's proposals and the predictions in the Estimates of Receipts and Expenditure published last Friday are realised.  There is reason to suspect that he will fall short of the targets on both sides of the balance sheet, but I can deal with that subsequently.</P>
    <P>At this point it is worth raising our heads to look beyond the 1988 position at the medium term prospects for reduction in the debt.  First, we need agreement on what the yardstick is to be. For many years, economists have talked about the overall public borrowing requirement, then the emphasis moved to the current budget deficit, then it moved to the Exchequer borrowing requirement and now, in some recent studies and in particular in the ESRI medium term review referred to by the Minister, the emphasis is on stabilising the debt-GNP ratio.  If we are to measure the progress, I hope that we are all using the same yardstick.  I notice from Friday's publication which the Minister is implementing now the changes he proposed to eliminate double counting in the debt.  I hope that he will give us clear guidance now, if we are to talk in terms of stabilising the debt-GNP ratio, of what we are actually talking about.  The ESRI report would suggest that it be stabilised at 1:1.63, that that particular ratio of debt to GNP would be the point of stabilisation. However, if we work from corrected figures which are now being produced by economists, the figure would be 1:1.35 and the Minister, who has half corrected the figures at this stage, seems to be falling somewhere in between.  I hope that we can have an accommodation where we are all using the same figures when we are discussing these matters.</P>
    <P>There are major consequences, obviously, of reducing the debt with which we agree.  There is no possibility of <Col N="313" /> making real progress because of the preemption of resources in interest payments. However, there are other conseqeunces, also, with which the Minister has dealt and with which we also agree, but we are disappointed at the rate of progress.  Reductions have been made in interest rates.  When I was Minister for Industry and Commerce, I remember predicting that a certain type of budget which we intended introducing would reduce interest rates by 5 per cent.  That was greeted with guffaws by the Opposition, led by the Minister for Agriculture. I am glad now that this kind of reduction has been achieved.</P>
    <P>It is fair to point out, however, that there is no great stimulus to investment from the reductions that have taken place.  As a matter of fact, we are back just lower than the position that pertained in the summer of 1986.  When we compare our interest rates with those applying internationally we are about the same rate now in any particular interest rate &mdash; if we take the triple AAA rate in particular &mdash; as that which pertains in the United Kingdom.  However, the difference between our rate and the Deutsche Mark rate has actually widened in the last nine months.  The point that I am making is that an economic policy that concentrates on the reduction of debt and hopes that there will be ensuing reductions in interest rates which will lead to economic growth is focusing too narrowly and will not achieve the results which the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance expect and is not achieving them now.</P>
    <P>The take-out of the economy in the Estimates laying the way for this budget published in October has been very significant indeed.  It has deflated and will deflate the economy in a major way, and every prediction for growth that I have seen so far is less than 1 per cent and most of the predictions are for negative growth.  The Minister has not stated quite clearly on what growth prediction rate he is basing this budget, but it seems from the figures that he is producing that it is based on a zero net growth rate.  That is <Col N="314" /> optimistic when we look at the predictions that have come from various sources in the last three months and there could quite easily be negative growth. Falling interest rates alone will not stimulate the economy.  The Government will come to realise this very forcefully as the year progresses.</P>
    <P>We agreed, as I said, with the Estimates which were published in October. Public expenditure was reduced dramatically, but in doing this, unnecessary trauma was created for many sectors in the community.  I should like to refer briefly to the managerial mess which still exists in the health and the education services.  In education now we see a review of a review of a review.  The Taoiseach will have to call his Ministers aside and make sure that in the implementation of cuts the public services are managed correctly.</P>
    <P>I should like to proceed now to the area of the specific tax measures which have been introduced in the budget.  No attempt has been made by the Government to introduce major tax reform in the budget and this is a serious mistake. An opportunity has been missed.  An enormous number of the working population are paying taxes at the highest marginal rates.  The Minister for Finance, in his proposals today, has tricked around with some allowances but he has made no radical changes in the taxation system. I do not think it is possible that we can achieve economic growth without major changes in the taxation system and in the PRSI system.  Every economic commentator points to our outdated taxation system as the major inhibitor of growth in our economy and the Minister has done nothing to change this today.</P>
    <P>The Minister has spoken about the requirements of the national programme for economic recovery.  He has claimed that his commitment in the programme is to provide relief on income tax amounting to £30 million.  When we look at the total figures we realise he has done no more than this because, while he purports to give back £90 million to the income tax paying community, he takes £60 million from the same community by a variety <Col N="315" /> of measures which he has introduced. Excise duties are an example.  He has put 8p on petrol and 4p on cigarettes which will raise £26 million.  He has introduced VAT on electricity which will weigh on the domestic consumer and that will raise £10 million.  Stamp duty on bank cards, which will affect the individual holder of a bank account, will raise £6 million.  The extension of withholding tax to the fees of medical personnel and the bringing of VHI into the scheme will impinge on VHI payers and on the patients rather than on the doctors.  The taxation on pension funds will bring in £15 million which again by and large will come from the pensions of the ordinary PAYE workers.  What purports to be a giveaway of £94 million is in effect a net £30 million, which is what the Minister was obliged to do in the plan.</P>
    <P>The range of income tax reliefs is very modest indeed &mdash; for example, 30p per week on the single person's allowance by an extension of the personal allowance by £50.  The Minister has quoted figures of £280 for a married couple on £16,000 but of course that is the maximum increase and nobody will gain any more than that.  All in all, there has been a missed opportunity.  The Minister could have been radical in the reform of income taxation but he missed the opportunity to do anything of a radical nature.</P>
    <P>In one of our budgets we introduced tax relief amounting to £120 million in a nine month period, which would have cost us almost £200 million in the full 12 months.  By the time the measure was implemented in April the tax relief was scarcely noticed.  As the Minister is aware, PRSI is taken over ten months of the year &mdash; there is a two month moratorium on PRSI payments &mdash; and as soon as people come back on the full rate of PRSI in April the effect of modest reductions in income tax such as this is totally lost.  The deduction from somebody's salary in April will exceed, even with these modest reductions in income tax, that in March.  It is a very modest proposal.  Obviously any relief of income tax is welcome and we welcome it in that <Col N="316" /> limited extent, but a major opportunity to reform income tax and to remove one of the great inhibitors to growth in our economy was missed.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister is aware that 46 per cent of the labour force is single. Most of these people are subject to the highest marginal rates of income tax on very low incomes.  What the Minister has done today will not take a significant cohort of single people on the average industrial wage out of the higher marginal rates.  In fact, when we allow for modest pay increases in the early half of this year I doubt that any significant number of people will transfer from the higher to the lower marginal rates.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's move to self-assessment. In December 1986, Deputy John Bruton as Minister for Finance invited a group from the IMF to study the possibility of introducing self-assessment in this country.  I am glad the Minister has decided to introduce this scheme. The International Monetary Fund sent a small team to examine the possibility of self-assessment in December 1986.  They concluded that self-assessment would have clear advantages and could result in the receipt of greater revenue at lesser cost but only if the system incorporated adequate powers and safeguards and provided it was widely acceptable.  Self-assessment would place on taxpayers the responsibility for calculating and paying on time their own tax liabilities and would dismantle many of the existing tax collection procedures.  A move to self-assessment could be made only if there was a high level of commitment to it.</P>
    <P>The necessary preconditions for the introduction of a self-assessment system would be that there would be a clear and unequivocal commitment to all aspects of the system; that there would be public recognition and acceptance of the advantages of self-assessment; and that there would be an enhanced revenue administration structure capable of meeting the new and altered demands that would be imposed on it.  If these preconditions are not satisfied a move to self-assessment will prove to be an expensive failure.</P>
    <P>There is also the whole question of <Col N="317" /> what sanctions the Minister intends to introduce.  There is no point in moving to self-assessment unless the Minister has sanctions in mind and he did not speak today of any sanctions which he might implement.  The report on self-assessment includes a number of them.  There is a proposal that there will be a surcharge for the late filling of returns; that penalties for inaccurate returns as a result of fraud or negligence will be implemented; that an interest charge for late payment of tax will be applied; that local involvement in collection with compliance visits being made by collection officials for the premises of defaulters will be in place; that greater use of existing powers, including the powers of entry to business premises, will be used; that there will be a depository receipt system for payment of PAYE by employers and traders; that a power of attachment to allow for seizure of financial assets will be implemented &mdash; I notice the Minister said he intends bringing in a power of attachment in this respect &mdash; that there will be a seizure if necessary and the sale of real or personal property; and that the Revenue Commissioners will have power to impose civil penalties.  I do not know what the Minister's intention is on self-assessment and on the penalties which should apply to non-compliance, but I do not believe that the power of attachment alone will be sufficient to achieve the ends which the Minister has in mind.</P>
    <P>I noticed also that the Minister has ignored completely the whole question of disclosure in self-assessment.  He should make it clear whether the Revenue Commissioners will have the power of establishing that full disclosure of people's assets has been made, that there has been full disclosure of accounts in banks and building societies.  The Minister will have a particular problem here because nondisclosure was extended to the banks when the DIRT tax was introduced.  I can see a very difficult situation arising, as the Minister moves to self-assessment, in having full disclosure but I do not think self-assessment can work unless there is full disclosure.</P>
    <P>I would like to deal briefly with the <Col N="318" /> proposals on social welfare made by the Minister.  A 3 per cent increase in social welfare from July is a very modest increase.  It just matches the rate of inflation.  It is what was committed by the Minister in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> but it is extremely modest.  The Minister has proposed a further increase for the long term unemployed and their dependants.  I would like to point out that in the budget introduced by us last year such a proposal was made but this was dropped by the present Government when they came to power.  We had proposed an increase of £3.50 per week for the long term unemployed and that is slightly in excess of what is now being proposed by the Minister.  We welcome it.  This is the poorest section of the community. I am glad that there is some targeting of particular sections in the social welfare code by the Government and I hope this can be continued.</P>
    <P>I would now like to deal with the extension of PRSI to the self-employed.  The commitment to extend PRSI to the self-employed and farmers was first proposed in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> in October 1987.  The proposal, I think, is of dubious origin.  It seems that separate agreements were made between the Taoiseach and the trade union movement on the one hand and with the farmers on the other.  The proposal to extend PRSI to the self-employed and farmers was an attempt to keep the partners together in a marriage which was breaking down. As the Taoiseach knows, very often the children of marriages arranged or continued on this basis are not very happy and this particular proposal is going to be a very difficult one indeed.</P>
    <P>If the proposal was simply that the same level of benefit would accrue to the farmers and self-employed as a result of making a contribution there would be no difficulty with it but what is being proposed is that there will be an extension of benefit and an increase in the liability of the State as a result of the introduction of this scheme.  Beneficiaries will be entitled to contributory pensions rather than non contributory pensions and these <Col N="319" /> will average approximately £8 a week extra.  It is not clear from what the Minister has said whether or not other benefits will accrue to beneficiaries, or whether the Government subsequently intend to extend other benefits to new contributors. It is not clear as to what the Minister's intentions are in this case but it is quite clear benefit will extend to widows and orphans within a three to five year period.</P>
    <P>The first question I would like to pose is at the level of principle.  Is it wise, logical or consistent at a time of massive cutbacks in public services to extend the welfare state to several hundred thousand people many of whom make their own provision for pensions at present and would be quite happy to do so in the future?  There would obviously be some modest cash flow advantage for the Exchequer in the early years &mdash; calculated by the Minister at £15 million in 1988.  This £15 million could be used to relieve somewhat the burden on income taxpayers but it is a very modest cash flow benefit indeed.  On the other hand, the potential liabilities accruing after the tenth year of the scheme have not been quantified and could be enormous.  What is being presented as a scheme introduced to reduce the burden of income tax on the PAYE sector could result in massive income tax increases to pay for the scheme in the medium and long term.</P>
    <P>As has been pointed out in the report on the extension of social insurance to the self employed recently published by the National Pensions Board, other questions also arise.  Chief among these is, first, the issue of assessment.  There are enormous difficulties in assessing the incomes of the self-employed which will form the basis of assessing liability as is already evident in relation to taxation. Secondly, there is the problem of evasion. It is likely that there will be acute problems and there will be every incentive to understate income and thus reduce or eliminate liability to avoid paying contributions altogether or to pay an incomplete contribution and to have an incomplete contribution record because <Col N="320" /> an incomplete contribution record will not affect pension eligibility.</P>
    <P>There will also be a major problem with collection and nothing the Minister has said would indicate that this has been solved.  There are already problems in relation to the health and youth employment levies and the Minister has made no proposal which would indicate that the collection system will be any more successful in this case.  In addition, for those not paying a schedule D income tax, an entirely new collection system will have to be set up.  No proposals for the establishment of such a system have been made even though the Minister has now announced a start up date.</P>
    <P>Then there is the question in regard to the rate.  At what rate in equity should the self-employed contribute to the scheme?  It is clear from the majority report of the National Pensions Board and two minority reports from farmer organisations that the level of contribution will be a matter of controversy. Even if the 6.6 per cent rate proposed by the National Pensions Board is adopted in future years &mdash; and the Minister's intention is that it will not be adopted &mdash; and the associated liabilities collected in full, the board's estimation is that the State will have to bear 60 per cent of the cost of pensions payable to the self-employed. Obviously, the cost would be much higher at a reduced rate.  This compares with a State subsidy of 38 per cent towards the cost of payments to existing contributory beneficiaries.  The Minister said that he will introduce the scheme at 3 per cent, extend it to 4 per cent next year and 5 per cent the year after.  At 5 per cent it will require a collection rate of 90 per cent to break even and that is with no extension of benefit.</P>
    <P>The genesis of the scheme seems to be that there is a sizeable sum of money, £300 million, going on non contributory pensions to the self-employed and farmers at present.  The presentation is that by introducing a modest contribution there will be a net advantage to the Exchequer and that, in effect, contributions would be received from people who are now <Col N="321" /> getting a major benefit without making a contribution.  Obviously, this appeals to the PAYE sector and to many taxpayers because the further point is made that quite wealthy people can divest themselves of property and claim non contributory pensions almost immediately, as can those with no means whatsoever.</P>
    <P>There is a case to be made and a case to be met but as presented by the Minister it looks like a botch.  It appears to give a cash flow benefit in the short term which could alleviate the burden on the PAYE sector.  The total is £15 million and, as presented by the Minister, there is no doubt in my mind that the liabilities which the State is now taking on will put a huge burden on the ordinary taxpayer in the medium and long term.  The burden will start between the third and fifth year in the case of widows' and orphans' pensions and very strongly after the tenth, eleventh and twelfth years in the case of old age pensions to the self-employed and farmers.</P>
    <P>I do not understand the logic of an extension of the social welfare system to an area such as this at a point when cutbacks are being made in other areas of State services and I do not think the Government have thought this fully through.  A hasty agreement was entered into in the concluding days of the preparation of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>.  There is a widespread belief that the Taoiseach had separate talks and made separate agreements with, on the one hand, the trade union movement and, on the other hand, with the IFA and the ICMSA and that the two agreements did not correspond in all respects.</P>
    <P>The least the Minister should commit himself to before the scheme is implemented is to have a proper actuarial assessment of the costs and benefits of it. At the moment it looks like it is being presented as something in relief of the income tax payer while massive IOUs are being signed which will put an enormous burden on people in the medium term. We are reaping today the difficulties of the seeds that were sown between 1977 and 1979.  We should not set seeds now which will produce weeds in 1997, 1998 <Col N="322" /> and 1999 and add a further massive burden to the economy.  I am calling on the Minister to produce a proper actuarial assessment of the scheme to deal with the difficulties I have raised.  I want him to consider the possibility of an opting out clause which could be simply constructed into the system.  I want him to present the result of that to the House before this proposal proceeds any further.</P>
    <P>In passing I mentioned the possibility of an opting out clause.  Many people in private pension schemes are quite happy to remain in them, and have not made any demand that the State should get involved in this area of activity.  The Government would do the income tax payer and the State a favour if they allowed people who want to arrange their own affairs for pension purposes to continue to do so.  A simple form of certification to be presented to the Department of Social Welfare stating that a certain level of cover had been privately arranged by an individual should be sufficient to allow a person opt out of the scheme.  Naturally, we cannot have people going in and out of a scheme like this and, therefore, the opt out clause would have to be a once-off.  In that context it would be worthwhile if the Minister offered the same opting out clause to those who are not self-employed, to employees who are paying very high rates of PRSI.  The sums should be done on that proposal to see if there would be a benefit to the Exchequer if people on the high rates of PRSI were allowed make their own arrangements for pension purposes and not be a burden on the State.</P>
    <P>The whole basis of the debate that has been going on for the last six or seven years has been that State schemes were over-extensive and putting an undue burden on the taxpayer.  The Minister should adopt my suggestion before the further extension is proceeded with.</P>
    <P>I should now like to deal with some of the Minister's individual proposals, some of which are of an usual nature, some of which can be welcomed and some of which are not so welcome.  I have mentioned income tax already.  There is no difficulty with what the Minister is doing <Col N="323" /> there but there is a major difficulty with what he has refused to do, to carry out a major reform of the income tax code not just for the benefit of the individual taxpayer but to restore incentives to the economy, treat PRSI and income tax on the same basis and reform the scheme in its entirety.  I am very worried about the extension of the withholding tax on professionals to VHI payments.  When the scheme was introduced on budget day last year I raised questions about it and I raised further questions during the course of the debate on the Finance Bill.  I thought I had an absolute commitment from the Minister for Finance that there would be no extension to VHI payments. A proposal that the VHI deduct 35 per cent from any payment made to a patient covered by VHI and forward it to the Revenue Commissioners will be difficult to monitor and will automatically result in extra cost to the patient rather than a reduction in income for the doctor.  I do not think it will be possible to ensure that it will apply only to the income of the profession and will not have to come out of the pocket of the patient who is covered by VHI.  I have no doubt that we will be returning to that during the course of the debate on the Finance Bill but I want to put down a strong marker on it on this occasion.</P>
    <P>I welcome the moves on tax administration. I do not propose to deal with them now and while there could be other improvements, at least a start has been made.  I welcome, in particular, the move to self-assessment although the Minister has not given us a very clear picture of his intentions.  The decision to tax pension funds is an interesting proposition.  The issue has been debated for some time and it is very difficult to know if the Minister's move is justified.  As I understand it, the Minister intends to take £15 million by imposing a 6 per cent once-off levy on the capital gains of pension funds.  That levy will not be on the asset but on the income.  I do not know what the average gain on pension funds was in the last 12 months but I suspect it was about 12½ per cent.  If the Minister takes 6 per cent off <Col N="324" /> that, a pension fund will be allowed to continue with a capital gain of about 3½ per cent more than the rate of inflation. On the face of it that appears to be a reasonable proposal but I always understood that the rule in regard to the taxation of pension funds was that the funds were taxed on the way in or on the way out but not taxed during the term.  By and large the contributions to pension funds are exempted from tax.  For example, one can make a contribution of up to 15 per cent of income, which will accrue tax relief at the highest marginal rate, to a private pension fund at the moment.  No tax is applied when money is on the way into a pension fund.  However, tax is applied on the way out because a person in receipt of a pension on retirement is taxed on that pension.  It is not correct to say that there is no tax on pension funds.</P>
    <P>There have been major capital gains in pension funds in the last number of years, certainly in the last three years and the current year, despite the events in October, but there were very lean years in the seventies.  In the years of high inflation the gains in pension funds were negative. I am not sure whether all pension funds can bear this imposition.  I would like the Minister to give us more information about this.  Strong pension funds can bear the imposition but we need more information about this proposal which it appears will bear very heavily on some pension funds.  I sincerely hope that it does not drive some of them into insolvency. An actuarial assessment would be of benefit to us as we debate this issue in the House.</P>
    <P>The idea of a once-off levy has been around for a long time.  The bank levy which the Minister is renewing was introduced a long time ago as a once-off levy. I have a fear of once-off levies and I suspect that if the Minister is still Minister for Finance next year we will have a once-off levy produced once more.  There are a number of once-off proposals in the budget, this £15 million being one of them and another, the £30 million to be repaid by the ESB.  We shall have more to say on that also.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="325" /> The other taxation proposals to which I have referred are the increases in excise duties.  There will not be great applause for the Minister as people drive home this evening realising that they will be paying another 8 pence per gallon of petrol. Neither will there be great applause for the Minister on the part of those who are still smoking, with an additional 4 pence on a 20 packet of cigarettes.  I wonder, is that wise?  I noticed, on the basis of last Friday evening's figures, a prediction that there will be an actual reduction in excise returns over the next 12 months of over £11 million.  Excise duties must be approaching the level of diminishing returns.  That is true particularly of the spirits industry and perhaps also the beer industry.  I am glad the Minister has not raised excise duties on beers and spirits. It is time for the Minister to experiment with a scheme much loved by the Taoiseach, of self-financing tax reductions&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Another experiment is overdue in the reduction of excise duties on spirits, and possibly on beer.  The same applies to electrical equipment, televisions, videos and such items.  I do not believe they are self-financing on a 12-month basis but there is evidence to suggest that reductions in excise on items with a very strong cross-Border trade &mdash; whether legitimate or smuggled &mdash; can be self-financing over a longer period of time.  The Minister could experiment in that respect with very little risk to revenue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am disappointed the Minister has not seen fit to move on value added tax.  He took off his hat to the notion that VAT rates would have to be harmonised within the Community by 1992 but since the Minister did not give any indication of how he will move I presume it is his intention to seek a derogation.  The evil day cannot be postponed too long.  The whole question of value added tax and <Col N="326" /> excise duties has to be put in order with a view to the harmonisation of tax rates within the EC.  The Minister has introduced a VAT rate of 5 per cent on electricity, while saying that there is scope for a reduction of 5 per cent in electricity prices, he is clawing back the benefit which would otherwise accrue to the taxpayer. It should be remembered that this will constitute a burden on domestic consumers only.  Business and manufacturing industry can reclaim expenditure on VAT, so that there will be a clawback for that sector.  However, instead of Seán Citizen and his wife having reduced electricity costs they will have to bear its present high level costs.</P>
    <P>The value added tax refund to farmers has been almost totally eliminated.  Tricking around with value added tax relief in lieu of getting taxation from the farming community is not the proper way to approach value added tax or farm taxation. The Minister is endeavouring to clawback the loss in revenue resulting from the abolition of the land tax.  Last year he went halfway toward abolishing the value added tax refund and he has gone almost the whole way this year.</P>
    <P>I should like to move now to the main thrust of my criticism of the budget.  I believe we are on a one item agenda. Finally, we have got Fianna Fáil to agree to that one item and they are attacking it with a certain amount of vigour.  The target of 8.2 per cent on the Exchequer borrowing requirement is one which represents substantial progress in debt control. We all agree with the arguments advanced about debt control but it represents a first step only.  One can control the debt, solve the economic problems statistically, make significant statistical progress and still end up with 270,000 people unemployed and massive emigration. There are real disincentives in this economy which have not been addressed at all by the budget proposals. Indeed, the Government have given no indication that they will address them.</P>
    <P>There is something wrong with this economy which cannot be explained totally in terms of the debt burden.  For example, if we look at growth rates in <Col N="327" /> OECD countries say, from 1980 to 1986 or 1987 and examine the league table, one finds Turkey tops the league with a 30 per cent cumulative growth over those years.  To begin with it had certain advantages in being a very undeveloped economy, which meant that it could grow rapidly.  Coming further down the league table one finds that Japan and Norway had growth rates cumulatively of between 20 per cent and 30 per cent, that the USA, Canada and Finland had growth rates cumulatively of between 15 per cent and 20 per cent.  For example, in the 10 per cent to 15 per cent growth rate band countries such as France and the United Kingdom are represented.  In the 5 per cent to 10 per cent growth rate band, Belgium and Holland are represented, two economies that have experienced serious difficulties in recent years.  There is no OECD country that had a growth rate between zero and 5 per cent and one OECD country only which is not in the table at all, that is Ireland, which had a growth rate of minus two cumulatively.  This miserable performance cannot be explained in terms of the debt burden.  There are serious structural problems in our economy which must be dealt with if we are to make real progress.  It is not possible to stabilise the debt GNP ratio without growth much less to use the growth for the benefit of the unemployed or to raise living standards.</P>
    <P>The ESRI medium term report to which the Minister referred in the course of his remarks says that we require growth rates of between 3 and 4 per cent starting in 1989 and being maintained into the nineties in order merely to stabilise the debt burden at a very high level. Indeed in that report the ESRI envisage that, while the debt would have been stabilised this would have no effect in real terms on unemployment or emigration, that we would still have this massive number of people unemployed and a huge number of young people emigrating. We have now over 19 per cent unemployed and we act as if this were the norm.  I might draw the attention of <Col N="328" /> the House to the fact that, in the worst days of the American depression in the thirties, unemployment there never went beyond 20 per cent.</P>
    <P>We must tackle the debt but unless we attack the other structural problems in our economy we have no chance of growth.  The major problem is that presented by our tax system.  The Minister missed an opportunity today to seriously reform taxation.  He fiddled around with tax allowances.  We have been doing that for the last five or six years, giving relief of, say, £70 million, £90 million, on one occasion £120 million or almost £200 million in a full year.  It did not make a whit of difference.  It did not restore necessary incentives in the workplace.  The marginal rates are much too high and too many people are paying tax at the higher marginal rates.</P>
    <P>It has been the practice on budget day to present tax tables, as the Minister has done on this occasion.  When there were children allowances in the tax code a married couple with two children was a typical example.  I might add that a married couple with two children, where one spouse only is working, represents 9 per cent only of the labour force; it is not typical at all.  A typical member of the labour force now is single, on the average industrial wage, and represents 46 per cent of the labour force.  How does one expect people who represent 46 per cent of the labour force to pay marginal tax rates on slightly above the average industrial wage?  Is it any wonder there is emigration? If there was never any recession the drag of more benign tax climates would pull a significant number of young people out of this country.  It is in the early part of the life of an administration that one can attack tax.  I do not know how long this Government will last but it is still early days in their lifetime.</P>
    <P>A recent article in the <i>Financial Times</i> examined tax reform in a number of countries, carrying a league table of those that had succeeded and those that had failed.  Those that failed were those that had attempted such reform on an incremental basis, doing a little each year <Col N="329" /> over a number of years while the countries that succeeded were the ones that rolled the claim into a package and went with the package and had the political will to sustain the package.  When you think about it the reason is obvious, because no matter what tax reform system is introduced, there will be winners and losers; but the losers catch on to what you are doing quicker than the winners, so the losers put pressure on you and vote against you; the winners do not realise the benefit until the medium term and consequently do not support you either, so you lose both ways.  There is a major argument for significant tax reform, for an extension of the tax code which would bring in £700 or £800 million and redistribute it to the PAYE sector to reduce the very high level of taxation which we have at the moment.  That is the second pre-requisite for growth in this country.  The first is on the table; it is now agreed.  It is to tackle the debt.</P>
    <P>From there we must look at the costs in the economy.  Wage costs are still significantly higher than those of our competitors. Any industrialist who has a plant in this country and a similar plant in the United Kingdom will tell you that every single item of cost is higher here, with the exception of the cost of property &mdash; and the cost of property is a very insignificant input into productivity.  In the final analysis, it is the UK we must watch, because that is still our main market. More important than that, it is UK firms that come in here and sell into our shops and are wiping out our own indigenous industry, and nothing in this budget is doing anything about that.</P>
    <P>For example, electricity costs are still enormously high.  I notice that the Minister for Industry and Commerce introduced an inquiry last night &mdash; and he does not need any inquiry.  The last thing I did before I left the Department of Industry and Commerce was to publish the review of industrial performance which was put together by the research section of the Minister's own Department, and I am sure they are giving him a copy of the book.  The inquiry has been completed by officials in his own Department. <Col N="330" /> Heavy fuel oil, for example, costs on average 19.3 per cent more here than the European average; electricity was 23 per cent more; postal services were 36 per cent more; telecommunications costs were 59 per cent more and, at that time, interest rates were 53 per cent more. The interest rate situation has improved somewhat, but not as dramatically as one might think because this was for the year ended 1985.  Various semi-State organisations, including the ESB, would argue that the situation has improved since then.  Certainly the nominal costs have come down, but the costs everywhere else in Europe have come down as well, and the relative disadvantages remain.</P>
    <P>How can one get growth in an economy if every factor of production costs less in the nearest neighbouring country than it does here?  Yet the Government have taken no steps to reform the income tax system.  They have put VAT on electricity which, because of the rebate of VAT system, will help manufacturing industry slightly.  But of course then the Minister and the Government have got the ESB to agree to transfer £30 million to the Exchequer.  That £30 million and that capital base in the ESB could easily have been used to reduce costs in the company and to provide cheaper electricity, in particular to manufacturing industry.  But that has not been done.</P>
    <P>We have had the additional excise of course, for example in relation to petrol, again moving things in the opposite direction. I do not know why these problems are not being addressed now.  I am sure the Taoiseach is aware that it costs 60 per cent more to shift one metric tonne in this country than it does in the United Kingdom, and our industrial strategy is supposed to be based on the international trading sectors carrying us forward.  If we cannot get it to the port at a competitive price, how can we get it out of the country, and how can we have export-led growth?  It is just not possible.</P>
    <P>So I would criticise this budget not so much on the details &mdash; we can agree with one particular detail and disagree with another &mdash; but I would criticise it very <Col N="331" /> strongly on the general thrust of the economic policy.  I think I understand the Taoiseach's policy, that if he reduces the debt, that will reduce interest rates and then you concentrate on certain sectors and that will give growth.  I do not believe that will happen because the economy is not competitive and you can only get growth when the economy is made competitive and that means tackling wage costs, the tax system, the cost of energy, the cost of transport, the cost of telecommunications, the cost of postal services. If we got those things right we might get the kind of growth levels necessary to stabilise the debt and give us growth in the future.</P>
    <P>This budget has absolutely no hope for unemployed people.  But the pass was sold on the unemployed 20 months ago when the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> was signed.  On that occasion one of the most malicious practices of the trade union movement was enshrined in Government policy, that is, the trading of jobs for higher pay.  Once you introduce a system which brings into the structure of a country the trading of jobs for higher pay you are heading for very high unemployment levels.  It is a sad reflection on the Government that the unemployment situation was scarcely referred to in the budget speech.  The only reference I can find to it was in the very last page when the Minister said that it would take time to reap the benefits in terms of substantial increases in economic activity and new employment.  That is the only reference. It is a pity.  There was a consensus in this House which could have backed a far more radical budget.  The consensus that has emerged in this House has enabled the Government to proceed quite radically in the area of debt control, and we need an equally radical approach now to take the disincentives out of the economy to give us the growth rates which will stabilise the debt, which will reduce it and which will bring real jobs into the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to begin <Col N="332" /> by complimenting the Minister for Finance on a hard year's work in which he has made substantial achievements.  The achievement that merits most praise from everyone in this House is the way in which he controlled public expenditure and kept it within the bounds he set himself last March.  He had a bit of luck on occasions and he did a bit of slightly creative accounting to keep within £20 million of his target.  The Taoiseach should, like Napoleon, treasure his lucky generals, because they are an attribute sometimes hard to come by.  This country is better off for the efforts made by the Minister for Finance to ensure that public expenditure was kept on target last year.</P>
      <P>There are a number of indications that public expenditure was not kept under control by some of the Minister's colleagues in Government.  In particular I have to look to the question of public sector pay.  The figures that emerge from this budget and from last year's budget are frightening in may respects.  Public sector pay amounts now to nearly £3 billion per annum and it is one of the chief areas in which the Government can exercise control on its outgoings.  It is interesting to note that on 31 March last year the Minister told this House that there was then, in that year, a 5.5 per cent increase in public sector pay.  He pointed out then that that was well in excess of the prevailing rate of inflation and said he did not intend at the expiry of the then agreed wage round to increase public sector pay further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unfortunately, in the context of the agreement arrived at with the social partners dressed up as a programme for national recovery, further pay increases were agreed.  So it comes about that in this year, taking into account the carry over of former agreements, the new agreement of 2½ per cent, increments of 1 per cent and special increases of 1.4 per cent, there is to be another 5.6 per cent increase in the public sector wage bill. The source for that is the Economic and Social Research Institute report to which the Minister referred.  In two years we have had public sector pay increases roughly of the order of 10 per cent at a <Col N="333" /> time when inflation was much lower. That does not show control of public expenditure.</P>
    <P>The <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>, which Deputy Noonan rightly characterised as a cruel deceit on those whose jobs were consumed to pay these increases, combined with last year's public sector wage deals, means that in two years the real value of public sector pay has increased rather than decreased. That is very sad because it shows a great opportunity was lost.  We are told £70 million is the cost of the public sector wage deal included in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>, that £28 million or £30 million will be spent on incremental wage increases, and that there will be more money spent on special increases and carry over from previous agreements.</P>
    <P>Leaving aside the question of redundancies and increased superannuation costs which will arise from that, £100 million need not have been spent.  I suggest that the price of that agreement made between the so called social partners was paid with jobs, and that price prevents this country from making a very substantial reduction in the amount of public expenditure which could have been achieved.</P>
    <P>It is naive to think that public sector industrial peace was purchased by that £100 million.  In a year when there is 3 per cent or 2½ per cent inflation, of course we can purchase industrial peace by a 5 per cent increase in public sector pay, but already there are signs that the trade unions who signed their names to that infamous agreement are getting cold feet because the employment targets will not be met and because some of the implications of the redundancy schemes for some of their career structures are unpalatable. It appears that if that agreement had not been struck, if another agreement had been struck, this country would have had £100 million more to devote to the real issue which faces this House today and which, yet again, we have decided to avoid and to leave out of the reckoning &mdash; that is, the burning issue of tax reform.  As I said, there would have <Col N="334" /> been this £100 million to apply to bringing back some incentive to work for a living.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke about £91 million in income tax relief, and that was in the context of a projected increase of £112 million, The yield of income tax this year will be up, not down, and it is important that everybody realises that.  The Exchequer will get more money by way of income tax this year than last year. There is not a reduction in the overall level of income tax.  In addition, the £91 million characterised as income tax cuts reflects £75 million needed to leave the income tax structure neutral in terms of its effect on the economy.  This shows there is a very marginal effect on the overall incidence of income tax and this budget is not the beginning, or even the beginning of the beginning, of a programme of radical tax reform.  It is quite the reverse.  It is tinkering with the tax system.  Our experience over the past 20 years has shown that tinkering with the tax system produced nothing but failure, frustration, disillusionment and emigration.</P>
    <P>In the past 20 years we have conducted a silent revolution in our fiscal affairs. Whether you blame Fianna Fáil or the Coalition for getting rid of rates in 1977 &mdash; Fine Gael and Labour promised to do it over four years but Fianna Fáil did it in one year &mdash; the fact remains that in 1965 16 per cent of the country's tax yield came from property taxes and 23 per cent came from payroll tax, including social insurance contributions and income tax. By 1985, because of that silent revolution, 46 per cent of our tax was based on payroll taxes whereas 4 per cent of the tax yield came from property.  That revolution was accomplished by the people who occupied various benches in this House.  There is no point in fooling ourselves that that remarkable, dramatic and very dangerous and damaging change occurred by accident.  It was deliberate, but it was concealed.</P>
    <P>I remember talking to a senior Member of this House in 1977 about the desirability of indexing income tax and he told me that to index the income tax structure <Col N="335" /> would be to end all social progress in this country.  I believe successive Ministers for Finance, from both sides, and their advisers &mdash; the mandarins of Merrion Street &mdash; must have realised that the complexion of Irish taxation was changing dramatically but they never actually quantified it and, most basic of all, there has never been a clear articulation of any basic strategy in relation to our tax structure.  Nobody has ever said he believes it is wrong to increase the overall burden of taxation on work and to alleviate it on property or that that proposition is right.  The only group ever established to consider the issue &mdash; the Commission on Taxation &mdash; came forward with radical proposals for a transformation of our taxation system and they met with a conspiracy of unmitigated silence.</P>
    <P>I want to ask the two biggest parties in this House a question: when did any of their spokesmen ever address their minds to the questions of fundamental tax philosophy and strategy raised by the Commission on Taxation?  I hear people muttering quietly that there are problems with that commision's report, that it is difficult to achieve, that some of their proposals are undesirable, but no party in this House ever addressed themselves, in public at any rate, to the fundamental issue of where they want the Irish taxation system to go.</P>
    <P>I welcome unreservedly Deputy Noonan's contribution this evening which shows that a huge conversion has taken place in his mind, that marginal tax reform is no longer of interest to Fine Gael, but that they are interested in wholesale radical tax reform.  This is the first time we have heard this but we have not heard the direction he wants us to take.  There is a political price to pay for honesty on this issue, and that price has to be paid by stating what they mean and what kind of tax strategy they advocate.</P>
    <P>I am proud to be a member of a party who, on occasion, have told the people precisely where they want to bring the Irish taxation system, irrespective of the political opprobrium some aspects of <Col N="336" /> what we propose may draw from a particular source.  I note, and I repeat it again in this House, that there has never been a single statement from the Fine Gael benches on the question of a property tax.  Do they believe in a property tax, or do they think that by singing dumb and allowing us and the Minister to talk about it, they can get away without adopting a position on that issue?  That is radicalism indeed.  It is the radicalism of obfuscation.  It is a cowardly approach when you take into account that this country needs a deep rooted and far seeing honesty among its politicians rather than what we are getting at the moment: an effort to suggest that tax reform of a radical kind can come about without spelling out the down side of any particular proposal.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats believe that taxation on work is a major obstacle to people participating in the economic life of the country.  You do not have to take a partisan view to accept that proposition. From the report of the ESRI, recently published, on the effects of our taxation system, it is clear that payroll taxes have got to the stage where they have a grotesque, distorting effect on the labour market.  You do not have to read <i>The Economist</i> or agree with the views of Miss Frances Cairncross to necessarily arrive at the same conclusion.  It is staring us in the face that an employer who employs someone at the average industrial wage has to put in £1.71p in terms of payroll costs to give his employee £1 in take home pay.  That is equivalent to a 71 per cent VAT rate on work as a service.  A person on one and a quarter times the average industrial earnings &mdash; around £12,000 to £14,000 &mdash; costs his employer £2.07p in gross payroll costs to give him £1 in take home pay.  That is equivalent to a VAT rate of 107 per cent on that input, which is work.</P>
    <P>I welcome unreservedly the beginnings of sanity in relation to the taxation breaks which have been given in the past to capital.  We have subsidised capital and penalised work to our cost.  We have subsidised capital to the extent of £900 million per year by tax breaks and grants to <Col N="337" /> industrialists and, at the same time, we have penalised work to an extent that no OECD country has ever attempted to do. We have the highest initial tax rate of any country in the western or the developed world, 35 per cent plus PRSI for the person who initially comes into the tax net.  We also had the most steeply progressive system of taxation among the OECD countries and those things have not come about by accident but by a concealed and deliberate creep in taxation which was, for various reasons, deemed acceptable in the past.</P>
    <P>I agree with the views expressed by Deputy Noonan that we must now have radical tax reform to undo the damage that has been done but I look to this budget in vain to see any evidence of that commitment.  If one looks at the allowances set in place today by the Minister, the immediate and obvious conclusion which one has to draw is that these allowances have been adjusted in a manner to discriminate against the poorest members of society.  The difference for a single person earning £5,500 or thereabouts is minimal but the difference for those on larger incomes is much more substantial.  The poverty trap is cemented even further into position by the niggardly increases in the tax regime for those on lowest incomes.  I welcome the social welfare increases but if you increase social welfare as proposed here, without making any effort to help those who are making some effort to help themselves, the poverty trap is raised even further.  The disincentive to participate in the economic life of the country is made greater and the source of social unjustice is made deeper and wider.</P>
    <P>Recently there has been a chorus which seems to have come from editorial chairs &mdash; and others &mdash; which suggests that this country should seek to attack the issue of poverty as a national priority.  Everyone agrees with that but the problem is that what is proposed by most commentators agitating for this is that there should be a system of palliatives brought in to redress the misery of those who are excluded from the economic life of the country. However, no radicalism is suggested in <Col N="338" /> terms of what is needed to get those people back into the economic life of the country.</P>

      <P>The biggest source of social injustice is the exclusion of people from the economic life of the community and no amount of remedial payments or programmes to combat this or that can ever substitute, in terms of social justice, for the basic dignity and right to participate in the economic life of the country, which we call a job.  This country &mdash; whether we approach it willingly or whether we are dragged screaming to confront the proposition &mdash; must finally acknowledge the fact that we cannot pile our tax burden on to work and ignore the consequences in terms of social justice.</P>
      <P>Deputy Desmond, speaking on television last night, suggested that there was no such thing as a high disincentive to work which is related to high taxation on work.  He said that was a myth.  I admire his honesty because he was reflecting what be believes.  However, I am amazed at the extent of his error in the matter.  If the iron laws of economics mean anything &mdash; and they do in some respects &mdash; they mean that you cannot tax work and at the same time hope to tackle the unemployment issue.</P>

      <P>As I said, it is the kind of economy that exists in South Africa. There are two classes, one participating in the life of the State and enjoying the spoils and the other excluded from it and perhaps providing the most menial services.  That is what this country is rapidly approaching and it is doing so because we have set in place a system of taxation, the thrust of which is to trample on those who make an effort and are willing to work at whatever level but especially at the lowest one.  I say very definitely to any person who thinks there is no such thing as a disincentive to work that they are flying in the face of all international orthodox opinion and of all research available.  They are also flying in the face of common sense.</P>
      <P>The taxation system must be reformed to make work worth while and that will only be done by broadening the tax base.  In relation to broadening the tax base I notice no suggestion whatever in the Minister's speech that he intends to broaden the tax base by including any kind of tax on real property, but there have been leaks from the Cabinet table or at a lower level of the Government hierarchy suggesting that the Government have it in mind to give local authorities the right to raise moneys by taxation on real property.  What we have heard so far does not amount to a radical extension of the tax base.  The suggestion of a domestic dwellings tax based on square footage is inadequate, unjust and reprehensible, and regressive in that it does not differentiate between the value of properties occupied by various people. If that is what the Government have in mind this party will have no hand, act or part in supporting them on that issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The taxation system has to be viewed in terms of equity.  The proposals contained in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> in relation to PRSI for the self-employed deserve close scrutiny.  They are apparently put in place at the instance <Col N="340" /> of some of the social partners, principally the trade unions and their purpose in putting them in place is to achieve a more suitable sharing of the burden of the Irish taxation system between those who are now in the PAYE net and those who are not in it.  In that regard it is about time people on this side of the House came off the fence.  The press today talk about rumblings within the Fine Gael Party on the issue.  It is not good enough just to rumble on the issue, to ask a few hard, searching questions, to seek actuarial reports or to suggest that the figures may not add up.</P>
    <P>There is a genuinely felt emotion to the effect that the self-employed and the farming sector are not sharing the burden of taxation equally, fairly or equitably. That is a well based feeling which requires government action to deal with it.  There is no point in nit-picking with the substance of what the Government produce here unless those who are prepared to enter into the debate with them on the merits of bringing PRSI to the self-employed are willing to accept or reject publicly the proposition that the farming community and some sections of the self-employed are not shouldering the burden of taxation adequately.</P>
    <P>In this country close on £1 billion, £1,000 million, of net income derives from agriculture.  Out of that sum for 1987 it is anticipated that farmers will pay to the Exchequer something in the region of £34 million.  That is 3.4 per cent of that £1 billion which will come back to the Exchequer in terms of direct taxation to help shoulder the burden of public expenditure, much of which is enjoyed partially or wholly by the agricultural community.  That is simply unacceptable. Therefore, when we cross swords &mdash; as we will &mdash; with the Government on the idea of extending PRSI to the farmers we will do so on the express acknowledgment that that sector for one are not carrying their far share of the burden.</P>
    <P>Neither are the self-employed in many respects.  They have a better tax regime than those on PAYE.  They have concessions with those on PAYE, even taking allowances into account, do not <Col N="341" /> enjoy.  They have the benefit of the previous year's taxation to some extent. They have in many cases the benefit of more discretionary tax reliefs such as investment and capital allowances which they can at their option chose to take on, on any individual occasion.  They have a very generous system of allowances in terms of tax relief for moneys put by as savings for their pensions.  Even when the self-employed pay their full share of taxation and are not evading, they have those things which give them a dramatic advantage as against a comparable earner in the PAYE sector.</P>
    <P>It must be stated in this House as a matter of honesty that there is also a very significant degree of outright evasion.  I am not suggesting that a majority do it. I do not believe they do, but a significant number of people are completely outside the whole taxation structure so that even the benefits of the favourable tax regime they enjoy are not necessary to them because they opt not even to participate in the system of taxation to a significant extent.  If the Government bring forward measures calculated to redress that balance in relation to the PAYE sector we will support them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach's courtesy is overweening on this occasion, and I accept that fully.  We are opposed to the principle of separate PRSI because we regard it as a regressive tax on work masquerading as insurance.  We recognise that its present existence is a form of taxation.  I notice the Taoiseach has finally come round to the view that PRSI is a system of taxation and told the nation so recently on a Sunday afternoon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We believe that the farmers and self-employed as a sector are not paying their fair share of taxation.  Pending the introduction of a comprehensive and fair general taxation system which would include a social security tax as suggested by the Commission on Taxation, we are quite prepared to see measures put in place by the Government which would redress the balance between the PAYE sector and the self-employed and farmers.  If that takes the form of a levy, or whatever, so be it.  We maintain that this levy or any equalisation measures between the <Col N="343" /> PAYE sector and the self-employed and farmers should not confer on the PAYE sector or the self-employed a right to a series of benefits in ten years' time.  That is fundamentally what we object to about this proposal.</P>
    <P>It is now proposed by extending the PRSI net to the self-employed to bring them into a system of social insurance which will entitle them in their old age, from 65 onwards, to contributory old age pensions as a matter of right, irrrespective of their means.  That is fundamentally socially unjust.  It means that a system which will be subsidised by the general fund of taxation to the extent of 60 per cent or more will be used to give pensions to those who are not at present in receipt of them.  It will give pensions to those whose incomes are such that they do not need them.  It will give pensions to those who have made no demand on the State for those pensions.  It will give pensions to people who have no discernible social entitlement to any subsidy from the State in view of their other means.  That is a fundamental social injustice.</P>
    <P>Why should a professional man, be he a barrister, solicitor, doctor, or company director, become entitled in his 65th or 66th year to a flow of income from the State which is to be subsidised to the extent of 60, 70 or 80 per cent by the taxpayer when people in the Simon Community are living in boxes 100 yards from this House and get no such elevated level of social assistance?  Why should we put in place a system to give more resources, subsidised more heavily by the taxpayer, to those who are able to look after themselves, as experience has shown in many cases to date, while we are unwilling to divert social resources to those who need them badly?  It is fundamentally unstateable as a proposition that social justice requires that.</P>
    <P>The fundamental cowardice in this measure is that the Government are acceding to a trade union demand, which is legitimately based I have to say, to try to equate the tax status of those who are in the PAYE net with those who are not. <Col N="344" /> But they are doing so by mortgaging the social insurance fund by requiring it to pay out major benefits in future to the self-employed and the farming sectors. There are many people in Dublin who will never participate in the contributory pension scheme when they are 65 but it is proposed to extend the contributory pension scheme to small-holders in the West who are now receiving the dole, small-holders whom we are told are about 15,000 in number.</P>
    <P>Is that fair?  Is it fair that the ordinary poor who have never made provision for their old age &mdash; and have never been in a position to make provision for their old age because they have never had a job &mdash; should get the assistance rate of benefit while people who have a five or ten acre holding somewhere in deepest rural Ireland have been receiving the dole all their lives?  Is it fair that they should be discriminated against?  That is what is implicit in this measure: the ordinary poor are to continue on assistance but the 15,000 small-holders are to be given a contributory pension for the outlay of not one penny.  That is outrageous.  It is unstateable in terms of social justice, whatever concept one has of the issue.  I do not think anyone in this House could put his hand on his heart and say that it is fair.  However, it is going to be done unless somebody stops it.  When the Social Welfare Bill is brought before the House it must be thoroughly and painstakingly debated.  There should be no guillotine on it and there should be no rushing it through because it is mortgaging the future to pay off in a misconceived way a demand for equity.</P>
    <P>Any examination of the National Pensions Boards report, on which all this was based, would indicate that what the Government are now proposing falls entirely between two stools.  The National Pensions Board admitted that the 6.6 per cent rate, if paid, would involve a 60 per cent subsidy from the taxpayer towards the eventual cost of pensions.  I noticed that in the speech by the Minister for Finance today there was a totally unsupported statement that any additional liability on the general <Col N="345" /> Exchequer to fund these pensions cannot be countenanced.  These things do not add up.  If a 6.6 per cent rate is paid, a 60 per cent subsidy will have to come somewhere from Exchequer&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and that is on the basis of a 100 per cent collection but we are now told that there is to be no Exchequer liability.  It is a simple lie which is being forced down the throats of the people and it is not one which is in any way motivated by a clear-headed examination of what social justice requires; it is a short term <i>quid pro quo</i> for agreeing to the infamous social partners deal and, in the last analysis, is going in the wrong direction.</P>
      <P>Have we in this House not understood the one fundamental fact, that this country cannot afford any more unfocused redistribution of resources to the &ldquo;haves&rdquo; in our society?  Have we not understood that that is half of our downfall and that we have high taxation rates precisely because we give benefits to those who do not really need them?  We subsidise this, that and the other to the &ldquo;haves&rdquo; in our society instead of taking the available resources and channelling them to the &ldquo;have nots&rdquo;.  This proposal from the Minister for Finance, when it is introduced in statutory form by the Minister for Social Welfare, will be a step emphatically in the wrong direction and deserves to be opposed on those grounds.  It is nothing but window dressing.  It has nothing to do with social justice and economic sense.  It is the quick fix of a few million pounds here and there without any regard to its long term social consequences. I do not like using clichés too much about it but it is the proverbial pig in the poke because it is coming to us dressed up as a measure of equity when, in fact, it is a measure of social, financial and fiscal irresponsibility.  We will not have anything to do with it in its present shape or form.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would suggest that if you wanted to achieve equity you would first go out to <Col N="346" /> the self-employed and the farmers and get in the tax that they owe at present. All the indications thus far are that we cannot even collect levies of the most simple kind from those areas.  If we want to achieve equity by imposing an additional burden on the self-employed and the farmers, I suggest that we should do so by way of imposing a levy of some kind and giving nothing in return for it. I cannot see any social justice being served by taking a small levy now which bears no relation to the cost later involved.</P>
    <P>A number of the features of the budget have been addressed by Deputy Noonan. I do not propose to repeat some of the comments he made but I do propose to point out that so far as the general bottom line of the budget is concerned there has been a £94 million alleviation in what would have been an increase in direct taxation and this has been funded more or less by an equivalent amount of indirect taxation.  The bottom line of the budget is that there has been a shift from direct to indirect taxation of £90 million, which is 3 per cent of the total income tax yield. Since income tax was due to go up by about 4 per cent in any event by the ordinary processes of inflation, it suggests that there has been no fundamental reform undertaken in the budget by the Government.  What we have had instead is a shift of a marginal 3 per cent kind from the burden of income tax, as it presently exists, to indirect taxation. That is the effect of the budget; it is nothing more or nothing less.</P>
    <P>It is about time that we gave up the pretence in this House of Ministers for Finance standing up budget after budget indicating that they are giving massive amounts of relief to the tax paying public when all the time the sad undercurrent is that personal taxation and all other forms of taxation are increasing inexorably.  We have the same business during every budget when Ministers for Finance stand up and say they are giving relief.  If they are giving relief, why is taxation growing all the time?  I think we have to shear away the rhetoric on this occasion.  There is a lot of hype about a budget.  There is <Col N="347" /> a lot of waving empty brief cases in front of snap hungry photographers; a lot of speculation; a lot of keeping quiet and keeping mum; a lot of trying to look smart by saying nothing coming up to the date of a budget as if the crown jewels were at stake and maintaining secrecy about a fundamental issue of tax strategy, as if these things can be kept secret until one minute and then suddenly announced in a flash of publicity and popular adulation. All this has to stop.</P>
    <P>This House has to have a different attitude to taxation.  We need to have an attitude towards taxation whereby nobody on the Opposition benches can adopt a totally different attitude to that which they adopted when they were in Government.  Sometimes what goes on between the Opposition and the Government, and certainly between the main parties here, is like a budgie in its cage pecking at a mirror.  Which is the reflection and which is the budgie and what does it mean?  Why do we have this sudden call now from Opposition for radical tax reform when four years were spent cementing in place the most dreadful draconian tax system?  Why do we have Ministers saying today that they are relieving the tax burden when they are doing no such thing, when we are having a 3 per cent change, when they are shifting the deck chairs on the decks of the <i>Titanic</i>, when they are moving the burden of taxation in a tiny way from direct to indirect taxation?  Why do we pretend that this is a big event, an event of note which will have dramatic effect when it will have no such effect?</P>
    <P>As far as the excise proposals are concerned, I cannot object to the proposed increased taxation on tobacco but I have to deal with the hydrocarbon increase in excise and ask some questions in relation to it.  It is suggested that 8p per gallon should be put on petrol, that 4p per gallon should be put on diesel and that the sum in relation to diesel oil should not apply to the provision of scheduled bus services. That means that the private bus owners are to pay but CIE are not to pay and that <Col N="348" /> the industrialists with lorries will have to pay.</P>
    <P>What are these two measures trying to achieve?  They are trying to achieve a further increase in the cost of transport in an area of the European Community which is most disadvantaged by high transport costs.  This is what these measures mean.  They are not motivated by a desire to tackle the fundamental infrastructural problems of this country.  They are not aimed at giving the Irish industrialist any help in transporting his goods to European markets, or at reducing the cost of getting to work for many Irish people who depend on a car to get there. These measures are increasing our transport costs which are already one of our weaknesses.  At the very least these measures should be reconsidered because they seem to fly in the face of what successive Ministers said, including the Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy Reynolds, who said on radio today that he was trying to drive down the costs to Irish industry.  Yet, this afternoon we find that the costs to Irish industry are being pushed up.</P>
    <P>The effect on tourism needs hardly to be stated.  This proposal flies in the face of what the Taoiseach said last week on tourism and yet it is put forward as a reasonable measure today.  The £15 million that will come from the imposition of this additional exise duty is only half of what the incremental pay increase, which should not have been paid in the public service this year, will cost, but it will cost much more in jobs foregone in tourism, in higher transport costs resulting in less competitive exports, than any number of other measures that could easily have supplied the same money.</P>
    <P>This is another slap in the face to the motor industry.  I notice that there is now a proposal to increase the capital value of a car in respect of which allowances will be made available for income tax purposes from £4,000 to £6,000.  That is certainly desirable as far as the motor industry is concerned but it is not enough. The damage done by our fiscal policies to employment in the motor industry will not be undone by this measure.  This is <Col N="349" /> the change that will have least effect in undoing the damage already done.</P>
    <P>There is a problem which seems to be in the permanent rather than the transient Government of this country, and that relates to transport.  Why is a motor car called a luxury but white goods such as fridge freezers are treated more beneficially? Which produces more employment? Is it thought that electricity is generated from native sources?  Which is more damaging in the long run, the importation of fridges, televisions and things like that or the importation of cars which could produce more, in terms of organising the economy and getting people to work, even repairing cars? Which is more likely to produce employment, white goods or cars?  Why is it that in Merrion Street we have this manic preoccupation with the car as a luxury which must be stitched into the ground on every occasion?  The car is not a luxury but a necessity for many people in rural Ireland.  It is less of a necessity in the city, but to treat it substantially differently from white goods and other luxury goods, and to treat it in a way which suggests that in some sense it is a necessary evil, is to totally forget the thousands of people who have lost their jobs in the motor industry because of the draconian taxation which this attitude permits and encourages.</P>
    <P>A number of features of the budget deserve praise.  I commend the Government for getting to their 8.2 per cent of Exchequer borrowing requirement as a percentage of GNP.  That is an achievement which this party applauds and which this party applauded when the Estimates were moved in the House.</P>

      <P>It is noteworthy that when the Taoiseach on 20 October 1987 moved a motion to note the Estimates in this House, the Progressive Democrats immediately indicated that they would not nitpick their way through the Estimates and avoid responsibility for backing their fundamental beliefs by their <Col N="350" /> voting pattern in this House.  On that occasion the Progressive Democrats indicated that with the exception of three or four things, such as the imbalances in the educational cutbacks which we thought were unfair in relation to primary education, the Ombudsman's office and the National Social Service Board, and a few other things like that, some of which were big in terms of money and some small, we accepted the overall figures of the Estimates.  Unlike Fine Gael, we decided we so accepted them that we would vote with the Government on that occasion to endorse those figures because we thought they were on the right track.  We voted in accordance with our beliefs and we did not diverge one inch from what was stated in this House.</P>
      <P>We are again endorsing the overall figures in this budget.  We are particularly endorsing the harder decisions implicit in this budget but we want to make it very clear that we reserve the right, especially in relation to social insurance for the self-employed, to vote against that on the grounds already outlined by me.  We will do that on the basis of an honest agreement that it was brought in to tackle an injustice but that it is the wrong solution to a real problem.</P>
      <P>I welcome the section 23 arrangements for the building industry.  They are desirable and well worth implementing.  I also welcome the arrangements in relation to urban renewal and the like.  All these things are matters on which the Minister and the Government deserve some degree of congratulation.</P>
      <P>At the bottom line, however, what this budget has to be judged by is whether it is moving in the right or the wrong direction on the fundamentals in our economy, which is the real economy. Yesterday's <i>The Cork Examiner</i> suggested that the Government had received a shot in the arm on the eve of the budget because it appeared that international trading statistics were going somehow to assist this country and the Government in making their minds up about certain budget options.  Of course, that was wrong; it was somewhat naive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a two-tier economy here. <Col N="351" /> There is the transfer price economy where everything is adjudged in terms of what price tag multinationals put on the produce that they export and what differentials they make between their raw materials imported and their finished product exported.  We have all heard of the Coca Cola factor, the fact that syrup for Coca Cola exported from Dundalk seems to be constituting an ever-increasing share of our national product, while employing a handful of people.  I am not against its being included in our national income statistics, but I am against people drawing false conclusions from it.  The real economy has nothing to do with transfer pricing and its results and repatriation of paper profits manufactured in this country.  The real economy is the one which is reflected in the tax figures which this Government put before the House and circulated to its Members last Friday. It showed a remarkably flat yield from income tax and from value-added taxation. That betokens a collapse in the real economic life of this country, the life that matters, that has something to do with generating resources which are available for redistribution, expenditure and the like.  We should never lose sight of the real economy when we look at all these international trade statistics or balance of payments and the like.  The real economy is suffering, groaning and collapsing under an increasing level of taxation.  No matter how you change the figures or shift taxation from direct to indirect, the level of taxation remains the same and it is crippling the real economy.</P>
    <P>The fundamental issue in the real economy, as I have said, is whether or not we are prepared to build here an economy which is conducive towards participation by the ordinary person, gives a reward for those who make an effort and gives an incentive to those willing to try.  Incentive is not the moral monopoly of the well-off in our society.  I am talking about incentive at the very bottom of society, about incentives among those who are excluded from society, those whose lives have been sold into intervention, or perpetual existence on the dole.  We cannot <Col N="352" /> sell our people's lives into intervention on an ongoing basis.  It is in the light of that that we must judge this budget. There is very little, if anything, here to raise the hopes of those quarter of a million people who are marginalised, let alone those who are now growing up with the certainty of emigration.  There is very little in this budget to stimulate hope among these.  There is nothing there which really shows a radical commitment on the part of the Government to switch, in an irreversible way, the focus of our taxation off work, off economic participation. Those on the left may, if they so feel, draw down on poverty and its consequences and the fact that this budget does little for such people in terms of remedying their situation by giving them resources to exist upon and they would be right in doing that.  However, I would ask them to look to the wider issue, that is, the question of how this problem is to be tackled, how we are to put in place the real engine of social justice, which is economic participation, which is work.  I would ask everybody, newspaper editors in particular, to address that issue, not to talk all the time about an attack on poverty with no resources.  I am not talking about an attack on poverty, a once-off effort to palliate the poor.  I am talking about putting in place a taxation system which is designed to draw into the economic life of the country those who are now excluded from it.  I am talking about an end to the economic apartheid which is growing up now and the figures which accompany this budget speech include one very interesting conclusion, that is, that the number of people unemployed will reduce from 256,000 people next year to 253,000 people.  A change of the estimated number of unemployed has been apparently made in the last few days, but the Minister did not refer to that.  He is hoping to save £8 million in unemployment assistance next year on that account.  What has happened in this budget which brings about that change? Where are the 3,000 extra jobs?  Of course, they are not there at all.  The reality is that for those people it must be the emigrant ship, the rate of departure <Col N="353" /> from this country, which has stimulated the Department to save an extra £8 million in unemployment assistance.</P>
    <P>I give the Taoiseach this guarantee, that if he is interested in achieving equity between the self-employed and the farmers on the one hand and the PAYE sector on the other, he should not make the mistake that he has set his heart upon in extending PRSI to them now.  He should come up with another proposal which is designed to achieve equity, which does not confer benefit on the haves and which does not worsen our situation, which does not mortgage our future.  If he does that, he will get our support but if he does not, if he persists in folly and in tinkering over the next few years in every budget with the system of taxation, we will not support him.  The choice is now with the Government.  The initiative is always theirs and as far as the Progressive Democrats are concerned, the radical tax reforms will be painful.  We shall spell out the painful aspects of them and we will support any Government for any unpopular measure to bring about radical tax reform, but we will not do the wrong thing for short term gain.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;despite the temptations that have been imposed on me over the past half-hour.  I am disappointed, very disappointed, with the budget.  Despite all the assurances that we have been given, particularly in the hype arising from the so-called <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>, the budget has very, very starkly failed to confront the three main problems facing the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We now have a situation where one in every five persons in the labour force is out of work.  We all know the poverty <Col N="354" /> and the degradation that this means for tens of thousands of individuals and families. I welcome in the budget the perhaps singular benefit, the decision to have an increase in payment of 6 per cent for the long-term unemployed; it is one very good feature of this budget, but, nevertheless, one must take into account that there is virtually nothing in the budget which has any thrust towards carrying out the promises of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>.  There is not a single reference in the budget to the various proposals contained in that programme. Therefore there is a major failure in that regard.</P>
    <P>I have been reading through part of the programme document, a very glossy document which cost a great deal and of which thousands were issued with magnificent hype in, I think, the Burlington Hotel in the presence of the Taoiseach and the serried ranks of Irish industry. Many assurances were given in relation to sectoral development strategy, the food industry, the beef industry, the pig processing industry, the tool making industry, mechanical engineering and right down the line.  Electronics were also mentioned as was horticulture where there was to be an increase of 2,000 jobs, forestry, the marine and tourism.  It was stated that there would be 25,000 extra jobs in the tourist industry and that an additional £500 million of foreign tourist revenue would be brought in over five years.</P>

      <P>It is none other than my own trade union <i>Liberty News</i>, in case there are any sullied origins in terms of my quotations.  In the budget today the Minister announced that there would be a reduction of £956,000 in the Vote for Tourism and Transport &mdash; that has not been published in the abbreviated Book of Estimates &mdash; which includes salaries, wages and allowances.  It is a drop of £1 <Col N="355" /> million.  That is some inducement for the development of tourism.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister of State will appreciate the point I am making.  A figure of £3 million is mentioned for tourism in appropriations-in-aid. We are to charge the tourists £3 million for the privilege of seeing our beautiful land.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>There is also a tourism package, a new subhead, of £4 million. Four million pounds has been taken from Bord Fáilte's budget and is being spent in other areas.  That is total cosmetic nonsense in terms of Government promotion of tourism.  I could go through the rest of the budget document.  I strongly urge the media to forget about the Financial Statement of the Minister for Finance and to concentrate on the principal features. The <i>Principal Features of 1988 Budget</i> are about the only true parts of any budget.  From long experience I know this is the document the Department of Finance write.  You tend to get the truth in the principal features and the political blurb is written on Sunday afternoon by the Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>In regard to post-primary education adjustments included in the White Paper on Receipts and Expenditure meant a reduction of £9 million.  In the budget a further reduction of £6.7 million was made.  That requires some teasing out and some substantial discussion in this House in the weeks ahead.  Deputy O'Rourke, Minister for Education, is not known for her elaboration of the problems which face her.  The dear Minister has been got at again in this budget and there has not been a word, even tonight, about what has happened in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Finance came in here and said he was going to spend an extra £44 million on social welfare and another £20 million on equal treatment.  In the <Col N="356" /><i>Principal Features of 1988 Budget</i> we find that the Minister is going to get £16 million more in PRSI from the self-employed under the social insurance fund.  It is a very open question as to whether he will ever see that £16 million but the Department of Finance have included it anyway. The live register has been adjusted downwards by £8 million.  The Government have now decided, in the light of current average underlying trends in unemployment, that there will be a drop of 3,000 on the live register, from 256,000 to 253,000.  I wonder how that figure was contrived.  Is there anything in this budget which seriously suggests to anybody that there will be a drop of 3,000 on the live register?</P>
    <P>We should look at the latest quarterly bulletin from the Central Bank.  I appreciate that the governor of the Central Bank has a rather black vein of humour now and again but I do not think it is as dark in terms of his projections for 1988 which indicate quite clearly that the decline in domestic demand is now forecast at 1.5 per cent.  There is a decline in real GNP of one half of 1 per cent. There is a further decline of 10 per cent forecast for the construction industry for 1988 and new residential construction is likely to fall by 5 per cent.  We could adjust that to 3 per cent as a result of the minor measure in the budget.  That does not give me any confidence for suggesting that the live register should be adjusted downwards in the budget today.  The Government said they will save £16 million on PRSI and £8 million on the live register.  The voluntary bodies are to be paid out of the national lottery this year, a real sleight of hand.  That is going to pay for everything.  There will be a saving of £750,000 there.  There will be a further saving of £15.4 million on social welfare. Where did that come from?  Is it the rationalisation of child dependency?  I take the Taoiseach's assurance that it is not.  The Department of Social Welfare, as the Taoiseach well knows, are very careful in their calculations.  The Department of Finance invariably want to cut the social welfare allocation even further. The net effect is that the Social Welfare <Col N="357" /> Vote is increased by only £18 million as against £64 million of gross expenditure taking into account the £20 million for equal treatment, the exceptional provision.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>There is an actual decrease.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>There is an increase of £18.6 million but the Government in total propose to expend no less than £64 million on social welfare and frankly I am very dubious about the budget arithmetic.</P>
      <P>I will refer to another aspect in relation to the <i>Principal Features of 1988 Budget.</i> I particularly ask the media to take note of this because this budget, like many others, has to be shredded before you find out the real meat enshrined in it. The National Museum and the National Library are to be funded in future by the national lottery.  That is a major policy change.  There has been a reclassification of national lottery expenditure, from current to capital, in the Department of Finance of no less than £21 million in the published Estimates.  An increase of £4.6 million is proposed.  Certain cultural and Irish language activities will now be funded through the national lottery as will certain youth and sport activities.  I have already referred to the voluntary bodies and in that regard there has been a further revision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me give another example.  Restoration work on historical buildings will now be funded through the national lottery. I have already referred to the public library service.  An outstanding feature of this budget is that £60 million of national lottery money which is very much under the control of the Minister for Finance is being dispersed among a number of projects.  Last year the national lottery was a substantial moneyspinner and this year it is estimated that gross takings will be about £138 million with a net benefit for the Exchequer of about £60 million. To fund major areas of public expenditure through the national lottery is, to say the least of it, open to considerable question.  Let me say to the Taoiseach <Col N="358" /> that to propose that the National Gallery, the National Museum and the National Library should be funded out of the national lottery was a fair old stroke but we should think about this again because the country deserves somewhat better in terms of the allocation of the moneys available through the national lottery.</P>
    <P>Let me deal with some other aspects of the principal features of the budget.  It is always interesting to note the comments of the Department of Finance contained in the document but there is one huge blank.  Page 18 does not contain one shred of comment in relation to capital allowances.  What has happened to the Department of Finance?  There is no comment either on group reliefs, Shannon companies and special reliefs on foreign dividends received by Irish companies.  As the Taoiseach well knows, the reality in relation to the question of capital allowances and in particular in relation to the Custom House Dock site is that all hell has been breaking loose over the past week between the Department of Finance and the Authority.  Finally, the contract was signed.  I challenge the Taoiseach to disclose to the House the inter-bank skulduggery which has gone on over the past week in relation to this matter.  I challenge the Department of Finance to state the extent to which they were totally opposed to what happened in regard to the signing of that contract.  It did not require the Property Editor of the <i>Irish Independent</i> to disclose the details.</P>
    <P>The area in and around Tallaght town centre is going to be designated for urban renewal incentives.  We all know that the developer in question put a gun to the heads of the Government over the past fortnight and said he would not&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>We know exactly what happened.  We have now reached the stage in the urban renewal scheme which we reached in the home improvement grant scheme where if the scheme had not been stopped the whole country would have ended up being double glazed.  The urban renewal schemes have been extended to include Dublin, Limerick and the five county boroughs and now, uniquely, Tallaght town centre because one individual said he would not go ahead unless he got a concession and he got it.  The Taoiseach knows who he is and who was involved.  He is now going to develop.  Let me throw a question at the Taoiseach.  What about Blanchardstown? A town centre is going to be built in Blanchardstown.  Are they going to get a concession?  I could name a half a dozen more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>We might as well declare the whole country an urban renewal incentive area at the rate we are going.  The Custom House Dock site has now been extended and the commercial banks told the Taoiseach that they would not approve the signing of that contract unless they were given favourable treatment under the 1987 Finance Act.  The Minister could take his JCB and Mr. McInerney's lorrys and drive them into the River Liffey.  They were not going to approve the signing of the contract unless they were given a concession to write off capital expenditure on a capital allowance basis against corporation profit tax. The Taoiseach then decided that we had better get something off them in return and increased the bank levy from £25 million to £30 million.  That is the reason for that increase, there is no other reason.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This budget has to be translated.  You <Col N="360" /> always have to relate a Fianna Fáil budget to what is happening in the background.  It is like appointing a hospital board; it is a matter of who sells their fruit and vegetables to the hospital and who gets the hairdressing contract.  Therefore, I am to say the least of it concerned about certain aspects of this budget.  I am equally concerned that a number of major provisions in the budget do not stand up or hold water.  I regard the decision to bring in farmers and the self-employed into the PRSI net as nothing more than a straightforward, abject capitulation to the interests concerned.</P>

Item No. 4 of the board's terms of reference was to advise the Minister for Social Welfare on the question of providing pensions for all employees related to their earnings and in particular to assess the potential <Col N="361" /> of the occupational pensions schemes in that regard.  It took me two years to get that through the Government but I got it through, against the Department of Finance and against at least one Minister for Finance.</P>

      <P>We set up the National Pensions Board and asked them to bring in a report on taxation for the self-employed. In fairness, Deputy Woods has proved to be a very good Minister for Social Welfare.  The Minister for Social Welfare presented this report to the Cabinet and recommended a rate of 6.6 per cent.  I think he would have settled for 5.5 per cent but he certainly would never have settled for less than 5 per cent. It now transpires that a miserable £12 million, will be collected on a proposal which is in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> to bring the self-employed into a social insurance scheme but what will those people get in return?  We are paying out to the farming community alone £172 million in widows' and orphans' benefits and so on &mdash; £300 million for all the self-employed &mdash; according to an estimate of the Department of Finance in 1986.</P>

The Taoiseach, because he had given certain commitments to the IFA in order to obtain their signature to the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>, capitulated and reduced the rate to 3 per cent.  That 3 per cent will not cover the annual inflation increase in contributory pensions.</P>

He revised that figure subsequently to £85 million and I revised it further for him to £77 million from 5 April but what have we got?  The figure now is £12 million.  The officials of the Department of Finance are aghast at this nonsense and have told the Taoiseach so.</P>

As a result of this move by the Government we are going to face a problem in the House.  I want to see a responsible system introduced in accordance with the recommendations of the National Pensions Board.  I do not want a general election on the insurance of the self-employed.  The Fine Gael Party, who have not made up their minds on this issue, will probably oppose it.  Deputy Jim Mitchell, when interviewed by John Bowman on &ldquo;Day by Day&rdquo; was very emphatic in stating that the matter would be discussed at a meeting of the Front Bench.

      <P>We do not have any apology to offer because social insurance would not have come in if it were not for the late William Norton of the Labour Party in 1952.  This should have been a final effort to bring the entire population into social insurance.  I do not want this to become a political football and I urge the Taoiseach to consider the rate of social insurance.  If he changes it he can be assured of our support.  It is a major issue in the budget.  I do not want to see the Social Welfare Bill which will be introduced before the Easter recess being defeated and precipitating a general election. I would prefer to see PRSI for the self-employed and farmers enshrined in our social legislation and in operation. The chief economist of the IFA said on radio the rate was frozen at 3 per cent. Deputy MacSharry will probably be in Europe this time next year and the Taoiseach will be preparing his party for a European election and, and in my view, he will run like a scalded cat from adding on any more to bring that figure to 5 <Col N="364" /> per cent.  The Taoiseach should take his courage in his hands and make the rate 5 per cent.  He will get our support for that move.  That rate would raise £30 million or £40 million annually but there would continue to be a 70 per cent Exchequer support for such pensions.</P>

      <P>I should like to deal briefly with some other aspects of the budget.  The Labour Party are anxious to make one point about the overall position in regard to taxation.  I am glad the Government have not put any further excise duty on beer or spirits because there is a black economy in operation in regard to such products.  I understand that in the region of 6,000 kegs of beer are sent across the Border weekly. Officials of Customs and Excise and the brewers are aware of that.  In some cases beer is being transferred from one keg to another before it is sent across the Border.  Representatives of the brewers are giving credit to pubs for beer that has been smuggled over the Border.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned about this aspect of the budget because there was a substantial fall in Excise returns in the past 12 months.  There is a great need to eliminate that black market.  There is no doubt that we have a very substantial <Col N="365" /> cash only economy flourishing throughout the country.  Built into that cash only economy there is the exploitation of young people in casual employment in the personal services sector, in the licensed drink trade, in the motor trade, in fast food outlets, in casual construction jobs.  As we all know the rates of payment there can vary anything from £1.50 to £4 an hour with no questions asked.  That economy is flourishing.  There was a tax amnesty under the last Government. There is a tax amnesty under the provisions of this budget.  It is remarkable how little the Department of Finance anticipate getting from an amnesty of that nature.  I make the point strongly to the Taoiseach and Minister for Finance that the public service staff embargo should be suspended to ensure rigorous surveillance and inspection by Revenue and Social Welfare staffs in those areas of employment.</P>
      <P>I want to refer briefly to the taxation provisions of this budget.  The amount of basic tax relief provided is exceptionally low.  While appreciating that there are extreme limits obtaining in regard to any tax relief at present &mdash; bearing in mind that I have always advocated a responsible degree of public taxation for the provision of essential public services &mdash; nevertheless the £91 million provided in this budget is, to say the least, sparse and, on close examination, derisory enough.</P>
      <P>I might remind the present Taoiseach that in 1986 he assailed the then Government, attacking the then Taoiseach, Dr. FitzGerald, whom I am delighted to see present in the House, when Deputy FitzGerald sat on those benches, and defended tax relief in the 1986 budget of £121 million which, in a full year, amounted to £205 million.  Deputy Haughey spent a long evening denouncing the Taoiseach of the day for bringing in, as he called it, such a derisory amount of tax relief at the time.  In fact Deputy FitzGerald and I were described by him &mdash; I well remember the words &mdash; as a cabal of right wing monetarists.  It is strange to note how things have turned today in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My preoccupation with the decision of <Col N="366" /> the Government today is that if I were effecting a redistribution of £91 million, most certainly I would not do so in the way it is being done here.  Take the example of a Deputy of this House with a salary of £20,000.  Approximately £7,000 of it is tax-free.  That is another issue I will not dwell on now.  If we take the example of table 5 of a married couple, one spouse earning £20,000 per annum, the tax relief amounts to £408 &mdash; that is the tax relief to a Deputy of this House.  One might well ask what do we give an equivalent couple earning £9,000 a year by way of tax relief &mdash; a miserable, awful pittance of £35.  Where in God's name is the equity there?</P>
    <P>We all want to reduce the 58 per cent rate of taxation.  We all want to get as many people as possible onto the standard rate of tax.  But had I £91 million to distribute by way of tax relief &mdash; even if I had only £75 million &mdash; there is no way I would apply that relief to people earning upwards of £14,000 per annum.  We spent many a weary hour in the previous Government examining taxation.  For example, we abolished the 1 per cent income levy.  We used to knock off the odd £6 million or £7 million, bringing down the 65 per cent or the 59 per cent rates of tax.  But never once, in terms of social equity, did we say to ourselves: let us spend £40 million on those earning more than £13,000 or £14,000 a year. That is not equity.  I will get into terrible trouble for reminding my trade union colleagues but they said, in this document, in terms of tax reform the <i>National Plan for Economic Recovery</i> includes a programme of changes to reform the tax system, increasing tax equity, improving tax collection and encouraging economic development.  There is not very much by way of encouragement of economic development in this budget.  At least I would have expected some improvement by way of tax equity.  There is none, not a shred.  I agree with one thing only Deputy McDowell said.  He does not understand the poverty trap although he talks a lot about it.  But he is right in saying &mdash; and here he used a word I gave him before <Col N="367" /> standing up &mdash; it is cementing the poverty trap.</P>
    <P>In the example I gave of a Dáil Deputy I note I used the Schedule D table whereas I should have used the PAYE one, which shows that a Deputy earning £20,000 per annum would receive tax relief of £357 whereas a corresponding married couple, one spouse earning £9,000 per annum, would receive tax relief of £70.  There is a hell of a difference between £357 and £70.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>It is on that that the Taoiseach and the Cabinet wrestled with their consciences, hour after hour before coming here with the <i>Principal Features of the Budget</i>.  The allocaton of £75 million, as it was to have been now £91 million &mdash; of course that is the insurance policy in case there is to be a general election &mdash; constitutes a budget a bit too clever by half.  The allocation of £91 million across the board is to say the least, inequitable, non-distributive and regressive. As such I do not know what in God's name, the Taoiseach and Minister for Finance were thinking about when they dragged this up from the tax models of the Department of Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's decision in relation to the Voluntary Health Insurance Board.  I have welcomed two budgetary proposals so far &mdash; the provision for the long-term unemployed; I am delighted that 6 per cent increase is being given to those 30,000 or 40,000 individuals.  I am very upset that there has been no increase whatsoever in child benefit.  I am all in favour of taxing child benefit and certain types of social welfare benefits.  I am all in favour of taxing other forms of income.  There is no proposal whatever in relation to capital or property <Col N="368" /> tax in this budget.  I am very concerned that, for the second consecutive year, there has been no increase in child benefit. I put this down to the structure of Government itself.</P>
    <P>Since 1981 I have been involved in five or six budgets.  I have come to the conclusion that it is quite impossible for a Minister for Finance to carry the burden he is required to carry, as a member of the Government, no matter how supportive the Taoiseach of the day may be.  It is fair to say that the present Taoiseach, to his credit, is very supportive of the Minister for Finance, as was his predecessor &mdash; and I only had the privilege of working with one in Government. We have reached a stage where it is no longer possible for the Minister for Finance to discharge his multiple responsibilities within the framework of a Department which has not been subject to fundamental governmental reform. There is a need for the Minister for Finance to become more directly responsible for revenue collection, including controlling what the Revenue Commissioners are up to.  We all know, with great respect to the Revenue Commissioners, that they are a law unto themselves.</P>
    <P>There is a great need for the Minister for Finance to be able to sit back and reflect on issues of tax reform.  Here today the Minister said that a statutory sick pay scheme has gone wriggling into an inter-departmental committee.  Where is this great statutory sick pay scheme of which employers were to take over the first 13 weeks?  It was not worked out properly.  The FUE objected.  Congress objected.  The inter-departmental committee got into a tizzy over it and the Department of Finance went berserk at the prospect of further Exchequer liability. The Department of Finance were unable to handle the taxation of child benefit or the interlocking of revenue and RSI social welfare numbers.  There is nothing in this budget either in that regard.  Really when one looks through this budget it is very catchy and a bit of a sellotape job as each decision was taken.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="369" /> There is great hostility in many areas to this but I think the Minister for Finance should consider having what is already in many countries, a Minister for Public Expenditure responsible for the public expenditure division of the Department of Finance, a full blown member of the Government &mdash; not with full blown AIDS since the abolition of the HEB has doubled the number of AIDS victims in the country so that the Government are regretting the abolition of the HEB.  We need in this country a Minister for Finance who can deal with the broad macroeconomic policy issues and sit back and reflect, a Minister who can deal with medium and long term economic and social planning, a Minister for Finance who can relate to the social partners and, quite frankly, deal with the enormous complexities of monetary policy on a day to day basis and bring in a budget.</P>
    <P>Separate from him there should be a Minister for the public expenditure side. I am sick and tired of seeing successive Ministers for Finance tearing the hair off their colleagues &mdash; they had little to tear off me but they did it &mdash; over perhaps £25,000 worth of postage expenditure inside the department when far bigger issues were of critical importance.  That is why we get here, in relation to the principal features, this mishmash of adjustments which have embroiled the Minister for Finance so much over recent months.  They are important but in terms of the overall management of the economy, they pale into relative insignificance.</P>
    <P>As a consequence we have all become obsessed with public expenditure questions to the exclusion of the relatively equal importance of taxation measures. That is why we have failed to bring a balance to organising a budget and implementing it in an effective way.  I strongly urge that that should be done whether it is done by way of reforms or property tax.  I assure the Taoiseach and the Minister that the Labour Party are in favour of a comprehensive property tax, but again no real work has been done on it apart from the Minister of State going off <Col N="370" /> half cocked down in the Custom House with a particular proposal.</P>

He should have done it in 1981 and finally he has done it and he will yet hear the laudatory observations of my namesake, Mr. Desmond, and his colleagues in the financial circles.  But the Taoiseach is not likely to get the support of the Labour Party for one reason.  I think it was possible to bring down the current budget deficit without mutilating public services and social services.  It was possible to bring it down in a more balanced way, and that is not the soft option.</P>

      <P>We know what they stand for.  It is possible to bring it in without &ldquo;getting rid of&rdquo; 10,000 public service workers, to use Mr. Noel Carroll's phrase.  That particular nonsense of going to the Governor of the Central Bank, asking him for £80 million, saying we will pay it back in 1990, 1991, 1992 or 1993 when the Taoiseach will not be there and we will not be there.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>As a consequence of that kind of policy being implemented, of flash policies with no great thought behind them, the only reason the Minister for Finance thought about applying this public service redundancy and retirement scheme to the whole of the public service was that he got a memorandum from the Department of Health.  He thought it was great.  They were looking for statutory mandatory payments so he said: &ldquo;Let us apply it to the whole lot of them.&rdquo;  That is how it happened.  Then he was asked how much it was to cost and it was to cost about £100 million.  It <Col N="371" /> is now £80 million.  Now £10 million has been spent, and what has happened?  We need our nurses; we need our student nurses.</P>
      <P>We do not need all of our public voluntary hospitals &mdash; I tried to rationalise these, as the Taoiseach knows &mdash; but we need the bulk of our hospital services and we need our public servants who, in many respects, have been demoralised by this proposition.  It is great gas to see the Minister for Finance saying to principal officers in the Revenue Commission that he will not give them permission to retire while simultaneously another Minister is saying to the Dublin Fire Brigade: &ldquo;Get rid of nine station officers.&rdquo;  There is now a strike involving 780 people and one of the prime reasons they went on strike was the abuse they suffered from intimidatory statements made by a spokesperson for Dublin Corporation.</P>

      <P>I did not stir it up.  I urge the Taoiseach, therefore, in a situation where public services have been decimated and where our social services are also under grave threat, to review the content of this budget.  For a variety of reasons &mdash; and they are entirely authentic &mdash; we will have to oppose some of the principal features of this budget, notably that relating to PRSI, and we will be voting against those features of the budget.  There is still time for the Taoiseach to revise the budget.  He has done it before.  I congratulate him on his decision in relation to the drugs refund scheme.  We are delighted.  I congratulate my colleague Deputy Brendan Howlin who highlighted it.  We got £11 million reinstated into the health vote.  This was done largely by the Labour Party.  The <Col N="372" /> Government caved in and we are pleased that they did so and thank them for it. We know the problems there are in Cabinet in doing a U-turn.  The Government have to do one in relation to Circular 80/27 because they still have not given the Minister for Education the £12 million. The Minister for Education, Deputy O'Rourke, still has not got that £12 million, but I have no doubt that money will be given throughout the year.</P>
      <P>We are extremely critical of many aspects of the budget and we will be opposing it.  We will vote against the increase in the price of petrol but we will not oppose the increase in the price of cigarettes because that is a health measure. We support the Minister in imposing that increase, although I would have increased the price of cigarettes by about 8p and the Exchequer could have got another £6 million or £7 million, but that is another day's work.</P>
      <P>When the Social Welfare Bill is introduced, we will put down many amendments and we will watch the Finance Bill with great care particularly as it relates to that hyped-up nonsense known as the Custom House Dock site, giving away £15 million by way of corporation profits tax to the banks.</P>

      <P>I hope to stay within the parameters of the budget.  At this stage I do not imagine there will be many people listening to the radio after four and a half hours of debate in this Chamber.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For a number of years the significance of budgets has gone.  There was a time when budget day was a big day and all the bad news was given.  We knew what our taxes were and what services would be provided for the year.  Nothing changed.  We knew exactly where we stood.  But that changed and we had minibudgets, often in the autumn.  Even that <Col N="373" /> has gone now and we have weekly budgets. Every week we hear of cutbacks, restrictions on services, new charges, new social welfare codes, new health or education charges and so on.</P>
    <P>Since this Government came into office we have had bad news every week.  The public already knew the bad news but they were hoping the budget might change something.  Apart from a few pounds here and a few pounds there, there have been no changes in the decisions already made when the Estimates were passed on 24 October 1986, cutting back expenditure on services and so on.  The Estimates were passed with the full support of the Fianna Fáil Party, the Fine Gael Party and the Progressive Democrats.  That set the parameters for the Minister's budget today.</P>
    <P>Praise has been lavished on the Government by commentators and representatives of big business for being the first Government in recent times to have met their targets.  There is nothing particularly praiseworthy or commendable about meeting fiscal or budgetary targets at the expense of education, health, social welfare services, local government services, all the services on which many sections of our society depend.  It is very easy for those commentators and representatives of big business to say this when some of them would spend as much on a business lunch as many people on social welfare would spend on themselves in a week.  It is all right for these commentators to praise the Taoiseach's Thatcherism because they do not have to live with the consequences of the Fianna Fáil budget or Fianna Fáil policies and decisions.</P>
    <P>By the absence of any change in education and health, the budget confirms the cuts in these areas.  Parents are having meetings all over the country to discuss the cuts in primary and post-primary education, particularly vocational, comprehensive and community schools. Parents are having a meeting next Saturday in Athlone.  These people were probably listening to the Minister hoping he would put a few extra pounds into primary and second level education.  If that <Col N="374" /> is what they were hoping for from this budget, then the Minister has given them nothing.  The only reference to education in the budget is that £6 million is being provided for refurbishing or rebuilding some rural schools which are in very bad condition.  No money is being put back into education.</P>
    <P>In recent months many people learned a lot about the Government, the thinking of Government, who runs the Government, why decisions are made and so on. There was a very interesting poster used by the TUI over the last six months or so &mdash;&ldquo;The politics of ignorance&rdquo;.  That is a very interesting poster because there is a political significance in ignorance. Thomas Davis said, &ldquo;Educate that you may be free&rdquo;.  If you examine that you will realise that if you are not educated you cannot be free because you do not have the freedom of expression.  If people are kept in ignorance they are kept in slavery and oppression, and they will not protest very much.  We have all heard that it was the education system in Northern Ireland which brought the young people to the stage where they were able to express themselves in a civil rights campaign. If they had been kept in ignorance that would not have happened.  The politics of ignorance means that if the people are not educated they will accept these cuts lying down and they will accept poverty, hunger, unemployment and so on.</P>
    <P>We have seen huge cuts in the primary and second level education, particularly in the VECs.  There is only one small section on education in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> of which this Government speak so much.  The Minister referred in his Statement to this programme which was signed by the social partners &mdash; the employers, the trade unions, the farmers and the Government. That programme states that cuts in education will not affect the disadvantaged, and that the disadvantaged will have the opportunity of going through second level education.  The document actually says that more working class children will go on to third level education.  This Government have destroyed that possibility.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="375" /> This budget also confirms that the health cuts which the Minister operated last summer will continue.  These health cuts are being imposed at a time when this country is experiencing the greatest level of poverty in 40 years.  The report of the South Inner City Community Association confirms what many teachers and a number of school principals in Dublin have said, that is, that children are hungry in school and that children's health is suffering because of lack of food. One principal told me that tuberculosis is on the way back.  There are no medical examinations in schools now although there was before free education came in. Up to the age of 14, as long as pupils were in primary school, a medical examination was carried out on pupils in these schools at least once a year, and school meals were provided.  Cutting back at this time of poverty is highly dangerous.</P>
    <P>The budget confirms that hospital and ward closures, hospital charges and long queues for vitally important life saving operations will continue because the Government have decided that it is more important to ensure that the banks are paid and our debt reduced then to keep people in good health, working or on decent welfare payments.  Their priority seems to be to keep the banks happy.  Tax reliefs can be given on VHI contributions for people to be treated in the Blackrock Clinic or the Mater Private Hospital but there is no money for public hospitals and people have to pay a £10 charge to get the service to which they are entitled. The debt was not created by the people who have to pay for it but by a previous Fianna Fáil Government who did what no government in any country in the world ever did before &mdash; until President Reagan as Governor of California abolished taxes at a great rate &mdash; they abolished rates, car tax, wealth tax and resource tax for farmers.  Indeed, they even refunded that tax to farmers who had already paid it.  Last year, when that Government were returned to office, they abolished the land tax.  Obviously, when a Government abolish taxes they must borrow money to make up for the <Col N="376" /> lack of revenue and that is what began the process of the huge national debt.</P>
    <P>The full deflationary impact of last year's budget on the unemployment figure was disguised by emigration and the infamous Jobsearch scheme.  The figures on the live register are now higher than they were this time last year, despite emigration and the Jobsearch scheme. On the basis of figures given by the Minister for Social Welfare earlier this month regarding Jobsearch, it is clear that if the live register figures were being compiled on the same basis as this time last year, the official figure for unemployment would now be approximately 265,000, not counting the 30,000 or so who have emigrated.  Indeed, but for emigration the figure would be over 300,000.  There is no doubt of the deflationary impact of this year's budget and, therefore, the estimates of unemployment will be even greater.  Those who vote for the budget will be voting for even longer dole queues.  The only specific mention of jobs in the budget is the fact that the Minister said there will be 9,000 fewer jobs in the Civil Service.</P>
    <P>The Jobsearch scheme was simply a method of harassing the unemployed.  If people on starvation allowances &mdash; either single people or families &mdash; tried to earn some money to put food in their stomachs they were harassed and taken off the dole.  The Minister, Deputy Woods said that 12,000 people voluntarily came off the dole.  The implication is that they were fiddling and that when they were asked to go on the Jobsearch scheme they did not claim any more.  The reason they did not claim is that they emigrated to London or other cities; it had nothing to do with the Jobsearch scheme.  The Minister is trying to indicate progress in relation to unemployment but the only purpose of the Jobsearch scheme was to take 20,000 people off the live register and put them on various training schemes.</P>
    <P>There has been a lot of talk about workers double jobbing.  One of the biggest double jobbers would be someone like Mr. Tony O'Reilly who has about 40 different companies, who is chairman of <Col N="377" /> them all and a director of many others which he does not own.  One could say that he had 20 or 30 jobs.  There are also double jobbers in the House.  Before Christmas there was a very tight vote here and somebody noticed that Deputy McDowell was absent.  Where was he? He was down in the Four Courts retained by the State on a case and also employed by the State to be in the House.  Of course, he could not be in two places at once.  I do not want to hear any of these people talking about double jobbing, especially in relation to firemen and people on low wages.  I do not even want to hear them talking about people on the dole double jobbing, trying to make £10 or £15 painting somebody's door to put food in their stomachs.  They are double jobbing here and it makes me sick to listen to that sort of hypocrisy.</P>

      <P>Tá tagairt don Jobsearch scheme san óráid a thug an tAire. I was referring to the Jobsearch scheme which has been dealt with in the budget by the Minister.  In any case, I do not think in the history of the State there was ever a Government which in such a relatively short time broke so many promises and so cruelly betrayed those who voted for them.  Never before have a Government engaged in such a series of U turns on almost every position which they took in opposition.  There has never been a Government which contributed so much to the sense of cynicism and disillusionment that so many people feel about the whole political system here. The longer this administration remains in office the clearer it becomes that it is doing enormous damage to all our people.  It has been said that this Government is a minority Government with the largest majority in the history of the State.  That is so because they have the enthusiastic support of Fine Gael and the Progressive Democrats and the endorsement of big business, finance houses, the O'Reillys and the Smurfits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="378" /> The Taoiseach and his Government have already done enormous damage to our health services and to the concept of free education and local government services.  If they are allowed to continue unchecked, unprecedented damage will be done to the whole fabric of society and we will rapidly revert to the economic and social standards of the thirties.  For many people that is the case already. Class lines have been drawn more clearly than ever before and people are seeing it more clearly than ever with big business, Fine Gael and the PDs standing together with their natural allies in Fianna Fáil. The trade unions, political parties on the left and, most important of all, those suffering from the policies of this Government, must similarly stand together and work to halt this carnival of reaction by Deputy Haughey and his Government.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach, Deputy Haughey, and his Government, or Taoiseach Haughey and his Government, if that is the correct phrase.  This budget will be a very bitter blow to the unemployed, the 255,000, or whatever the figure is.  The deflationary impact of the Estimates and the budget will not just condemn these 255,000 people to another year without jobs; it will almost certainly mean that tens of thousands more will join them or face the prospect of emigrating. Given the level of poverty facing those on social welfare, the levels of increases in this budget are totally inadequate. The policy of increasing social welfare simply in line with inflation would be acceptable only if the existing basic levels were adequate.  This is clearly not so and was recognised by the Commission on Social Welfare as not so.  In 1985, three years ago, the Commission on Social Welfare recommended that the basic income for an adult on social welfare should be between £50 and £60 per week.  In today's figures that would be between £55 and £65 per week so that, even with the increase announced in the <Col N="379" /> budget, the extra few shillings for the long term unemployed, most people will still get less than two-thirds of the figure recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare.</P>
      <P>There is a total absence of the kind of fundamental tax reform needed.  Juggling around with the tax bands is not tax reform.  Despite the changes announced, which will be of little assistance to some people on PAYE, the total income tax take, 90 per cent of which is paid by the PAYE sector, will be almost exactly the same as last year.  No effort has been made to broaden the tax base.  Capital taxes remain at their extraordinarily low level and are exactly the same as the outturn last year.  Capital taxes outturn for 1987 was £40 million; the post budget estimate was £40 million, exactly the same.  There is no change in capital taxes which are the lowest in Western Europe.</P>
      <P>We were told that the income tax take was supposed to be in the region of a £70 million reduction, but the income tax take will be only £7 million less in 1988 than it was in 1987.  There is a minimal increase in corporation tax of about 9 per cent only.  There is still no wealth tax or property tax.  There is no effort at tax reform in its most fundamental sense, although the Minister said we have a very low rate of corporation tax by international standards.  We have been saying here year after year how low ours is by international standards.  Even by American Reagan standards and Thatcherite standards we are still the lowest.  An effort must be made to broaden the tax base and reduce the burden on the PAYE worker but at the same time to increase the take for the Exchequer &mdash; there should be no drop in the take to the Exchequer &mdash; to ensure that the taxes are used for the benefit of the country and our people, for our health and education services etc.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The decision on PRSI in the budget represents almost a total victory for the farmers and self-employed.  Even if a decision had been made to implement the full rate of 6.6 per cent, the amount recommended by the National Pensions <Col N="380" /> Board, it would have gone no way towards meeting the costs of the benefits for which farmers will now qualify.  The Minister pointed out in his speech that last year the Exchequer paid out £300 million to the farmers and self-employed for these services.  The cost of the assistance schemes was £300 million.  By putting 3 per cent PRSI on them the Minister says he expects he will take in this year £12 million, but he has not said in his Budget Statement what the pay out will be in 1988.  It was £300 million last year but now they are paying contributions and they will get contributory pensions etc.  I expect the pay out will be higher than the £300 million, but the Minister's take is only £12 million.  Who pays the balance?  The good old reliable; who else? The total income tax take from all the farmers and all the self-employed plus the 3 per cent PRSI and the Minister's £12 million all together will not even pay the £300 million.</P>
    <P>Of course, in addition the farmers and self-employed are paid their grants, subsidies and headage payments and get tax relief for this, that and the other.  Where does that all come from?  It is amazing. It comes from the same people, the ordinary working class people who pay it in their tax, their VAT, their pint and their excise duties, the same people pouring it in to the Minister so that he can hand it out to people here, there and everywhere in grants and so on, but he does not ask them to pay their share at all.  Why should big farmers not pay their share to ensure that there are grants, subsidies headage payments and so on for the smaller farmers? They expect it to come out of the workers' pockets and, of course, it does.</P>
    <P>One development in the budget of which it is important to emphasise the dangers and sinister elements is the decision to impose VAT on electricity. During the debate on the Single European Act early last year we pointed out that VAT would come on electricity and food.  The process of harmonisation of VAT has now begun.  The Minister has taken his first step on this in putting VAT on electricity.  The next step will be VAT on food.  We will almost certainly see <Col N="381" /> VAT on food next year.  Nothing will be free of VAT.  Children's shoes, food, electricity, all will have VAT because the harmonisation process has begun.</P>
    <P>In that regard I have referred in every budget debate to the VAT refund to unregistered farmers.  I can never understand it.  It began about seven or eight years ago.  When it started off it was about £7 million.  It went up to £20 million, then £40 million, £50 million, £60 million and last year £70 million.  How did the farmers' liability for VAT increase so enormously in the past five years?  Why do farmers not register for VAT and let us see they are due this money?  It is only a figure.  The Minister says in his Budget Statement that he will take £7 million off VAT.  Why does he say that if the VAT refund is due to them?  The Minister deducts the £7 million because he knows it is not due to them in any case.  It is simply a method of handing out money to farmers.</P>
    <P>There is no basis for it; it could be £70 million, it could be £40 million or it might only be £20 million.  They do not know how much is due yet they hand out the money under the heading, &ldquo;VAT refund to farmers&rdquo;.  No Minister has ever explained to me &mdash; and I raise this every year &mdash; how they arrive at the figure for the VAT refund for unregistered farmers. If they are due a refund why is the Minister taking £7 million off them this year?  I would like the Minister to answer that.  They are not due a refund; this is another hand-out.</P>
    <P>The ESB the firm for which I worked for 30 years and who, sadly, have been robbed before by way of levies are now to have £31 million hijacked from them by the Minister.  The ESB are expected to maintain their high level of efficiency without this money and are going to be under attack from our PD privateering friends who will say how inefficient they are.  Where will they get the money for maintaining their plant, machinery and stations at their highest efficiency? Where is the cash that is needed to give a better service to customers and for research and development and so on to <Col N="382" /> come from?  It is being grabbed by the Minister for Finance and so the privateers will be able to say: &ldquo;Look how inefficient they are, how their services to their customers are getting worse and why do they not reduce the price of electricity&rdquo;.  The ESB are under fierce pressure to reduce the price of electricity and yet the Minister, first, takes £31 million from them and, secondly, puts VAT on electricity so that if they were going to reduce the cost by 5 per cent, that 5 per cent must go back on again.  In every way they lose and in every way they will be the ones who will be blamed.  Neither the Minister for Finance nor any other Fianna Fáil Minister will defend them when the attack is on because the grab for the privatisation of the semi-State companies is increasing day by day.</P>
    <P>There are people out there who are friends of the members of the parties in here who are anxious to get their piece of various semi-State companies, whether it is Aer Lingus, Irish Life, the ESB or whatever, rather than put their investment into developing their own companies. The country is wide open for development.  Why do these people not put their money into developing our land, fisheries, food industry or mineral industry or into building a smelter?  These industries are wide open for development and nobody would stop the privateers from engaging in such development but, no, they want to grab whatever money they can out of those companies that are good and are operating efficiently.</P>
    <P>Every party have their friends: for the PDs, it is the Ryans of Ryanair or Guinness Peat Aviation; for Fine Gael it is the O'Reilly's or the Smurfits and for Fianna Fáil it is the Goodmans or the Purcells. It is interesting that this Fianna Fáil Government who had no money for health or education were able to find £30 million, £50 million or £100 million &mdash; nobody is really sure &mdash; what the amount is &mdash; to hand to Larry Goodman who was then able to buy Baileboro Co-Op.  He was able to buy Baileboro Co-Op with our money.  Killeshandra Co-Op did not stand a chance, especially when Larry Goodman had one of Fianna Fáil's top <Col N="383" /> organisers, Deputy Liam Lawlor, organising his campaign.  Larry Goodman was a winner from the start.</P>
    <P>The Minister dealt with unpaid taxes and rightly condemned those who do not pay their taxes and, in particular, those who deduct PAYE and PRSI from their workers' salaries and then refuse to hand the money over to the State.  He rightly condemned them and said that this has got to stop.  What is the Minister going to do about it?  This has got to stop because it is robbery.  The money is taken from workers' wages, held by the firms and not handed over to the State.  Why are these employers not prosecuted and put in jail? If a person steals a bar of chocolate he ends up in Mountjoy Prison.  There is a lovely big prison in my constituency.  It is brand new.  We have been told that it is one of the finest prisons in the world. It boasts excellent cuisine.  Why not put these offenders there?  That would stop this practice very rapidly.  That is the place for all the tax dodgers who, by not paying due taxes over to the State, are robbing people of their health services, education services and local government services.  The Minister will not resolve this problem unless he puts the boot in and gives these people the same treatment A1 Capone got because they are, in their way, in the same line of business as he was.  He was jailed for tax dodging.  If these people got the same treatment it would resolve that problem.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the Minister is at last arranging &mdash; and we have advocated this for a long time &mdash; that nobody will get a grant or subsidy until they can show a certificate that they have paid their taxes. That is only right and just.  People should not be handed out money from the Exchequer when they have not paid their due share in.  If they paid their due share in, money would be available for all the various services, whether by way of grants, subsidies, local government services, education services or health services. All our citizens avail of these services regardless of whether they pay their taxes so it is only right that the Minister has promised that people will <Col N="384" /> not get a grant or subsidy until they have paid their taxes.</P>
    <P>I would like to ask the Minister why he abolished the special investigation unit which I believe employed only 16 people and who identified moneys owing to the State, which had not previously been identified, to the extent of £6 million last year.  Apparently because of complaints from the self-employed association &mdash; I am not sure of their proper name &mdash; who said they were being harassed by the special investigation unit, that unit were abolished.  If the members of the self-employed association lived in Ballyfermot, Clondalkin or Blanchardstown I can tell them that they would be harassed every day of the week by rent inspectors from the corporation, inspectors sitting in cars for the purpose of seeing whether they own a car, or whether they are working. Michael Woods's Jobsearch inspectors are after them at every hands turn. Special phone lines have been set up so that neighbours can ring and inform on their neighbours.  These phone lines are like the hotlines the RUC have.  Michael Woods has a hotline going whereby a person can ring up and inform on his neighbour.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy Michael Woods, has a hotline set up whereby people can inform on their neighbours.  Nobody could tell me that the 16 inspectors in the special investigation unit were harassing the tax dodgers to the same extent.  Yet, they are being abolished because someone has complained that he is being harassed for not paying tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I commend the Minister for including Tallaght town centre as a special designated area.  The city of Dublin has a grave responsibility for the three satellite towns of Tallaght, Clondalkin and Blanchardstown. These towns were planned 15 or 20 years ago and they were to accommodate 100,000 people each. People were sent from the centre of Dublin to these areas and then left to fend <Col N="385" /> for themselves in a foreign environment. These towns still have few facilities, they have no town centres and the people labour under transport costs and so on. Nothing apparently is being done to assist them.  I do not know whether or not the Minister's proposition will help but at least it is an indication that the Minister recognises that there are problems.  I hope the Minister recognises that similar problems exist in Clondalkin and Blanchardstown. These were supposed to be towns, not surburbs of Dublin.  That was the way they were planned and the plan has been dropped.  I hope the Minister will pursue that matter to include the other two satellite towns in his plan to try to ensure that development takes place in the town centres.</P>
    <P>The Government want to save money. There is no easier way to save money than to put the 250,000 unemployed people back to work.  In that way the Government would save £600 million on handouts in social welfare and would get another £600 million at least in tax from the workers.  That would be a net gain of £1,200 million to the Exchequer.  It would also create new wealth and new jobs and growth in the economy and we could rapidly pay off all bankers and enable us to have a better health and education service.  There is a question of priorities here.  If the priority is to pay back bankers there will never be growth in the economy, but if the priority is the people that we represent growth is possible.  The Minister should remember that of the £22 billion debt, almost £12 billion of it is owed to Irish banks.  The Minister should be in charge of those banks.  We only owe £9 billion in foreign debt.  We should not worry about the £12 billion owed to Irish banks.  The Minister should not put the public debt as a priority and he should not try to frighten people by saying that we owe £22 billion and that therefore we should cut off our health service, let people die and let people remain ignorant and so on because we owe all this money. We owe all this money to AIB, to the Bank of Ireland, to Ulster Bank and a few more banks.  Why worry about them? One piece of legislation would put the <Col N="386" /> Government in charge of the whole lot &mdash; which is what The Workers' Party would advocate.  If we stop the robbers from bleeding us to death we could be a grand little country with a very high standard of living.</P>

    <P>The purpose of this Resolution is to give effect to the excise duty increase of 4p including VAT, on a packet of 20 cigarettes in the most popular price category and to provide for <i>pro rata</i> increases in the case of other products.  The new rates will take place from midnight tonight and the additional yield to the Exchequer resulting from these increases is estimated at £7.5 million in 1988 and £8.8 million for a full year.</P>
    <P>As an aside, I should like to mention that the opportunity has been taken in the Resolution to delete old-fashioned terms which have, perhaps, unsatisfactory connotations.  Those terms are &ldquo;Cavendish&rdquo; and &ldquo;negrohead&rdquo;.  In place of those old terms in future we are going to substitute &ldquo;sweetened pipe tobacco&rdquo;, a major reform, I think.</P>

      <P>I must say, as a user of one of the most popular brands of cigarette, that I confess to feeling no great sadness over the increase which the Taoiseach is proposing.  That is another day's work. For a revenue of £7.5 million in 1988 we are doing all the things mentioned in this Resolution, including the very obscure matter about &ldquo;negroheads&rdquo;, &ldquo;Cavendish&rdquo; and &ldquo;sweetened pipe tobacco&rdquo;. Could the Taoiseach indicate what the difference is between the extra revenue <Col N="389" /> that would be generated this year by this increase of 4p on the packet of cigarettes and the corresponding increases on these other categories of tobacco and the extra revenue that would have been generated last year by a similar increase?  The Taoiseach some years ago, indeed as far back as 1983, worried yearly about increases in duties on tobacco lest we might be running into a situation of diminishing returns.  As I listened to him year by year worrying about such matters, I wondered why the returns had not gone out of sight, but that did not happen.  It seems that the extra revenue that could be derived from an increase of this kind this year is substantially less than the extra revenue that would have been expected in any previous year.  Perhaps the Taoiseach could give us some comparisons between the situation this year and the situation last year.</P>
      <P>The other question on which I should like a little clarification is looking forward a little to the conditions that we face as we move towards a more complete harmonisation of excise duty under the plans proposed for the EC.  There are, of course, several elements in the duties proposed here.  For example, in the schedule to this Resolution we see that the rate of duty on cigarettes is £39.60 per thousand together with an amount equal to 13.33 per cent of the price at which the cigarettes are sold by retail. From long experience I know that these matters are absolutely fascinating when one is absorbed in them in the process of building up a budget but for the buyer of cigarettes they are less interesting. There is a question of the balance between the specific duty and the other part of the duty that has to be addressed.</P>
      <P>I wonder if the Taoiseach will indicate if there is anything in the changes that are being made this year that in any way prepares us for the kind of situation that we are likely to face when we move towards a greater harmonisation of these duties at EC level, apart from the expectation that the total revenue would be substantially less if we moved to a full harmonisation.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a lot of useless information here and I will give it to the Leader of the main Opposition party for what it is worth.  First, cigarettes account for approximately 93.5 per cent of total excise receipts from tobacco.  Cigarettes are the main component.  The excise duty on cigarettes and tobacco yielded £303.3 million in 1987, 21 per cent of a total excise yield of £1,390 million.  Approximately 96.5 per cent of duty paid cigarettes are made in Ireland and approximately 42 per cent of the other tobacco products are made in Ireland.  I am giving this information because it helps to give an idea of the structure of this particular excise duty.  Unfortunately, I have not got the information as to what this rate of 4p would have brought in in 1987 but the Deputy could possibly relate the £7.5 million that I have mentioned for this year or £8.8 million in a full year to that £303.3 million in 1987. If there is any additional specific information I can give the Deputy perhaps he will let me know.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have some more information for the Deputy on the question he asked about the EC situation. The duty structure on cigarettes is laid down by EC directive and applies in all EC states.  It combines both a specific and an <i>ad valorem</i> element.  Our post-budget 1988 take will be £39.6 per thousand cigarettes plus £13.33 of the retail selling price.  A specific component cannot <Col N="391" /> exceed 55 per cent of the total tax content of cigarettes in the most popular price category.  Irish manufacturers have requested that the specific element be kept as high as possible to inhibit the importation of cheap foreign cigarettes, as Irish cigarettes are of a high quality and a high cost.  Proposals for the harmonisation of excise duties generally, including the excise duty on tobacco, are being discussed at present in the context of the completion of the internal market by 1992 and are expected to progress significantly during 1988.  The point there is that our manufacturers prefer that the specific element in the duty be kept as high as possible as distinct from the percentage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>From what the Taoiseach said about this increase having a marginal effect I take it that we are at the point of diminishing returns or near enough to the point of diminishing returns in relation to tobacco taxation, that the revenue elasticity of further taxation has got to the stage where it is nearly negative.  Is that the case?  Secondly, are health considerations in mind in relation to this increase or is it made entirely on the basis of maximising revenue?</P>

    <P>¹O. J. No. L96, 3.4.1985, p.25.</P>
    <P>I have pleasure in moving this resolution which is the resolution dealing with hydrocarbons.  The purpose of this resolution is to give effect to an excise duty increase of 8p, including VAT, on a gallon of petrol and a 4p increase, including VAT, on a gallon of auto diesel. These increases, which are intended to take effect from midnight tonight, will result in the following additional Exchequer yields: petrol in 1988, £14.8 million and in a full year £16.6 million; auto diesel in 1988, £3.7 million and in a full year, £4 million.  The resolution also provides for an excise duty differential of 4½ per gallon including VAT in favour of unleaded petrol.  The Minister mentioned that matter in his speech.  The present higher trade costs mean that unleaded petrol is 4½p per gallon dearer than its leaded equivalent.  The present measure will therefore equalise the price of leaded and unleaded petrol at the point of sale and thus remove a considerable disincentive to the use of unleaded petrol. Again, virtue is triumphing over base monetary considerations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I know the Taoiseach speaks as a reformed smoker of some standing.  I would not take too much issue with him about what he said in regard to the duty on cigarettes, although his tongue was firmly in his cheek but I must say that when we come to petrol it is a different matter.  While we must commend an effort by the Government to make a move in favour of unleaded <Col N="395" /> petrol, the matter should be put in context lest the Taoiseach does what he says he never does which is to claim too much virtue for a particular measure.  There are 13 outlets in this country where you can buy unleaded petrol and I do not know whether that number will increase as a result of this measure.  I do not know how many motor vehicles there are in the country that use unleaded petrol and I would be very grateful if the Taoiseach could give us some information on that. If the Taoiseach has the information, I would also like to know whether there are any plans to encourage the importation of vehicles with engines capable of using unleaded petrol and whether side by side with that there are any plans to increase the number of outlets where this is available.</P>
      <P>I can see that this is a factor which might have a marginal effect on tourism since an increasing proportion of car fleets in continental European countries are equipped with engines that can take unleaded petrol.  Perhaps the wider availability of unleaded petrol here would make a marginal difference in the number of people who would be prepared to come here on holidays using their own cars.  We would need a good deal more information from the Taoiseach on what he expects the effects of this change in duty on the volume of sales will be, first of all, from the point of view of the price elasticity of the demand which underlies the forecast of expenditure.  Secondly, I would like to know whether the Government have given any consideration to the effect this increase will have on the competitiveness of petrol sales here as compred to those just across the Border.  As the Taoiseach knows, for a very wide band of country along the southern side of the Border it is now virtually impossible to run a petrol retail operation because of competition from the other side and ease of movement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach should also give us some indication of what the Government's expectations are in relation to the development of retail prices of petrol.  A <Col N="396" /> 4p increase per gallon is certainly something which would be felt.  It is, as I am sure the Taoiseach and his colleagues on the other side would know, particularly on the basis of their protestations over recent years on similar occasions, something that has a differential effect depending on what part of the country you are in.  Those of us who represent rural constituencies know that the price of petrol is a much bigger issue for us than for many of those who represent urban constituencies.  In my own case, for example, my family car now does around 20,000 miles a year and the only time I ever drive it is to go to Mass on a Sunday. That is a result of living in a rural constituency and one, indeed, which is not very far from where we are now, 35 miles at most.</P>
    <P>When you get out past the area which is served by a relatively frequent public transport service the only means of moving about is by having a car or a motorbike and therefore the price of petrol becomes a substantial item in a family budget.  With that in mind, it would be useful to know what the expectation is as to the volume of sales.  In relation to the forecast of prices, are we seeing here an anticipated clawback by the Government or a clawback by the Government in anticipation of a change in petrol prices, or will this 4p be further added to in the coming months through an increase arising from a movement in crude oil and petrol prices internationally?</P>
    <P>Finally, could the Taoiseach indicate to us what the trend in the volume of sales of petrol here for 1986 was and what the forecast is for the volume of sales post-budget in 1988?</P>

      <P>The Worker's Party are implacably opposed to the provision contained in this resolution.  First, we are amazed that the Government are seeking to impose increases as proposed and outlined by the Taoiseach in moving the resolution and, indeed, by the Minister for Finance, Deputy MacSharry, in proposing the budget earlier today.  In January 1986 this issue was debated at length <Col N="397" /> in the context of the budget which was then being proposed by the Coalition Government of the day.  It is worth noting some of the arguments which were then presented by the present Government who were then in Opposition in opposing an increase of similar proportions to deliver similar revenue to the Government's coffers.  The Taoiseach, Deputy Haughey, who was then Leader of the Opposition, said and I quote from the Official Report, volume 363, column 1083:</P>
      <P>We are opposing both these resolutions which propose additional taxes and an extra burden on the unfortunate motorist.  There are many arguments, social and economic, which can be advanced against both the increases proposed.</P>

      <P>What astounds us is how in such a short period of time the arguments forcibly advanced in January 1986 against a similar proposal can be turned around, as the Taoiseach did a few months ago.  I should like to ask the Taoiseach, and the members of his party who spoke against a similar proposal in 1986 when in Opposition, to explain how matters have changed so dramatically since then to warrant such a U-turn?  How <Col N="399" /> have matters changed for the beleaguered motorist, for the tourist and traders in the Border areas?</P>
      <P>The Workers' Party are surprised and dismayed at this change in attitude by Fianna Fáil.  We are opposed to the resolution for all the reasons advanced by Fianna Fáil when in Opposition such a short time ago.  We consider this to be an attack on working people.  Deputy Seamus Brennan, when in Opposition, told us how an increase in the price of petrol would affect the lives of young working people with a family.  He told us that at the end of the day such people, even allowing for improvements in the tax system, would suffer a net loss when one takes into consideration the increase in the cost of running a car to and from work, to and from church and to and from local shops.  This represents an attack on the living standards of working people.  It is a cute piece of work which represents a negative contribution to the relief promised for so long to the PAYE sector.</P>

      <P>As a Border Deputy I should like to tell the Taoiseach that this represents yet another nail in the coffin of the few retailers still in business in Border areas.  I do not often find myself in agreement with any member of The Workers' Party but I must agree with Deputy McCartan who spoke of the crocodile tears shed by Fianna Fáil members when in Opposition about a similar move.  This increase is a charter for more smuggling.  Does the Taoiseach realise the extent of the smuggling along the Border?  The amount of money lost to the Irish Exchequer is hard to estimate.  I can assure the Taoiseach that he would need a diviner to find a petrol retailer in Border areas.  I hope he does not run out of petrol in the vicinity of the south Armagh border because it will be a long way back to Kinsealy.</P>

      <P>I share the views of my party leader in regard to the concessions on unleaded petrol.  I hope that as a result many car owners will adjust their cars for use of that petrol.  On one occasion I was about to put the nozzle of the unleaded petrol pump into my tank when an attendant informed me that there might be disastrous consequences for my engine if it was not modified for the use of unleaded petrol.  I welcome the concession in the budget and we should try to ensure that more of our cars are converted for use of unleaded fuel.  Will the Taoiseach explain how the Government decided on the balance in relation to these duties because it seems to me that they got it wrong.  In the course of the debate on Financial Resolution No. 1 the Taoiseach said that he could not state categorically that we had reached a point of diminishing returns in regard to tobacco products.  Indeed, he indicated that health considerations had played a minor role in regard to the decision to increase the duty on cigarettes.</P>
      <P>The decision to increase petrol by 8p per gallon will have a great impact on the average person and on industry.  To increase the excise duty on cigarettes by 8p would have yielded as much but would not have affected the average person to the same extent.  Will the Taoiseach accept that the Government have got the balance wrong in this case?  My colleagues from Border counties have indicated the damage such an increase will do in their constituencies.  In recent months the differential between the price of petrol North and South has narrowed considerably and that has proved of great benefit to traders in the South.  However, this hike in the budget will change that. Will the Taoiseach agree that the Government did not give this matter sufficient consideration and that they got the balance wrong?</P>

      <P>I should like to compliment the Taoiseach on reintroducing <Col N="401" /> the exemption for young farmers from tax when they inherit farms from their fathers or close in-laws.  Of course, the concession should never have been dropped. I should like the Taoiseach to take my two criticisms of the budget seriously. I regret the decision of the Government to transfer to the Department of Health the operation of the scheme whereby indirect taxes on motor vehicles adapted for use by disabled persons may be refunded.  I am opposed to that move because I believe that that money will be swallowed up in the Department of Health who are in a critical financial state.  It is my belief that the £3 million, the full year cost of the existing scheme, will not be forthcoming.  Those who are concerned about disabled drivers, the Irish Wheelchair Association and the Spina Bifida Association, have expressed the view that the disabled will lose out.</P>
      <P>I am disappointed at the decision of the Government to increase the price of petrol by 8p per gallon particularly when I consider that three senior Ministers in the Government are from Border counties, two from the constituency of Cavan-Monaghan, and one, the Minister for Finance, from Sligo-Leitrim.  Those Ministers must understand the problems petrol retailers in Border counties are encountering. Traders in the Border counties who attended a meeting in Monaghan before Christmas of the Border Traders Association were happy that as a result of the fall in oil prices the difference in the price of petrol had fallen.  It had reduced to a difference of 53p per gallon.</P>
      <P>They calculated that a 10p to 15p additional reduction would mean that it would not be worth one's while travelling a distance to fill one's tank.  They had hoped that that would have been the position following on this budget.  But, lo and behold, the Minister announces today that the price of petrol is to be increased by 8p per gallon &mdash; and that on the part of the people who were shouting on this side of the House less than 12 months ago about what was happening in Border areas.  They well know and realise the position but obviously have decided to close their minds to it.</P>

      <P>On this occasion all the Minister for Finance is doing is taking the benefit into the Exchequer of a major reduction in the price of petrol.  My information is that another decrease in the price is on its way.  Deputies might please compare like with like.  The imposition af excise duty in 1986 resulted in a direct increase in the price of petrol whereas, in this case, taking one week with another, the imposition of this excise duty will not directly increase the price.</P>

      <P>I am somewhat disappointed at the two Border Deputies. Both of them should know that this Government acted very positively, efficiently and decisively as soon as coming into office to help traders along the Border.  That was one of the most effective actions taken for a long time <Col N="403" /> whose results were dramatic and immediate. I do not know that this imposition on the price of petrol, in itself, will disadvantage people along the Border.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Not a lot.  Let me come to the question of fact posed by Deputy Dukes.  First of all, we calculate that one third of motor vehicles can use unleaded petrol and, of the remainder, some would need a slight mechanical adjustment to use it.  Over the years the volume of sales discloses that petrol has gone down considerably in volume and that diesel has gone up; diesel has become much more popular over a decade.</P>
      <P>Though not strictly relevant to this, one Deputy raised the question of the change in regard to disabled drivers.  It was I who introduced that concession for disabled drivers in the first instance.  I will be very determined to ensure that the change in the system of administration does not in any way disadvantage disabled drivers.  I can give the Deputy a very solemn assurance on that.  I know a lot about that.  I assure him that this change is being made not to save money or disadvantage anybody but simply to have a more effective and efficiently administered system.  Like the Deputy, I will be maintaining a very careful eye on how the position will unfold.  As the Deputy will know also, the Minister, in the course of his remarks today, said that the new scheme will be devised in consultation with individuals and organisations representing disabled drivers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those are just a few facts sought by Deputies.  I will endeavour to get any further information people seek.  I want to make the point again that, whereas this will mean more money for the Exchequer &mdash; and perhaps many people would have preferred if recent decreases in price could have been retained for the benefit of motorists &mdash; on the other hand it is not all that unfair or indeed unexpected that the Minister would take <Col N="404" /> advantage of the decrease in prices to gain some benefit for the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>I have to be a little aghast at the crocodile tears of Deputy McCartan in this regard.  I too represent a working class constituency.  If the people of my constituency had to choose between getting revenue from petrol, from income tax, from VAT or anything else, I think the vast majority of them would opt for getting that extra revenue from petrol.</P>

Then, when we propose a change of this kind to help to finance considerable concessions for the PAYE sector, this other member of The Workers' Party tells us that he is passionately opposed.  It is a rather funny and peculiar sort of cause for The Workers' Party to be adopting, to be fighting to the death for a small, relatively insignificant increase in the price of petrol which, in the context of the overall arithmetic of the budget, will go ultimately to the benefit of the PAYE taxpayer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I intervene to add my voice to the claims made already by Deputies McGahon and Boylan on behalf of the immediate Border area.  I concede immediately that the 48-hour condition was a help to the country in general.  As Deputy McGahon has said, it deterred people from travelling long distances in busloads, from comparatively distant parts, on shopping sprees to the North. But it has done nothing whatever for the towns from Blacklion to Emyvale right up to Dundalk, nothing whatever.  They are ghost towns at present.  I am thinking particularly of towns like Clones and Belturbet, very close to me.  Within a few hundred yards of the town of Clones, in Northern Ireland a huge petrol filling station has been built with ancillary shops selling everything and anything.  Within a mile of the town there are two or three of these petrol filling stations.  The result is that there is wholesale smuggling to the complete disadvantage of the immediate Border areas about which I speak.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is really very difficult to believe that the Taoiseach, the Minister for Tourism and Transport and the Minister for Health would allow this to happen.  We were told last year and the year before that because there was no Border voice in the Cabinet these things were happening, and that if there were a Border voice in the Cabinet &mdash; my own name was mentioned &mdash; it would not be allowed to happen.  Now we have reinforcements in the Cabinet and this disgraceful performance is taking place and it is really putting these unfortunate people out of <Col N="406" /> business, I do not know how this will be received in the areas I am talking about.</P>
    <P>I and the other two Deputies who have spoken are members of a committee in Fine Gael for Border areas and have been asked to go to Castleblayney to meet the people there who have this problem.  We have been asked and have gone to Monaghan where we meet the same problems. In that area people were expecting VAT to be removed from videos and colour televisions which, I understand, are being bought now on a professional basis by professional smugglers; they are being sold now from door-to-door in a professional way which did not happen until now.  These people were expecting that something would be done there and I myself made representations to the Minister for Finance on behalf of a large business in Monaghan and another in the town of Cootehill about this very problem. What are these people going to say, when the Government campaigned at the last election to put an end to this and got votes on the strength of it?</P>
    <P>I would say they got Deputy Leonard's seat on that campaign &mdash; it is no wonder he has left the Chamber.  They promised to fix up the people on the Border and put and end to this smuggling and put the people in Monaghan town, Clones, Belturbet, Ballyconnell, Swanlinbar, Blacklyon, Emyvale and Dundalk back in business again, and that the cash registers would be ringing in the old traditional way.  What will they say when they find this evening that instead of things improving under this Government they have been deliberately made worse, because the petrol is what brings people across the Border, and when they go there they fill up the boots of their cars with items that can and should be bought on this side of the Border.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Taoiseach to have an in-depth study made of the situation along the Border with a view to introducing some remedial measures to relieve the problems of business people along the Border.  I know that if I had made the promises the Taoiseach indirectly made and the promises his Cabinet Ministers and Deputies made <Col N="407" /> directly in the last election I would be ashamed of my life to be seen in any of those towns.  I appeal again to the Taoiseach to make an in depth study of the whole situation and do something about it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to make three brief observations.  On the question of petrol I agree with my colleagues on this side of the House that the matter has been dealt with in a rather hamfisted way by the Government.  There was a recent reduction of a similar amount.  Had the clawback been in operation at that time and had the reduction not been conceded to the consumer the revenue yield would have been higher because the Minister would have had at least two months additional revenue and there would be no negative buoyancy as applies now on an 8 per cent increase.</P>
      <P>The second point I want to make is that we really must strive to have an equalistion because the knock-on effect of increasing the price of petrol on the other Border commodities, notably beer and spirits, is considerable.  As the Taoiseach knows, the general estimate for one major company is that currently there are between 5,000 and 6,000 kegs of beer a week being imported illegally into the Republic.  That is accentuated by the petrol situation.  It should have been handled better.</P>
      <P>Now we have the prospect of a further increase in the immediate future.  It would be interesting to know how much that will be.  All Governments should be interested in bringing about an equalisation. Things were going that way and I think the yield should have been foregone on this occasion.  After all there was no increase in the price of beer in this budget or in the price of spirits.  The Minister and the Taoiseach were correct in that decision in terms of equalisation.  If we could bring it down to 40p or even 30p to 35p we would have been on the road to improving the overall Exchequer yield.  I put that very strongly to the Taoiseach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second point is one raised by the Taoiseach himself in regard to the <Col N="408" /> scheme for disabled drivers.  The Taoiseach knows the reason for the policy change.  He is aware of the particular abuse that had arisen, albeit on a minor scale, but sufficient to mention and require a change in policy.  I am gravely concerned that the onus for this measure is now being transferred from the Revenue Commissioners to the health boards.  I would not give the health boards, at this stage, £2 million to provide incontinence pads for patients because they would not give them to the patients. To suggest that one should given the health boards some £2.3 million with a view to the health boards, the Minister and the Department of Health bringing in a scheme of subsidy the equivalent of the excise remission makes me fearful for the prospects for that scheme.  My colleague, Deputy Brendan Howlin, recalled £180,000 being made available to the Southern Health Board for a paediatrician in Wexford General Hospital, and when the money got there it was made quite clear there was no way that money would be spent on that measure. So if, for example, the Eastern Health Board get&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but I accept your ruling.  I am very concerned about these new health board measures.  I do not believe for one minute that they have the administrative intention to get embroiled with the Irish Wheelchair Association or the Association for Disabled Drivers in developing a bureaucratic scheme of assistance for those who wish to purchase <Col N="409" /> motor vehicles within that framework.  It will be a shambles.  That is not a criticism of the competence of the Department of Health.  The Department of Health, having lost 16 staff in the last fortnight, cannot even keep up with the redundancies, never mind keeping up with the disabled drivers' scheme.  This is a transferred scheme in that the money being saved &mdash; how much I do not know &mdash; is being transferred to the Health Vote.  I believe we should have been less pedestrian as regards people buying petrol across the Border.  I would not have imposed that increase.  We will be calling a vote on Resolution No. 2, not because we are opposed to taxation &mdash; like the Taoiseach, I am in favour of taxation for essential public services &mdash; but because I have strong reservations about this increase.  We will not be supporting Resolution No.3 which is tying VAT on farmers with VAT on electricity charges. That proposal is too far-fetched to be bought by anybody in the House.</P>
      <P>I am very worried about the disabled drivers' scheme which is supposed to be brought in by the Minister for Health who is under so much pressure at the moment that he would nearly spend that money trying to keep Barringtons Hospital open.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a couple of questions I should like to raise.  I notice that this imposition applies to all transport with the exception of scheduled passenger services. I presume that means CIE and other smaller companies will be exempt from the increase in the excise duties being introduced here tonight.  I wonder if this is the proper way to subsidise CIE. If we are subsidising the State transport company we should do it in an obvious way.  To disguise this subsidy by increasing the excise duty on all other forms <Col N="410" /> of hydrocarbon using transport and not apply it to CIE, is not a transparent move.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I am raising this issue because I do not believe this is the way to do it.  This increase should apply across the board.  This is particularly true at present when the concept of competition in access transport and internal transport is being introduced.  In Kildare Street every Friday night we see queues for buses that are run by the private sector bringing public servants to destinations all around the country. These companies will be at a competitive disadvantage now.  I am not objecting to a subsidised State transport scheme; all I am saying is that it should be up front.</P>
      <P>Against the background of my remarks today, this measure disimproves the terms of competition.  If we are simply looking at the internal economy, we see that the increase in excise duty of 8p on a gallon of petrol is cancelled by a prospective reduction in the price of petrol at the pumps.  The consumer pays the same price per litre or per gallon and is no worse off.  But that argument does not stand up if we look at the competition between this country and our western European neighbours, and especially at competition between this country and the United Kingdom.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I gave a figure today &mdash; it was open to correction by the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Finance and it has not been corrected as yet &mdash; that the cost of transporting a metric tonne by lorry in this country is 60 per cent higher than in the United Kingdom. If the basic economic argument is that we must improve the trading sectors of the <Col N="411" /> economy, that our growth should be export led in internationally traded goods and services, and that increases in internationally traded services would pull the rest of the economy forward, we cannot afford any loss of competitiveness.  If the price of diesel is increased by 4p a gallon in real terms, vis-à-vis the United Kingdom &mdash; and I am particularly interested in the situation in the United Kingdom which is still our largest market and is our primary competitor &mdash; then the terms of trade are shifting to our disadvantage.</P>
    <P>That is one of our big problems and will remain even though the debt is being attacked in a very resolute way.  If we did get growth of 3 per cent or 4 per cent in 1989, there is the prospect of harmonising the debt/GNP ratio.  All the optimistic projections say we cannot do that without growth.  The argument is often presented that we must get the debt right by cutting and then we must get growth, but we cannot get the debt right unless there is growth.</P>
    <P>The medium term study by the ESRI published in December is based on the proposition that this year we will have a minus growth rate of .2 per cent but that next year we will have a positive growth rate in real terms of between 3 per cent and 4 per cent.  My argument is that while the terms of trade and the factors of production are not competitive on all fronts with our nearest neighbour and largest competitor, we will not get those growth rates.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach, if I understand his economic policy and I think I do, is of the view that if we cut the debt interest rates will come down, and that as interest rates come down resources will be released.  That is true and we all agree with it.  New investment is created and this one factor on its own will give some growth.  He couples that with strategies in different sectors and talks about the tourist industry, aquaculture, forestry, financial services and so on, but if we are not competitive and if the structural <Col N="412" /> problems in the economy are not corrected the Taoiseach's sectoral policy will not work.</P>
    <P>The Minister introduced a package for the tourist industry which cost£4 million. He took £8 million out of the Estimate and now he has brought it back.  I understand an element of this package will be petrol vouchers for tourists.  The concept of petrol vouchers was introduced last May and petrol vouchers were being issued in London.  As I understand it, at the end of the tourist season, members of Bord Fáilte were almost going around the pubs giving out petrol vouchers like somebody giving out tickets for a badly attended disco.  The voucher system does not work.  When visitors come to this country they get very bad value.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach will be aware from the recent forum on the tourist industry that a survey taken last autumn showed that 48 per cent of foreigners who took holidays in this country thought they got very bad value, or bad value, for their holiday.  The main reason for the bad value was the cost of a holiday here.  They talked about the price of drink and petrol and the cost of car hire.  I know the Taoiseach has a very strong interest in the tourist industry, which I share, and a strong sectoral policy for it, because it is one of the potential areas for growth. It is also an area where growth can be distributed to the most remote parish because the tourist industry not alone can create wealth but acts as its own distributor which is a very effective means of distribution in an economy such as ours with a small population in a fairly large area.  If the tourist considers that he or she is getting bad value in this country, elements such as this in the budget will make a bad situation worse.</P>

Is the Taoiseach aware that the price of a litre of petrol in the United States is the same now, almost to the cent, as a gallon of petrol here?  Is he also aware, from his consultations with the tourist industry, particularly at the recent tourist forum, that the most cost effective and beneficial type of tourist to attract here is the one who flies in, hires a car at the airport and travels freely around the country?  Getting the major advantage of added value in the tourist industry is not a question of packing aeroplanes with chartered passengers and taking them in coaches on pre-packaged holidays to hotels where a bed is offered at $15 a night.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The real money-spinner is the person flying in independently, hiring a self drive car with two or three companions and booking into guesthouses and hotels.  The Taoiseach has already replied to the point I raised regarding CIE and I should also like him to comment on what I said about the cost of internal transport in this country and how it compares adversely with the cost of internal transport in the United Kingdom.  I am sure he will agree <Col N="414" /> that the price of diesel and petrol is one of the major elements in these costs.</P>

      <P>The Leas-Cheann Comhairle has been most generous in allowing Deputy Desmond to speak about disabled drivers and I just want to make a few brief points.  In that regard I hope that when the refund of VAT, excise duty and the duty on cars is handed over to the health boards they will not adopt a miserly attitude in how they determine the people who are eligible.  I would not like to think that people who benefited from this scheme in the past will not be eligible under the new scheme. I can understand why the scheme will now be under the auspices of various health boards but, unfortunately, it has been my experience that these boards have a more stringent policy in determining eligibility for any type of scheme than Government Departments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not possible to get excessive growth in the economy and at the same time to reduce the burden on the public finances.  The Government's primary concern should be the reduction of Exchequer borrowing.  Growth is only possible in very limited areas.  My analogy is a man who owes £500,000 to the bank, <Col N="415" /> who runs a business and comes up with a brainwave which, as he tells his bank manager, will make them a fortune.  The bank manager says that may be so but, as the businessman is up to his ears in debt, he cannot advance any more money.  That is what happened to our economy over a long number of years. The Government's strategy in trying to control the national debt is the proper course.  This is an astute and excellent budget and it proves that the test of its formation was many months ago when the expenditure side of the Estimates was decided.  It is like a successful shopkeeper. If he can control his overheads he can sell more competitively than anyone else.  When this Government came to power&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a few questions for the Taoiseach.  Surely, the Taoiseach would agree that there are an amazing amount of inherent contraditions contained <Col N="416" /> within this resolution because identified in the Minister's speech today &mdash; particularly in the area of tourism &mdash; he said:</P>
      <P>The <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> recognises the existence of considrable potential in tourism...</P>
      <P>What I want to weigh up against this resolution is that this Government, last summer, identified one of the major problems in the tourism area as the cost of petrol in this country, not alone that but they went out and did something about it in terms of the voucher scheme which they operated within the UK which is a very big potential market in this country. It is probably one of the biggest potential markets that we have in terms of motoring on the ground which Deputy Noonan quite rightly said in the context of the added value in our tourism.  Now the Minister for Finance and the Government impose another penalty of 8p on the price of petrol.  It is already a serious problem and it is being compounded and made worse.</P>
      <P>I should also like to say to the Taoiseach that it is strange that he imposed this increase when we have a company like B &amp; I suffering so seriously &mdash; they have identified the huge drop in passenger traffic on the sea routes &mdash; and one of the reasons is the drop in the car family holiday into this country.  Again, we are penalising them when they are on their backs trying to do something about it. Surely, that is an incredible contradiction contained within this increase.  It is wrong to identify it as just an 8p increase in itself.  It is a serious problem which is being made worse.  The loss has been identified by the non-repeat tourism business. When they get here and find it so expensive they do not come back; they were not doing that at the lower rate and I can assure the Taoiseach that they certainly will not do it at the increased rate for petrol.  I am extremely puzzled and baffled at the contradictions in that area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach said, and I was interested to hear this, that the increase in diesel will apply to all the private hire bus companies operating on scheduled <Col N="417" /> routes and even to those operating on non-scheduled routes.  He knows that CIE operate a lot of non-scheduled routes including bingo buses.  The Taoiseach has now informed the House that they will also get the benefit of it.  The Taoiseach should also bear in mind that there are many areas in this country which CIE do not service and which are being serviced by private companies. They are providing a much needed social service.  I hope that those companies will be looked at on their merits as well because this whole area is extremely important for the future development of the bus companies.  As the Taoiseach has rightly said, we have seen what the Minister for Tourism and Transport has done in regard to deregulation in the airways. The Minister could also take a leaf out of his book in the deregulation of the busways which is so badly needed, because with the expansion within the EC we have a serious problem.</P>
    <P>Finally, could I say that this 8p increase is a total contradiction and goes diametrically opposite to the present needs of tourism.  The extra £4 million that they have made available for tourism will probably end up being used to fund a voucher scheme in the UK because of the 8p increase.  It is a complete balancing of money and it is not a real incentive at all.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have two very brief points which I want to put to the Taoiseach on the earlier discussion which we had about what PAYE workers should expect.  At present they pay 90.3 per cent of the income tax collected and get nothing but cutbacks from this Government. Why should they expect anything by way of return by paying extra costs in petrol prices?  The second question I want to ask the Taoiseach is whether he would at least agree that as a form of indirect tax it discriminates against working people in so far as it does not have regard to the capacity of the person to pay.  Paying 8p extra on a gallon of petrol is far more onerous for a working man than for someone who is much better off and in a far better position to pay.  On that matter <Col N="418" /> alone would he agree that there is an inbuilt inequity in the system?</P>

The first one is the same question which the present Tánaiste put to the then Taoiseach on 29 January 1986 in the context of increases in hydrocarbons.  In other words, have the Government made an analysis of the increase in industrial costs arising out of this obvious increase in distribution of transport costs <i>vis-à-vis</i> our competitors and what is the result of that inquiry?  Second, what has become of his much vaunted quotes on that and other subsequent occasions on this self financing selective tax cuts question? Third, does he agree, as was indicated by the present Tánaiste on that occasion, that this method of raising taxation is a lazy way for any Government to go about taking in revenue?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment has the effect of deleting the charge of 5 per cent on ESB bills. I move it for a number of reasons.  First, it seems that the ESB are being used and <Col N="423" /> have been used over a long number of years as a kind of&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;lucky dip or a till to which the Government can go at any time to pull in a few million pounds or a few tens of millions of pounds depending on their need at any given time.  A special levy was imposed some years ago on the fuel oil they use for generating electricity.  A special rates levy was put on them also in relation to their power stations etc. which also brought in money for the Government. It was not brought in for local authorities, it was used directly by Government.  Now we have the imposition of VAT on electricity which the Government claim will have no effect on consumer prices.  I would like to hear the Minister explain how that will be.  How does he propose to ensure that the ESB reduce their prices in order to compensate for the increase arising from the 5 per cent VAT?</P>
      <P>If our semi-State companies are going to be treated in this cavalier way by Government, they are not semi-State at all and cannot be classified as independent commercial companies.  The ESB provide a very important resource for industry and for virtually every home in the country.  They provide a very efficient, modern service, yet they are abused in this way by Government.  I am anxious to hear how the Minister proposes to get the ESB to reduce their prices and whether there will be any reference at all to the fact that it may or may not be commercially the correct thing to do at this time.</P>
      <P>If the ESB argue, as they may well do, that they are not yet ready to reduce prices, will the Minister come back to this House and propose a reduction in the VAT which he is proposing to take here tonight?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of whether this is a tax on consumers will depend ultimately on whether the ESB can reduce their prices. We are being told that the PAYE sector <Col N="424" /> are getting money out of this budget.  On a very simple level, so to speak, in terms of the sums one can do arising from the budget, it seems that the PAYE sector are getting reliefs in the region of £7 million.  At the same time £10 million is going to be taken in VAT on ESB bills. Something like £14 million is going to be taken in increased petrol prices as a result of the increase in excise duty, and as a result of the imposition of a 6 per cent tax or levy on pension funds they are going to have another £20 million taken out of their pocket.  Right along the line the vast majority of the people, the working class who pay most of the tax, are being robbed once more with no attempt to give them real relief at the end of the day.  That is why we are proposing this amendment to the resolution before us that the 5 per cent VAT be not placed on electricity bills.  We have no confidence whatsoever in this Government either in carrying through on their promise that this will not mean an increase in the price to the consumers, nor that once they have it in place they will not come along in six months or even next year and increase it further and place it on food as would seem to be their intention as well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I should like to make a number of observations on this resolution.  First, I would like to reiterate a point I made when discussing the previous resolution.  It seems that when the external terms of trade are moving in our favour and when costs of production are going down the Government will take specific decisions to prevent this happening and the benefit of an improving cost environment abroad will accrue to the Exchequer rather than to the competitive sector.  We were told that the price of electricity was about to come down by 5 or 6 per cent.  It is not going to come down now because the Minister is taking that reduction in a new VAT rate of 5 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that industry will be able to claim back the 5 per cent VAT and I would like the Minister to confirm that this will be so.  If that is the case, while industry will not benefit from reductions <Col N="425" /> in the price of heavy fuel oil which is the main cost factor, apart from wages, at least they will not lose significantly.  They will remain line-ball but every other user of energy in the EC and, in particular, in the United Kingdom will have their electricity costs reduced further.  Another example which shows that the Government are not moving to correct the uncompetitive aspects of the Irish economy, but actually moving in the opposite direction, is that their sectoral policy and decisions like this are paradoxical to say the least, if not directly opposed to each other.</P>
    <P>The second point I would like to make concerns the domestic consumers.  Domestic consumers could have expected a reduction of 5 per cent or 6 per cent in the price of electricity but they are not going to get it now.  If this is taken in the context of the peculiar decision in the budget that the ESB be required to pay £31 million in outstanding loans from the Exchequer back to the Exchequer, this is a very heavy imposition.  I would like the Minister to comment on this transfer. Have the ESB got this amount of liquid assets in hand so that they can write off loans which were to be repaid over 15 years at about £2 million per year and which are all up-front now?  Is this the same ESB who, in December 1986, threatened to take the Government to the Supreme Court because they were required to pay a levy in lieu of rates and who in 1987 can come up with the full payment on the rates levied and hand over £31 million to the Exchequer?  What effect will this hand-over have on the price of electricity?  Would the price of electricity have come down further if the Government had not robbed the coffers of the ESB?  A point I made already today is that we will not get growth in the economy until we are competitive with other countries and, in particular, with out nearest neighbour.  This is another example of the Government deliberately making Irish industry even more uncompetitive than it is already.</P>
    <P>The Government are introducing a new rate of VAT.  The previous Government reduced the number of VAT rates <Col N="426" /> from five to three and there was a general movement towards a more organised system with fewer rates.  We all know that in the background there is the issue of harmonisation of VAT rates in Europe. Now, for some reason or other a new VAT rate is being introduced so that we are going to have rates of zero, five, ten and 25 per cent.  Why have the Government introduced this new VAT rate?  Is this going to be the vehicle by which other zero-rated items are going to be loaded as we move towards harmonisation?</P>
    <P>If there was an omission in today's budget &mdash; and God knows there were many &mdash; the most glaring omission on the tax side was the paucity of comment on harmonisation of VAT rates which, as a result of last year's decision on the internal market and the Single European Act, will face us in 1992.  I am sure the Minister is aware of recent studies in this respect and I am certain his officials will be able to brief him on this.  I should like to ask the Minister if he is aware that if a single VAT rate of 13 per cent was introduced on all items, there would be a loss of almost £200 million to the Exchequer but if, on the other hand, a single VAT rate of 15 per cent was levied on all goods and services, £10 million extra would accrue to the Exchequer.  Many European countries want, on harmonisation, to have two VAT rates.  I wonder if it is the Minister's intention to reintroduce the 5 per cent rate, which he has now introduced, in subsequent budgets and to include the main exemption which, of course, is food products?  Pre-VAT expenditure on food products in Ireland in 1986 was £1.967 million.  That is an awful lot of money.</P>
    <P>We are so near the harmonisation of VAT rates in the EC that the Government, the Minister or the Taoiseach should, during the course of this debate, comment extensively on the issue of harmonisation. It is the Government's intention to go for dual rates?  If the Government were to go for a standard VAT rate of 14 per cent, with a reduced rate of 7 per cent, there would still be a loss to the Exchequer of about £314 million.  If an 18 per cent standard rate and a reduced rate of 8 per cent were <Col N="427" /> introduced the Irish Exchequer would raise slightly more than it does at present. That is a huge problem but there is an even bigger problem on the excise side. I wonder if the 5 per cent VAT rate on electricity was a 2 o'clock in the morning decision last Thursday to provide the wherewithal to bring the income tax relief to £91 million or is it the thin end of the wedge for a reduced rate of VAT which would extend to the bulk of exempted items and, in particular, all food products? I would like the Minister to answer these questions.</P>
    <P>As I said already, as I understand it all industries registered for VAT purposes will be able to claim relief on VAT in respect of their electricity bills.  It is arguable that there should be some small cash flow benefit to companies for that reason. Certainly there should be no increase in their yearly cost of electricity.  In this context I should like the Minister to comment on a scheme being operated by the ESB at present which allows the prepayment of electricity bills a year in advance to achieve exemptions from both company taxation and the DIRT tax.  I am sure the Minister is aware of this scheme and he might use the opportunity during this debate to cast some light on this clever tax avoidance scheme which is now widespread.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> While businesses registered for VAT will be able to claim back the 5 per cent VAT on their electricity bills, is the Minister aware of the other anomaly that arises where large farmers registered for VAT will not be affected by the second proposition to reduce the VAT from 1.7 per cent to 1.4 per cent because once they are registered they can claim it back anyway? The proposal regarding VAT on agricultural products will only affect the vast number of farmers who are not registered <Col N="428" /> for VAT.  This affects middle sized farmers and small farmers.  It affects anybody with any land and any activity.  The smaller one is, the less likely one is to be registered.  This is unfair.  The larger farmer will be able to claim the VAT paid on the electricity he uses for his milking machines and he will not be affected by the secondary proposition here.  The small farmer whether he has or has not an income will have to pay the 5 per cent extra on electricity charges and will be hit again because he is not registered.  I know a case can be made that it is equitable and just to tax the farming community in a fair way and in a way which would yield a greater return than at present.  The <i>quid pro quo</i> negotiated by the Minister's party when land tax was abolished did not involve a reduction in the rate of VAT rebate.  This again is an example of where the leaders of the farming organisations bought a pig in a poke.  We had the first tranche of rebate eliminated last year and the second tranche of rebate is eliminated this year. Tricking around with the VAT system and with rebates in the VAT system is not an adequate substitute for a fair taxation system on the farming community and we should not take that approach.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister either tonight or in the course of the budget debate answer the questions I have raised especially the questions about VAT and electricity in the context of the harmonisation of rates within the Community?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the electricity capital repayments the Minister said it had been agreed to repay all outstanding Exchequer advances in the current year.  I take it that was an agreement between the Government and the ESB rather than an agreement inside the Government.  Like Deputy Noonan I would like to know where this money is. Is it accumulated capital reserve which exists now, or is it money which is to be brought in over the course of the next year on electricity bills still outstanding? If there are capital reserves in the ESB accounts it would be reasonable for the Government to ask for repayment <Col N="429" /> immediately, but if it was a question of foregoing further decreases in electricity prices and tariffs in order to give the £31 million repayment to the Government, then the issues Deputy Noonan raised as to whether or not we are really interested in the capital costs would certainly arise.</P>
      <P>I would like some indication as to the capital status of this money at the moment.  Is it in existence at the moment or is it proposed to bring it into existence by deferring what would otherwise have been decreases in ESB charges?  If the Electricity Supply Board are in the business of maintaining capital at the moment which is surplus to requirements, might it not be wiser to use that in negotiating redundancies as there seems to be a common consensus among those who know something about Electricity Supply Board prices that there is considerable overmanning in the ESB?  This would produce a long term benefit to the consumer rather than keeping in existence, for want of redundancy capital, a work force which is surplus to requirements.</P>

      <P>In relation to the capital repayments from the ESB the Minister says that following completion of the Moneypoint power station, the board's borrowing requirements has been reduced and that in addition its cost base has improved because of favourable movements in interest and exchange rates.  Further on in relation to VAT the Minister used almost the same argument by saying that the benefit of falling oil prices and interest and favourable exchange movements meant that there was scope for a reduction of 5 per cent. If the Minister says that because of the board's improved position because of a favourable movement in interest and exchange rates they can therefore pay over £31 million, does he still think the favourable exchange rates and movements in interest rates will allow them to reduce the cost of electricity by 5 per cent?  The Minister cannot use the same argument for both things.  Does the agreement between the ESB and the Government mean that the Minister has asked them to borrow the £31 million to hand over to the Government, because they do not need to borrow money to build any more power stations since Moneypoint has been completed and because their borrowing requirement has been reduced?</P>

      <P>The Minister talked about the benefit of falling oil prices, interest rates and favourable exchange rate movements and indicated that, because of those, there is scope for a reduction of 5 per cent in electricity prices.  The falling oil prices did not arise today or yesterday and neither did the reduction in interest <Col N="431" /> and exchange rates, so why is it only now on budget day that we come to this 5 per cent reduction in electricity prices?  It is typical of the slight of hand approach of this Government to the budget.  Let us be clear about it.  This is not a situation of maintaining the price of electricity at the same figure.  The price of electricity should be 5 per cent less.  That is what the economics of the situation warrant, as the Minister concedes.  The reality is that electricity prices will be increased by 5 per cent.  That is what is happening here.  The price of electricity has been increased by 5 per cent to each and every householder, rich and poor.  People are dependent on electricity for heating, for warming their children's bottles, for cooking, for their basic needs.  Those who cannot now get fuel vouchers because of the Minister's cutbacks are in a very serious situation.</P>

The price of electricity should have been reduced by 5 per cent and the Minister has conceded this.  We are not talking about luxury matters here, but about basic needs in working class homes.  This is an across-the-board increase, irrespective of people's means.  Let the Minister not think that anybody is being codded by the hope that electricity will be the same price as last year.  That is the message that will come across to the public.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputies for their contributions.  On a point raised by Deputy Noonan, the harmonisation of VAT in the EC context cannot be separated from the harmonisation in excises.  As the Deputy and the House are aware, this matter is beginning to be the subject of discussion.  We shall have to negotiate our way through that between now and when full harmonisation is expected, by 1992.</P>
      <P>I wish to repeat, as the budgetary statement has made clear, that the imposition of VAT on the price of electricity is being offset by a countervailing price reduction in ESB charges.  No matter what Deputy Taylor says, this will mean that there will be no increase in electricity charges.  That is the only fact that is relevant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>There will be no increase this night on electricity charges. That is the position.  Electricity is the exception to heating and lighting fuels generally, such as turf, gas and central heating oils, which are liable to 10 eper cent VAT.  All the EC countries except the United Kingdom have VAT rates which are above 5 per cent and the recent EC proposals for tax harmonisation include the application of a VAT rate between 4 and 9 per cent on electricity. In so far as we are concerned at the moment with the 5 per cent VAT, with the exception of the United Kingdom, this is the lowest rate in the EC.  In Denmark there is a rate of 22 per cent. Deputy Taylor has made typical scare statement about the increase in the price of electricity by 5 per cent.  That is not the case and we categorically refute it. Others here and in other places have suggested that it is only a step away from VAT on food.  That issue does not arise&mdash;&mdash;</P>

There is the price of 5 per cent reduction in the cost countervailing the 5 per cent VAT, with a negative result for the domestic consumer but a very positive result for the commercial sector. This give them the opportunity to reclaim in full and get the full 5 per cent reduction.  The second point is that it <Col N="434" /> enables the ESB to repay loans outstanding to the Exchequer.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I am satisfied that trade missions are a cost effective way of marketing Irish products abroad.  Irish companies will not travel on a trade mission unless they consider that definite business opportunities might result.  While they get some assistance <Col N="52" /> from CTT the companies pay, on average, three quarters of all costs associated with the visit.  From post-visit analyses carried out by that body, I am satisfied that the business generated for Irish firms justifies the resources allocated by CTT to these activities.</P>
    <P>It will be noted that some trade missions take place in the context of meetings of joint commissions.  These are co-operation arrangements between ourselves and certain State trading countries.</P>

      <P>The <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>, published in October 1987, outlined a range of policy measures to achieve an enhanced industrial development performance and the rationale behind such measures.  Specifically in relation to industrial incentives the programme involves (a) an increased priority for the development of indigenous industry with a particular emphasis on the expansion and growth of selected Irish companies firmly rooted in the economy; (b) greater emphasis on State aid to achieve a significant shift in resources from the support of fixed asset investment to the upgrading of marketing, product development, R &amp; D and management expertise; (c) training grants, expenditure being reoriented towards equipping Irish companies with marketing, management, technological and commercial language skills; and (d) linking State aid more directly to employment so that disbursements will depend on the achievement of specific employment targets.</P>
      <P>Details of the total amounts of industrial grants paid in the years 1985 and 1986 are set out at Appendix 4A of my Department's Review of Industrial Performance 1986, copies of which are available in the Dáil Library.  Figures for 1987 will be contained in the annual reports of the relevant State agencies for that year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Reynolds) Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>International trading treaties or agreements are a function of the common commercial policy of the European Community.  The formulation of this policy is a competence conferred on the European Commission and executed by them.  All member states are, therefore, bound by any international trading treaty or agreement, to which the Community has acceded.  Accordingly, it is not possible for some member states not to accede to a trading treaty or agreement. Member states are not co-signatories in every case; in some cases signature on behalf of the Community as a whole is deemed sufficient.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is possible that the Deputy may be referring to the Co-ordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls (COCOM).  This arrangement is signed by those EC countries who are also members of NATO.  It includes the member countries of NATO, except Iceland and Japan.  Its purpose is to control exports of strategic materials and technology which are of military application or could be adapted to such use.  Because <Col N="56" /> of its militarily neutral status Ireland is not a member of COCOM.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>Significant success has already been achieved, as a result of the Government's fiscal and monetary policy, in improving the cost environment for industry which has led to lower interest and inflation rates, and a stable exchange rate.  Bank interest rates have declined by 5 percentage points in the <Col N="57" /> past 12 months while inflation has reduced from 3.9 per cent in 1986 to 3.2 per cent on average during 1987.  The moderate pay increases agreed under the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> will also contribute significantly to our industrial competitiveness.  As regards the industrial costs in respect of which I have a direct function, I made an order in July 1987 bringing about a reduction of 10p per gallon in the price of petrol and 5p in autodiesel.  Since then these prices have been monitored and adjustments made each month; petrol is now 23p per gallon cheaper that it was in early July 1987.</P>
      <P>As far as insurance is concerned, significant measures to tackle the problems of cost and availability are already in train.  These constitute an integral part of the Government's <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>.  Insurance industry representatives have given assurances that reductions in insurance premia will follow the introduction of an improved framework and I will ensure that they live up to their promises.</P>
      <P>The <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> imposes a requirement on State sponsored bodies, which provide utilities and services, to bring down, through greater efficiency and cost &mdash; containment measures, the high cost environment now affecting the competitiveness of our economy and the growth of employment. This is primarily a matter for the State bodies themselves and the relevant Ministers who have responsibility for those bodies.</P>
      <P>There were no increases in ESB, postal and telecommunications charges in 1987 and I expect a similar pattern in 1988.</P>
      <P>In general, however, developments affecting industrial costs will continue to be very closely monitored by me, with the assistance of the industrial costs monitoring group, and I can assure the Deputy that no effort will be spared in our determination to further improve the cost environment for industry.</P>

      <P>The information available to me indicates that heating oil (I presume the Deputy is referring to gas oil) is cheaper in the State than in Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>My inquiries reveal that the schedule price for a litre of heating oil is 21.33p Sterling &mdash; about 24p Irish &mdash; in Northern Ireland whereas it is less than 21p here.</P>
      <P>The price of gas oil in June 1987 immediately prior to my introducing control of petrol and autodiesel prices was 21.25p per litre compared with a current price of 20.92p per litre.  These figures show a reduction over this period rather than an increase as the Deputy suggests.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Reynolds) Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is referring to the non-payment of debts due to an Irish company in respect of a contract with a Nigerian buyer for the supply of fish which gave rise to claims under the export credit insurance scheme.  The total amount of debts involved is US$3.7 million. The non-payment of the debts has been largely due to the acute shortage of foreign exchange in Nigeria over the past few years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the reply to Parliamentary Question No. 17 of 7 April 1987, continuing efforts have been made by my Department, the Irish exporter and the Irish Embassy in Lagos to have the debts cleared by the Central Bank of Nigeria. Once cleared, promissory notes will be issued by the Bank which would allow for repayment of the debts over a period of time under a Nigerian debt rescheduling programme.  All other countries with trade debts in Nigeria are engaged in the same process.  The efforts to speed up the process included a visit to Lagos by officials of my Department in July 1987 and a further visit by an official of my Department, accompanied by the Irish exporter, in December, 1987.  These visits involved detailed meetings with the Nigerian Ministry of Finance, the Central Bank, the Nigerian buyer and local banks, and as a result the prospects of a recovery have been enhanced.  Specifically, papers relating to debts of US$864,000 have been matched and we are hopeful of obtaining promissory notes for this amount in the near future.  The prospects of matching papers relating to an amount of US$731,000 have improved and the Nigerian buyer is willing to discuss arrangements for the payment of <Col N="60" /> any outstanding unmatched amounts.  My Department is in almost weekly contact with the Irish Embassy in Lagos.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Deputy that my Department and the Irish Embassy in Lagos will continue to exert pressure on the appropriate authorities in Nigeria until a recovery has been made.</P>

The technology transfer programme, administered by the Industrial Development Authority, is one of the primary means of assisting that technological development.</P>

There is no direct correlation between technology transfer agreements and start-ups by foreign industry.  However, I am informed by the Industrial Development Authority that the number of such agreements signed and the number of foreign start ups for each of the years in question were as follows:</P>

    <P>The 1984 and 1985 figures include average premia for the Insurance Corporation of Ireland (under administration) which provided results for the 24 months period ended 31 December 1985.</P>
    <P>Gross written premiums increased by 12.3 per cent in 1985 over 1984; while in 1986 they increased by 7.6 per cent over the 1985 levels.  The increase in the net earned premium income of motor insurers over the period 1984 to 1986 was 24 per cent account being taken of the ICI data.</P>
    <P>In the main, increases in the numbers driving and increases in premium rates to meet the cost of claims gave rise to these increases.  Notwithstanding the premium increases motor insurers incurred underwriting losses in the order of £32 million, £23 million and £18 million in 1984, 1985 and 1986 respectively.</P>
    <P>As the cost of insurance is directly related to the level of claims occurring the important task is to reduce the number of accidents and the number and cost of claims.  Determined action is being taken by Government to bring about these reductions and is an integral part of the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i> Insurance industry representatives have given assurances that reductions in insurance premia including a better deal for young drivers will follow the introduction of an improved framework and I will ensure that they live up to their promises.</P>
    <P>There has already been a considerable slow down in the number and size of price increases notified to my Department. There are also signs of an easing of terms <Col N="67" /> and increased competition for motor risks.  One insurance company has recently introduced a special rate capping scheme which establishes absolute maximum premium levels for young motorists and I am hopeful that these encouraging developments will continue.</P>
    <P>The fact remains, however, that only when the number and cost of claims is reduced significantly in overall terms will it be possible for insurance companies to offer reductions in premium levels.  To do this it will be necessary, in addition to the action being taken by Government, for the motoring public generally, and young motorists in particular, to improve standards of driving and road safety.</P>

      <P>I would like to refer the Deputy to Section V of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> which details the Government's employment strategy. This section specifies areas where potential for increased employment has been identified and indicates that further such areas will be identified.</P>
      <P>Specifically, a sector by sector development strategy based on market research at home and abroad, our natural resources, the new advanced skills in our work-force, and the achievement of increased market share in selected sectors and markets is being undertaken. Specific and realistic job opportunities will be identified for each sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It will be clear to the Deputy that if these sectors of industry are to expand <Col N="68" /> and create employment to their full potential they will, because of the limitations of the home market, have to look to the development of export markets.</P>
    <P>As regards trading opportunities offering the greatest scope for increased exports, the countries of the EC and, in particular, the UK continue to offer the best opportunities.  The UK remains our most important market.  It is particularly so for indigenous industry which having won a share of the home market, can then take its first step in exporting to this adjacent market.  Of our other EC partners, Germany is the next largest export market and has been targeted by the Government for special attention because of its potential.  Other European markets which offer particular opportunity are France, Italy and Spain.  In so far as more distant markets are concerned, potential is seen in such areas as China, South East Asia, and Japan in addition to North America where CTT continue to work for increased exports.</P>
    <P>In developing export potential in all markets CTT provide comprehensive assistance to Irish exporters.  This includes arrangement of trade missions, attendance at trade fairs, inward buyer missions, provision of market analysis and a full range of support services to individual companies.</P>

      <Col N="71" /> With regard to rationalisation and amalgamation the Deputy will be aware that with effect from 1 January 1988 IIRS and NBST were, in effect, amalgamated to form Eolas, the Irish Science and Technology agency.  The anticipated reduced staffing numbers are shown above.</P>
    <P>Additionally, with a view to giving SFADCo a more integrated and creative role in contributing to national recovery, responsibility for the promotion and development of medium and large scale industry in the mid West Region was transferred to it from the IDA on 1 January 1988.</P>
    <P>Furthermore on 2 October 1987 NET entered into a joint venture with Imperial Chemical Industries plc.  The manufacturing activities of NET and those of ICI's Belfast subsidiary, Richardson Fertilizers Ltd., were amalgamated into one entity &mdash; Irish Fertilizers Industries Ltd., while NET itself was restructured into a holding company.  As a commercial undertaking employment numbers in NET/IFI, and similarly in Irish Steel, will have to reflect their commercial operation. It is not possible therefore to estimate the staffing levels in these commercial bodies at end-1988.</P>
    <P>The end-1988 staffing levels reflect the rationalisation and amalgamation proposals which I have detailed together with the reductions in numbers resulting from the Government's voluntary redundancy package.</P>
    <P>While I have no proposals for further rationalisation or amalgamation in these areas at this time, this is a question which is kept under continued review to ensure the optimum return from Exchequer funding.</P>

      <P>The corporation's annual report for 1986, which was laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas on 1 September 1987 gave an account of its activities, staffing and general performance to 14 May 1987. As I have no function in relation to the day-to-day operations of the corporation it would not be appropriate for me to comment further on the work of NADCORP in advance of the publication of its Annual Report for 1987. This is required to be made to me not later than 30 June, 1988.</P>
      <P>In the Government's <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> it is indicated that NADCORP will continue an active, innovative and developmental role in the provision of investment capital to indigenous enterprises and will actively seek out projects of national and strategic importance.  I do not have any other plans for the corporation at this time.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 56 and 60 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In reply to a number of parliamentary questions on this general subject on 18 November 1987, the Government's overall strategy for employment creation and, in particular, the strategy for industrial development and associated employment <Col N="73" /> generation as set out in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> was outlined.</P>
    <P>The industrial development agencies under the aegis of my Department are putting in place job targets for 1988 based on the overall target for manufacturing in the programme.  Moreover they have reorganised their structures and personnel to line up with the programme's strategies and targets.  I shall be monitoring progress in these areas very closely.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that implementation of the various policy initiatives, together with continued improvement of the industrial environment, constitute the best strategy to achieve the objectives set.</P>
    <P>More generally, the targets set in the programme are being monitored by the programme's review and monitoring committee under the chairmanship of the Department of the Taoiseach and on which my Department is represented.</P>

      <P>The object of insurance is to put the insured in the same financial position after a loss as he was immediately before that loss.  Accordingly, claims are paid on the basis of the real value of a vehicle as opposed to any higher declared value.  Otherwise, a claimant could have an incentive to <Col N="74" /> create a loss which would put him in a better position after the event than before it.</P>
      <P>It is the responsibility of the policyholder to ensure that his vehicle is valued at its current market value because at the end of the day there is nothing to be gained from over-insurance.</P>

      <P>The current position regarding the siting of the Community Trade Marks Office (CTMO) is as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="78" /> Nine member states have indicated their interest in offering a site for the office and a formal Commission proposal on the location of the CTMO is awaited. Since the choice of location is still open, Ireland is determined to pursue its candidacy vigorously.</P>
    <P>Ireland officially submitted its candidacy for the location of the CTMO in October 1983, and in 1986 submitted an incentive package for Dublin to become the seat of the office.  This incentive package was further enhanced by a Government decision of September 1987 offering to locate the office at the Customs House Docks site, thus making available the statutory incentives which apply at the site.</P>
    <P>The Government have made it clear to our partners in the Community and to the Commission that they regard Dublin as a very suitable location for the Trade Marks Office.  We have argued <i>inter alia</i> that considerable importance should be attached to the peripheral regions in decisions on the location of any new Community institution, and that undue emphasis on the financial incentives offered by candidates will inevitably favour the richer member states.</P>

The estimates in the reply of 12 May 1987 of yield from payments for legal services and payments arising from the public capital programme were derived from the expected global public authority expenditure on these items.  To determine the amount of tax paid under <Col N="90" /> these and other headings in respect of each professional category would require an individual examination of all the relevant returns furnished in 1987 by accountable persons.  Such an examination could be carried out only at disproportionate cost.</P>

    <P>(1)  The information relating to Schedule D assessments is comprehensive.  However, some of the figures are subject to revision as they are based on assessments under appeal.</P>
    <P>(2)  The information relating to employees from whose income tax was deducted under Pay As You Earn is necessarily somewhat restricted in coverage because all end of year returns were not capable of being processed at the time the information in the tables was being compiled.</P>
    <P>(3)  <i>Total Income</i> is the total income of taxpayers from all sources as estimated in accordance with the provisions of the Income Tax Acts.  It such items as capital allowances, interest paid in full, losses brought forward, allowable expenses and superannuation contributions.</P>

Finds include a well preserved bronze ringed pin, a bronze needle, a bone pin, glass beads, a stone bead, an iron knife and clasp, a disc, cut antler, pottery and many animal bones. The excavation was started on 5 October 1987 and was completed on 11 December at a cost of £20,000.  Further minor excavation may be required in advance of the construction of the Garda station.  Under the contract terms, the archaeologist <Col N="104" /> must furnish a summary report to the Commissioners of Public Works within 12 weeks of the completion of the excavation work and agree on a date for the presentation of a definitive report to them.  While it is not obligatory, reports are often published, usually as a paper in an archaeological journal, at a later date.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. MacSharry)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Commissions of Public Works have over 200 National Monuments in their guardianship.  In recent years, it has been the practice not to accept guardianship without an accompanying public access route but there are many cases extending back to the last century where this aspect was not considered.  Cases still arise from time to time where the Commissioners find it necessary to make Guardianship Orders and where no clearly defined rights of access exist.  In many guardianship cases there could well be public rights of way established by the use over a period of time, but the Commissioners would not necessarily be aware of these.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Complaints are received from time to time from members of the public who have had their access to monuments impeded and the Commissioners endeavour to resolve these problems.  They are aware of only four cases, namely Dromineen Castle, County Cork, Killeen Church, County Meath, Kiltiernan Dolmen, County Dublin and Rathcoffey <Col N="105" /> Castle, County Kildare, where landowners are currently preventing the public from gaining access to monuments in guardianship.  Expenditure on these monuments in the period 1982-87 amounted to £1,200.</P>
    <P>The Commissioners must of course carry out their statutory duty in relation to monuments in their care whether or not the public has a right of access.</P>
    <P>I would like the general public to have defined and established routes of access to all National Monuments.  The National Monuments (Amendment) Act, 1987, empowers the Commissioners to compulsorily acquire such routes.  Obviously they would use their power judiciously and within the financial resources available.</P>

I am also informed that the deceased person was in good form during the search and made no complaints of any nature to the gardaí.  She subsequently spoke to a number of neighbours and in one conversation referred to the search but made no complaint about it.</P>

    <P>On the day after the search, the person concerned was found by her daughter-in-law, dead in her bed.  Ar dheis Dé go <Col N="108" /> raibh a h-anam.

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Collins) Gerard Collins">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>The statistical information sought by the Deputy is set out in the following statement. The mandatory sentence for capital murder is death and, accordingly, there are no prisoners serving life sentences for capital offences.  I take it the Deputy has in mind offenders who were sentenced to death and subsequently had their sentences commuted to 40 years imprisonment.  Details in relation to this group of offenders are shown separately in the statement.</P>
      <P>It is not the practice to give release dates to offenders significantly in advance of actual release.</P>
      <P>The cases of offenders serving life sentences are kept under review in the context of factors such as the circumstances of the offence, length of sentence served, behaviour while in custody and the previous record of the offender.  An overriding concern in assessing suitability for release must be the risk to the community which could be posed by a release.  In suitable cases proposals &mdash; which can include occasional periods of temporary release &mdash; are drawn up with the aim of final release.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that each case must be considered on its merits and that the length of sentence served can vary significantly from case to case.  The details given in respect of offenders serving life sentences at present include a number of offenders where successive attempts to reintegrate them into the community have failed.</P>
      <P>1.  Offenders serving life sentences released during 1984-1987</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Begley</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Food if he has satisfied himself with the operation of the milk super-levy system having regard to the fact that some co-operatives in the north and west of the country appear to be millions of gallons of milk under quota while southern farmers and co-operatives <Col N="118" /> are substantially over quota; and if the position will be worsened further by the imposition of a compulsory cut of 1 per cent on farmers in poorer counties like Kerry under the voluntary cessation scheme while refusing to allow farmers into the scheme in other parts of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. O'Kennedy) Michael O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied with the operation of the super-levy system.</P>
      <P>The arrangements for the second stage of the milk cessation scheme were announced by me on 20 May last following consultation by my Department with the farming and co-operative organisations. These arrangements were in accordance with the views of the organisations that disproportionate losses of quota in any area of the country should be avoided.  In announcing the details I fixed a maximum limit of 3.25 per cent reduction in quota between the two stages of the scheme for each co-op or dairy.  I also emphasised in my announcement &mdash; and subsequently in Press advertisements &mdash; that the way to avoid compulsory quota cuts taking place was for co-ops and dairies to encourage as many of their producers as possible who were ceasing milk production or were delivering below their quota levels to join the scheme.  Unfortunately this did not happen in sufficient numbers in some co-op areas in the south of the country.</P>
      <P>I consider that the arrangements made were the fairest and most equitable.  If applicants for the scheme had been selected on a purely voluntary basis then some co-ops in the west and north east would have suffered quota losses of up to 6 per cent.  I would also point out to the Deputy that the Co-ops, such as those in Kerry, in which compulsory cuts are to be imposed will suffer lesser overall quota reductions than those from whom the reduction has been achieved on a voluntary basis.  Furthermore producers who suffer these compulsory cuts will receive compensation at the rate of 22.97 pence per gallon over seven years, i.e. the same rate as that payable to the farmers who joined the cessation scheme.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 141 and 142 together.</P>
      <P>I assume that the first question raised by the Deputy relates to those who left the live register arising from the national Jobsearch programme.  The position is that since the introduction of the programme in April 1987 up to week ending 1 January 1988, and excluding those who left the register having secured employment or placements on Manpower schemes or AnCo mainline training courses under the programme a total of 14,675 left the live register arising from the Jobsearch programme.  This figure can be broken down to a total of 12,724 who left the register voluntarily and 1,951 who had their cases reviewed resulting in disallowances under the Social Welfare Acts.  Almost three-quarters of this total of 14,675 were still off the register in week ended 1 January, 1988.  I have no information as to why those who left the register voluntarily did so.  The vast majority of those called for interview were long term on the register.  Those who left voluntarily did so when offered a chance of a job, a place on a scheme or a training course.</P>
      <P>The Jobsearch programme figures are compiled on a weekly and not on a monthly basis.  As no statistics are compiled in my Department about those on the live register who emigrate or die no adjustment of the type referred to by the Deputy is made in the figures.</P>

A deciding officer decided that he was not therefore entitled to invalidity pension.</P>

    <P>The person concerned was dissatisfied with this decision and was therefore referred for further examination by a different medical referee which took place on 27 November 1987.

    <P>*Social Welfare recipients consist of all those in receipt of a social welfare payment excluding child benefit.</P>
    <P>&dagger;Social Welfare dependants consist of child and adult dependants.  Since the full implementation of equal treatment in November 1986, child dependant allowances are payable at half rate to each of a married couple where both are in receipt of a payment or to a married person whose spouse is earning over £50 a week.  This results in the former case in a double counting of child dependants which it is not possible to estimate.  At September 1987 there were in total approximately 84,000 half rate allowances in payment.</P>

      <P>The Department's office in Maynooth is run by a branch manager who provides office accommodation and staffing under contract.</P>
      <P>The growth in the number of unemployed claimants has undoubtedly placed considerable pressure on both the accommodation and the staff of all the Department's local offices.  While there are no plans at present to upgrade Maynooth employment office to a full employment exchange, the question of providing an employment exchange in the Lucan-Leixlip area is being examined.</P>
      <P>The branch manager is in the process of acquiring alternative accommodation for the branch office, which will enable the level of service to be improved.</P>
      <P>The question of arranging for the provision of full time Manpower service facilities in Maynooth is a matter for An FÁS.  It is accepted that the provision of information on such facilities would enhance the service available to social welfare clients and the objective is to arrange for this in future where it is feasible.</P>

      <P>Entitlement to unemployment <Col N="127" /> assistance is dependent on a claimant being the holder of a qualification certificate and to obtain such a certificate a claimant must satisfy certain conditions including an assessment of means.</P>
      <P>The person concerned claimed unemployment assistance on 22 September 1987 and his papers were referred to a social welfare officer for investigation.

      <P>The family income supplement scheme is designed to provide cash support for employees with families who are on low earnings.  In many cases workers may be worse off or only marginally better off than if they were claiming disability or unemployment benefit and the scheme is intended to redress this situation. These considerations do not apply in the case of self-employed persons who are not covered for these social insurance benefits and for that reason they are not included in the scheme.  It is <Col N="128" /> not proposed to alter the existing arrangements.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he will outline the grounds on which the cost of a mortgage was excluded from relevant means in assessing a means test against a person in receipt of unemployment assistance with a working spouse; and if he will consider re-introducing allowance for mortgage or rent in view of the hardship that is being caused by this severe ruling on means test.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The legislative basis for the assessment of means for unemployment assistance purposes is contained in section 146 of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1981, as amended by section 13 of the Social Welfare (No. 2) Act, 1985, which provided for equal treatment for men and women in matters of social security.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="129" /> Prior to the implementation of the equal treatment provisions allowance was made for rent or mortgage payments where the wife of an unemployment assistance claimant was employed under a contract of service.  The allowance, which was deducted from the net earnings of the claimant's wife, was made as a household expense when assessing the value to the husband as &ldquo;head of the household&rdquo; of his wife's income from employment.</P>
    <P>The Act of 1985 provided for the deletion of the reference to the &ldquo;head of the household&rdquo; because the concept was incompatible with the principle of equal treatment.  This provision came into effect in November 1986.  The amended legislation provides that the value to the household of all income earned by the claimant's spouse must be assessed as means.  As rent and mortgage payments are of value to the household, they are not disregarded in assessing the spouse's income as means.  Allowance is made, however, in respect of employment related expenses incurred by a spouse.</P>
    <P>Transitional arrangements made for certain persons who were adversely affected by the equal treatment provisions contain provision for the continuation, until the end of the current claim, of allowances made in respect of rent or mortgage payments where these had been in operation in November 1986.</P>
    <P>It is not proposed to amend the legislation to provide for allowances in respect of rent or mortgage payments in assessing a spouses's income as means for unemployment assistance purposes.  However, anyone who is unable to meet their mortgage or rent payments can claim a supplement under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.  Application for this supplement may be made to the community welfare officer at the local health centre.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">

      <P>Following investigation the unemployment assistance claim of the person concerned was disallowed on the grounds that, by failing to furnish details of his means, he failed to show that his means did not exceed the statutory limit. In this regard, the person concerned failed to provide the required verified evidence of his wife's income.</P>
      <P>He appealed against the disallowance on 1 December 1987 and his papers were returned to the social welfare officer to afford him a further opportunity to cooperate in the investigation of his means.</P>
      <P>This investigation will be completed as soon as possible and his case will then be submitted to an appeals officer for determination at the earliest available opportunity.</P>

      <P>The absenteeism control programme operated by the Irish Productivity Centre in 1986 was primarily focused on the creation of an awareness in both management and workers of the need for absenteeism controls and the social and economic effects of absenteeism.</P>
      <P>I understand that a number of companies and organisations in the public and private sectors have introduced absenteeism control programmes.  However, the resources are not available to obtain full statistical information on reductions in absenteeism arising from the Irish Productivity Centre programme.</P>

Instead, approval was obtained for the creation of a post of Special Adviser in the Office of the Minister. When the officer appointed to this post resigned, there was no question of a post of economic adviser in the Department being filled for the simple reason that such a post did not exist on the Department's staffing complement.  I have not exercised my right to have an economic adviser appointed to my Office.</P>

      <P>I circulate a tabular statement showing Ireland's trade with Portugal for each of the years 1980-1986 and for the first 11 months of 1987, the latest date for which figures are available.</P>
      <P>The table shows that Ireland's exports to Portugal have increased from £10.4 million in 1980 to £29.2 million in the period January to November 1987.  As a consequence our trade deficit has been reducing from a peak of £19.6 million in 1985 to £13.7 million in 1986 and to £9 million in first 11 months of last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The positive trend in our trade balance is due, to a large degree, to Portugal's accession to the European Economic Community on 1 January 1986.  CTT, with a trade consultant in Lisbon, are now in a position to provide a comprehensive <Col N="142" /> range of support services for Irish exporters.</P>
    <P>In 1988 Ireland will, for the first time, have a national stand at the Alimentaria Food and Drink Exhibition which will take place in Barcelona from 4-9 March 1988.  This Spanish Exhibition attracts key importers and buyers from Spain and Portugal and CTT intend conducting an extensive pre-Fair canvass in both countries to advertise and promote interest in the Irish stand.</P>
    <P>In October 1988 CTT have scheduled Portugal in its buyer airlift programme for the first time.  This will involve flying selected Portuguese buyers to Ireland to meet selected Irish exporters.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the level of activities proposed by CTT for Portugal in 1988 will maintain the recent improvement in our balance of trade with that country.</P>

      <P>In the case of kerosene and gas diesel oil the wholesale prices listed are in fact the prices at which these products are generally available.</P>
      <P>No monitoring has been carried out on the price of kerosene since the National Prices Commission was disbanded in January 1986 thus the wholesale price is not readily available for 1986 and 1987.  The price of kerosene is not subject to the addition of a Whitegate element.</P>

      <P>I understand that it is not envisaged that there will be any transfer of staff from the Industrial Development Authority to the Shannon Free Airport Development Company Ltd. arising from the Government decision referred to by the Deputy.  The total number of staff in both of the bodies will, in fact, be reduced over the level prevailing in 1987, the reduction being proportionately greater in the case of the IDA.</P>

The Registrar of Friendly Societies appointed two inspectors in December 1984 to examine and report on the affairs of the society.  In June 1985 the High Court appointed a liquidator to the society.

When LPG was the subject of detailed price control (i.e. up to March 1985) price was reviewed on the basis of actual costs for the bottled gas companies. The &ldquo;imported price CIF&rdquo; was not an element in the decision process and therefore figures for this category are not readily available to my Department.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if his attention has been drawn to the strong criticism of the manipulability value and veracity of published company accounts outlined in reports (details supplied); if he favours the proposal that assets owned by companies should be valued on the basis of their current actual value or earning capacity to the company owning them rather than at the price at which they were bought; his views on whether inadequate information on the true state of the affairs of companies contributed to the recent economically destabilising collapse in share prices; and if he intends to hold discussions with the Stock Exchange, the accountancy profession, the Revenue Commissioners and other appropriate representative bodies with a view to devising and enforcing through the Companies Registration Office, a <Col N="153" /> more accurate system of company accounting.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Reynolds) Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to the academic study of accounting principles carried out in the UK and reported recently in the financial press.</P>
      <P>I should say at the outset that there is nothing in existing legislation to prevent assets being valued on a current value basis.  Indeed, Part III of the Schedule to the Companies (Amendment) Act, 1986, specifically provides that the assets of a company may be included in the balance sheet at their current cost.</P>
      <P>Having said that, I am not aware that there is, or is likely to be, any widespread acceptance of the far-reaching suggestions in the study referred to by the Deputy.  The study was an attempt establish a theoretical framework for accounting, relying on basic economic principles.  I understand that many of the suggestions have been the subject of criticism since they were published.</P>
      <P>For example, the proposal in the study that assets should be valued on the basis of &ldquo;earning capacity&rdquo; or &ldquo;value to the owner&rdquo; would have to be approached with considerable caution.  The adoption of such a procedure would introduce a considerable measure of subjectivity into accounts and would mean that valuations would depend on the circumstances of each particular company.  The likely effect of this would be to reduce, rather than increase, the value of company accounts by making it more difficult to compare them with those of other companies. The historical cost convention, on the other hand, whatever its faults, maintains a basic element of objectivity in valuations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that various attempts have been made previously to propose new asset valuation principles but none has proved satisfactory.  The most substantial recent attempt, Statement of Standard Accounting Practice 16 (SSAP 16), was withdrawn by the accounting profession in June 1985 <Col N="154" /> because of its poor acceptability, its complexities and because of its questionable relevance in a period of low inflation. There is no evidence yet to indicate that the proposals in the recent study, which are still at the level of theory rather than practical suggestions, will prove to be either satisfactory or widely acceptable.</P>
    <P>On the question of whether inadequate information on companies' affairs contributed to the recent collapse in share prices, I am not aware of any widespread or significant evidence to suggest that such is the case.  Indeed, such evidence as there is seems to suggest that the recent decline in share values was triggered by factors which had little to do with the valuation of the assets of quoted companies, whether here, in the United States or elsewhere.</P>
    <P>I have no plans at present to engage in discussions on the question of changing company accounting procedures.  I will, however, be keeping up to date with developments in this area.</P>

    <P>Following consultation with the local authorities concerned and representatives of the building industry, my Department shared their view that certain important aspects of design-construct contracts are not suitable for road works.

      <P>Provision has been made in the <Col N="182" /> 1988 road grant allocations for expenditure this year on 22 major road schemes which, when completed, will form part of the network of national primary routes. Details of these schemes, in respect of which grant allocations totalling £51 million have been notified for this year, are set out in the following table.</P>
      <P>Details of direct employment on individual schemes are not available in my Department.  It is estimated, however, that the direct employment content of this expenditure will be about 1,200 man-year-jobs, apart from the spin-off employment.  A further £16 million has been allocated this year in respect of other major road projects.</P>
      <P>Policy regarding the carrying out of future major schemes by contract or direct labour will be set out in the blueprint for road development which I intend to publish within the next few months.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="186" /> The former has already been achieved in Ireland, with effect from 1 April 1986, by virtue of the European Communities (Lead Content of Petrol) Regulations, 1985 (S.I. No. 378 of 1985).  Unleaded petrol was introduced on the Irish market in October, 1986 and is regulated by the European Communities (Lead Content of Petrol) Regulations, 1986 (S.I. No. 374 of 1986).  Arrangements to promote unleaded petrol are proceeding in line with the Directive's timescale.</P>

    <P>The foregoing figures relate to tenders for schemes of more than five houses. These tender prices do not include land acquisition costs or miscellaneous costs <Col N="191" /> and may not include the cost of site development which is sometimes carried out under a separate contract.</P>
    <P>The acceptance of tenders for schemes of five houses and less does not require my specific sanction where the housing authority has an approved unit cost and the cost of the particular scheme can be met from the authority's capital allocation.</P>
    <P>With regard to 1988 the position is that each housing authority has been asked to submit its claim for a capital allocation for its housing construction programme. Pending receipt and examination of these claims it is not possible to indicate what funds will be made available to the individual authorities to finance their housing programmes and consequently what schemes may be approved.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case referred to by the Deputy, <Col N="195" /> the company by whom the person concerned was employed is the subject of a High Court action brought by the Liquidator of a company by whom he was previously employed.  The person concerned has submitted a Redundancy Certificate to my Department but the Liquidator disputes the validity of the Certificate and has advised my Department that, if it acts on the Certificate, he will not allow the Department's claim for recovery of the lump-sum payment in the winding-up process.</P>

      <P>As the information sought by the Deputies is concerned with day-to-day activities of FÁS, I would suggest that they seek this information direct from FÁS.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The rationale behind the establishment of non-commercial State-sponsored bodies such as FÁS to carry out executive functions of Government is to provide the optimum degree of flexibility and freedom and to relieve Ministers of responsibility for the decisions which the <Col N="197" /> boards and staff of the bodies take in the course of day-to-day administration of their responsibilities.</P>
    <P>The principal functions of FÁS are set out in the Labour Services Act, 1987.  I am answerable to the Dáil for the overall policy of FÁS including the legislation under which it operates and also for the Exchequer allocations provided to it. However, day-to-day operations of FÁS are a matter for its board, and I am not answerable to these specifics.  Section 12(5) of the 1987 Act relieves FÁS of the obligation of furnishing me with information on day-to-day activities.</P>

      <P>My Department has agreed to provide the capital funds to equip the psychiatric unit in Tralee on condition that the running costs (pay and non-pay) are transferred from St. Finan's Hospital, Killarney.  This unit would replace the 50 bed Admission Unit in St. Finan's Hospital.  It was agreed at a meeting in May 1987 that the Southern Health Board would re-examine the requirements to open the unit in Tralee and submit a revised proposal to the Department. However, this information was not submitted until recently and the board has informed my Department that in view of their personnel and budgetary resources at St. Finan's Hospital and Tralee General Hospital it is not possible to open the new unit.  I do not accept this view and I have asked my Department to pursue this matter further with the Southern Health Board.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 266 and 267 together.  The bed provision at Roscommon County Hospital in 1987 was 30 psychiatric beds and 70 general acute beds.  This provision is consistent with my Department's policy regarding the provision of general acute beds in the Western Health Board area.</P>

      <P>The Health Research Board compiles the information requested by the Deputy. The latest figures published by the Health Research Board are for 1984 and I have outlined the number of admissions and admission rates to Irish psychiatric hospitals and units for the treatment of schizophrenia for 1982, 1983 and 1984 in the following tables.  The Health Research Board determined the 1982 admission rates by using the 1979 Census of Population and the 1983 and 1984 admission rates by using the 1981 Census of Population.</P>

While it is intended that applications for early retirement should receive favourable consideration, the board will have to have regard to the provision of adequate services and will retain the right to refuse applications from key personnel.

      <P>The various considerations given in recent years to the acute hospital situation in Limerick reflect the fact that the maintenance of three separate hospitals in the city could not be justified on medical or economic grounds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="215" /> This issue was again addressed in the context of the review of acute hospital services which I initiated in May 1987.  In June 1987 the review group met with the boards of management in St. John's and Barrington's Hospitals and with the management of the Mid-Western Health Board.  In view of the fact that Barrington's and St. John's Hospitals are only about 400 yards apart and provide broadly similar services, one of the issues explored at these meetings was the desirability of concentrating the acute work done by St. John's and Barrington's Hospitals on the one site with a reduced bed complement of about 100 beds.</P>
    <P>Further meetings were held in Limerick in August 1987 at which the rationalisation of the services provided by the two voluntary hospitals on to one site was proposed.  Subsequently both hospitals put forward detailed submissions as to why each of them should be the hospital to be retained.  Significantly, neither submission suggested that both hospitals should be retained.</P>
    <P>Following these meetings, my Department obtained an architectural report on both hospitals.  A full review of the situation in relation to both hospitals was then carried out in my Department.  The outcome of the meetings which were held in June and August, the contents of the architectural report and other material already available in the Department were thoroughly analysed.  The choice as to which hospital was to be retained as the voluntary hospital in Limerick was made with great care and consideration.  I decided in favour of St. John's because:</P>
    <P>&mdash;it is a more spacious site;</P>
    <P>&mdash;it is a more spacious building which already has a capacity of 120 beds as opposed to 90 at Barrington's;</P>
    <P>&mdash;it provides better potential for developing further patient services;</P>
    <P>&mdash;the hospital building and services are on balance superior to those in Barrington's.</P>
    <P>Following from this decision it is clear that improvements are required to the accident and emergency facilities at both <Col N="216" /> St. John's and the Regional Hospital to fill the void which will be created on the closure of the casualty unit at Barrington's. These improvements are being put in hands immediately and will cost about £400,000.  There was in any event a real need to up-grade the existing accident and emergency facilities at Barrington's and proposals costing about £1.3 million had been put forward by the hospital.</P>
    <P>Due to an unfortunate combination of unexpected deaths and consultants reaching retirement age it would have been necessary to replace at least three consultants at Barrington's Hospital this year.  Discussions are now being held with St. John's Hospital and the Mid-Western Health Board to determine how best these vacancies at consultant level can be filled and deployed, together with the two remaining consultants at Barrington's, to provide hospital services in the Limerick area to maximum effect.</P>
    <P>When these improvements are completed in Limerick the people of the area will have two hospitals with the capacity to provide the range and quality of services necessary to meet their needs.</P>

      <P>106.  (1)  Teachers whose school work does not reach a satisfactory standard may have recognition withdrawn from them or be dealt with otherwise as the Minister may determine.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 291, 292 and 330 together.</P>
      <P>I would refer the Deputies to the answer which I gave on 1 December 1987 to a question regarding the construction of a new national school at Frenchpark, County Roscommon.  The consultations entered into with the school authorities have not yet been concluded.  My Department's Primary Buildings Branch wrote on 14 January 1988 to the chairman of the school's board of management setting out in considerable detail the range of options which are available to the school and the level of grant assistance which would be forthcoming from my Department towards the cost of the provision of essential classroom accommodation.  A reply to this letter is awaited.</P>
      <P>It is not the practice of my Department to disclose the financial details of national school building or improvement projects which are or have been the subject of grant applications, such information in individual cases being considered confidential as between my Department and the school authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The existing permanent building at Frenchpark national school was erected in 1951-52.  My Department does not have records of amounts expended on the care and maintenance of the building since its erection, as such matters are the responsibility of the school authorities at local level and are financed indirectly through the capitation grant towards operating costs of national schools.  A number of factors and not simply the poor condition of the existing building gave rise to the school's application for a grant for the replacement of the existing school, including the fact that enrolments at the school had outgrown the original <Col N="225" /> two classrooms, and that it would not have been economically sound to extend the building.</P>
    <P>Deputy Naughten's question regarding receipt and approval of plans for a new national school is understood to refer to recent submissions by the school authorities' architect, and the position at present is that my Department has yet to receive definite proposals in the context of the present discussions.</P>

    <P>The Minister for Education desires me to refer to the graded allowances payable to principal and vice-principal teachers and to other teachers in posts of responsibility in national schools in accordance with the recommendations of the Ryan Tribunal.  The agreement arrived at in this connection included the recommendation that payment of the allowance be contingent on specific responsibilities being assigned to and satisfactorily carried out by, the teacher.</P>
    <P>The matter of these responsibilities has been the subject of discussions between the Department, the managerial associations and the Irish National Teachers' Organisation.  As a result of these discussions, agreement has been reached on a list of duties and responsibilities of principal teachers and teachers in charge in national schools.  A copy of this list is enclosed.  Additional copies may be obtained from the Department where required.</P>

    <P Just="Center">RESPONSIBILITIES AND DUTIES OF PRINCIPAL TEACHERS AND TEACHERS IN CHARGE OF NATIONAL SCHOOLS</P>
    <P Just="Center">Section A</P>
    <P>1.  The Manager of a national school is charged with the direct government of the school, the appointment of the teachers and, subject to the Minister's approval, their removal and the conducting of the necessary correspondence (Rule 15 (1)).</P>
    <P>2.  Subject to the authority of the Manager, the principal teacher is responsible (in addition to teaching duties which may vary according to the size of the school &mdash; and which may be determined by the Minister either generally or in relation to any particular school but from which the teacher can, in no case, be completely relieved) for the discipline of the school generally, the control of other members of the teaching staff, including the co-ordination and effective supervision of their work, the organisation of the school, the keeping of the records of attendance, the promotion of pupils, the time-table arrangements and their observance, the books used by the pupils, the arrangements in connection with the Free Books Scheme for necessitous children, and all other matters connected with the school arrangements in each division.  (Rule 123 (4)).</P>
    <P>3.  The authority of the principal teacher for the organisation and conduct of the school derives from the authority of the Manager.

      <P>The Deputy is understood to refer to the school officially known as Laragh No. 2 national school, Kingscourt, County Cavan.  My Department is prepared in principle to grant-aid the replacement of the existing unsatisfactory accommodation at this school and tenders had been invited for a proposed three classroom new building. Because, however, of the pressure on the capital funds available to my Department for the national schools building programme, I am not at present in a position to authorise the placing of a contract for the project, nor am I in a position at this stage to say when the necessary authorisation may issue.</P>

      <P>The gross saving of £4.13 million, which represents the difference between the level of expenditure provided for and the actual expenditure, amounts to a variation of only 0.35 per cent.</P>

(iv) It is intended that the trustees will be as specified in the standard deed of trust for community schools.  (v) Due to Meath County Council's decision to route the Ashbourne by-pass through part of the school site the implications of the need to restrict the site are still under consideration in my Department.  However, the rate at which both projects may proceed will depend on the availability of capital resources and my Department's other commitments and priorities.</P>

      <P>A senior officer of my Department recently met the acting chairman of the school's board of management, and arising out of the discussions which took place it is the intention to put a set of modified plans to the school authorities for their consideration.  These will take into account the fall in enrolments at the school since the original building project was first proposed and the necessity for economy in the provision of the accommodation now required.  The question of interim improvements to the present structure will not now arise.  I am making arrangements to have the Deputy informed of developments in due course.</P>

      <P>I would refer the Deputy to the reply which I gave to a question on 3 December 1987 regarding the building project for Currabaha national school, County Waterford.</P>
      <P>The school authorities have since submitted an alternative scheme for my Department's consideration.  This was found to be unacceptable and it will be necessary to discuss a revision thereof with the authorities.  The question of sanctioning an alternative scheme does not accordingly arise at the present juncture.</P>

      <P>I appreciate, and sympathise with, the many difficulties being experienced by the people living in Jobstown.  However, my prime function is to provide adequately for the educational needs of the area at all levels in the most economical way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The original decision to provide a community college in Jobstown was taken on the basis of all available information in relation to population growth, house <Col N="252" /> building programmes etc.  However, a variety of factors have combined to alter the picture, with the result that the demand for post primary pupil accommodation will in the future be significantly less than was originally anticipated.  Consequently the building of Jobstown community college, which would result in an excess of accommodation in the area, will not now be going ahead.</P>
    <P>No decision has been taken to amalgamate Brookfield community school and Jobstown community college.</P>

      <P>The booklet <i>Constitution of Boards and Rules of Procedure</i> sets out the procedures by which boards of management of national schools must operate and defines the term manager as the person or body of persons nominated by the patron and recognised as manager by the Minister.  In the vast majority of these schools, the function of management is carried out by a board of management consisting of a chairperson and nominees of the patron, members elected by <Col N="253" /> parents and representatives of the teaching staff.</P>
      <P>If the Deputy's question relates to the functions of a school board of management as a collective body <i>vis-á-vis</i> the functions applicable to the chairperson as an individual, the rules of procedure indicate the particular duties of the chairperson but also state that &ldquo;the Board may authorise the chairperson and/or another member in respect of a particular function or functions to act on its behalf for a specified period of time&rdquo;.</P>
