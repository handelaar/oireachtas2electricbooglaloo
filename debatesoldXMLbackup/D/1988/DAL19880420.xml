      <P>Before proceeding with the Order of Business this morning I feel that Members would wish very much to join with me in extending a most warm and cordial welcome to the members of the Australian parliamentary delegation, the first Australian parliamentary delegation to visit Ireland, who are happily with us this morning, led by the Deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives, Mr. Leo Boyse McLeay.  On behalf of Members of this House I offer them our warmest congratulations on the great occasion of their bicentenary and trust they will have a very pleasant and fruitful stay with us.

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> In the autumn of last year the Minister for the Environment announced, with a certain amount of fanfare, that legislation was being introduced to allow building societies to get involved in banking activities. Subsequently, the Taoiseach committed himself and his Government to introducing two Bills, one along the lines announced by the Minister for the Environment and the other to allow the Central Bank to control these activities.</P>

I understand from newspaper reports this morning of a reply the Taoiseach made yesterday that these Bills are certainly not before the House and are not in the course of preparation. Can the Taoiseach bring us up to date, against the background of the reply he gave yesterday to Deputy O'Keeffe?  Are we not now going to have this legislation? Are we going to have it in this session or what is the position?</P>

    <Title>Finance Bill, 1988: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>There are four remaining aspects of the Finance Bill on which I want to comment briefly this morning: first, the absence from the Minister's speech of any elaboration on section 54, the scheme of support for disabled drivers; second, the proposed £10 cash card levy; third, the tax amnesty; and fourth, the once-off percentage levy on pension funds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First, I will deal with the position of disabled drivers.  In Dáil Éireann on 27 January last, at column 403 of the Official Report, the Taoiseach, when speaking of <Col N="1490" /> the existing scheme of support for disabled drivers, said:</P>
    <P>I will be very determined to ensure that the change in the system of administration does not in any way disadvantage disabled drivers.  I can give the Deputy a very solemn assurance on that.</P>
    <P>He concluded enigmatically by saying &ldquo;I know a lot about that&rdquo;.  The existing scheme, in my assessment, has been underfunded in the Health Estimate for 1988 by about £500,000 and it now transpires it is not possible to transfer the existing scheme for what the Department of Finance classically call more effective adminiatration from the Revenue Commissioners to the health boards, or for that matter to the National Rehabilitation Board on the basis of the budget provision of £2.8 million as announced by the Minister for Finance on 27 January last.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the Taoiseach knew well, and the Minister for Finance knew equally well, that the scheme was being cut in the budget by £500,000 and that they, quite deliberately, chose not to disclose that basic fact to the House at that time. The Taoiseach said the provision for 1988 was £2.8 million and that the cost in a full year would be £3.3 million.  There is grave concern about this provision at this stage so much so that yesterday afternoon we had disabled drivers in front of Leinster House making their case to Deputies as we were coming in, and their case was made very well.</P>
    <P>We have a very interesting and comprehensive scheme which provides exemption from VAT and duty on the purchase of new cars for disabled drivers. Each driver can purchase 600 gallons of petrol a year, exempt from duty, and their cars are exempt from road tax. Ironically, that scheme was brought in by the Taoiseach when he was Minister for Finance.  With due respect to our departmental colleagues in the Department of Finance, once they get their hands on a reasonably good scheme their ability to emasculate it is never-ending, and it is <Col N="1491" /> proposed to emasculate the existing scheme of support for disabled drivers.</P>
    <P>In my view the Taoiseach has a nerve, since the Minister for Finance has direct responsibility, to blandly disclaim at this stage all responsibility for what I can only describe as the exceptionally mean proposals to cut a basic mobility facility for some of the most disabled persons in our society.  I understand that the bones of a new scheme are being considered by the Minister for Finance.  Under it the Minister proposes to substitute cash grants for car purchase in place of a general exemption from VAT and excise duty. That represents a major cut in the scheme, no matter what way we look at it.  I understand it is proposed that the provision under which a person gets a new car every two years is being changed to every three years and that that major cut affects disabled drivers.  There is a proposal whereby the petrol and road tax rebates which on average have a cash value, if fully taken up on petrol, of £935 per annum will be cut to a cash grant of £600 per annum.</P>
    <P>Such propositions have been presented by the Department of Finance to those directly involved in the working party and it is possible that we will see the introduction of a means test and an age limit in relation to these concessions. They will represent a further cut in the allowances paid to disabled drivers.  I understand that a member of the working party, bereft of further imagination in regard to the cuts, has decided that secondhand cars should be brought within the ambit of the scheme.  That is a classic Department of Finance proposition.  In effect, a disabled person may find himself or herself in the middle of the night miles from a telephone and unable to repair their secondhand car which has been converted for use by a disabled driver mainly because of the Minister's decision to substitute secondhand vehicles for new cars. Is the Taoiseach seriously suggesting that this is part of his <i>Programme for National Recovery?</i> That phrase sticks in the mind of disabled drivers who are endeavouring to get back to work or to have social <Col N="1492" /> mobility.  One good thing the monitoring committee of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> could do would be to call for the report of the working party and ensure that the existing scheme is maintained and financed properly.  If that does not happen the Labour Party will vote against the relevant section in the Bill and unless we receive an assurance from the Minister for Finance when replying to the debate tomorrow evening in regard to this we will vote against the Second Stage of the Bill.  I hope the other Opposition parties will join with us in rejecting that, the unkindest cut of all announced in the budget.  It is not good enough for the Minister to specify that section 54 will rescind the old scheme if he fails to disclose the details of the new scheme.</P>
    <P>I should like to deal with what I regard as a harebrained proposition for the raising of revenue, the introduction in the budget of a £10 tax on cash dispenser cards.  I do not know who concocted this measure to raise £6 million.  Since the introduction of the automatic cash dispenser machines an estimated 900,000 cards have been issued and I understand that eight out of every ten current account holders possess such a card.  I hold such a card.  We are all aware that the banks charge between 10p and 15p for each cash dispensing transaction and that the average customer makes 40 or 50 such transactions each year.  The introduction of this levy runs contrary to the policy of the European Community.  It is a unique tax in Europe and I do not know of any other European Minister for Finance who is proposing to introduce such a levy.  This indirect tax is not matched elsewhere in the Community but what is more serious for us is that it is out of harmony with the efforts to harmonise indirect taxation in the Community. It is ironic that the Minister for Industry and Commerce is berating those in industry, and his colleagues in Europe, in his efforts to introduce general harmonisation &mdash; I am totally in favour of this although it will be very difficult here by virtue of our zero rating on food &mdash; while at the same time the Minister for <Col N="1493" /> Finance is introducing an extraordinary levy of £10 on cash dispensing cards.  I find it mindboggling that the Department of Finance should introduce such a levy. It has caused great outrage in the community.</P>
    <P>Many young students have handed their cards back to the bank.  It is ironic that the commercial banks, in order to encourage students to open accounts with them, lodge £5 to their credit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>&ldquo;Come into my parlour&rdquo;, said the spider to the fly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>However, as a result of the budget, students will have their accounts debited by £10 on receipt of a cash dispenser card.  For the privilege of opening a bank account a student will now find himself or herself in debt to the tune of £5.  Students, those on low income, pensioners and small savers whose income is automatically credited to their account through the paypath system are irate that they will have to pay this levy.  It was a panic measure by the Cabinet.  I understand that several members of the Government were not aware of this move until it was announced on budget day.  We had the great irony of the Minister for Labour, having got clearance from Government for the introduction of amending legislation in relation to the Truck Acts to reform the payment of wages by cheque and having obtained the agreement of the Federated Union of Employers and the trade unions, finding himself shafted by the Minister for Finance who decided to introduce the £10 levy on cash dispensing cards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know of one employer who had issued over 120 of those cards to his employees. He is now saying to the Minister for Labour: &ldquo;Are you going to cough up a £1,100 per annum levy because I have issued the cards to the bank to get the cash system in operation?&rdquo; Whoever thought up this proposition deserves no commendation whatsoever from this House.  It is bad enough having to pay prevailing bank charges; God knows they <Col N="1494" /> are sufficiently high.  For example, one must pay 7p on every cheque one now writes.  It must be borne in mind that the cost of installation of one of those dispensing machines is approximately £35,000.  It is not easy to have them installed.  I have wanted them installed in major industrial locations.  I have wanted them installed in, say, hospitals.  We have convinced the banks to have them installed in many places such as colleges of technology, university complexes, places where there are large congregations of people.  It must be remembered that it costs any bank in the region of £35,000 to £40,000 to instal one of these machines.  They are also very costly to service.  Therefore, it is much more economic and cheaper to have them used.</P>
    <P>I find it difficult to believe that the Government gave this decision any really serious consideration.  I find it even more difficult to believe, in the light of the opposition to this proposal, that the Minister for Finance does not wish to bend on it.  This was a very stupid decision &mdash; not just a bad one, downright stupid.  The decision relating to the proposed levy on pension funds was equally ill thought out, stupidly devised and, with much ado, has been rectified in an endeavour to introduce the same yield, allegedly on a once-off basis, but of course we know it will obtain for all time to come.  Just because the Cabinet at the last minute changed their minds about the reduction in mortgage interest because the Leader of the Opposition said he could not support such a proposition, there was a mad rush to ensure a yield of £6 million by way of levy on bank ATM machines as an alternative.  That is bad budgetary policy. The Minister should be big enough to change his mind and abolish this imposition.</P>
    <P>In relation to those bank Pass cards there is involved the fundamental question of cash security.  Time and again subversive elements within our society have endeavoured to rip off cash transactions. I am well aware of the extraordinary efforts undertaken in the Department of Social Welfare when I <Col N="1495" /> was there for approximately four years, in order to protect employment exchanges and post offices from being ripped off by subversive and criminal elements.  We know the risks undertaken daily within the banking system in relation to cash transactions.  We are aware of the dangers of wage snatches, payroll bank robberies and so on.  In circumstances in which the introduction of the bank dispenser cards constituted a valuable method of protecting cash transactions this latest levy will be seen to be entirely counter-productive.  Certainly it does not constitute an advertisement for the protection of the community in their daily multiple cash transactions.  I earnestly ask the Minister to change his mind in this regard which would bring a sigh of relief from the community at large and be welcomed by the banking community, in particular, who are totally opposed to this proposition.</P>
    <P>The Minister has many other alternatives available to him.  I should say that we will be opposing this section.  If the Minister is that badly caught for £6 million why does not he or the Government simply increase the bank levy and get the necessary finance in that way?  The bank levy is being increased anyway under the provisions of the budget by £5 million to £6 million.  There is no reason the Government could not have imposed a straightforward increase in that bank levy if they were determined not to lose any yield in revenue.</P>
    <P>I want to refer now to the so-called major incentive provided by the budgetary tax amnesty.  I am opposed to the relevant section of the Bill.  In respect of those who pay their taxes on time, who have consistently paid their due and lawful taxes, indeed those who for one reason or another have not paid their taxes, who have been rightly caught for the payment of interest, caught by sheriff seizures &mdash; whatever transient sympathy we may have for them &mdash; who have been caught because they have not paid their taxes, who have been legitimately brought before the sheriff, the courts, caught for late payment of taxes, it is <Col N="1496" /> outrageous that overnight the Government should decide to issue a universal, general, amnesty of an extraordinary kind.</P>
    <P>There are now major companies writing to their customers.  I have here an executive briefing by Cooper and Lybrand which makes interesting reading, which says that if one has undisclosed income or has previously failed to make proper returns they can help by providing a totally confidential initial consultation to consider the implications of availing of the amnesty, free of charge, establishing the actual amount of exposure to tax liability, preparing and agreeing tax returns with the Revenue Commissioners in time to meet the amnesty deadline, negotiating with Revenue on behalf of their customers so as to minimise the ultimate liability and agreeing payment schedules to ensure liabilities are cleared before 30 September 1988.  As we are aware, those circumstances would arise in which a person would have arrears of tax in respect of periods up to 31 December 1987 when it is possible to obtain a full waiver or related interest and penalties provided the principal tax is paid over to the Revenue Commissioners by 30 September 1988.  That is an extraordinary Government decision which is totally unacceptable on grounds of fundamental equity.  In other words, those who have failed to pay their taxes, deliberately in many cases delayed paying them, who have an income which they deliberately concealed from the Revenue Commissioners, are now given an open-ended amnesty of extraordinary generosity.</P>
    <P>Any ordinary taxpayer keeping an account in order, paying their ordinary taxes and penalties legitimately imposed, must look upon this amnesty with a great deal of cynicism because such a system should never have been brought in.  In one newspaper on 3 April the financial editor, Mr. Des Crowley, a reputable writer, said that this year saw the usual mad rush to beat the taxman before the end of the financial year because of the tax amnesty which continues for several months longer.  He went on to say that one person admitted to Revenue that he <Col N="1497" /> had an undisclosed balance of £2.8 million in the bank.  Because of the amnesty instead of being liable for £1.8 million he is liable for only £1.4 million.  That is a classic example and we have heard of other cases.</P>
    <P>I remember well in Government considering the question of tax amnesty and we were prepared to give very limited leeway to those who were not paying taxes.  However, this handout to people who basically have not paid their taxes and who have undisclosed resources must certainly make tens of thousands of taxpayers feel irate.  I congratulate and support the Minister on the introduction of more effective powers of attachment which will come into force on 1 October. However, the provision of a tax amnesty has been quite excessive and, irrespective of the additional revenue which may accrue, it is fundamentally wrong because in three years time people will be baying for another tax amnesty and perhaps a future Minister for Finance will reintroduce it.  Once you go down that road, it is hard to stop in terms of administering an effective system.</P>
    <P>I wish to comment on the tax on pension funds.  I recall in Government debating at great length the introduction of DIRT.  We had a working party report and many intensive discussions.  There were misgivings and concern about its introduction, not least that the Fianna Fáil Party would exploit it unmercifully. I vividly recall the heartrending criticisms here by the Opposition on the introduction of DIRT.  I fought for its introduction and, without it, the Exchequer would not have £300 million today. Indeed, at official level there was great hostility towards the introduction of the tax but I am glad it was brought in because without it our financial problems would be much worse.</P>
    <P>I do not consider that much thought was given to the introduction of the tax on pension funds because, on further examination which undoubtedly should have been done before, we can see that there has been a major change in the system of levying taxation on pension funds in the Finance Bill.  As a former <Col N="1498" /> trade union official, I have always been in favour of the development of effective pension funding on a deferred savings basis and I had many a prolonged row with young industrial workers who could not see the sense in it.  I am in favour of building up pension funds to ensure that the Exchequer would not have a huge liability for non-contributory pensions and I was responsible to a large measure for the setting up of the National Pensions Board in 1986.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about this once-off tax because I do not believe for one minute that it will be on a once-off basis.  In 1989 and 1990 the yield from this tax will increase and in a full year it will probably yield £20 million or £25 million.  The rate will then probably change and it will become a substantial tax on pension fund investment income in the years ahead. It is yet another tax and I have strong reservations about its introduction.  The Government already receive significant sums each year by way of tax on pensions generally paid out from pension funds and I am worried about a number of pension funds where the capacity for contributions have seized up by virtue of lack of employment and the age factors relating to the funds.  The Minister should look again at the decision of the Government in that regard because there are other ways of raising money apart from having a go at pension funds.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for having had the patience to listen to my prolonged contribution to this debate.  I am sure he will not take umbrage when I say that the Finance Act for 1987 and the Finance Bill for 1988, to an extent have been lost opportunities.</P>
    <P>Go back to the Finance Bills of 1983, 1984, 1985 and 1986 and consider that if the DIRT had been brought in in, say, 1984 and if the farm tax had been instituted earlier and copperfastened in 1983 or 1984, then one would have had a far better tax system in operation now. When one examines the details of the Finance Bills for 1987 and 1988 one finds they are not particularly striking.</P>
    <P>One gets an opportunity in the lifetime of any Government to bring in at most <Col N="1499" /> three or four Finance Bills.  To this extent this Bill is in many ways a lost opportunity and I think we can improve it considerably by making substantial changes in it on Committee Stage.  I have no doubt the Minister will listen to us carefully and we will press him very strongly on the issues I have raised in my contribution to this debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Minister for Tourism and Transport (Mr. Wilson) John P. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism and Transport (Mr. Wilson)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have this opportunity to speak in the debate on the Finance Bill.</P>
      <P>The Finance Bill incorporates changes which reinforce and continue the overall Government strategy in the management of the economy &mdash; a strategy which encompasses two key objectives &mdash; improving the public finances and revitalising the economy.  Of course, revitalising the economy is the paramount objective.  I do not need to repeat in this House the legacy of misdirected fiscal and macroeconomic policies that this Government inherited when they took office just over a year ago.</P>
      <P>The essential features of the economic situation that we inherited were set out succinctly in the National Economic and Social Council's study <i>A Strategy for Development 1986-1990.</i> That was published just 18 months ago.  It also outlined an agenda under which our economic problems could be solved.</P>
      <P>A primary requirement outlined by the NESC for solving our economic problems was the stabilisation of the national debt to GNP ratio, as a first step towards the ultimate reduction of that ratio.  Indeed, the council went further by suggesting that it would be neither feasible nor desirable to effect the required reduction in borrowing through higher taxation. Accordingly, it was necessary to tackle the problem mainly by means of savings in public expenditure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On taking office this Government set about implementing a programme for national recovery based fairly closely on the strategy recommended by the NESC. That meant that hard decisions had to be taken on public expenditure; these <Col N="1500" /> decisions were taken and we have held the line on them, even though we have had to face some fairly strong criticism from vested interests.  A barometer of the success of our policies is evident in the significant reduction in the Exchequer borrowing requirement that we achieved last year.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note the Exchequer borrowing requirements and the percentage of GNP for the years 1985 to 1988.  In 1985, it was £2,015 million or 13.1 per cent of GNP; in 1986 it was £2,145 million, with the percentage of GNP gone up by one decimal point to 13.2 per cent; in 1987 it was reduced from 13.2 per cent to 10.3 per cent with an Exchequer Borrowing Requirement of £1,786 million and the post budget estimate for 1988 percentage of GNP is 8.2 per cent while the borrowing requirement is £1,457 million, a drop from £2,015 million in 1985 to £1,457 in 1988.  I do not have to underline to the House that this is a significant reduction.  This has facilitated a considerable reduction in domestic interest rates which in turn has helped to restore confidence in the economy and as head debtors to banks, the ACC and the various financial houses we know it has encouraged investors.  An analysis of the investment economic indicator shows that investment is significantly increased in the plant and machinery area.  It may not be significantly increased in the other major sector, namely, building construction which constitutes that economic indicator, but it certainly is very encouraging in the plant and machinery area.</P>
    <P>As I said in my contribution to the budget debate, reductions in Exchequer borrowing do not just happen.  The reductions which are now coming on stream required a new balance of macro-economic policies to be struck, necessitating a curtailment in public expenditure in a number of areas.  Despite criticism from some sections of the community, there is now a broad acceptance of our policies across a wide spectrum of Irish society.  This reflects a realism within the country that public expenditure just has to be got under control, in <Col N="1501" /> order to remove the burden which the national debt has placed on all our shoulders, individuals and businesses alike.  As the House knows, the national debt had reached a figure of £26 billion at 10 per cent interest rate.  That is £2.6 billion which if we had not to pay it in interest rates would make a big impact on the various areas now being curbed, namely environment, road making, education and health.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that this Finance Bill, which gives effect to the taxation and other changes announced in the budget of last January, demonstrates a continuation and a consolidation of the Government's strategy.  The Bill also demonstrates how this Government have now begun the process of reforming the structure of the taxation system as well as introducing certain specific incentives to important economic sectors.  This is in line with developments in other industrialised countries.  Indeed, over the past few years there has been increasing recognition, throughout the industrialised world, of the importance of tax reform in improving economic performance. The Governments of Felipe Gonzalez and Francois Mitterand are examples of socialist Governments who are in line with that thinking as of now. They see the necessity.  Realism is all.</P>
    <P>Of particular interest to individual taxpayers are the general income tax reliefs. In that regard the Finance Bill provides for the implementation of a range of income tax reliefs.  These include increases in the personal and PAYE allowances and a substantial extension of the 35 per cent tax band.  It is important to point out that the changes, costing over £150 million in a full year, go much further this year than would be required to meet the Government's commitment on income tax in the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i> The fact that in Britain the standard rate of tax has been reduced substantially, whether we like it or not, will have an impact on this country, although I would not go so far as some speakers in the debate yesterday did when they said it would mean people would leave the country because of the <Col N="1502" /> difference in tax.  Plenty of people do not subscribe to that <i>ubi bene, ibi patria,</i> whatever you do well that is your native land, type of philosophy.</P>
    <P>The changes represent substantial progress towards this Government's aim of having two-thirds of taxpayers paying tax at the standard rate.  I think the figure is now over 60 per cent.  The bringing down of inflation to around 3 per cent is also very significant in this regard because, as we know, inflation impacted on wages and salaries and people moved into a higher bracket for the purpose of paying income tax and went way above the standard rates.  That particular process has been halted and, therfore, any allowances have a greater impact and are a greater help to taxpayers.</P>
    <P>What is particularly significant about this Finance Bill is that it confirms that the general orientation of Government's taxation policy is towards a broader base for tax liability and much more effective tax collection.  In this regard I would like to refer to the innovative arrangements which were announced in the budget and which are now set set out in the Finance Bill as part of a phased move towards a self-assessment tax system.  The changes in the Bill indeed represent a radical overhaul of the tax assessment arrangements for the self-employed and for companies. While the broad objectives are to simplify tax assessment and collection, and to eliminate arrears, they are also designed to make life significantly more difficult for these defaulting.</P>
    <P>I should point out that the new arrangements are the product of very careful and serious consideration.  This is evident from the very useful discussion paper entitled &ldquo;New Arrangements for Tax Returns and Assessment&rdquo; issued by the Department of Finance after the budget. The views expressed by various bodies on that discussion paper have been considered in drafting the legislation.</P>
    <P>The new return and assessment arrangements detailed in the Finance Bill are accompanied by two other measures aimed at improving collection and eliminating tax arrears.  They are the incentive arrangements to clear tax arrears &mdash;<Col N="1503" /> Deputy Desmond did not like them very well &mdash; and what is known as the power of attachment which he did like.  Put bluntly these measures contain elements of the carrot and the stick.  There was a belief during the last war that eating carrots improved the eyesight.  This &ldquo;carrot&rdquo; should make for more clarity of vision in taxpayers.  The carrot &mdash; and it is one that responsible citizens who have got behind in their tax affairs will welcome &mdash; encourages people to bring their tax affairs up to date.  In effect, the Finance Bill contains a special incentive scheme which involves a waiver of interest and penalties to encourage clearance of outstanding tax, whether in respect of arrears or undisclosed income.</P>
    <P>I can imagine many taxpayers who have been hit hard by the sluggish economic environment and the depressed business environment of recent years, welcoming the opportunity to wipe their tax slates clean.  By clearing away their arrears, they can then set about developing their businesses, free from any accumulated tax burden.  The Government are playing their part by not only offering this incentive to bring tax affairs up to date but also by providing for a business climate which is immeasurably better than it was when this Government took office just over a year ago.  Inflation and interest rates played a part in what has been achieved and are highly significant in this regard.</P>
    <P>As regards the stick in the Finance Bill, I refer to the power of attachment to the financial assets of defaulters.  In essence, attachment provides that, where the Revenue Commissioners believe that a third party has an amount of money due to a tax defaulter, they may direct the third party to pay the amount to them or the amount of tax due by a defaulter, if less.  Indeed I have met some businessmen who were trying to screw money out of people who owed it and they were delighted to hear about this.  They thought it would be a very useful weapon as a means of collecting their own debts. Amounts in dispute between the third party and the tax defaulter are excluded <Col N="1504" /> from the attachment process.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that the power of attachment is being introduced at a time when the climate has changed &mdash; and rightly changed &mdash; against the non-complying taxpayer.  The power of attachment is a necessary component of the new climate that defaulters now have to face and it will provide an effective deterrent against non-compliance.  This and the other measures in the Finance Bill to which I have referred represent a major effort to come to grips with the problems that exist at present in our tax administration. I believe they are positive developments.  Indeed, the only people who will consider these developments in a negative light are tax defaulters.</P>
    <P>As regards tourism and transport, there are a number of specific issues I would like to touch on.  As Members of the House are aware in the budget the Government allocated an additional £4 million for a special package of measures for tourism in 1988, &mdash; £4 million of scarce taxpayers' money.  The Government set up a special tourism task force to advise on how best to apply these funds in order to ensure the maximum increase in visitor numbers and tourism revenue.</P>
    <P>That task force was probably the most experienced that we could command because individual members of the industry were involved.  The proposals they made have the realism that comes from being involved in the industry itself.  On foot of the recommendations of the task force the Government have given approval for a new tourism campaign designed to renew the impetus for growth in the industry in the current year.  Bord Fáilte, with their new executive chairman &mdash; Martin Dully who, as the House will be aware, has an excellent track record at the helm of semi-State companies &mdash; have been given responsibility for organising and implementing the campaign.  As Deputies know, specific initiatives, in particular the &ldquo;Write and Invite&rdquo; scheme are now being implemented.  These and other initiatives are designed to achieve the challenging targets we have set for Irish tourism for 1988.  We are aiming to increase overseas visitor numbers by <Col N="1505" /> over 300,000, to increase revenue by up to £75 million and, consequently, to create approximately 4,000 new jobs. The beauty of the tourism industry is the fact that it is labour intensive and that is a very important factor at present.</P>
    <P>Our success in achieving a significant revival of the tourism industry's fortunes in 1987, combined with the initiatives which have been and are being taken in the current year, clearly signal the new sense of purpose, direction and confidence in Irish tourism.  Moreover, the Government are greatly encouraged by the way in which the industry itself has responded so positively, in particular by pledging £2 million to the task force, which will supplement the £4 million already provided for in the budget.  Since I took office as Minister for Tourism, I have found the people involved in the tourism industry ready to co-operate for their own benefit and they have a broader vision for the benefit of the economy and the country.  I am very pleased to be able to put that on the record of the House.</P>
    <P>The special campaign approved by the Government to which I have referred and the imaginative and innovative initiatives now being implemented by Bord Fáilte are some of the elements in our programme for tourism development.  We are taking initiatives in a range of other areas.  Many of the activities of Government have a tourism dimension which has received insufficient attention in the past. The Government have resolved that the importance of tourism will be given priority from now on in the activities of all Government Departments.  Already access fares have been significantly reduced and we are committed to ensuring that the potential of tourism is not undermined by the cost of air or sea transport to Ireland.  The Ministers concerned will give priority to tourism considerations in the areas of the environment, the marine, the provision of public facilities, and in the improvement of our competitiveness, so that we can maximise tourism revenue.  The Minister of State at my Department, Deputy <Col N="1506" /> Lyons, has a specific role in this connection in ensuring that all Departments continue to accord the highest priority to tourism issues.</P>
    <P>I now turn to a Government scheme which encourages investment in tourism. I refer to the business expansion scheme which was extended to the tourism sector in our budget last year.  I want to express my delight that the Minister for Finance saw his way to do that because it is capable of being impacted on the whole tourism scene.  As the Minister for Finance said in his recent budget speech, the stimulation of tourism related investment by the extension of the business expansion scheme to tourism should have an effect this year and in future years.  Since the scheme has come on stream for tourism last December, Bord Fáilte have received over 2,500 inquiries for information about the scheme.  That gives an idea of the level of interest.  Given the Government's concern to ensure the best possible use of taxpayer's money, a system of approvals has been introduced to assess the robustness of proposed projects. To date there have been many actual applications to Bord Fáilte for certificates of approval in connection with marketing and development plans for specific projects.  These projects, which involve a total investment of £6 million, relates to a range of tourism facilities &mdash; hotels, holiday cottages, charter boats, marinas &mdash; as well as tourism marketing companies.  Already approval has been given by Bord Fáilte for nine of these projects.  I should also mention that Bord Fáilte are running seminars throughout the country at present to ensure that all sectors of the tourism industry are made aware of the benefits and scope of the scheme.</P>
    <P>The Government are committed to a &ldquo;hard sell&rdquo; approach over the whole range of areas related to tourism.  Therefore, we will ensure that the incentives to invest in the tourism industry are aggressively promoted, just as we adopted sharper and more targeted marketing of Irish tourism products at home and particularly abroad.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1507" /> Given the constraints on public finances, the Government have unequivocally moved away from a previous overemphasis on increased public expenditure as a solution to all our problems, towards specific targeted schemes which require private sector investment such as the business expansion scheme.  As my colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, has pointed out in the industrial policy context, the day of the automatic grant of State funds is over.  We have placed and we must continue to place greater emphasis on obtaining the best possible value from the taxpayer's money in providing support for industry money in providing support for industry in general.  For too long the grant mentality has pervaded the Irish economy but we are committed to changing this, to redirecting State support and in some cases to seeking a repayable element. We just cannot continue to spend the amounts of money we had been spending on direct public expenditure.</P>
    <P>At this stage I would like to refer to some further aspects of the Finance Bill that have a bearing on my own area of responsibility.  The Bill contains a number of provisions which will be of benefit to tourism.  For example, while the Finance Bill imposes VAT on electricity this will be absorbed by price reductions arising from falling oil prices, lower interest rates and favourable exchange rate movements.  But what is more important is that those engaged in commercial tourism will be able to recover the VAT element of their electricity bills.  In effect therefore such commercial businesses will in future be paying less for their electricity.  I know that the cost of electricity has been a subject of intense discussion, particularly its comparative cost in the EC context.  Not many years ago our electricity was being sold at a highly competitive price but we have gone well ahead of continental countries in recent years and this problem must be resolved.</P>
    <P>The Finance Bill also addresses the issue of lead-free petrol.  We have been aware for some time of the importance of the availability of this commodity to <Col N="1508" /> our overseas visitors, especially those from mainland Europe.  The Minister for Transport of the Federal Republic of Germany is very pressing on the lead-free petrol issue and is undertaking a missionary campaign.  West Germany spends more on tourism than any other country in the world and we are targeting that market.  A good fares regime is now in place and we are anxious to attract many more German tourists.  The numbers coming here are static at 1 per cent of the German tourism industry.  This provision in the Finance Bill will be very helpful in this regard.  We have now brought the cost of lead-free petrol into line with that of premium grade leaded-petrol. In addition to being positive from an environmental point of view, this should also help boost visitor numbers from the Continent.  I very much hope the petrol companies will now reinforce the concession contained in the Finance Bill by vigorously promoting the use of lead-free petrol.  The Europeans are very conscious of the research that has been done on the effects of lead-laden petrol.</P>
    <P>I would also like to mention that the extension of incentives for urban renewal detailed in the budget and in the Finance Bill have implications for our tourism industry.  The physical appearance of our cities and towns makes a strong impression on our overseas visitors in particular and we must constantly seek to renew and revitalise the core areas of our cities and eliminate unsightly dereliction. I believe that the extension of the renewal incentives scheme can make a significant contribution to this process. Furthermore, the restoration of what is referred to as &ldquo;section 23 tax relief&rdquo; can also be beneficial.  In this regard, the House should note that the provisions in the Bill go further than announced in the budget by restoring also the similar relief for situations where the expenditure is incurred on the conversion of a building into two or more flats for renting.  In addition, the separate relief provided under sections 21 and 22 of the 1985 Finance Act is being reintroduced; this will provide for a deduction against rental <Col N="1509" /> income from the rented property in question, of certain refurbishment or conversion expenditure on the property. Again, these provisions should assist in the urban renewal process.</P>
    <P>Turning to more general issues, I think it is important to point out that the Government strategy cannot be confined to what is contained in the budget and the Finance Bill.  These are indispensible cogs in the wheel of economic development, but the Government's overall policy must be seen within the framework of our longer term macro-economic strategy as set out in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> prepared last October, and which was endorsed by the major bodies representing workers, business and farming at national level.  A key area in which Government resolve to make progress under that programme is in the creation of a fiscal climate, an exchange rate and monetary climate conducive to economic growth.  In this regard the maintenance of a stable exchange rate for the Irish pound within the European Monetary System is an important objective. By achieving this objective we can ensure that the benefits of lower inflation and more moderate interest rates prevailing within the European Monetary System will become progressively available to our domestic producers.</P>
    <P>A stable exchange rate environment, particularly if it is combined with the realistic pay increases provided for under the terms of the <i>Programme for National Recovery,</i> can go a long way towards laying the foundations for an improvement in our international competitiveness. There is no doubt that our ability to create jobs &mdash; the paramount objective &mdash; and hence tackle the unemployment and emigration problems lies in improving the competitiveness of Irish industry.  It also depends on developing and improving the performance of the internationally traded sectors and developing our natural resources by targeting specific sectors of the economy for growth.</P>
    <P>We in Government have done much in the last year to improve the climate for those operating or starting up businesses. <Col N="1510" /> A major contribution to the improved business environment is the fact that we have succeeded in achieving a stable and predictable fiscal environment.  Too often in the past optimistic and rosy targets were set but they were not adhered to. In this context this Government were very conscious of the importance of framing credible budgets, with the objective of restoring confidence in the economy. The budgets themselves and the improved economic environment are due testament to the success of the Government's strategy, as are the Exchequer Returns for the first quarter of 1988, which were published recently; they show that we are on course to achieve our budgetary targets this year.</P>
    <P>I should at this stage remind the House that Government can only do so much in terms of creating a favourable environment for industry and producing a range of specific measures to help businesses along the road to success.  The efforts and expertise of individual business people, as well as the business environment and the overall economic climate, will in the end determine the fortunes of their enterprises.  We in Government have committed ourselves to providing for a positive business environment that encourages the development of industry.  I look forward to hearing more positive evidence of industry &mdash; and here might I refer specifically to the tourist industry &mdash; availing of the opportunities and incentives to develop.</P>
    <P>Let me emphasise that when it comes to investment and Government support for investment this Government are interested in &ldquo;winners&rdquo;.  In this vein I would like to conclude my contribution to this debate by mentioning a project which the Government are committed to and which we believe will be a winner. One of the success stories of the past year has been the progress made in the development of an international financial services centre in the Custom House Docks area in Dublin.  Only a year ago this was a mere concept.  While there were some plans for the development of the Custom House Docks site, these plans did not extend to the establishment <Col N="1511" /> of a financial centre.  But now the groundwork for an international financial service centre is well advanced, with construction work already under way.  At present much work is under way to attract business to the centre.  In this regard, I should mention that the 10 per cent rate of corporation tax has been provided for companies setting up in the centre, subject to a certification procedure.  The Finance Bill also contains a number of additional measures to promote the development of the centre.  Of course our objective is to have within a few years a financial services centre of international status here.  We have the potential to make a success of this in terms of expertise and infrastructural support services.</P>
    <P>I know we have many young people with expertise working in London at present who are more than interested in this development.  They are working in the financial services area and are anxious to come back.  I was more than pleased to read the address of the London-Irish Society, a group of young people, many of whom are working in the financial services sector, stating at their dinner which they convened for St. Patrick's Day that their prime objective was to give something back to this country for the amount of money that was invested in their education and that they were also committed to returning to work here when an opportunity offered itself.  I would be sanguine enough to believe we are on the road to achieving that.</P>
    <P>I was very pleased to be a member of Government in the seventies, which had to send the then Minister for Labour, Mr. Gene Fitzgerald, to Britain to persuade young Irish people to come back to the industries we had established at that time.  I look forward to that happening again.  It ties in with what I said at the outset of this speech, namely, that all the financial and fiscal arrangements we are trying to put in place are for that paramount purpose.  As Minister responsible for tourism, I can see potential benefits to tourism in Dublin as a spin-off from the successful development of the Custom House Docks area since the development <Col N="1512" /> package includes a range of facilities to augment the financial centre.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann noting that the Finance Bill, 1988:</P>
      <P>(a) Fails to make any effort to fundamentally reform the tax system or broaden the tax base, and in particular fails to ensure an adequate return from capital or corporation taxes, and</P>
      <P>(b) fails to take any measures likely to stimulate employment and reduce the number on the dole queue,</P>
      <P>therefore declines to give a second reading to the Bill.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>We oppose the Bill for the reasons mentioned in the amendment and also for the particular reason that the Finance Bill fails to take adequate measures to ensure that the withholding tax on fees paid by the VHI, for instance, to medical consultants will not be passed on in the form of higher charges.  We also oppose and have opposed from the very beginning the £10 levy on cash cards and we further oppose the abolition of section 43.1 of the Finance Act, 1968, with regard to the remission of road tax on vehicles for disabled drivers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First, I wish to deal with paragraph (a) of our amendment.  The Bill fails to make any effort to fundamentally reform the <Col N="1513" /> tax system or broaden the tax base.  I think the Bill reflects the new right-wing consensus which clearly exists, not only in the House but outside among the various organisations for employers, the Confederation of Irish Industry, the media, and economists, etc.  I think the Minister for Finance had in mind ensuring that it would win acceptance from Fine Gael and the Progressive Democrats but certainly he had not tax equity in mind when producing this Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>The PAYE workers discovered in their first pay package a couple of weeks ago just how inadequate were the tax concessions announced in the budget.  It is agreed by everybody that juggling around with the tax bands is not tax reform, although the Minister for Finance in his speech seemed to indicate, and he endeavoured to pretend, that there were major tax reforms in this Finance Bill. Despite the changes announced in the budget, which became effective a couple of weeks ago, the total take in income tax from the PAYE sector will be virtually identical to what was taken last year.  The total take is the same amount as last year. The Bill is totally lacking in any radical tax reform measures which are needed to bring tax equity.</P>
    <P>The measures required for tax reform have been listed in various reports by the Commission on Taxation. The Minister for Finance in reply to a series of questions in the Dáil last year showed that no progress had been made in the area of tax reform.  In fact, during the past five years the position of the PAYE worker has actually deteriorated significantly compared to other groups.  We believe that very urgent action is required if the inequities in the tax system are not to be increased further.  Everybody recognises the inequities in the tax system.  Everybody recognises the enormous burden carried by the PAYE sector and people at work, but nobody is prepared to take the measures necessary to broaden the tax base and to make the major tax reforms that are required.</P>
    <P>In the replies to the parliamentary questions to which I have referred, it was <Col N="1514" /> shown that in the period of office of the Coalition Government from 1982-86 the average tax paid by a PAYE worker increased from £1,672 per annum in 1982 to £2,768 per annum in 1986.  In that short period of four years the average tax take increased by £1,096 or a 66 per cent increase in the average amount paid by the PAYE worker.  At the same time, the average tax paid by farmers increased from £543 to £629.  This represents an increase of only £86 or 16 per cent in the amount paid by farmers as against a 66 per cent increase in the amount paid by PAYE workers.</P>
    <P>Over the years, I have regularly and constantly been abused and accused by various IFA people of being anti-farmer. I have repeatedly pointed out that I am not anti-farmer but that I am anti-tax evasion.  I totally oppose the inequities in the tax system and the refusal by Governments to ensure that everybody pays their fair share.  Every pound which is not paid by farmers is an extra pound which has to be paid by the PAYE worker and every pound which is not paid by the self-employed, companies, chancers and speculators, is an extra pound which goes on to the backs of the PAYE workers. That is how it operates and that is why I am against evasion.  When I say I am against the system which during the four year period 1982-86 put a 60 per cent increase on PAYE workers and only a 16 per cent increase on farmers, I only give farmers as an example because the figures are available to us and have been given to me in reply to a question.  The difference in the increases does not represent equity in the tax system and this Finance Bill does nothing whatsoever to change that or to ensure that we will have a more equitable system.</P>
    <P>In the same period the average tax paid by the self-employed increased by £680 or 51 per cent.  This is much more than the increase on farmers but it is still much less than the increase on PAYE workers. In 1982 PAYE taxpayers paid an average of three times as much tax as farmers and 1.26 times as much tax as the self-employed. The respective figures for 1986 are four and a half times as much as <Col N="1515" /> farmers and 1.38 times as much as the self-employed.  The average tax paid by farmers in 1986 at £629 was the lowest for any year since 1982.  Not alone was the 1986 figure of £629 lower but it was also lower than what it was in previous years.  The take from farmers had gone up for a few years but it came down in 1986.</P>
    <P>The replies also show that no serious effort is being made to ensure that farmers are brought into the tax net.  The point I am making in relation to the average take from farmers is that it is the average take from the small numbers of farmers who pay tax.  No progress has been made in widening the tax net to include more farmers.  According to the figures given by the Minister for Finance, Deputy MacSharry, 129,000 farmers were chargeable to tax in 1985, yet only 20,000 are ultimately expected to make any payments for that year.  This is an appalling situation and it appears that neither a Coalition nor a Fianna Fáil Government have the courage or the conviction to take on the IFA in this area so as to ensure that the farmers who are making money pay tax.</P>
    <P>We can see from the figures in the Finance Bill that a worker will pay tax once he earns over £52 per week or £2,700 a year.  Every day we hear farmers on the radio crying out that the average farmer makes £2,500 only a year.  No farmer who earns £3,000, £4,000 or £5,000 a year has to pay tax but every worker who earns over £2,750 a year or £52 or £53 a week has to pay tax on that miserable amount. This Bill does not bring the farming and self-employed sectors into the same tax net as PAYE workers.</P>
    <P>We believe that a start in this area should be made in the next budget.  A clear effort should be made to bring in tax equity by transferring at least 10 per cent of the take from the PAYE taxpayer directly onto other taxpayers such as farmers, the self-employed, business people, owners of capital, etc.  This will not mean any reduction in the overall burden of taxation but it will move the burden directly and clearly from one <Col N="1516" /> sector to the various other sectors.  This would force Governments to ensure that the collection and assessment systems in those other sectors are adequate to ensure that the money is brought in.  A clear step should be taken to take 10 per cent off the backs of the PAYE taxpayers and the total take in income tax should be reduced from 93 per cent, or whatever it has reached at this stage to under 80 per cent.  If we do not take a major step in this area there will be no reduction from year to year, just as there is none this year, in the total tax take from PAYE workers.  We have advocated, and we again advocate it, that 10 per cent of the burden on the PAYE workers should be transferred to all other taxpayers.</P>
    <P>The number of staff in the Revenue Commissioners has been cut by more than 11 per cent during the past five years. Reducing the number of staff at the disposal of the Revenue Commissioners, who are the ones who bring the money into the coffers of the State, is an appalling effort at economy.  It is perverse to try to save money by cutting the number of staff who have the potential to increase the revenue of the State.</P>
    <P>The Minister is endeavouring, as is shown in the Finance Bill, to bring in measures, which are very welcome, to collect outstanding taxes.  We have advocated at all times that it is essential that taxes which are due, which have gone through all the processes and are clearly owing to the State should be brought in and that those who do not pay those taxes should be treated as criminals because when those taxes are not brought in other people suffer.  We call them criminals because when they do not pay, other people suffer in the areas of health care, education, local authority services and in various other ways throughout the community. We welcome the steps being taken by the Minister to ensure that the taxes which are clearly due to the State are brought in and that every means is used to do so.  The Minister has taken fairly radical steps &mdash; which we hope he will implement and which will not just be something in a Bill &mdash; so that he can collect this money.  I want to ensure that <Col N="1517" /> the public are not in any way confused about this.  The Minister is not taking any steps against tax evasion.  What the Minister is talking about is collecting this money which we know has gone through all the existing processes and is due.  He is not doing anything about the massive tax evasion.</P>
    <P>I have referred to the reduction in numbers in the Revenue Commissioners and the great difficulty in handling the assessment area.  They cannot even touch the issue of farmer taxation because they have not got the staff to deal with it.  The Minister is talking about this pot of gold which they refused for years to admit existed.  We were pointing out over the last number of years that it was there while everybody else on these benches sneered at the idea and said that there was no pot of gold out there.  The Minister for Finance is now trying to collect that pot of gold but once that is in, what is he doing about the remainder?  What about other years?  What about the evasion and what steps are being taken to ensure that those who have the money pay their taxes?</P>
    <P>That is not being dealt with by the Minister and the decision to scrap the 16 person anti-evasion unit which had significant success in its couple of years in existence, places a major question mark on the commitment of this administration to stamping out tax evasion.  In a couple of years this unit was responsible for initiating investigations where tax evasion was suspected.  They went out into the field and discovered who was evading and who was not and followed up complaints and reports made by members of the public just as is done in cases of fraud in regard to social welfare, and those complaints are followed up very rapidly indeed with inspectors hopping out at every little report and cutting people off immediatley before proving anything.  They are cutting people off from their social welfare benefits because of some anonymous report and then taking six to eight weeks to restore the rightful payments.  In the meantime such people must borrow from moneylenders so that their family can subsist.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1518" /> This tax evasion unit did not have any such powers.  Nevertheless, it was very effective and in 1986 was responsible for bringing in £6 million in tax which would otherwise have gone uncollected.  The estimated figure for the following year was £8 million.</P>
    <P>Those in the unit were not tax inspectors in the normal sense but investigators and 14 out of the 16 were actually engaged in field work finding out what was happening.  Their impact was very obvious from the protests which were coming from all quarters about their activities, and it was these protests which led to the Government deciding in January that they did not want to harass those people any more and those working in the unit received letters from the personnel officer of the Revenue Commissioners informing them that the unit was being disbanded with effect from 8 February and the investigators would be returned to routine duties.</P>
    <P>The decision to appoint these investigators in the first place was a political decision, and a good one, but it was also a Government political decision to abolish them as well.  In view of the continuing very high level of tax evasion it is inexcusable. This Government are surrendering to various organisations representing the self-employed in particular who are screaming and complaining about alleged harassment by the tax investigators.  It was a clear backing down by the Government because of the political clout of the people being harassed. The Government backed down in the face of that and that is in sharp contrast to the continuing and increasing harassment of people on social welfare.  On any excuse they are abused, with hatches clamped down in their faces, being told to go away, not being given any money; they have to find out where to make complaints and so on.  No matter how they scream or shout the Government will not back down and remove those investigators and inspectors.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to company taxation, capital allowances etc.  In this Finance Bill sections 39 to 42 provide for a reduction in capital allowances from 100 <Col N="1519" /> per cent to 75 per cent initially and then to 50 per cent next year.  That sounds marvellous.  To compensate for this reduction in capital allowances, the standard rate of corporation tax is being reduced initially to 47 per cent and then next year to 43 per cent.  But the case for capital allowances is very doubtful.  In fact very few Governments have been able to make any case for it; they have just introduced them.  Even the Thatcher Government in Britain has totally abolished capital allowances over a priod of three years.  Deputy Haughey has totally accepted other policies of Mrs. Thatcher. It would be no harm to draw this to his attention so that he could tell his Finance Minister that Maggie does not do it that way and to have a look at why the Thatcher Government abolished capital allowances over a period of three years.</P>
    <P>The range and extent of tax allowances is now so wide that many companies are not paying any tax at all.  In 1984 two-thirds of all publicly quoted companies paid tax at a rate of less than 10 per cent. In fact the average effective tax rate for publicly quoted companies in that year was 8 per cent.  That is unbelievable.  In 1964 there were only 3 per cent of companies who did not pay any tax at all. Twenty years later, in 1984 35 per cent of companies paid no tax.</P>
    <P>
      <i>The Economist,</i> which I do not think will be considered in any way a left wing magazine &mdash; in fact, it is a very right wing one &mdash; stated that here income tax has risen and taxes on companies have declined to a negligible 4 per cent of revenue in 1987, half of the OECD average. The Minister for Finance admitted that the changes will not bring in any more tax.  He also admitted that we have excessively high reliefs for investment and that the tax yield from companies is low by international standards.  I am not saying anything radical or extraordinary here; the Minister points this out himself. He goes on to say that our incentives have been exceptionally generous &mdash; which is quite true.  It is no harm to give the figures for this exceptional generosity.  The tax relief to companies in recent years was <Col N="1520" /> £800 million and direct grants and subsidies to industry amounted to £400 million. Between tax relief and direct grants and subsidies, £1,200 million was given to industry and companies.  That is far more than was ever given to State companies in any particular year, perhaps up to ten times more in many years.</P>
    <P>That is the climate which is not considered satisfactory for these companies. The Government say that it is not good enough for private companies and that we must improve it.  Where else in the world, in Europe, among the OECD countries, is there a better climate for private enterprise, private companies, than the climate here, where they can obtain £1,200 million in reliefs and direct grants?  Yet these companies in the past five or six years have put 40,000 people out of manufacturing jobs.  The problem is that the strategy of successive Governments has been all carrot and no stick. They have been just handing out taxpayers' money to these companies with no policy behind it, no instruction that they will get their money if they increase work, increase jobs, develop or show expansion.  They are given the money in the hope that they will expand but naturally they do not.  They put the money into their pockets, their own investments, send it abroad, to tax havens, do what they wish with it.  They certainly do not improve the economy and never will.</P>
    <P>Regarding employment, the only developmental policy that this Government seem to have concerns the Custom House Docks site.  There is nothing else that we can see of development, expansion, or creation of jobs.  If that development goes ahead on the scale planned &mdash; and there is certainly no proof that it will go ahead at all &mdash; it will certainly be an important boost for the construction industry for a time.  However, I must be very sceptical that it will lead to any substantial number of new jobs.  There will be many jobs in the Custom House Docks site development, but the major portion of these will have been transferred from other areas into that area of high tax advantage.  There will be no <Col N="1521" /> indication of any great boost of jobs there, apart from the important boost to the construction industry if the development goes ahead.  I do not think anybody has yet shown us where these jobs will come from.  That is the only developmental, or expansion, or job creation policy the Government seem to have.</P>
    <P>The Irish Congress of Trade Unions have called for a minimum tax of 10 per cent on all companies.  That is not much to ask, that no company would pay less than 10 per cent tax.  In other words, the 35 per cent of companies who pay no tax at all would at least pay 10 per cent and those paying very low taxes, as low as 4 or 5 or even 1 per cent, would at least pay 10 per cent.  We would support that. The Congress also said that profits repatriated should be levied.  The repatriation of profits is a huge hole in our economy and any Minister for Finance who does not face up to this in some way is not facing up to the problem of our finances. The repatriation of profits exceeds the interest payments on the foreign debt that is causing such enormous problems to this Government, to the country, to our children in schools, to our sick people in hospitals and so forth.  We are all told that it is because of the banks that have to be paid first before they can have their health or their education looked after. Repatriation of profits and other movements of funds out of the country amounts to far more than is required to service the national debt.</P>
    <P>These are areas that any Minister for Finance who is serious about his job must tackle and we support what the Irish Congress of Trade Unions said, that there should be a levy on all profits which have been repatriated.  That is the stick.  You also have the carrot of incentives which are there already towards retaining the profits here for expansion and development in this country.  I would also like to deal with a matter which is becoming more important to Ministers for Finance with regard to tackling tax evasion and with regard to methods of taxation.  That is the question of access to bank accounts and information on them.</P>
    <P>We hear banks and building societies <Col N="1522" /> regularly advertising that nobody will ever know anything about how much money people have invested, or where it is &mdash; that there is absolute, total confidentality. It needs a court order in this country before access to bank accounts can be gained.  Yet, the great American system which we laud so much and which gives such tremendous benefit to the private entrepreneur has a system whereby people putting money on deposit must produce their tax numbers.  This is the system in America where we encourage all our young people to go, that is, second to Australia which for some reason or other seems to be the place to go.  In banking we should adopt the American system.  There is no obligation here for banks to give any information and where they must deduct tax under the DIRT tax system they just deduct at the standard rate of tax.  There is no obligation on them to ensure that they are deducting at the correct rate.</P>
    <P>The Minister should look at the American system and if he finds it useful he should be prepared to implement it here. There is a fear in relation to this area. For some extraordinary reason we do not want to upset the system fixed by banks, bankers, speculators, stock exchanges, businesses, the FUE and the CII who are the people who control what the Minister for Finance will think or do.  The Minister should consider the American system in regard to access to bank accounts.  It is only through the tax system that the Americans have been able to get at Mafia gangsters, speculators and people like Al Capone.</P>
    <P>Another matter which concerns me is the £10 charge on cash cards.  This charge is not big but it is not a tax on the banks. It is a tax on consumers.  When it was first suggested most people thought that the Minister had made a mistake and that it was meant to be a tax on credit cards. This is to apply to the person who cannot get to a bank because it closes at 3 o'clock.  Cash cards are a method whereby people whose wages or cheque, whether social welfare or salary, are paid directly through the bank could draw cash <Col N="1523" /> whenever they wanted.  It is extraordinary that the Minister is opposed to that.  Perhaps he has some objection to new technology and would prefer people to queue in the banks for their money, as that is exactly what people will do.  They will throw away the cards and the Minister will gain nothing.  In effect the Minister is abolishing a new system.  Is that his reason or is he trying to bring in money?  If the Minister wishes to bring in money he should have no problem in increasing the levy on the banks as they have no shortage of money.  There seems to be some other reason which I cannot understand.  This suggestion is ludicrous. Perhaps the Minister made a mistake and is now refusing to admit it.  I appeal to him to look at this again and not make a fool of himself.</P>
    <P>Another area which concerns me is the removal of section 43 (1) of the Finance Act, 1968 in relation to disabled drivers. This also is difficult to understand.  The Irish Wheelchair Association and the Disabled Drivers' Association have been in touch with us and they are totally opposed to this move by the Minister. The Chairman of the Irish Wheelchair Association said in a letter that any scheme on mobility is, by definition a crunch issue for wheelchair users and he hopes that that observation made clear the disappointment felt at this uncalled for &ldquo;improvement&rdquo;.  The Minister has referred to this as an improvement.  The chairman also said that under every heading the benefits to the disabled driver under the emerging new scheme are a definite disimprovement on the old scheme.  The General Secretary of the Disabled Drivers' Association said:</P>
    <P>It is inconceivable that an Irish Government, supposedly operating within the constraints of Christian principles, and who only a few short years ago paid lip-service to the high ideals contained in the United Nations proposals for an International Year of Disabled People, should now propose to abolish the only bit of legislation which gives the disabled any rights under our <Col N="1524" /> Constitution.  Instead of providing more legislation to protect the rights of the disabled, they are dismantling the small bit we have.</P>
    <P>The General Secretary of the Disabled Drivers' Association said that in a letter to TDs of all parties dated 19 April 1988. I also received a letter from a physically disabled person which said:</P>
    <P>I am a physically disabled person and a member of the Disabled Drivers' Association of Ireland.  I would urge you to ensure that a difficult situation for disabled drivers is not made worse; please ensure that the terms of the 1968 Finance Act are retained, by voting against the measure.  I am not in any way against change or progress in this or any other area &mdash; but surely the people who must be listened to in this instance are the physically disabled. Why does the Minister not speak to the Disabled Drivers' Association and to the Irish Wheelchair Association?</P>
    <P>On Financial Resolution No. 2, on 27 January 1988 at column 403 of the Official Report the Taoiseach said:</P>
    <P>Though not strictly relevant to this, one Deputy raised the question of the change in regard to disabled drivers.  It was I who introduced that concession for disabled drivers in the first instance.</P>
    <P>That was in 1968 and he was very proud of it.  He went on to say:</P>
    <P>I will be very determined to ensure that the change in the system of administration does not in any way disadvantage disabled drivers.  I can give the Deputy a very solemn assurance on that.  I know a lot about that.  I assure him that this change is being made not to save money or disadvantage anybody but simply to have a more effective and efficiently administered system.</P>
    <P>He further went on to say that the new scheme would be devised in consultation with individuals and organisations representing disabled drivers, but it has not been brought in following consultation <Col N="1525" /> with individuals and organisations representing disabled drivers.  It has been brought in by a Minister for Finance who totally ignored what they had to say.  It seems the Taoiseach believes he knows what is best for disabled drivers.  He thinks they are like helpless little children who do not know what is best for themselves. I ask the Minister for Finance to take another look at this and to have discussions with the Minister for Health and the working group who are already working on this matter with disabled drivers and the Irish Wheelchair Association and the other organisations concerned and to change his mind on this issue.</P>
    <P>Those are the main points that I want to make on this Bill.  As I have said, I have moved our amendment on the basis of the first two factors I mentioned &mdash; the failure to make any effort to reform the tax system and the failure to take any measures to stimulate employment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>In listening to some of the speakers during the course of this debate today one would imagine that a certain kind of Utopia could be achieved by steamrolling State involvement into every sector of the economy.  The opposite has been proven to be the case. If we were to continue to do that into every area of development we would automatically steamroll the lifeblood out of the private sector.  That is not to say that the State does not have a role to play in industry but it is clear that the climate for growth has not been all it might have been.  One can, as Deputy Mac Giolla has said, get rid of capital allowances, impose more taxation on industry and make it not worthwhile to earn a few bob but the day you do that is the day you will make what is already an extremely difficult situation nationally far worse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I find it difficult to understand why Deputy Desmond attacked tax relief on covenants.  This was symbolic of a generalised attack on a certain segment of society.  It seemed to suggest that out there somewhere is a great mass of extremely wealthy people who can afford to pay for their children's education <i>ad lib</i> and who should not be entitled either <Col N="1526" /> to that relief or mortgage interest relief. In fact, the opposite is the case.  In terms of education and several other areas of activity, the new poor are the same classes about which Deputy Desmond spoke.  If a person is earning in excess of £13,000 and has a number of children he may have to educate every one of those children without any assistance from the State.  It is ludicrous to suggest that that class of person should not be entitled to relief from the State.  It is fair to say that mortgage interest relief which has been retained has been of enormous benefit to many people.  If this relief were to be eliminated there are many who would not be able to repay their mortgages.</P>
    <P>Up until recently this country failed to create an atmosphere in which the private sector could flourish in tandem with the public sector.  It is very easy to come into this House or stand on any platform in any part of the country and attack every measure which appears to be unpopular, as if the measure was unnecessary in the first place.  This kind of deception has been prevalent throughout the country over the past year but because of a sense of national pride which has always been part of the Irish character nobody, or very few at least, has been fooled by this. Everybody knows that the economy is in difficulty, that the Government do not like introducing measures which may be unpopular and that the medicine, although harsh at times, has to be swallowed. The people who suggest otherwise have offered few alternatives other than that the State should get more involved in the private sector or, if you like, take the private sector out.  That remedy has failed more than once and I could give numerous examples of its tragic effects. In listening to that line of argument one would imagine that every semi-State company has been a resounding success, made massive profits and was a model to all.  I wish that were the truth but of course it is not.  Clearly, that line of argument has to be rejected.</P>
    <P>This Bill which for the very first time addresses the question of tax reform in a real way has to be welcomed.  I would like briefly to deal with the background <Col N="1527" /> to the Bill.  As we all know, the greatest single debilitating factor in the economy is the level of the national debt.  In the last year, by the end of March, the Exchequer had raised virtually all its borrowing needs for the year with minimal recourse to net foreign borrowing.  Foreign borrowing is now at its lowest level since the late seventies.  This in turn has led to the creation of a new kind of atmosphere where stimulation of the economy can take place.</P>
    <P>Few would have believed a little more than 18 months ago that interest rates would have fallen to the level to which they have fallen.  Interest rates are now at their lowest level for ten years. Whether you are repaying a mortgage or getting a loan for a business this is obviously of crucial importance.  The reduction in inflation has been dramatic. Indeed, the Minister has stated that a further reduction in inflation to 2½ per cent or less on average this year is also in prospect.  Interest rates have fallen dramatically. Inflation is at its lowest rate in years.  We have succeeded at last in bringing borrowing down to its lowest level in years and everybody now agrees that for the first time in several years things are looking good and that there is light at the end of this tunnel.</P>
    <P>The enormous success of the Government is mirrored by the fact that inflation is now below the EC average.  It has been apparent for several years that there are significant weaknesses in the economy which the Government must continue to address.  In the context of the lowering inflation rates it is clear that we must continue to improve competitiveness, failing which the strategy might very well be denied the level of success which it clearly deserves.  It has to be borne in mind throughout the entire debate on this Bill and in justice to the young people in our national and second level schools that the national debt is still significantly high, that the problem has not yet been solved and that it is still there.  It has been abundantly apparent since the early eighties that, unless this country can break free from the debt spiral, we will not have the <Col N="1528" /> resources to invest in the infrastructure upon which industry and jobs can be created. Indeed, it is fair to say that this problem clouds all horizons for development and that this problem has to continue to be addressed, failing which success will be denied.</P>
    <P>It has been clear for a number of years that the taxation system has been stifling growth.  It has been stifling ambition and it has been stifling to the workers.  In the Finance Bill, 1988, for the first time the problem is addressed.  It is admitted that the tax reductions are not what they might be but at least there is a concession to those on PAYE and the Minister has stated that this year's tax changes are the beginning and not the end.  It is clear that the level of taxation is far too high and that it has to be tackled.  The attempts made to do this in this Bill have to be welcomed by any fair-minded person. Indeed, Deputy McDowell, spokesman for the Progressive Democrats, said last night that the introduction of a system of self-assessment was a tremendous achievement, and without any doubt in the world it was.  As I have said, the reductions in income tax are not as high as they might be but I hope that by continuing the present fiscal policies, we will achieve a level of equity in the taxation system which will compare favourably with other countries.</P>
    <P>It was with a certain amount of disbelief that I listened to Deputy Desmond last night attacking the Custom House Docks site development.  He said it was not planned and that when he was in Government only four concessions were given to the financiers and so on who were to go into the centre.  He said the Minister for Finance and the Government had given too many concessions. Everybody now knows why the Custom House Docks site was not proceeded with in the life of the previous Government. If you dig in your heels on these issues, fail to negotiate and fail to come up with agreement, you may be absolutely assured that nothing will happen.  Deputy Desmond and his Government succeeded very admirably in ensuring that nothing would happen, not just in that <Col N="1529" /> area but in others.  They succeeded extremely admirably in this instance. Now that the project is beginning Deputy Desmond has decided that too many concessions were given.  In all justice one has to say that, coming from a member of a Government who did nothing whatsoever about the matter, it took a brass neck to say that.</P>
    <P>The Custom House Docks site brings Ireland in a major way for the first time onto the international stage of finance and that has to be welcomed.  Its construction alone in the short term will provide considerable employment and subsequently it should be of enormous benefit to the Irish economy.  Its importance and its significance cannot be underestimated in any circumstances.</P>
    <P>The reintroduction in this Bill of section 23 of the Finance Act, 1981, is a significant change.  There is no question but that when in operation in the past it provided a welcome boost for the construction industry.  I would like to see section 23 of the Finance Act, 1981, extended to the public sector.  It has become apparent in the course of the last number of years that the amount of money available from the Exchequer for building council houses has been limited. I believe if the section 23 relief were given to the construction industry in the building of council houses, an arrangement whereby the builders would lease back the houses to the local authorities, we would achieve two significant aims. The first would be a considerable boost to the construction industry itself and the second would be the provision of local authority houses without the capital cost being borne, in the first instance, by the local authority.  This would solve a temporary problem and is something I would like to see implemented.</P>
    <P>The VHI tax scheme has been attacked on several fronts.  It seems that the main line of argument is that the consultants will increase their fees with a view to obtaining from their patients the amount of the tax which has to be paid.  I do not believe this line of argument will, in the final analysis, hold water.  It is clear that <Col N="1530" /> there would be no justification whatsoever for members of the medical profession to do this, and to do so would be morally wrong.  The situation must be closely monitored to ensure that this does not happen, and the good faith of the Minister in this respect should be respected.</P>
    <P>I mentioned self-assesment.  This is a radical, innovative and imaginative approach which places responsibility on the taxpayer for meeting his own tax obligations. It will streamline the system, significantly reduce the number of taxation appeals and clearly will reduce the levels of estimated tax.  The situation where an inspector of taxes sends out demands, very often for exorbitant amounts, and the subsequent appeals and comings and goings between accounts and the inspector of taxes office, was clearly ridiculous.  This new method of assessment is something which must be welcomed as a realistic step forward and one which was very badly needed.</P>
    <P>I welcome the levy on the banks.  They, too, have a social obligation to the country, at large.  They make considerably profits and the argument could be made that they should contribute even more to the economy from which they benefit so much.  The banks in this country are in a relatively sacrosanct position and it is only right that they would contribute significantly towards the development of the country particularly at this time.  The levy has to be welcomed by all right-thinking people.</P>
    <P>The relief for foreign dividends was attacked and I cannot understand why. Section 38 makes provision for the repatriation of dividends earned abroad by the subsidiaries of Irish companies.  If we did not give the concession, do the people who are attacking this provision seriously believe the funds would be returned to this country?  It is a ludicrous argument to suggest that that relief should not be given, an argument that has more to do with ideology than with the interests of the country.  It has more to do with some kind of cuckooland principle than with solving our economic difficulties. It smacks of a sort of throw away <Col N="1531" /> to the people who would be left of left, if I may use that term, because it is quite clear that the repatriation to this country of dividends earned abroad can only be of benefit to the country, and anything which is of benefit to the country should not be opposed for opposition's sake.</P>
    <P>The intention here is that the funds repatriated to this country would be used for investment within the country, and the Minister has made it clear that it will be necessary to show that these repatriated funds will be directed towards the maintenance and creation of employment here.  Now we have reached the stage where those who are opposed to this money coming in free of tax are logically against the investment of that money for the creation of employment here.  That is what the far left have said &mdash; they are against it.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to understand that kind of logic in a country which has faced such severe difficulties over the last number of years.  It is difficult, if not impossible, to understand that kind of lunacy.  That is the kind of perverted thinking that has left much of this country in extreme difficulty over the last number of years.</P>
    <P>Let it be clearly said that there is nothing wrong with repatriated funds coming into the country free of tax in order that the money may be used towards the maintenance or creation of employment here.  If anybody on the Left does not agree with me, he can go into the streets of Camden Town or talk to the young people on unemployment assistance all over the country, and they will tell him what is happening.</P>
    <P>Those who criticise such a measure would be better off interviewing those who will gain as a result of it.  In my view this measure is something different and it in many ways reflects the spirit of the Bill.  It amounts to a new approach to dealing with our difficult problems.  It is time we approached the problems of taxation, of investment and of duties in a new way, taking into consideration that old modes and practices in regard to taxation and of approach to the economy are obsolete.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1532" /> The Bill is an indication of the commitment of the Government to a new approach.  Conservatism in taxation and in regard to our other problems will not serve the unemployed and will do a disservice to our youth in the long term. Therefore, the innovations in the Bill to try to solve our difficult problems are to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>Listening to some speakers one would imagine that we do not have taxation of farmers.  People give the impression that a Bill has been introduced banning all taxation of farmers but that is not so.  The Government have said that farmers will have to submit tax returns and will be liable to pay tax, like everybody else.  It is ludicrous to try to create the impression, for whatever mischievous reasons, that farmers do not have to pay tax.  The opposite happens to be the case.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mac Giolla said that many of the companies that were given tax relief by the Government were the same companies that put 40,000 people out of work.  His solution to that problem was to get companies to pay more tax and not give them any tax concessions.  The day that type of thinking is adopted is the day the ground will be cut from under us. However, in this context Deputy Mac Giolla made one good point.  He pointed out, very fairly, that grants given by the Government to provide industry very often did not create the number of jobs expected.</P>
    <P>It is abundantly clear that in the channelling of moneys into industry by the Industrial Development Authority we must concentrate on the creation of jobs. The amount of money given to any project should in the first instance be directly related to the number of jobs created. In other words, there should be no free handouts and those in receipt of grants must be obliged to create the jobs for which the grant was intended.  I accept that that philosophy has been followed up to now but in too many cases those who received grants did not create the number of jobs for which the money was intended.  That must end.  If it does not I will be very disappointed.</P>
    <P>An allegation was made that the Bill <Col N="1533" /> did not do anything to deal with unemployment. That is not true.  The fact that interest rates have been driven downwards, that there is an attempt to reform the taxation system, that inflation is at its lowest level for years and that our borrowing requirement is at its lowest level for years automatically starts to create the correct climate for the creation of employment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>It has to be emphasised that the Bill increases tax revenue in the State by £146 million this year and any attempt by Fianna Fáil to try to convince people that it amounts to an effort to reduce the tax burden is false.  In some areas tax is being increased in an anomalous and unfair way.  It is true that the Fine Gael Party gave broad support to the budget and through their underwriting and underpinning of the Government's efforts, are providing to improve the public finances, a level of constructive opposition that was not provided heretofore by any political party.  That is evident from the fact that we are not opposing the Second Stage of the Bill. The strength of the Government, if they are perceived to be strong, is only as strong as Fine Gael will permit by their decisions in the House.</P>
      <P>In the budget the Government missed a number of opportunities to improve the position of the country.  We should not look at the Bill only in the context of the national debt or of the extent of our unemployment problem.  We should remember that in 1992 there will be a new competitive position in Europe as a result of the single European market and that in 1993 the Channel Tunnel will be in operation.  All the pressures in the nineties must be to remove the structural inefficiencies and defects in our economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must act in a way which will resolve our problems <i>vis-à-vis</i> our lack of competitiveness. For that reason my major criticism of this Bill is that its provisions have not made any attempt to deal with the reform of our tax code.  There has <Col N="1534" /> been no attempt to deal with the problems which will arise from tax harmonisation in 1992.  The Government have dodged this issue.  For a country so heavily dependent on indirect taxation, that will be a major problem for us in the years ahead.  It should be addressed now because any changes proposed will have to be phased in over a period.  It is interesting to note that the problems of tax harmonisation are the subject of an indepth analysis by the OECD countries at present, representing trade unions and management.  They are arriving at a number of conclusions we would need to examine.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that one can reform one's tax code in a way that will have a neutral or minimal effect on the level of revenue yield.  Our reform should incorporate the recommendations of the Commission on Taxation on simplicity and equity in the administration of our tax code.  There was little movement toward simplicity in personal or company taxation in this budget.  There has been no attempt whatsoever made to reduce the disincentive effects of personal income tax which have resulted in a major growth in the brain drain and the black economy. We have seen an indexation of bands and allowances barely marking time.  Overall income tax revenue will rise this year.</P>
    <P>There were some detailed, imaginative reforms I should like to have seen introduced in this latest budget which have not been proposed.  Every speaker so far has said that the ultimate purpose of the Government's and all our efforts is the creation and stimulation of employment. There has been no attempt made to utilise the tax code to that purpose.  I might cite a scheme in operation in America called the jobs tax credit scheme under whose provisions every employer who recruits an additional employee receives a subsidy by way of voucher or tax credit against the company's tax liability for that year, whether it be $1,000 the first year, or $500 the second year.  It would be very simple to incorporate such a scheme into our system.</P>
    <P>We have a live register of unemployed people.  There are in existence already <Col N="1535" /> different provisions whereby people taken off the dole can be given a subsidy under the provisions of the employment incentive scheme.  We need to reverse the balance of the payroll tax costs by the introduction of such a jobs tax credit, under which an employer would receive a credit of, say, £600 in the first year and £400 in the second year provided the relevant employee is retained for that period in full insurable employment. Such a credit would go towards an employer's PRSI tax bill or the company's PAYE liability.  Such a scheme would ensure that employers would be able to submit such vouchers with their P35 returns or at the end of each year.</P>
    <P>I have had umpteen examples of the disincentive to employment obtaining. For example, if employers want to take on an additional employee and pay him or her say, £100 or £150 a week, they fall into a state of relapse when they ascertain from their accountant the total cost involved.  One must remember that one is talking of something in the region of an additional 25 per cent on top of wage costs when one takes into account the taxes that have to be remitted, employer's liability insurance obligations, and so on.  Therefore, it will be seen readily that there is no real mystery about the huge growth in the casual labour market, why the provisions of the Jobsearch programme must be invoked to deal with people who are working and signing on simultaneously.  There is no mystery about the fact that employers are doing everything possible to invest in new plant and machinery in order to do away with labour.  Until we seriously examine the tax treatment of labour here there will not be any serious growth in employment.</P>
    <P>There is also a limitation on the level of potential growth of employment in certain sectors on which we depended in the past, such as manufacturing industry.  We shall also have to examine the potential growth of employment in the personal services sector.  I am talking about transferring from the black into the white economy <Col N="1536" /> personal services, work undertaken casually at present in the form of, say, gardening, house cleaning, baby sitting. That is an area which all the international forecasters contend will grow.  The question must be posed: will those services grow here within or without the taxation system?  There are many married mothers at work who would like to be able to avail of tax benefits in order to employ such people.  There is a great need to have this sector organised thereby affording people additional employment opportunities. There is nothing by way of provision in this Bill for employers' PRSI, jobs tax credit or for the creation of growth in the personal services employment sector.</P>
    <P>In relation to income tax I should say that the previous Government &mdash; of which my party were a member &mdash; introduced a change in the income tax system <i>vis-à-vis</i> families.  The tax free allowance for children was abolished and the child benefit scheme introduced.  With the benefit of hindsight I can say it was wrong to have abolished the tax free allowance for children.  The financial demands, particularly on relatively low paid workers with large families, are enormous.  Looking at the social welfare system one would have to conclude that, in respect of nearly all types of semiskilled or unskilled employment here, if one has more than four children, it would not pay one to go to work.  With such an abundance of work available on a casual, black economy type basis, undoubtedly it is paying people not to be employed officially.  We shall have to re-examine the question of tax free allowances for children, especially those of large families of low paid workers.  That whole poverty trap between the social welfare and taxation systems is of this House's creation.</P>
    <P>There must also be questions raised about this Government's commitment to community health care.  In all of the glossy reports produced this is something regarded as being worthy and supported by everybody.  In practical terms one might well ask: what is being done about it other than the closure of hospitals?  I <Col N="1537" /> remember when the present Minister for Agriculture and Food stood where I am now standing.  Every year he tabled amendments to the Finance Bill incorporating an increase in the tax free allowance for people who minded dependent relatives who were ill, who would otherwise be hospitalised, who would otherwise cost the State a minimum of £150 a week.  If we are serious about community care &mdash; as they are in other countries about contending that elderly and sick people should be treated in their family environment, we should allow our taxation system to respond and ensure that that allowance is extended.</P>
    <P>It is with great regret that I note the treatment of the disabled under the provisions of section 54 of this Bill.  Practically every speaker to date has referred to the disgraceful decision to abolish the concessions given to disabled drivers.  I appeal to the Minister for Finance to re-examine that decision.  This must be seen in the context of the abolition last year, in many cases, of the mobility allowance payable by health boards.  Previously disabled people were entitled to three concessions &mdash; cheaper petrol, cheaper cars and a concession with regard to motor taxation.  We are told by some civil servants in the Department of Finance that the mechanisms that have worked since 1968 are now, for some reason, too cumbersome, too unwidely.  How is it we were not told every year for the past ten that they were too cumbersome?  They were not.</P>
    <P>This is a penny-pinching exercise, worse than any of the rhetoric I have read of well before my time in this House, such as taking a shilling off the old age pension.  This is downright unfair and unreasonable.  The one thing disabled people value, that affords them independence, is their mobility.  I ask the Government to reconsider this decision. Otherwise it will mean disabled people will have to pay more for their cars. Neither does it take account of the fact that they must have special features on their vehicles such as automatic transmission because they are unable to change gears and so on.  All of these <Col N="1538" /> practical considerations must be taken into account in their case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4, 5, 12 and 22 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Fisheries Acts and the issue of angling licences are the statutory <Col N="1544" /> responsibility of my colleague, the Minister for the Marine, who took into account a range of factors, including tourism interests, before deciding to introduce the rod angling licence fee.</P>
    <P>A small number of brochures printed by Bord Fáilte prior to the announcement of the proposal to introduce the licence fee made reference to the availability of free coarse fishing.  However, brochures distributed since November last referred to the possibility of the introduction of licensing and imposition of licence fees for the 1988 season.  In addition, Bord Fáilte have fully appraised tour operators of the position and made every effort to alert tourists to the licensing requirement before, or on, their arrival in Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has made no reference to the present problems particularly in the west which I believe are affecting tourism seriously, I refer to the appalling carry on of some of the anglers over there which is disgraceful and should not be tolerated by anyone.  In that regard would the Minister agree that angling as a tourism product is probably one of the best natural products we have available to promote out of this country and that where it has been most successful in other countries, the way it has gone forward is by the angling clubs themselves in these countries being responsible for developing fishing and for gaining the income from tourism such as is intended in respect of the licence in this country? Would he not consider it a possibility that the angling clubs in this country should be allowed to collect the licence fee in the first instance from their own members and then from the tourists for utilisation within the local areas primarily&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy that it is a very important tourism ingredient and for some areas, such as my own, the only one we can rely on.  However, at this stage I have to enter a caveat.  I have learned just today that court proceedings have been instituted challenging the legality of the regulations on grounds of constitutionality.  I must be careful, therefore, not to be in breach of the <i>sub judice</i> rule.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>This is much too serious a problem for the tourist industry to become a matter of party political politics, therefore I will attempt to be very temporate in what I say here.  The Minister is the person responsible for tourism and, as Deputy Cullen has said, the first tourism into this country was through angling.  Unfortunately, we are getting an extremely bad press abroad about this aspect of our tourism industry.  The cuttings from foreign papers surely must be on the Minister's desk.  In view of that, will he not say to his colleague, the Minister for the Marine, that he should withdraw this new licence charge until the beginning of next year until talks can take place with the responsible members?  I endorse what Deputy&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>With respect, it is within his sphere of responsibility to talk to the Minister for the Marine and point out the damage that has been done abroad to Irish tourism.  Unfortunately, damage will be done this year, but the major damage will be done in 1989 and 1990 and the years afterwards.  It is essential for tourism that this measure be withdrawn now so that talks can take place between now and the end of the year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate what the Deputy has said, that it is not a matter <Col N="1546" /> for party political wrangling.  When it is a question of another Minister in Government I am conscious of my obligation under Article 28.4.2º of the Constitution with regard to Cabinet responsibility.  I must repeat that I am being very careful, in view of the information brought to me today that there is a challenge on constitutional grounds and as court proceedings are imminent I am making no further comment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the Minister's responsibility for tourism, will he say whether, because of the considerable damage being done by the rod licensing law, the figures for tourism which he has projected are unlikely to be achieved? Also, in view of the fact that the whole purpose was to raise additional revenue for central Government, would the Minister agree that the polluters are the ones who should have been asked to pay?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I am at one with the Deputy in the belief that polluters should pay and I think that principle is applied not merely in this country but throughout Europe.  I believe also with regard to pollution that there are very few voluntary polluters and that those who pollute our waters wilfully should be brought to heel.  So far as my Department are concerned I accept the view that confrontation in this matter at present can only do further damage to our tourism effort.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I must ask the Minister if he is seriously asking us to believe that he heard only today of the writ or plenary summons that the Munster trout anglers have served on the Government.  It is a matter of some weeks now since the Attorney General accepted that writ on behalf of the Government.  I am in possession of that information for a matter of weeks and I find it hard to believe the Minister.  However, I accept his word. He is a member of the Cabinet so I find it very strange.  If he insists that we accept what he says I will certainly do so, but let me put a question to him in relation to that writ, and I understand the <Col N="1547" /> sensitivity of what we are talking about. Could he prevail on his colleague, the Minister for the Marine, Deputy Daly, to treat this with the same sensitivity as obviously he, the Minister for Tourism and Transport, is treating it?  Could he suggest to the Minister for the Marine that until this writ has been finally settled, until the matter has come to a conclusion one way or another, the legislation in question must be put in abeyance?  I do not want it withdrawn at this point but I think it should be put in abeyance because even if prosecutions are taken what happens is that the solicitor for the defendants in all cases&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I appreciate there is a division of responsibility under the Constitution but I appeal to him to use his influence as Minister for Tourism and Transport with the Minister for the Marine to have this matter postponed for this year.

The local authorities usually make a contribution and, rightly, then expect to have representation on the regional tourism organisations.  The size of the boards is one of the major problems that must be settled in the reorganisation.</P>

I find it very difficult to believe that if there is a problem Aer Rianta have not already solved it because I have the greatest confidence in their commercial ability and the accounts are there to prove it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that what we are witnessing is a problem that could possibly get worse because of increased air traffic on a bilateral basis between the UK and Ireland and in the EC generally?  Airport authorities get a direct contribution per passenger increase so their funds have gone up, but there is not agreement within the EC or between the UK and Ireland to start increasing the levels of service which air traffic controllers need in resources and staff.  That problem is becoming more obvious with these types of incident occurring more regularly.  Is any progress being made in this area and does the Minister accept that this is part of the problem?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the first part of the Deputy's statement to the effect that the increase in traffic has caused problems, particularly at the London airports. I can answer for this Government and my own Department in that we have scheduled £30 million expenditure for increasing the facilities available for air traffic control.  I know that about £300 million has been allocated for similar investment in the London area.  The EC are fully <Col N="1556" /> conscious of what is happening.  Various airports have flow control regulations in operation because of the huge increase in the number of aircraft using the airports.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister accept that in the EC context the problem I have highlighted will directly affect Irish passengers travelling to European resorts this summer and that there is an undercapacity in manpower and resources affecting the ability of air traffic controllers to handle the number of aircraft flying through the various corridors? What proposals is the Minister putting forward at EC ministerial level to deal with this problem?</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Tourism and Transport if his attention has been drawn to the fact that there was a recent exclusive agreement between Aer Rianta and Aer Lingus on the handling of passengers and luggage from foreign airlines at Dublin Airport; if the purpose of this exclusive agreement is to prevent independent Irish airlines from being involved in these functions; and if <Col N="1557" /> a derogation has been sought from EC competition policy for the agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>New arrangements in relation to ground handling at Dublin Airport were introduced recently.  The main features of the new arrangements involve:</P>
      <P>(i) a formal agreement between Aer Rianta and Aer Lingus under which the latter have been granted sole rights to engage in ground handling for third party carriers for a period of three years;</P>
      <P>(ii) a substantial reduction ranging to over 30 per cent depending on aircraft type on the published charges for ground handling which previously applied;</P>
      <P>(iii) a formal mechanism under which carriers who are unhappy with the standard or cost of the service offered or provided by Aer Lingus can appeal to Aer Rianta.  The responsibility of Aer Rianta in this regard is to ensure that the Aer Lingus service is efficient and reasonably priced and their findings on any appeal are binding on Aer Lingus;</P>
      <P>(iv) continuation of the right of any carrier to engage in handling its own aircraft;</P>
      <P>(v) permission for a carrier already engaged in self-handling to handle for any carrier for whom he acts as general sales agent;</P>
      <P>(vi) carriers engaged in self-handling may be allowed by Aer Rianta to co-operate in relation to the sharing of equipment, etc.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the new arrangements is to ensure the availability of an efficient and reasonably priced ground handling service for all the carriers using Dublin Airport and to maintain the high operational and safety standards of the airport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many of the features of the revised arrangements are entirely new.  In particular I am satisfied that they represent a <Col N="1558" /> significant improvement on the situation which existed previously and that the changes will substantially benefit all the carriers using Dublin Airport, including the independent Irish airlines involved.</P>
    <P>It was not necessary to seek a derogation from EC competition policy in respect of the new ground handling arrangements.  The Council of the European Communities has already decided that certain categories of agreements and practices in the air transport sector, including those relating to ground handling, should be exempted from the competition provisions of the Treaty of Rome and the Commission is at present drawing up regulations in this regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Was there competition for these handling rights?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as I know the arrangements was made between Aer Lingus and Aer Rianta, and submissions from other private airlines were received.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Would I be correct in saying that there was no competition?  I suspect that there was no competition. Considering this is a very lucrative operation and that activities on the ground at airports account for 25 per cent of the overall ticket price, surely the Minister should be extremely concerned that there would be competition to ensure that the most competitive operator gets the contract.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy that this is a very important matter.  It is so important that we had a detailed and comprehensive examination of the whole area of ground handling which concluded in December 1987.  The two other independent airlines and their position with regard to the provision of full ground handling service was discussed and assessed at that time.  The revised arrangements I have outlined in detail in my answer resulted from that examination and the Deputy can be assured that in enforcing the 30 per cent reduction we were fully conscious of the points he has made.</P>

    <Col N="1559" />
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I make is that this seems to be a nice cosy arrangement between two State bodies and that other Irish airlines are not being given an opportunity to tender for this type of operation, which, as I pointed out earlier, is very lucrative and must assist an airline in making profits and in operating.  I would appreciate if the Minister bears this in mind and sees that everybody is given a fair crack of the whip.  Competition has led to lower air fares to and from this country.  If the handling charges are not competitive it will lead to inflated prices because of their input into the overall fare structure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept what the Deputy says, and that it is important to get the very best value from the particular service. It was because of its importance that I had a detailed examination and review made, out of which these new rules came. If it were a cosy arrangement before, then it is 30 per cent less cosy now.</P>

      <P>The Minister mentioned attracting back-track traffic from Europe as one of the targets but what is his view in that the airlines, and Ryanair in particular, have not got agreement for the lower air fares from the other European countries?  As I understand it, they are not getting any co-operation for the new low fares out of Europe.  What is the current position?  Are Europe ganging up on us?</P>

In the special campaigns, a major sales force are now touring Germany, France and Switzerland up to 6 May.

Some months ago a review was under consideration and a sum of £1 million was mentioned in the newspapers last week by Ryanair and the board of Farranfore Airport.  May I ask the Minister if he will go further than saying they have outlined to Farranfore Airport what is necessary and say that the Government will support financially, which obviously is the crux of this matter, the efforts of the directors of this airport to give Kerry the air link which it needs so badly at present?

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware from my reply to his previous question on 11 November 1987 the first phase <Col N="1568" /> in the Aer Lingus fleet replacement programme was implemented last autumn with the delivery of two new B737 &mdash; 300 aircraft.  In November last following consideration of the matter by the Aer Lingus Inter-departmental Review Group, the Government approved the acquisition by Aer Lingus of four new B737 &mdash; 500 aircraft for delivery in late 1990 mainly to replace existing aircraft on the Continental European routes.</P>
      <P>Aer Lingus have submitted recently to my Department a further proposal to acquire two new Boeing 737-400 aircraft for delivery in 1989 to serve anticipated growth in traffic on the Ireland&mdash;London routes.</P>
      <P>This proposal is currently being examined by the Inter-departmental Review Group which is examining the whole question of Aer Lingus fleet replacement up to the mid-nineties and assessing the company's overall investment strategy and financing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a number of specifics in the Minister's reply for which I thank him.  May I take it that the most recent proposal in respect of 737-400s would not be involved in any reliance on State funding?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to hear that. In reply to a similar question in March last year, the Minister indicated that no decision in regard to funding a replacement fleet would be taken until the review body had reported.  We were advised in November that that would be early this year.  It was my understanding that there would be a report available to the Minister and to the House for discussion on the whole question of funding.  It now appears that matters are moving along piecemeal.  Can the Minister indicate if we can ever expect discussions on the whole future of replacement funding schemes?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The 300s, the 500s and the prospective 400s will deal with the London-Dublin and continental routes. <Col N="1569" /> The only other significant factor then is the replacement of the jumbos which is down the road in the nineties.  It seems quite a rational way for dealing with it. There have been interim studies and reports and arising from these progress with regard to the 300s and the 500s has already been made.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to repeat this but initially there were indications that the Minister was getting a report in principle on the whole question of funding. Is that position now abandoned in favour of the scheme for scheme so that there will not be an opportunity to discuss it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope we will have plenty of opportunities to discuss Aer Lingus, their activities and their fleet.  The position was that by March of 1987 a complete change took place in the thinking of Aer Lingus.  Circumstances had changed.  The dollar was weaker.  Fuel was lower in price.  Interest rates were more favourable and they were making better profits and that changed the scenario that existed before that.  From that point, that is, from March of last year on, decisions have been taken step by step.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Since other airlines have been given licences to operate to Britain and to continental Europe in recent years, does the Minister feel there may not be a need for the smaller planes he is suggesting are required by Aer Lingus for those routes, given the greater competition from other airlines; that there may be an earlier need for an additional jumbo, given that Bord Fáilte are going ahead with the task force recommendations on a special programme for traffic to North America? Despite the change in the dollar, in another year or two we could have substantially increased traffic from the United States.  There may be a need to change the type of plane and things may not be as they are at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the 300 could be called a small plane.  It has 135 <Col N="1570" /> seats.  The 400 has 153 seats and is a substantial plane.  As I mentioned in my reply to the supplementary by Deputy McCartan, the jumbo is really a transatlantic requirement.  As of now some people have written to me indicating that a smaller twin-engined plane will be able to deal with the Atlantic before very long, but I do not think there is any urgent need for a jumbo as of now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Tourism and Transport the progress, if any, he has made at EC level in obtaining permission for Irish hauliers to have lorry trailer units waiting at continental sea ports for delivery of goods within the member states at which the goods are landed; and his views on whether the present system whereby Irish hauliers must transport the lorry and driver with the trailer unit is adding greatly to the cost of Irish products.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The type of operation described by the Deputy comes within the definition of cabotage, i.e. point-topoint haulage within another member state.  At present this type of operation is not permitted within the member states of the EC.  The EC Commission has submitted proposals to the Council of Transport Ministers aimed at introducing cabotage.  Progress has been slow, however, because some member states have serious reservations about its introduction.</P>
      <P>Until a satisfactory resolution can be reached at EC level on the cabotage issue, the type of operation described by the Deputy cannot be introduced, even though it would add to some extent to the overall cost-effectiveness of Irish haulage operations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>My understanding of cabotage is slightly different from the <Col N="1571" /> Minister's.  I thought that where an Irish haulier wanted to collect at a point in Europe and deliver to another European country that was primarily cabotage. What I am speaking about is the way things operate at the moment directly from Ireland as base country into Europe.  What progress has been made on the cabotage issue?  The Minister has indicated that it has been slow, but have any proposals of any description been agreed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I must confess to the Deputy that I, too, when I first got the question, thought that the definition of cabotage was as the Deputy said.  I double checked it and, in fact, it is regarded as cabotage within the meaning of that word within the European Community.  It is true that no progress has been made because many people see it as a grave threat to their business.  Some of our own haulier associations are very much opposed to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that liberal Ministers like himself are not able to persuade a lot of conservative Ministers within the EC such as those in Germany where even local internal hauliers cannot get into the market?  How does the Minister see this coming to fruition? Have there been any agreements on rights of establishment within the EC countries by the Irish hauliers.?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>To take the latter part of the question first, the right of establishment is guaranteed by the Treaty of Rome.  Needless to say, in various areas of economic life it has to be paced.  I would be reluctant to comment on the conservatism or liberalism of the Ministers in other EC countries.  Suffice it to say that many of them have serious problems.  For example, the country which was mentioned by the Deputy which provides autobahns for the rest of Europe does not charge any tolls but when their hauliers are in other countries they are often charged tolls sometimes in <Col N="1572" /> excess of those charged to native hauliers. There are problems of harmonisation of taxes, fuel costs and so on.  All these are under discussion at the moment.  It is true that at the last Council of Ministers meeting we reached an almost unanimous decision &mdash; one out of the 12 objected &mdash; to interim arrangements to carry us up to 1992.  We are having a meeting in Germany in the near future and I would hope that we might get agreement on what was almost agreed the last time.  If we do, it will benefit our hauliers very significantly and it will be a step on the road to full liberalisation.</P>

      <P>I can understand what the Minister is saying.  I am glad the Minister has mentioned 1992, because this question very much looks down that road. Whether we like it or not, or whether we do or do not like to comment on people in other countries, we must get agreement from this country's point of view.  Has any progress been made on agreement and on recognition of the island states in the EC?  We are faced with extraordinary difficulties in this whole transport area. What specific proposals is the Minister trying to get approved to improve our position?</P>

      <P>I can assure the Deputy &mdash; and this is one of the agreeable surprises of the EC &mdash; that as far as Ireland is concerned there is, I am not saying a universal, but an almost universal attempt to make special provisions for us.  This is a reality with regard, for example, to air transport where we, in company with Portugal, obtained special concessions.  In regard to the package which I mentioned a moment ago, if we had got that through, all hauliers who have applied for international licences in Ireland would be satisfied.  That I would regard as a significant step forward in the liberalisation of road transport.</P>

      <P>Finally, does the Minister accept that we must have some agreement before 1992?  We must be able to move into the areas we want to move into.  It is no use waking up in 1992 and <Col N="1573" /> being faced with an onslaught.  Even if there is not agreement throughout Europe on the whole package, we must seek agreement, from our point of view, to give us opportunities as soon as possible to start operating that system.  Does the Minister think that there will be any progress in this regard within the next 12 months?  Is he hopeful that even Ireland's position can start to move forward?</P>

      <P>Before we adjourned I was speaking in relation to section 54 on the change for disabled drivers.  All Deputies have received representations from the Irish Wheelchair Association, the Disabled Drivers Association, from people suffering from multiple sclerosis and so on outlining their concern about the changes which will increase the cost of motoring for them.  Since 1968 these people have enjoyed the benefits of cheaper petrol, VAT refunds and lower motor tax.  It is extraordinary that 20 years later this scheme is described as cumbersome. Why was it not described as cumbersome before?  This seems to be a most unfair penny pinching exercise.  The Taoiseach gave a solemn commitment to this House that as he had originally introduced this scheme, he would ensure that disabled drivers would not be less well off.  I earnestly call on the Minister to look again at this measure.</P>
      <P>Section 52 deals with the £10 charge for bank cards.  This is not only a tax on technology but a tax on a sensible security precaution.  The level of tax at 20p a week is not excessive but the principle of the tax is unfair.  If money is required it is credit cards such as Visa cards and Access cards that should be taxed.  The profit margins of those financial companies are very high and they could absorb such a stamp duty charge.  As it is, the proposal is indiscriminate and arbitrary and it will penalise people who were using cash cards, not because they were high rolling bank clients but simply because they could not get into the banks during the restricted opening hours and were advised by their employers to get into the cashless system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been a lot of debate on section 68 which relates to the amnesty. While we must have concern for people who paid the full amount of tax prior to the announcement of the amnesty, on balance the amnesty is worthy of support. There is a need to wipe the slate clean once and for all and get tax arrears up to date, and to follow that by very rigorous follow up on current taxes by the Revenue Commissioners.  The big problem in the debt collection business is that the <Col N="1606" /> longer the arrears grow, the more difficult it is to collect them.  The Revenue Commissioners ended up taking a major stake in a lot of companies because they were not on top of their own collection procedures and bi-monthly returns lapsed into six monthly returns and so on.  That must be avoided or else we will need another amnesty in two years time and there will be a net loss to those who genuinely pay their taxes all the time.</P>
    <P>There has been much debate in relation to self assessment and the power of attachment and this is covered extensively in sections 9 to 20 and in section 69.  It is a major change in our tax system and it would be foolish to think that every self-employed person is <i>au fait</i> with the fundamental change that is taking place and with the new responsibility placed on taxpayers to remit their returns of income and their cheques.  I have no doubt that the standard of accountancy here is very patchy and the quality of some accountants has left a lot to be desired.  Some people who have a blank mind in relation to tax forms immediately hand them to their accountants and 18 months later, because the accountant has been negligent, matters are in arrears.  Any sheriff can outline the difficulties with accountants. In order to introduce self assessment we need a major publicity campaign alerting people to their new responsibilities in relation to returns of income. This Bill imposes new stiff penalties for non-compliance with the system and many people are not aware of the new procedure and have a naive attitude to the tax now in that they believe that no news is good news and that if they do not hear anything from the tax man everything if all right.  Under self assessment the opposite is the case.  The obligation is on the taxpayer.  I foresee major teething problems with this.  Each taxpayer must be fully advised of the procedures.</P>
    <P>I support the power of attachment which is to be introduced on 1 October in relation to getting taxes paid but there are problems.  The principle of the power of attachment is that whatever is owing to the taxpayer who owes the tax is genuine money available to the taxpayer.  What is <Col N="1607" /> the situation where a small businessman incurs major bad debts because some of his traders do not pay him?  Will the Revenue Commissioners accept an IOU in that case?  In many cases the cash difficulties of small businesses arises because of the domino effect of other business failures.  The power of attachment should be used very sparingly and only where there is an undeniable case that the taxpayer is unfairly not meeting his obligations. This proposal should be reviewed in that there should be a set of criteria as to when the power of attachment will be used.</P>
    <P>There may be a loophole in the power of attachment in that amounts that are in dispute cannot be subject to the power of attachment.  Taken at face value I could say in relation to any taxes I owed which the Revenue Commissioners wished to pursue via a third party debt, that the amount was in dispute and I could therefore avoid the powers in this legislation.  Perhaps when replying the Minister will clarify that?</P>
    <P>Next week I will be tabling an amendment on Committee Stage in relation to one of the most unfair anomalies I have come across in the system.  I hope the Minister for Finance to whom I have written on a number of occasions about this matter and who has not replied to me in any detail, will take particular note of this when replying to the debate.  When the Farm Tax Act 1985 was in operation, on 10 December 1986 the Department of the Environment sent a circular, FIN 33/86, to every local authority in the country in relation to the Farm Tax Act. A certain paragraph in it said:</P>
    <P>As you are aware the Finance Act, 1986 allows farmers who pay their farm tax in the current tax year to offset this amount against any income tax liability arising in 1986-87.  The Government however announced at the end of September that the income tax concessions would be improved for those farmers who pay their farm tax before the end of 1986.  The improvement will be the facility to offset any unused portion of <Col N="1608" /> the 1986 farm tax credit against their income tax liability for 1985-86 and 1987-88.</P>
    <P>You may consider it appropriate to advise persons from whom farm tax has been demanded of the new arrangements, so as to improve early collection of the tax.</P>
    <P>Arising out of that circular on 15 December, Wexford County Council sent the following letter to people in my constituency who were due to pay the farm tax:</P>
    <P>Dear Sir or Madam,</P>
    <P>I refer to the demand for farm tax issued to you on 1 December 1986. Under the Finance Act, 1986, farmers who pay their farm tax in the current tax year can offset this amount against any income tax liability arising in 1986-87.  The council has now been advised by the Department that in addition to this facility any farmer who pays his or her farm tax before the end of 1986 will be able to offset any unused portion of the 1986 farm tax credit against their income tax liability for 1985-86 and 1987-88.</P>
    <P>That written commitment, made by Government Ministers to Dáil Éireann and by the Department of Finance to local authorities and to the farmers, is on the record in black and white and has been broken.  It is very serious that our public affairs should be treated in this way. Many of my constituents paid their farm tax by 31 December 1986 on the understanding that they would get credit against their income tax bill for 1986-87 and 1987-88 and I have tabled an amendment to meet that commitment.  It is disgraceful if assurances given by Ministers and by officials in the Department are abandoned at the stroke of a pen.  I hope the Minister will look favourably at my amendment which will involve a very small cost on the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>In this Bill there is a change in relation to VAT refund to farmers.  It is extraordinary that the Minister for Finance should say he is reducing the VAT refund <Col N="1609" /> of £9 million to farmers because some of them have not paid their health contributions. In the normal course of events I would not mind that because there should be some penalty for not complying with the system, but why is he penalising farmers who have paid their health contributions? By changing the VAT refund system the Minister is doing this just that. That argument does not hold water.  This is a very arbitrary and unfair decision.</P>
    <P>Another anomaly about which I am very concerned is the increase in the PAYE allowance from £700 to £800.  It has always been blatantly clear in the work area that there is no difference between the sons and daughters of employers and other employees.  The fact that they are not allowed this £800 allowance is very unfair.  I ask the Minister to look at this on Committee Stage because every year the anomaly is worsening.</P>
    <P>Section 27 is very important.  There has been a lot of talk about the Financial Services Centre and the job potential there.  In my view there is fantastic potential for at least 1,000 jobs in a future market, where people can buy forward in stocks and commodities as a hedge against inflation while others sell on the same basis.  The IDA have done a substantial amount of work in this area.  I welcome the incentives provided and hope it is not long before this centre is in operation.</P>
    <P>One of the facts which emerged from a recent OECD study on tax reforms in member states between management and unions was the effect of our tax structure on competitiveness.  One of the striking conclusions they came to was that increases in VAT did not affect competitiveness but increases in excise duty did.  It strikes me as very alarming that, in a year when we are spending £4 million on tourism, we have adopted the simplistic answer of putting 8p on a gallon of petrol.  In my opinion it is wrong not to take the view that there is a direct link between competitiveness and the structures in the economy if each year we add more excise duty to petrol.</P>
    <P>When discussing this Bill we have to take into account recent developments in <Col N="1610" /> the United Kingdom.  After the last two budgets we have seen a very drastic drop in income tax rates there.  The arguments for looking at the medium and higher personal tax rates in this country have been accelerated because of the opportunities opening up in Britain to facilitate a brain drain from Ireland.  Studies show there are two forms of emigration &mdash; enforced emigration, requiring employment, and optional emigration which involves a person going to a country where he will be better off.  We have to take full cognisance of these facts because we have spent a fortune educating our graduates.</P>
    <P>The Minister said this is a reforming Bill which introduces self-assessment and reforms corporation tax and company tax.  I would like to deal with the proposed reforms in company taxation.  It is proposed that we should pay for the reduction in the rate of corporation tax by reducing capital allowances.  In Britain they have abolished all capital allowances over a three year period.  I take the opposite view.  I believe profits should be generated and properly taxed.  Let us look at any business in this country.  If I were to set up a retailing outlet in the High Street, get a premises, refurbish it, invest in stock and so on, I could write that off against tax, but if I buy the premises I am not able to write off one penny of it against my tax.  That is unfair.  An incentive should be provided where capital allowances are allowed against the purchase of premises.</P>
    <P>If someone makes a profit, he should be allowed to plough it back into the business without being taxed on the double.  As I said, if I purchase a building there is not one penny of the capital allowance written off against income tax. To restrict accelerated capital allowances from 100 per cent to 75 per cent to 50 per cent and so on does not seem sensible because there are certain types of business which unavoidably are capital intensive. I would prefer to see companies which make high profits pay taxes rather than poking around with the system.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that there are some <Col N="1611" /> very sophisticated business representatives lobbying for this reform of the tax code.  It would suit their type of business because either they have carried out their expansion, invested the capital and are reaping the profits &mdash; they could not write off the capital allowances if they wanted to because they have already been written off.  Such companies would avail of the reduced rate of corporation tax.  The small ventures who are starved for capital will be badly hurt by this.  I am thinking in particular of the service sector where the rates of corporation tax are minimal.  In my view it is a retrograde step and I do not think there has been sufficient public debate about it.  There is a need to study the financial problems of small businesses and the type of tax changes that affect the balance between share and equity capital as against loan capital.  Those matters were not taken into account.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to delay the House unduly on this Bill which is worthy of support in so far as it meets the central target of improving the public finances.  In overall terms it increases taxes by £146 million. However, there has not been any real reform in a number of vital areas.  I would like to have seen some imaginative step being taken such as a jobs tax credit under which a employer who takes on a new employee would get a credit of £1,000 against his tax bill in the first year and, perhaps, £500 in the second year.  I would like to have seen a development of the personal allowances whereby mothers who are teachers could employ baby-sitters, gardeners and so on in the white economy rather than in the black economy by being given a personal income tax relief for such work.  I would like to have seen practical support for many of the matters we speak so piously about such as community care.  I would like to have seen an increase in tax free allowances to enable people to keep indisposed and disabled relatives at home.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that such steps were not taken in the Bill.  It cannot be a question of money because very little would be involved in such changes.  The Minister <Col N="1612" /> for Finance has failed to implement in a meaningful way the recommendations of the Commission on Taxation.  We will not be opposing Second Stage of the Bill but we have great concern about section 54, which concerns disabled drivers, and section 52, which imposes a £10 charge on cash dispensing machine cards.  We are critical of what is not in the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon) Rory O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened attentively to the contribution of Deputy Yates and while I would not agree with everything he said I have no doubt that my colleague, the Minister for Finance, will study the points he raised. He mentioned the assistance scheme for disabled motorists and I should like to comment on that.  The present scheme, as the Deputy is aware, does have a number of anomalies in it, not least of which is the interpretation of the disability for which people are entitled to have a tax rebate.  For example, for a rebate of VAT the person should have no use in both lower limbs.  The Government decided to transfer the scheme to the Department of Health to try to make it more balanced and have more equity in it mainly because of the anomalies.  The amount of money available to my Department is the same as was available to the Department of Finance, £3.3 million in a full year, and all that money will be spent for the benefit of disabled motorists.</P>
      <P>It is our intention that the National Rehabilitation Board will administer the scheme.  The Disabled Drivers Organisation were unhappy about a scheme that might be implemented by the eight health boards.  They felt there might be variation between the health boards and that all the money might not go to disabled drivers.  In my view health boards are well capable of administering a suitable scheme but it is better that the scheme should be administered by the National Rehabilitation Board who possess the necessary administrative and medical expertise to decide on the eligibility of disabled drivers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>After the announcement by the Minister for Finance that the scheme was to <Col N="1613" /> be transferred to my Department I established a working party representative of the various interests to study how we might bring forward an equitable scheme.  I will name the members of that committee because there is a perception that the committee is not sufficiently representative of disabled drivers and that there is not a balance on it.  The members are Brian Malone, who is confined to a wheelchair and is chairman of the Irish Wheelchair Association; Martin Donoghue who is also confined to a wheelchair and is general secretary of the Disabled Drivers Association; John Furey, chief executive officer of the National Rehabilitation Board; Dr. Tom Gregg, former medical director of the National Medical Rehabilitation Centre and a member of the Rehabilitation Board; Derry O'Dwyer, programme manager of community care with the Midland Health Board; Dr. Declan Bedford, director of community care and medical officer of health in County Meath and one official from my Department, John Cronin who is the assistant principal officer involved in the services for physically handicapped.  In my view that committee leans very much in favour of the disabled.</P>
    <P>We want an equitable scheme.  When travelling to Galway six weeks ago I visited the Disabled Drivers Association centre in Ballindine and discussed with representatives the transfer of the scheme to my Department.  I explained that what we wanted was the greatest amount of consensus on how a scheme that would benefit the people who are entitled to benefit should be administered. We are suggesting that there should be a lump sum for changing a car on a regular basis and an allocation for running costs each year to the disabled person and that the National Rehabilitation Board, with their expertise, should decide on those who are entitled to benefit.</P>
    <P>The present financial position has acted as a spur, an incentive and, indeed, an obligation on all sectors involved in the planning, managing and delivery of <Col N="1614" /> public services to reappraise their priorities, demand an efficient and effective approach to service delivery and insist on value for money.  It is, perhaps, understandable that there has been a concentration of attention over the past 12 months on the necessary pace of alterations required by the Government in rectifying our financial ills and the difficult choices which have been taken and carried through.  There is now an awareness that what has taken place was indeed necessary if we as a country are to continue to have control over our future, have the freedom to make decisions and ordain our own affairs.</P>
    <P>The demands placed on our people by the Government in accepting the difficult choices which have had to be made have in so short a time produced tangible results.  In the economic and budgetary areas the achievements are there for all to see.  The budget deficit in 1987 was £20 million less than originally planned. Exchequer borrowing was also inside the target by £72 million.  The current deficit of 6.8 per cent of GNP is the lowest since 1980.  Exchequer borrowing, at 10.3 per cent, is the lowest since 1977.  Exchequer borrowing is also down by some £359 million.</P>
    <P>The general public are not slow to appreciate the efforts taken on their behalf.  They recognise that within a short time span the Government have brought about a fundamental and more realistic change in expectations, of confidence in managing our affairs and a sense of purpose and direction which will lead to further economic growth and recovery.  That is not to say that our efforts are complete but the signs of a good, productive start are there to see.  There remains some further progress to be made in reducing our indebtedness and in curtailing overall public expenditure.</P>
    <P>The <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> provides specific targets to be achieved before the end of 1990.  An integral feature of the programme is a reduction in the Exchequer borrowing requirement to between 5 per cent and 7 per cent of GNP.  This challenge and responsibility, <Col N="1615" /> which involves all sectors of the community, particularly Members of the Oireachtas, is in no way diminished by the results we have achieved to date. Further application and response is required by all in our efforts to continue to improve public finances and reduce the burden of debt which remains persistently high.</P>
    <P>Given the macro financial position I have outlined already, it is imperative that there be a rationalisation of a very significant amount of resources in financial and personnel terms devoted to the health services, ensuring that all unnecessary and wasteful expenditure is eliminated.  The only way forward for our services in the immediate future is the creation of a rational, cost-efficient and effective service in a position to respond to the legitimate health needs of the community. This sound approach has been adopted by the Government since assuming office.</P>
    <P>The Estimate for health services for 1988 is £1,109,944,000.  That Estimate takes account of the continued funding of the community drugs schemes, the transfer of the disabled drivers' assistance scheme from the Revenue Commissioners to the Department of Health and an increase of 3 per cent in the rates of allowances to disabled persons from July next.</P>
    <P>Allowing for Appropriations-in-Aid to the Health Vote, overall non-capital spending this year will be just under £1,300 million.  While that represents a slight decrease on last year's spending the provision is satisfactory in the context of the overall position and when account is taken of the effect of the savings implemented in 1987 carried through into this year.  That overall figure will allow for the provision of an adequate and comprehensive health service.</P>
    <P>In determining the 1988 allocations to the health agencies I felt it essential that the agencies should know as early as possible exactly what level of funding would be available to them this year.  It was my view that early notification could only help the health boards, voluntary <Col N="1616" /> hospitals and other bodies to plan their service delivery level in good time.</P>
    <P>One reason for the problems encountered by the health services in 1987 was the unavoidably late notification of their allocations.  Therefore, I was pleased to be able to notify the 1988 allocations to these agencies in October last, affording them an opportunity to begin immediately planning their service delivery for this year.</P>
    <P>I met the chairmen and chief executive officers of the health boards and the voluntary hospitals when the allocations were given to them.  At these meetings I underlined a number of points I considered to be of critical importance. However, I stressed that they would be required to manage their services so that their expenditure would not exceed their allocations, explaining that that was an absolute requirement on each of them. Since that time my Department have met the agencies to discuss in detail how they intended to remain within their allocations in 1988 while, at the same time, maintaining a proper level of service.  I also met the chairpersons and chief executive officers of health boards and a number of the major voluntary hospitals and underlined to them the necessity not to incur expenditure over their approved allocations.  As a consequence of these meetings I believe the health boards and voluntary hospitals have taken the necessary steps in terms of controlling expenditure. My Department are monitoring the position intensively to ensure that no unapproved expenditure is incurred and will continue to do so throughout this year.</P>
    <P>The controls which my Department exercised last year on expenditure are being maintained in 1988 with a view to ensuring there is no overrun on the part of any agency.  Should agencies incur overruns, their financial viability will be threatened.  The agencies themselves are aware of the financial realities facing the country, that there are no magic solutions to the problems encountered in the health services.  Solutions will come about only by way of co-operation and the will to <Col N="1617" /> implement the hard decisions confronting us in the national interest.</P>
    <P>Underlying the present position <i>visà-vis</i> the health services, there is the beginning of a fundamental shift in how these services are perceived and delivered and how the service professionals see their role.  There are also changes in management approaches apparent to those of us concerned in the everyday management of the services.  These changes have occurred not in spite of the control of public expenditure but rather because of it.  While concepts of better management techniques, improved health promotion and co-operation between agencies have been with us for some years, the fact is that the challenge facing all of us in the health services has expedited the necessary changes.</P>
    <P>It has always been the case that resources allocated to health have fallen short of the demands for health and personal social services.  Indeed, we are by no means unique among developed countries in that regard.  Wealthy countries such as the United States, the United Kingdom, Denmark, Germany and France all experience the same problem of endeavouring the provide adequate resources to cater for the expectations of all their people.  A perspective that projects that unlimited resources will be available at some point in the future to any Government, not alone for health, is fallacious.  Resources will always be subject to limitations.  In that regard the general public, young and old, healthy and otherwise, health professionals, planners and managers all have a common interest to ensure that resources are used to maximum effect.</P>
    <P>Because of the nature of the provision of our health services and the shifting in the mid-seventies of almost the entire funding of services into central taxation, the public have a responsibility to know the basis on which funding and services decisions are taken on their behalf.  The underlining principle of decisions taken and choices made at all service levels must be presented in a rational, informed and objective manner.  The need for choice in the allocation of resources, for <Col N="1618" /> example between competing services, is because resources are limited and the demands are well in excess of the resources which can be made available by Government.</P>
    <P>There is an increasing awareness that choices have to be made.  Indeed at national level choices are made as to the general direction of Government policy, and the level of resources to be allocated to various Government programmes. Similarly, in the health services informed choices, in many cases very difficult choices, have been taken over the last year or so.  I will explain in greater detail some of the informed choices and the direction which I have pursued in conjunction with health agencies.  A choice always carries with it a sense of sacrifice as other options, which we would wish to adopt but cannot afford, have to be set aside for the present.  This is necessary to ensure that resources are allocated to produce the best results across the full range of health and social services programmes.</P>
    <P>As Minister for Health I am fully aware of the range of choices, directions and demands which are and can be made in the health area.  However, I have made funding and service choices which are in the best interests of our health services to ensure the maintenances of an adequate and affordable level of service and to allow for priority developments which will be valuable to patients both now and in the future.</P>
    <P>The financial circumstances facing the health services have created an increased awareness among management in the services of the need to examine every pound spent so that the best return is achieved. In this regard my Department are actively supporting the health boards and hospitals in every way possible.  Here I should refer to the work of the Cost Containment and Efficiency Unit in the Department of Health.  I have mentioned before to this House the work carried out by the unit in support of the services.  It focuses on promoting cost-consciousness and co-ordinating information between agencies.  It is undertaking important work particularly in the key area of prices <Col N="1619" /> of medical and surgical consumables which cost about £125 million per annum.</P>
    <P>The unit have brought about a price information exchange system between agencies so that they are aware of the prices being paid for a range of items. While such information always would have been of some interest to health boards and hospitals, there can be little doubt that the funding pressures have ensured that agencies see it as a very practical support mechanism.  Managers are more and more concerned to make the best use of the resources and information available to them.  This is in effect another aspect of the fundamental changes I mentioned earlier as regards how people see their role in the delivery of services.  In the past local managers of health services have seen themselves as primarily involved in the delivery of ever expanding services and have not had to be overly concerned with how those services were funded.  They saw themselves also as meeting specific needs which had to be met in the same way as they were met in other developed countries.  In that situation the question of deciding on priorities did not arise very often because every demand for funding by different interest groups proved to have a validity which could not be ignored.</P>
    <P>Inevitably, there will be problems when priorities are decided but the bonus for the health services and for the State in general is that there is a new awareness among all groups in the health sectors of the need to make every penny count. This has meant that health professionals at every level are working closer together in health boards and hospitals than they have done in the past with, for example, administrators in hospitals and other professional groups discussing in the greatest detail how best they can utilise all their resources, whether they be financial or personnel.  Not only is there increasing co-operation within hospitals in achieving greater efficiency but there is also a greater willingness among agencies to cooperate with each other in many areas of activity.  Agencies are exchanging information on how they are managing their <Col N="1620" /> resources.  This is building up a pool of ideas and knowledge for the improvement of the health sector generally.</P>
    <P>It is fair to say that no other area in the public services is now going through a greater self-examination than the health services.  The benefits of this initial approach for administrators, medical or nursing staff is apparent now in the short term and will have long term implications for the health services.  In the future it will not be possible to see oneself simply as a service provider; the necessity to match services with available resources will be permanent and inescapable.</P>
    <P>In that context, all health and hospital boards should, in so far as is appropriate and within the bounds of existing legislation, maximise their income from various sources.  I have expressed this view to health boards in the interests of a clear and open examination of possible additional sources of revenue to assist boards in the existing difficult situation.</P>
    <P>To summarise, therefore, it is clear that the changing financial picture has brought about a renewed management vigour in the health sector whether it be in seeking value for money in every pound spent directly or in co-operating with other agencies or with professionals in implementing efficiency measures.</P>
    <P>I have also identified the critical elements which require change and have in train various initiatives which will effect change where this is required. These initiatives include the rationalisation of the acute hospital system; a review of funding arrangements for health services; the development of health promotion and preventive services; the development of primary health care services and the improvement of managerial effectiveness at all levels of the system.</P>
    <P>The general hospital programme consumes about 50 per cent of the revenue budget of my Department.  As such, it is the single most expensive health care programme.  For the past decade or so it has become evident in this country and in most other developed countries that its capacity for expansion is almost limitless. It has become evident too that, <Col N="1621" /> notwithstanding the rapid expansion of hospital facilities and services in the past, the results in terms of reducing morbidity and mortality have not been significant. On the basis of efficiency alone it has become necessary to assess what level of hospital service is required to provide a modern service.</P>
    <P>Deputies will already be well aware of the review of the acute hospital system which I instituted last year.  This review has proved to be an excellent foundation for the hospital rationalisation programme.</P>
    <P>The review ensured that the programme could proceed on a planned basis, taking account of comprehensive consultation with all the interests concerned. The review focused on the following issues in particular: the steps necessary to rationalise the acute hospital system, so that the resources available are deployed to provide a high level of service on an equitable basis for the whole country; the implications of the extent to which essential services had been reduced due to financial constraints in 1987 and the opportunities that existed for the delivery of a more cost-effective service through better management of the system and the individual hospitals in it.</P>
    <P>This review showed that there were hospital beds surplus to our needs in a number of areas.  This year has seen considerable progress in attempting to reduce the financial resources taken up by the acute hospital sector so that progressively more funds can be redeployed to the development of community care services.</P>
    <P>I should also mention in this regard that in areas where health boards have decided that district hospitals should close I have provided funds from the national lottery to assist health boards and local community organisations in providing a range of day care services and crisis intervention beds for the elderly.  I have provided funds in this way for day care facilities in Kilrush, Thurles and Tipperary and for nursing and crisis intervention beds in Lismore.  I am also proposing to provide funds for day care <Col N="1622" /> in New Ross and Bagenalstown.  As a result, institutional beds which are surplus to our needs have been phased out and replaced with day care facilities, which will considerably strengthen community care services in these areas.</P>
    <P>Deputies, however, should not forget that while this process of redeployment of resources from hospital care to the community is going on, the existing hospital facilities are continually being developed and upgraded so that while we will have a smaller hospital services sector, it will be of the highest standard. In order to ensure this, I recently approved the provision of funds to allow the commissioning of the new hospital at Cavan and the new developments at St. James's, the Mater, Mullingar and Castlebar.  Building is also underway on the major hospital projects at Sligo, Waterford and Wexford and on the new maternity unit in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda.  These developments will ensure that we will have an excellent hospital accommodation stock right into the next century.</P>
    <P>The outcome of the review to which I referred indicated that there was a significant number of hospital beds in several parts of the country which were surplus to needs.  To continue to provide such beds would be unjustifiable at any time but to continue funding them at this time would be irresponsible.  Deputies will be aware of the steps taken in the past year or so to eliminate these beds and I am glad to say that a great deal of difficult but necessary work has now been done to fit the supply to the need.</P>
    <P>The financial resources available to the hospital service can now be concentrated on fewer hospitals, but rationalisation is not confined to a reduction in numbers. It also embraces the process of hospitals adapting and co-operating so that the service provided to patients is of the highest modern standard, is accessible to the patients and gives good value for money spent.</P>
    <P>The concentration of resources in fewer locations will inevitably mean a more intensive use of beds.  This, together with the evolving demands arising from <Col N="1623" /> the progress of medicine, will require a new flexibility in delivering services.  The development of new techniques and procedures, whether diagnostic or curative, demand careful consideration as to how they can be delivered.  It is now clear that the mode of delivery can have a significant saving on cost but, more than that, it is also a matter of great importance to the patient.  Thus new methods of delivery such as day care, day surgery, programmed investigations units and five-day wards are now being expanded.</P>
    <P>I was very happy to be associated with the opening of Beaumont hospital.  The considerable difficulties which attended the commissioning of the hospital have now been left behind: there is a real commitment within the hospital, among clinical, management and other staff, to make the hospital one of our major centres of excellence.  Given that commitment and the excellent day-to-day performance of the staff, it is a source of great disappointment and, indeed, concern to me that a few begrudgers in the media and indeed elsewhere portray the hospital in a most negative and false way possible.</P>
    <P>Beaumont hospital is providing a very good service to its patients today.  In the weeks and months which lie ahead, that service will become even better, as the hospital realises the full potential of its staff, its equipment and buildings.  The management and staff of the hospital also know that very high standards of service can be provided for the local community on an integrated basis by establishing well structured working arrangements between the hospital and the Eastern Health Board.  They will not settle for anything less than the best and they will have my full support in achieving it.</P>
    <P>A further pivotal review which is currently progressing is an in-depth examination of the funding of our health services.  Last May, as Deputies as aware, I appointed a Commission on Health Funding, chaired by Dr. Miriam Hederman-O'Brien.  The commission are examining the extent and the sources of the future funding of our health services. I am anxious to receive the report of the <Col N="1624" /> commission as early as possible in order to have the benefit of their deliberations in the critical area of funding and their advice on possible alternative sources of funding in the future.</P>
    <P>The efficiency and effectiveness of our hospital services depends to a very considerable extent on the way in which our skilled medical manpower is utilised. Hospital consultants occupy a deservedly high standing in Irish society and we are fortunate to have so many talented men and women available to treat patients. For that reason, I attach great importance to arrangements under which consultant services are provided to public patients.  I am aware that the present common contract has been the subject of some criticism in the past and I was pleased, therefore, to initiate some months ago a review of the existing contract with the Irish Medical Organisation. It is my objective to secure in that review such changes in procedure and practice as may be necessary to provide a clearly visible and equitable basis for the organisation and remuneration of consultant services in public hospitals.  Apart from this issue the agenda covers all of the major matters which are appropriate for the consideration of hospital medicine in the last years of this century.  I am hopeful that a constructive approach by those participating in the talks will enable a satisfactory result to be achieved at the end of this review process.</P>
    <P>It has been acknowledged for some time now that many of the more prominent health problems in Ireland need to be more energetically addressed from a prevention viewpoint.  Specifically, such major health problems as heart disease, cancer and accidents are each amenable to some extent to preventive solutions. This is not to deny the need for a high level of services for the treatment and care of victims but it is important to develop an appropriate balance in the emphasis given to different strategies in tackling these health problems.  This untapped potential of preventive strategies was the primary justification for the new health promotion structure <Col N="1625" /> established by the Government last January. That structure includes a health promotion unit within the Department of Health.  During the current year this unit will undertake an extensive work programme, including health education campaigns and the development and implementation of policy related to the promotion of health in a broader sense. Among the specific issues being addressed are smoking, alcohol and other drug abuse, AIDS, immunisation programmes, food hygiene and nutrition.</P>
    <P>The unit are also collaborating with the Irish Cancer Society and the European Commission in the organisation of an information week on cancer during the first week in May.  Cancer is a major public health problem in Ireland and other developed countries and, to the extent it is related to lifestyle, is preventable through public information and awareness campaigns.  This Europe Against Cancer Week provides an opportunity to capitalise on a collective European effort to combat cancer.  It is indicative of the growing interest at EC level in tackling the major health problems of the member countries.  This is a very useful development and the organisation of this information week on cancer, based around a ten-point EC code against cancer, has my full support.</P>
    <P>In a major initiative to prevent cancers and reduce the incidence of tobacco related illnesses I recently introduced a new Tobacco Bill to the Dáil, the primary objective of which is the control of smoking in public places.  I feel that it is vital for the protection of public health that exposure to environmental tobacco smoke should be controlled.  It is also an important step in the creation of an overall environment which is more conducive to healthy living and it will encourage young people to regard non-smoking as the normal majority adult behaviour. The Bill also includes an important provision to update the law in relation to the sale of cigarettes to children.  The sale of oral smokeless tobacco products, which are both addictive and carcinogenic and <Col N="1626" /> which have not yet become widely established in this country, will also be prohibited under the Bill.</P>
    <P>The promotion of health, given the known association between various lifestyle practices and environmental factors, extends beyond the bounds of the health system.  It is therefore necessary to adopt a multisectoral approach to certain health problems and for the first time we now have in this country a formal framework within which this can be done. This framework operates at a mumber of levels.  I have set up an advisory Council on Health Promotion to make recommendations to me on changes in public policies which impact on human health. The council are broadly based and include in their membership the main economic and social interests in the community. The council have been meeting on a regular basis and I look forward to receiving their recommendations in due course.</P>
    <P>In addition to the advisory council, the Government decided that there should be a committee of Ministers established, reflecting the collective commitment of the Government to health promotion and providing a forum at the highest level at which intersectoral policy issues and, indeed, conflicts can be discussed and resolved.  The presence of the Ministers for Agriculture, Energy, Education, Labour and the Environment with the Minister for Health on this committee makes it a potentially powerful instrument in effecting change in public policy on a broad front in the interests of community health.</P>
    <P>There is a definite awareness now among health boards that there are certain key community care services which must be protected if we are ever to significantly reduce our reliance on costly institutional care.  I have stressed to the boards the need to ensure that basic services like home help, meals on wheels and community nursing continue to be supported as far as possible even at the expense of general hospital care.  These are not easy choices to make but they must be made.  In the past when funding increased at a higher rate than it can now <Col N="1627" /> there may have been assumptions that the hospital services could continue to swallow up more and more of the available resources and that community care services could also benefit but only in a marginal way.  That situation no longer exists as the health boards have come increasingly to realise that financial considerations do not allow for hospitals to consume resources disproportionately in the future; at the same time the boards are aware that the community services must be protected if there is to be a significant integrated service.  The position now is that it is the institutional services which are, so to speak, under the microscope to justify their existence while the community services must be maintained.</P>
    <P>I do not, of course, claim that there will be a massive transfer of resources to community from hospital programmes in the immediate future.  There will be a gradual transfer and it will take time, and it is interesting that the percentage of the health budget going to community care has increased about 2 per cent in the last two years.  The important thing is that the shift in attitudes does exist and that it has responded to the new funding situation we all face.  The general hospital programme is changing to adapt to new conditions. It has also meant a greater commitment to movement away from over-reliance on the general hospitals and to focus interest as far as possible in maintaining a reasonable level of community care support.  The financial situation has also underlined the necessity to develop health promotion and education policies which emphasise and support the value of both society and individuals taking clear responsibility for their actions and thereby start the process of turning the health services from a largely curative service into a more positive and dynamic healthorientated system.</P>
    <P>The general medical services scheme continues to provide an excellent service to the most vulnerable sector of our community. This sector represents some 37 per cent of the population of 1,323,000 persons.  Government's commitment to <Col N="1628" /> this sector of our community is evidenced by the fact that a sum of £112.8 million is being made available in 1988 for the scheme.  This figure represents, an increase over the previous years funding, despite the continuing financial difficulties facing the provision of services generally.  The 1988 level of funding underlines my desire to preserve to the maximum degree possible the level and quality of services available through the GMS.  However, Government policy regarding containment of costs and ensuring, as far as possible, value for money in relation to the provision of services must be pursued.  In this regard I note that the trend of increased costs in the scheme has continued in 1987.  It is vital that this persistent increase in cost be halted and we must, therefore, look to measures which can correct the position.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that the future of the GMS has been under consideration for some considerable time, in fact since 1982 when a working party was established to review the present arrangements particularly as regards the participation of doctors in the scheme. Unfortunately, that review and subsequent discussions did not produce agreement on future arrangements.  I therefore was pleased when the Irish Medical Organisation responded to my request some months ago to resume the negotiations with a view to achieving an early agreement on a new basis for the provision of medical services in the GMS. My concern is to reach an agreement which would enable medical services to be provided efficiently and the scope of general practice to be expanded as a key element in our health services as a whole. I have, of course, personal experience of the contribution which general practitioners can make to the effective treatment of patients and it is my objective to ensure that that potential is realised in a way which is most effective from the point of view of the patient&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Government have been sensible in their general approach to maintaining and developing a health service within the finite resources available. They have been sensible also in ensuring that priority needs are met throughout the various health programmes and sensible in laying the foundation for a health service which can develop and grow in a planned, rational and managed manner to meet future health demands.</P>
      <P>The caring approach adopted means that those in need have ready access to curing and caring services, that disadvantaged groups in our society are treated in an equitable manner which ensures that ability to pay does not hinder the availability of quality services to meet genuine need.  In caring we must ensure that we have in place services which are viable, which meet genuine and identified needs and represent good value for money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A sensible and caring approach does not mean that we are prepared to be deflected from the difficult courses we have charted.  The opposite must surely be the case.  An approach which is genuinely in the interest of the community as a whole must be prepared to make difficult choices, choices which are unpalatable and appear unpopular.  However, we must recognise that such measures are necessary in the public interest, and I use <Col N="1632" /> the term in its true meaning.

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. P. Gallagher)</NameTxt>
      <P>The economic performance of Ireland in 1987 was remarkable for a number of reasons: economic growth, at 3½ per cent, was significantly better than envisaged early in the year; exports increased substantially, which helped create a modest surplus on the balance of payments on current account for the first time since 1967; inflation, at just over 3 per cent was the lowest for 20 years.  The Government have continued to tackle with determination the problems created by the past high levels of Exchequer borrowing, and as we all know this has meant taking many difficult decisions in reducing public expenditure.  These decisions have not been easy or painless, but they are the only sensible approach to reducing both past borrowings from levels which were unsustainable and, consequently, our present levels of taxation to pay for those borrowings.  It is, indeed, encouraging to see so many positive indications from the economy after less than one year of the Government's policies.</P>
      <P>The year 1988 demands the continuation of those policies, and already there are encouraging indications for the year ahead.  The Government earlier this year negotiated one of the more moderate pay rounds of recent years; a substantial rise in exports is predicted; and inflation is forecast to be even lower in 1988, at 2.25 per cent.  These are the conditions that face the Irish economy in 1988 and we must use to the maximum effect the opportunities they offer, in terms of increasing earnings from output, exports and tourism, and in terms of employment generation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding sea fishing and aquaculture, the marine area is in a good position to take the opportunities provided by these more favourable conditions and the Minister for the Marine and I will make <Col N="1633" /> every effort to ensure that these opportunities are availed of.  There will be no overnight success, and it would be misleading to pretend that we will achieve the full potential of our marine resources in 1988.  Instead, this will be a year of investment and funding in the development of these resources.</P>
    <P>The quotas achieved for Irish fishermen in 1988 will allow for the continued growth and development of the fishing industry here.  The agreement reached by the Ministers in Brussels in December last, after long and very difficult negotiations, will result in increased potential earnings of £7 million approximately for Irish fishermen over and above the original proposal on the table.  Both the Minister and I fought hard in those negotiations and were successful in offsetting the very drastic reductions being proposed in respect of the more sensitive species from our viewpoint, namely, mackerel and herring.</P>
    <P>The mackerel situation is of paramount importance to the Irish fishing industry and we have succeeded in maintaining this year's mackerel quota at the 1987 level.  More importantly, we have been successful in persuading the European Commission to review the mackerel situation in the light of the up-to-date scientific advice.</P>
    <P>I should like to pay tribute to the industry for financing the surveys carried out under the Department's supervision in 1986 and 1987.  We are convinced as a result of these surveys that quotas and catches can be increased.  This information was not available to the Commission in December last year but we have now supplied it and I am reasonably confident that we can achieve an increase in our quota.  The results of the surveys have to date been most encouraging and we are in a strong position to negotiate further in late May or early June this year.</P>
    <P>I have always felt that the management of our fisheries, quotas, etc.  should be carried out in close liaison with the various elements of the fishing industry. Since taking office I have made this a priority and I am happy to say that the <Col N="1634" /> management of our more sensitive fisheries involved regular contact and discussion with the representatives of the industry, both producers and processors. Management regimes have been agreed which allow for the balanced and rational exploitation of our quotas, resulting in better prices for our fishermen and greater continuity in supply for the processors. This year the mackerel fishery is still in place and I hope it will run until 28 April.  Last year it terminated around 16 February.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, prospects for the industry this year are good.  I would encourage our fishermen to build on our catches of non-quota species which will prove vital if these become subject to quota in the future.  In this regard I am impressed by the substantial catches of horse-mackerel made to date.  This is a developing and highly lucrative fishery and I wish to pay tribute to the pioneering spirit and vision of the fishermen involved and to the processors, who went out and developed the valuable markets.</P>
    <P>Exports of frozen horse-mackerel to Japan rose from £2 million in 1986 to £7 million in 1987.  This is a new market and demands adherence to very high standards of quality by both the producer and the processor.  It represents a major breakthrough by the processing industry as previously Japan only imported sea frozen fish whereas the Irish product is frozen ashore in factories using Irish labour.</P>
    <P>BIM are finalising a major development plan covering the expansion of our sea fisheries resource up to the end of 1991.  The plan will address the following issues and will propose follow-up action within the framework of Government policy:</P>
    <P>&mdash;a planned approach to the modernisation of our fishing fleet;</P>
    <P>&mdash;the development of our aquaculture. This offers exciting possibilities for the production of salmon, trout and mussels;</P>
    <P>&mdash;the development of our processing <Col N="1635" /> sector, to increase the value-added worth of the national catch, and</P>
    <P>&mdash;the marketing in Ireland and abroad of these fish products.</P>
    <P>The Government will give urgent consideration to the plan which should be completed by Easter.  While Ireland will continue to work within the framework of the Common Fisheries Policy, there is some scope for action outside the quotas. For example, the use of new fishing grounds outside the Community limits and increasing the catches of our non-quota species are possibilities which are already being pursued.  The acquisition by Irish fishermen of the most modern fishing vessels is the best statement of belief in the success of this direction in Irish fishing.</P>
    <P>The Department of the Marine will support the plan in every way they can, by funding &mdash; to the extent possible within our financial constraints &mdash; BIM's development plan and by legislation such as, for example, the introduction of a fish marketing Bill in the next year to consolidate existing controls and quality standards in the processing sector.  We should not forget the progress made to date in areas such as aquaculture, where 14 areas of coastline have already been designated and another seven are being considered as suitable for aquaculture and within which licence holders may operate.</P>
    <P>As to licensing in particular, there is currently a programme of development of aquaculture to provide a sound legal framework for the development of the industry by licensing bona fide operators.</P>
    <P>These measures for the development of our sea fisheries are attainable by selective investment, on the basis of identified priorities, of funding which the Exchequer is already providing and of investment from the private sector which has proved so important in the past.  The Government are counting with confidence on the continuation of this investment towards this development.</P>
    <P>Our inland fisheries also offer a potential for development as a tourism and <Col N="1636" /> leisure resource.  The present administrative structures are generally accepted to require some re-organisation.  The Minister for the Marine recently spelled out the objectives which he considers should underpin the management of inland fisheries.  These are: employment and income generation; optimisation of income distribution; optimisation of the amenity and recreational value; conservation and development of stocks; rationalisation of management and development of community involvement in the management, protection and marketing of the local fishery resource.</P>
    <P>The report of the Salmon Review Group was recently published, and the Minister has invited all interested parties to make submissions on their views on the contents of the report, including the restructuring of management, not later than 31 March.  The submissions received are being studied by officials of the Department of the Marine.  Ireland already has excellent leisure opportunities on its rivers and lakes for boating holidays and a wide range of marine sports, and there is still potential for the expansion of these activities.  The development of inland fishing has not kept pace with these activities and the revised management structure must address itself to the obstacles to this development as a matter of urgency.  The introduction on I January of licences for inland fishing is an attempt to give inland fishing a source of income in addition to Government funding.</P>
    <P>I wish to take this opportunity to emphasise that the revenue from the licences will still be only a fraction of the total cost of the structure which is required to maintain and develop inland fishing, and most people, including many anglers, accept the necessity for these licences, the cost of which are quite modest in comparison with other countries. I would also like to point out that we have had salmon licences for many years.  When rod licences were discussed some ten years ago it was suggested that it would be better to allow people to pay a voluntary subscription.  While there are <Col N="1637" /> 130,000 anglers, only 4,000 of them contribute voluntarily.  We believe it is necessary to have an income from licences in these difficult recessionary times.  There are financial constraints and the Department and the Government have contributed each year some £4 million towards the development of our inland fisheries.  We feel that the rod licence is a modest price.  While many people suggest that the income from the rod licence will go towards the Exchequer, I wish to emphasise once more that the income from the rod licence will go directly, not alone this year but every year, towards the development and protection of our industry.</P>
    <P>The legislation now appears to be controversial, but Deputies and Senators on all sides had every opportunity to vote against it when it was before the Dáil and Seanad.  There was only one vote on Second Stage and the Labour Deputies voted against it at that time.  A vote was called on Final Stage but the vote did not take place.  By and large this legislation went through the Dail unanimously.  It is wrong and unfair of Deputies and Senators to state publicly&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I have listened to my constituency colleague.  I was surprised that so few, and all were in the <Col N="1638" /> House at the time, showed an interest in the Fisheries (Amendment) Bill and the development and protection of inland fisheries.  Indeed the record shows those who were interested.  Deputy Molloy wanted the Bill rescinded while the leader of his party did not vote against it at that time.</P>
      <P>Marine tourism is a product area of particular importance in view of our natural resources.  The Department of the Marine have been given the specific remit to develop the largely untapped potential which marine related leisure activities represent.  Its objective is to encourage the development and promotion of a range of aquatic recreational activities which would have a significant appeal to the domestic market as well as foreign tourists.  The unique coastal attractions of Ireland represent a very considerable competitive advantage for developing a range of tourism activities based on marine sports.</P>
      <P>Work has already commenced on identifying potential marine related leisure projects, facilities and activities which can be targeted for development and promotion.</P>
      <P>Work is progressing to facilitate and accelerate maritime and aquatic sports and related activities such as marinas right around the coast.</P>
      <P>The recent announcement of a marina for Dún Laoghaire by and large has been welcomed by all and I hope this is just the start of many new marinas around our coast.  The Department of the Marine and the Office of Public Works will facilitate private investment in this area and have instructions to encourage suitable development plans and remove obstacles. These agencies are at present identifying suitable projects and it is hoped that some of these will commence construction in the near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fishing, like agriculture, has a great advantage over other industries in that it is a renewable resource.  We have a choice of overfishing for short term gain, or with careful control of our levels of fishing and stock management, of creating a long term stable source of employment, food and exports.  A very obvious <Col N="1639" /> threat to this resource is pollution, both of sea and inland water.  Our tourist industry is also vulnerable to this threat. Since coming into office, the Government have dealt with a number of incidents and have responded with a number of legislative initiatives designed to counter both oil and other pollutants.</P>
    <P>The Oil Pollution of the Sea (Civil Liability and Compensation) Bill 1987, has reached Committee Stage in the Dáil, having been passed by the Seanad.  The Sea Pollution Bill will be brought before the House, hopefully in this session.  It will strengthen the law dealing with discharges of oil from ships and will extend the law to cover non-oil pollutants, as well as introducing new provisions in relation to wreck management and removal.  In addition the Minister for the Environment will increase the existing penalties for pollution under the Fisheries Acts, with the Water Pollution (Amendment) Bill, 1987.  The Bill will also require the polluter to make good the damage caused by his actions.</P>
    <P>The Government will continue to provide support for the fishing and shipping industries, both directly through financial assistance and indirectly by funding services such as harbours and safety services. The 1988 estimates provide £3.1 million for the maintenance and development of commercial and fishery harbours. A number of projects are presently being considered for funding and priority will be given to those projects which can show the best return for this investment.  The recent Government decision that public sector bodies may get assistance from the European Regional Development Fund if such assistance would otherwise be lost to Ireland, means that commercial harbours may receive ERDF funds for developments being financed from their own resources.</P>
    <P>The Government's policy in relation to fishery harbours is to ensure that the major fishery harbours have adequate facilities to cater for the larger vessels now in use and their catches while at the same time providing a network of piers <Col N="1640" /> around the coastline to cater for the needs of fishing communities.</P>
    <P>The Government have revived a programme started in 1979, to establish a chain of remote controlled VHF radio stations around the Irish coast.  I was pleased to announce last week that the station at Glencolumbkille is now operative. It is important to point out that additional funds have been made available this year and there have been no cutbacks in the area of marine safety.  We look forward to resolving the black spot problem off the north Mayo coast and indeed in other areas around the country.</P>
    <P>The provision made in the Estimates was recently increased by £250,000 to allow for the establishment of a further four stations to be located in Dublin, Wexford, west Waterford and north-west Mayo.  Two stations at Glencolumbkille, County Donegal and Cork airport are now completed.  Work has commenced on the replacement of equipment at the coast radio stations at Valentia and Malin Head.</P>
    <P>I attended a meeting recently in relation to safety along the west coast.  I was very pleased to listen to the views of the fishermen and those who organised the meeting.  I look forward to having further discussions with them and with the Minister for the Marine, Deputy Daly, and the Minister for Defence, Deputy Noonan, to establish what can be done to allay the fears of the people of the west of Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Minister for Finance introduced the Bill he mentioned the effects the financial regime which the Bill is putting in place will have on the economy during the coming year.  Overall the message he gave was sanguine in tone but I am considerably depressed by the prospects which face our economy this year and in 1989.  We are told that the adjustments, which is the euphemistic term for the continuation of the policy of drastic pruning and expenditure cuts, will have to continue into 1990.  I am terrified at the prospects for the country if there has to be a continuation of what has been <Col N="1641" /> put in place up to now without any adjustment or change.</P>
      <P>We are presented with a picture of an economy coming right.  There are a number of bright spots on the economic scene but I am afraid they conceal an underlying dire position.  We know that the balance of payments last year was in surplus, the first time for many years.  Not only was there a balance of trade but there was a balance of payment surplus, something which is rarely achieved in the majority of western capitalist democracies. Occasionally countries like Taiwan, which is an exceptionally vigorous trading nation, can achieve that but it has not been achieved here or, so far as I know, in our neighbouring European countries for a very long time.  It is heartening at first sight to know that we have achieved a surplus in our balance of payments. It is of great economic importance that we do so because it has the effect of strengthening the position of our reserves and of ensuring that our currency stays healthy.</P>
      <P>We achieved our balance of payments surplus on the basis of buoyant exports but those exports came from an extremely narrow part of our manufacturing industry.  They came essentially, and almost entirely, from the pharmaceutical and electronics sectors of industry.  These are two areas of industry that are owned entirely &mdash; and if that is an exaggeration I can say without any shadow of doubt that they are 99 per cent owned &mdash; by foreign owners who came here because they were attracted by the package of incentives, who are entitled, under that package, to repatriate their profits and whose tax liability to the national Exchequer is extremely small.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position is that the manufacturing sector who are producing these tremendous export figures, an extremely vigorous sector, are not contributing proportionately to the domestic economy. I am not saying that by way of complaint because that is the deal we offered these people and that is the deal they accepted.  They came here in good faith and they have to be allowed to continue to operate under the terms of the <Col N="1642" /> agreement we made with them. Undoubtedly there is some spin-off to the economy through the employment they give and the lift they may give to the immediate environment in which the plants are located.  Essentially that buoyant sector of the economy who are putting a great face on our exports &mdash; and that great face on our exports is preserving the strength of our pound and contributing to healthy reserves &mdash; are keeping our national statistics respectable. It is those figures and the performance of that sector which gave us the growth we experienced last year.  As I said, it is very narrowly based and a proportionate benefit to the Exchequer does not come from them because of the arrangement of our deal with them.  That is one side of the economy.</P>
    <P>The other side of the economy is what I call the indigenous economy: the trading sector, the wholesalers, retailers and the people in Ireland who manufacture for them.  Statistics in the current report of the Allied Irish Banks economic review show that the amount of exports achieved by that sector of the manufacturing industry is less than one quarter of their total output.  I know and every Deputy in the House knows, from the empirical observation of moving around through our own communities, that that sector of the economy is in dire difficulty because it is from that sector of the economy that the Government are withdrawing all the assets needed to achieve the cuts and repayments on debt servicing.  The Central Bank report told us that for 1987 some £800 million was withdrawn for the service of the external debt alone.  That sum had to be paid by what I describe as the indigenous economy &mdash; the trading part of this country and the small home manufacturing area.  The contribution of the very viable, active and vigorous manufacturing sector in the hands of foreign owners who are here on a tax holiday to these huge withdrawals from our economy is minimal and out of proportion to their size.</P>
    <P>We have two economies in this country &mdash; the viable manufacturing economy I <Col N="1643" /> have referred to and the indigenous economy and the latter has to bear the cost of correcting our dire Exchequer position. It is bearing that cost by having drawn from it comparatively immense sums of money.  Comparative to its size and to its capacity to provide those sums, the demand that is being made is comparatively immense.  For the life of me I cannot see how the Government can continue to withdraw from that sector of the economy without at the other end putting in fuels to fund growth in that sector to enable it to continue to pay and meet the demands that are being made on it without something giving.  There is no investment of any significance going in at the other end.  The normal sources of investment would be from the Government through their Public Capital Programme but we know there is going to be a reduction in that as part of the Government's policy to get the Exchequer back in balance.  We know that investment from the private sector is reckoned to fall in 1988.  The only hope that it will not fall as drastically as 1.  fear it will fall is if interest rates are reduced so that there will be an incentive to invest in the economy.</P>
    <P>We are also told that gross agricultural output for 1988 is to decline.  Again there will be less funds available in that sector of the economy for spending and generating economic growth.  The forecast for 1988 is that there will be, possibly, a marginal growth of such size that it will be insignificant.  What is talked about is a ½ per cent and some say I per cent growth in GDP.  It seems to be common case among all commentators that, when one allows for the repatriation of profits by the multinational companies who are entitled to do so under their arrangement with us, there will be a negative GNP.  I have to ask what is the Exchequer going to do for revenue out of a negative GNP or a marginally static GDP situation when we consider that last year revenue receipts were down by £76 million at a time when the economy grew by over 3 per cent? A growth rate of 3 per cent GNP is a significant growth rate by any <Col N="1644" /> terms.  Yet there is this apparent contradiction. We have a growing economy, yet the fruit coming to the revenue is down by the sizeable sum of £76 million. I know the explanation may be given that for part of the time there was a collection difficulty on the part of the revenue.  That does not explain a drop in receipts of the magnitude of £76 million.  The reason there was such a drop is that there was a downturn in economic activity in the indigenous sector of the economy, the sector that contributes to the revenue.</P>
    <P>If that sector of the economy was so on its knees in 1987, what state will it be in in 1988?  What state will it be in in 1989, and what state will it be in in 1990? Businesses have been going to the wall at an unprecedented rate during the past year.  They will be falling like skittles during the next two years unless some economic activity can be generated for the indigenous economy.  We will continue to have an excellent appearance on the international scene and our national statistics will be good and kept good by virtue of the vigorous performance of the externally owned manufacturing sector of our economy.  That is fine as far as it goes but it is concealing a really sick country in regard to the rest of the economy.</P>
    <P>I do not know what the answer is because there appears to be common case among economists on all sides of this House on the need for the policy of retrenchment, cutting back on public expenditure, screwing the economy into the ground, reducing consumer spending.</P>
    <P>Let me say a word on consumer spending. The Minister for Finance is optimistic that the tax concessions will release some extra consumer spending into the economy.  I think he is being less than frank in making such a statement because he knows that the measures in this Bill and in his budget generally are designed to claw back almost as much as is given by way of relief, and the forecasts are that personal consumer spending in 1988 will drop or remain pretty much at the same level as in 1987.</P>
    <P>I am worried by the evidence I meet in my daily business, and that I am sure <Col N="1645" /> other Deputies meet it in their daily contacts in their own communities, of a very sick and sluggish commercial scene with businesses being harassed for want of cash, wholesalers finding it difficult to sell, manufacturers finding it difficult to sell and, when they can get orders, finding immense difficulty in getting paid.  Commercial travellers and the like will say they have never seen such a dire situation in business in this country, that the level of economic activity is so poor that they wonder how many businesses will be in existence when they do their next round of calls.  That is because there is no investment coming in to generate activity.  The Government have withdrawn from the scene.  Schools are not being built.  The roads programme had been cut back. This programme and that programme have been eliminated and there just is not any activity funded by Government as happened in the past.  Private funds are not there.  The businesses themselves are not making sufficient profits to generate a surplus for investment and they are afraid to borrow.</P>
    <P>I see a very grim situation where the Government are, in effect, pulling out from one end of the economy money to meet their debt commitments without putting anything in at the other end to generate growth in the economy.  If we do not have a growing economy there is no way the Government can continue to withdraw from it.</P>
    <P>People may say that we have a growing economy, that we have only to look at the statistics.  I have to point out again that those statistics are misleading and we must distinguish between the foreign-owned viable manufacturing sector and the indigenous economy.  The former are producing healthier statistics but they are not producing the revenue that would normally come in to meet the demands the Government have to make on our economy.</P>
    <P>We are in a very serious situation and in many ways our position is analogous to the large developing countries who got into a mess with their debts.  We have many advantages over those countries. We have a sophisticated educational <Col N="1646" /> system, good physical infrastructure and a highly trained work force.  We are a member of the EC.  We have healthy reserves and we are respectable in economic terms.  We have the same problem in that we are not able to generate sufficient resources here off our own bat to continue to meet the demands being made on us.  I shudder to think what the position for the shopkeepers and the small manufacturers and wholesalers here will be like in 1989 and 1990 when this medicine is repeated because, as commentators tell us, we have to continue it until then.  Where will we get funds to be invested into our native economy to try to generate some activity and some growth?  We may have to look at some of the solutions, not the same but analogous to those that have been offered by the creditors of the large developing countries.</P>
    <P>It is embarrassing to have to say that here.  People are not prepared to admit it because they would rather take refuge behind the good statistics.  Those statistics are misleading because they are cloaking the true position here.  If those statistics were genuine the contribution from that sector in proportion to its earning back into the economy to the Exchequer would be fine and I would agree that the thing is coming right.  I do not think it is coming right and I do not think it can come right until some form of investment can be found to compensate the indigenous economy for the demands being made on it.  We are caught in a vicious economic circle.  To service our debt we have to withdraw huge resources from our economy.  The withdrawal of those resources weakens the economy, thereby impairing its capacity to sustain continuing withdrawals that are needed to continue to service the debt, not to speak of other deleterious consequences.</P>
    <P>Of course, another indicator of the false nature of the national statistics is that unemployment is rising, notwithstanding a growing economy.  Again that does not make sense.  Possibly in the first year of growth after the recession <Col N="1647" /> there is a slack to be taken up, but unemployment should certainly commence to stabilise in this year if we are to have the modest growth which has been forecast. The statistics are again no longer reliable. All of us Deputies here know from our own observations in our own communities that emigration is taking place at an unprecendented rate and is forecast to continue doing so, and that should not happen if there is growth.  That again proves my thesis that the indigenous economy is in dire straits and losing its work force, thereby further impairing the capacity for economic activity.  That is the position as I see it.</P>
    <P>I do not know who or what institution, if any, can come to rescue us and provide for us the resources we need to try to keep the domestic economy, the indigenous economy, turning over and generating growth.  There is an element of &ldquo;head in the sand&rdquo; and avoiding the issue by looking at the good national statistics. We must not be misled by them.  It is great to have them, they are preserving our currency, keeping our reserves healthy, but they are misleading us as to the true state of our economy.  Personal consumer spending will mark time, at best, during this coming year.  Public net current expenditure is reckoned to fall, investment is reckoned to fall and gross domestic expenditure is forecast to fall.</P>
    <P>I do not know what will become of us, whether we can start to open negotiations for some exchange of part of our debt for equity to some of the resources that we have yet untapped, natural resources, namely, forestry and fishery.  These are two areas where there is an open-ended and ever growing demand for their products and our investment in development over the years has been regrettably small and inefficient.  There has been no dynamism in these areas.  These would be viable investment venues for people or institutions to whom we owe money and to whom we might say, &ldquo;We think that instead of demanding these payments from us, in view of our position you should put that money back to us and you will get a better return&rdquo;.  Our roads <Col N="1648" /> infrastructure, in particular, has many possibilities for an accelerated programme with large investment, coupled with tolls.  There is room for viable investment there, also.  We have seen the start of that on the outskirts of this city.  These are two areas regarding which we could go to the institutions to whom we are beholden financially and make a dignified appeal for a reinvestment by them into our sick and under-capitalised economy.</P>
    <P>I do not know if any Government are prepared to admit that this is what faces us and to face the obvious consequences of recognising that picture.  Where do we get funds to invest in our economy to stop it from dying altogether under the continuing demands that the Government have to make on it to cure the Exchequer imbalance?  That is our dilemma.  I have indicated some possible ways out of it, not terribly palatable ways, ways which people might see as being undignified and inconsistent with sovereignty &mdash; possibly even a confession of failure after 60 years of independence and responsibility for our own economic affairs.  However, if we have to endure in 1988, 1989 and 1990 what was endured last year, I cannot see the indigenous economy surviving without huge social and commercial damage to business up and down the country.  Businesses are already going to the wall in unprecedented numbers.  Commercial anxiety and uncertainty is coupled with a harsh revenue regime.  The efficiency of the new Revenue sheriffs is quite outstanding but, yet again, at a huge price, a price that has put people to the wall and has killed morale.  Part of the price is depression in rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>It is no joy to me to have to speak in such gloomy terms but there is no point in anybody coming into this national Parliament and speaking in less than realistic terms.  I think that to some extent we have been fooling ourselves that the cuts of last year and proposed cuts for this year are on the way to curing our economic ills.  They may be on the way to rectifying the Exchequer imbalance but by the time we get near that happy state <Col N="1649" /> I do not know what sort of economy, if any, will be left here.</P>
    <P>Before I conclude, I should like to say one word on a specific matter in the Finance Bill and that is the proposal to introduce withholding tax on payments being made on foot of a contract of insurer to health insurers.  I was very unhappy when I heard that mooted.  I could appreciate, from the point of view of the Minister for Finance, that he could see a certain consistency between that approach and the withholding tax introduced last year. There were fees being paid to professional persons and why should they not be subject to the withholding tax in the same way as the arrangements already made last year?  However, there is one significant difference.  That tax was being withheld from fees owed by the State to professional persons who, in turn, would have a liability to the State for tax.  There was a mutuality of interest or liability there.  In the case of insurance contracts, the State is now proposing to intervene in a private contract and direct the insurer to withhold from the medical person part of the fees the subject of the contract.  I have to say that at first sight that particular proposal seemed to be verging on the unconstitutional and the more I think about it the more I am coming to that conclusion.</P>
    <P>The Constitution has within it the guarantee of the rights of private property. That is a right that people are becoming impatient with from time to time.  They see it as an impediment towards social justice and so forth, but that guarantee of the right to private property is inextricably linked with the guarantee of personal freedoms that are in the Constitution.  Consider the situation of your personal freedom if you did not have your right to your property guaranteed.  It would be a very hollow right, indeed.  The right to property is a real, important, democratic right and it is in the Constitution.</P>
    <P>Modern jurisprudence is now tending to interpret property in a much wider way than in the past not only with regard to immovable hereditaments or chattels, but other things such as the protection <Col N="1650" /> that one gets by virtue of being in a trade union.  That is a property right which might have to be protected in certain legal situations.  The right to a pension can be a property right, various things of that nature.  The modern trend has been to widen the definition of property.  In the light of that trend, it is inconceivable that a court would not interpret my rights under a contract of insurance with health insurers as a property right.</P>
    <P>What the State is now purporting to do in this Bill is to interfere with that by directing my insurer not to fulfil his full contract with me which is to pay me X pounds for cover for my medical expenses.  I know that there are provisions in it trying to prevent me from being prejudiced but that is not the point. If I wanted to assign my rights under my contract of insurance, I cannot assign what I have contracted for.  I cannot assign the property right that I have paid for in my contract of insurance as I contracted it because the State has intervened to make sure that what I will be assigning will be less than the full value of what I am paying for.  That is just an example of the interference with my right.  People may say that it makes no difference to me in practice and that it is the consultant who will suffer.  I do not know what hypothetical situations could arise in the future whereby that simple answer by the Minister in this Bill might not satisfy my position.  There is a grave danger in this interference by the State in a private contractual arrangement and I find it obnoxious and constitutionally dangerous.  This is something we will have to debate in greater depth on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>A serious economic situation faces the country.  We have two economies, one a viable and vigorous manufacturing economy narrowly based on pharmaceuticals and electronics, largely owned by foreigners who are repatriating their profits and who are not contributing to the Exchequer with the result that that very profitable sector is not reflected in the economy or in the Exchequer returns. The burden of cutting back on expenditure and reducing our debt is falling on <Col N="1651" /> our native economy.  In drawing from the native economy the resources to meet that burden the Government are preventing it from growing.  The native economy is in a position where it cannot grow because there is no investment in the native economy to generate the growth to provide resources to meet the Government's demands.  I have indicated tentatively what we must do in dealing with the dilemma that that poses.</P>

      <P>There are no immediate solutions.  It is possible to make progress to find a means of easing the burden.  The people have recognised, as indicated in the recent opinion polls, that they have a Government who are making progress, who are easing the burden on those in greatest need.  The people recognise that we have a Government with the will and the ability to lead the country in the right direction.  The first essential condition on putting the country back into reasonable prosperity, is to give hope.  It is much easier to detect the absence of hope and confidence than tó notice its presence. We saw the slow erosion of hope during the eighties, falling living standards, shrinking employment, emigration and the closure of businesses plus a huge increase in our national debt and a rise in crime.  We had come to a point where the very existence of our independent State was beginning to be questioned. That has changed for the better.  One year of real leadership has reversed the most dangerous of those trends.  Hope is rising, debt is being contained and there is national consensus to a degree unheard of before.  A great deal of energy and maturity is at last being applied to our difficulties.  The Government are going about their business with both eyes firmly <Col N="1652" /> fixed on their duty.  The Government have refused to engage in a popularity contest for the sake of a quiet life.  The Government have not shied away from taking hard decisions.  The Government may not be universally loved but they have earned the respect of all sectors.  We have the unique spectacle of a Government who have tried to convince the social partners that all of them must contribute to the solution.  The Government's success in this area is remarkable. There may be disagreements on detail, but there is near unanimity on the general thrust of the Government.  This consensus does not emerge by accident.  It is brought about by difficult tedious negotiations and by the exchange of views of all interested parties.  Consensus only works when all concerned are convinced and confident that there is a management team who will implement agreed policies with a sense of justice and urgency. Nobody here needs to be convinced of the sense of urgency to create jobs and to bring back our many emigrants.  I am convinced that the tide will turn dramatically in this area in the years ahead due to the determined efforts of this Government.</P>
      <P>I acknowledge that the leader of the main Opposition party, Deputy Dukes, has played a relatively important role in encouraging consensus.  Because of his responsible role in the 25th Dáil, when historians analyse the events of the late eighties, he will be credited with being an important political figure who, in recognising the need for political stability, showed altruistic qualities in playing a constructive role in this Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot say the same about the leader of the Progressive Democrats.  The people expect and demand real leadership from politicians.  I accept that parties of the Left have advanced sincere ideologically based alternative policies, but I cannot understand some of the stances taken by the leader of the Progressive Democrats.  Deputy O'Malley as leader of his party outbid all of us in this Chamber during the last election campaign, when it came to cutbacks, but when it came to cutbacks of health services in his <Col N="1653" /> own constituency he opposed this essential element of rationalisation.  This was from a party who scorned parish pump politics and politicians.  The reputation of the Progressive Democrats, the party of the pocket calculator, has been badly dented by their self-interest approach to the 25th Dáil.</P>
    <P>There are many Government decisions on health issues and on education which I find difficult to accept.  I do not want to make teachers redundant or to close hospitals.  I do not want to cut spending on roads, on industrial development and on farming supports and neither do the Government.  More than that, I do not want to be party to the destruction of the country we all cherish.  I will not be a party to such destruction so I must and will recognise the greater priority.  I and not just the Government must do my duty, however painful.  I want to see the day when all our young people are flocking back to fill the vacancies created by sound and courageous Government policies. Under this Government we are witnessing the birth of a new and exciting beginning for our relatively young country, but we still have much work to do.</P>
    <P>If we look at our very encouraging export figures, we can still see an overreliance on the UK market.  Our improvement in trade last year with the UK which amounted to about £44 million was worth almost twice as much as our total improvement with three other countries in the EC, with similar sized markets and trade conditions, namely, West Germany, France and Italy.  With the completion of the European internal market a mere four years away it is obvious that we must make an all out effort to capture a sizeable share of these markets.  A central part of this strategy must be becoming proficient or at least having a working knowledge of the language of our customers. It has been suggested that too many of our students are studying French and that German is being neglected.  I discussed this matter with secondary school teachers and came to the conclusion that we should not replace the study of French with German.  French is <Col N="1654" /> still a very important and essential language in the EC and it should not be replaced by German, Spanish or Italian. This presents our educationalists with a problem.  Most leaving certificate students are studying three languages, Irish, English and French along with science, commercial subjects and so on.  I understand the difficulties of school authorities and students in trying to fit four languages into a leaving certificate timetable.  I compliment the schools that manage this.  We must look at other options, for example extra curricular courses, a greater promotion of night classes, courses in languages in second level schools and the involvement of business.  I welcome the emphasis placed by the business community recently on learning the language of the purchaser.  Businesses have a major role to play in our efforts to tap new markets in Europe through a greater proficiency in European languages.</P>
    <P>The successes of this Government are quite staggering and very evident to everybody.  The business community have acknowledged the Government's many achievements, in particular I refer to foreign borrowing which is at its lowest level since the late seventies.  Inflation continues to fall.  The inflation rate is now below the EC average and this combined with a reduction in interest rates and the income tax concessions will, I have no doubt, lead to a growth of private investment in the coming months.</P>
    <P>The acknowledgment in this Finance Bill of the contribution that the PAYE sector have made to this country in recent years and the need for significant income tax reductions in this sector is one of the principal features of this Bill, and it is one I particularly welcome.  The Minister has pointed out that these tax changes are only the beginning.  If we are to encourage initiative and reward effort, we will have to continue to reduce income tax, as the overall level of taxation is still too high.  Nevertheless, it has to be acknowledged that these changes went far beyond the commitments made in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> where £30 million tax relief was promised.  As <Col N="1655" /> the Minister said, in 1988 relief will cost £91 million and £152 million in a full year.  This, I believe, is a major boost to taxpayers and this trend must continue. We are well on the way to having two-thirds of taxpayers paying tax at the standard rate only.</P>
    <P>The radical steps taken by the Minister in introducing a new tax assesment and collection system are to be applauded. We will now have a situation where the taxpayer will feel responsible for meeting his or her tax obligations and where the number of appeals will be significantly reduced.  We are talking about tax defaulters who are being given a once-off opportunity to clear up their accounts before September.  I understand there has been a very positive response to this innovative proposal.  It will, I have no doubt, bring in revenue that would otherwise never have surfaced.  If defaulters do not take advantage of the scheme then the introduction of the power of attachment will penalise them accordingly.  This Government have not just given attractive concessions to the PAYE taxpayer, but have for the first time in years seriously stood up to the tax defaulters and to the whole question of uncollected taxes.</P>
    <P>I welcome in particular the return of the section 23 tax measure.  This, as we know, allows expenditure incurred on constructing new residential accommodation for renting to be set off as a reduction against all rental income.  The Minister has decided to extend the relief to costs incurred in the conversion and refurbishment of property, of rental accommodation.  I welcome wholeheartedly this additional measure.</P>
    <P>We are all aware that a considerable number of building workers are employed, particularly in the Dublin area, in conversion and renovation of buildings.  Many of these buildings, particularly in the city area, are historic and in urgent need of preservation.  I have no doubt that this section 23 proposal will play a major role in preserving Dublin's fine architecture and ensuring the renewal of our city as a vibrant and lived <Col N="1656" /> in city.  It is most appropriate that this measure is being introduced in this the year of the Millenium.</P>
    <P>Other Deputies have referred to the International Financial Services Centre. All I would like to say is that I am impressed with the progress made to date on the Custom House Docks project.  The fact that 22 projects have been approved in principle, involving 700 jobs, is most encouraging.  The Government have rightly placed a lot of emphasis on this development.  I am as anxious as anybody else to see building in progress and to see some of our unemployed workforce, particularly in the building industry, back at work and no longer on the dole queues. I am also anxious to see many young emigrants who are part of the brain drain back working in our midst in this Financial Services Centre.  I have no doubt this will happen in the near future.</P>
    <P>There has been reference in the debate to treatment of disabled drivers.  I believe those representing disabled drivers have really misinterpreted what the Government are proposing for disabled drivers in this Bill.  What the Minister is proposing is that the Minister for Health, not the Minister for Finance, will, through the National Rehabilitation Board, administer the scheme covering the remission of road tax on vehicles for use by disabled drivers.  The Minister for Health has set up a working party with representatives of disabled drivers on the committee.  I understand the majority of the members of the committee are disabled drivers. They have the same number as was provided by the Department of Finance.  My understanding is that their brief is to eliminate unfairness and distortions in the present scheme.</P>
    <P>One such anomaly is that drivers with the full use of one or both legs do not qualify for assistance.  In other words, only those drivers who do not have the use of both legs qualify.  I think this is wrong.  I believe the working party will come up with a more balanced and fair system.  I understand they are thinking at present of a lump sum every three years to pay for the car and an allowance for running the car.  It is in the interest of the <Col N="1657" /> disabled drivers to bring in a new scheme; otherwise I believe the Department of Finance will revert to the original scheme.  I also believe there has been a lot of disinformation on this particular measure and it is time the air was cleared. The motives of the Minister and the Government are clear to me, and they are to improve, not to downgrade, the present scheme.</P>
    <P>Much has been said in this debate and written in the newspapers about the £10 levy on ATM cards.  It has been said that this is taxation on technology.  Some of the strongest opponents of this tax have been the banks.  I share the concern the banks have for their customers but there is a simple solution to this problem, and that is, that the banks pay the £6 million involved and thus save their customers this new charge.  After all, it must be pointed out that the banks have their own charges on ATM cards.  For example, the Allied Irish Banks charge 12p per transaction and the Bank of Ireland charge 14p per transaction.  In other words, if a Bank of Ireland customer uses his or her card twice a week then he or she is paying the bank £14 in a full year. There are many other bank charges the customer has to pay and I believe the banks should cover the cost in this instance and end the debate once and for all.  The Minister has to get the money from somewhere and the banks do well out of this economy.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his speech emphasised the fact that the Government were determined to pursue policies in line with cuts in public expenditure.  Priority has been rightly given to agriculture, tourism, forestry and fishing, our natural resources. The Government are also making a determined effort to protect and develop our natural environment.  This is a strategy I have promoted since my election to the Dáil last year.  Most of us would agree that we should protect and develop our environment and ensure that, for health and social reasons, our rivers, lakes and seas are clean, that our air is pure and that our fish, meat and agricultural products are fresh, wholesome and uncontaminated. This is a valid and just <Col N="1658" /> argument.  But there is another argument to support a strong environmental protection strategy, and that is an economic one.  There is no doubt about the direct link between Ireland's environmental state and our economy.  It is not just the state or condition of our rivers, lakes, land and agricultural products but also the image of Ireland abroad and the produce of this nation.</P>
    <P>An example of this link between our environment and our economy presents itself in the form of what was once a beautiful tourist attraction and popular fishing lake, Lough Sheelin.  Much has been written about this lake in recent times.  What has been done to Lough Sheelin can only be described as desecration and never be allowed to happen again.  The fact that this lake has been taken off the tourist promotional leaflets being distributed throughout Europe speaks for itself.  Those who destroyed Lough Sheelin seriously injured our tourist industry in that locality.  I can only hope that in time the fishermen will return to Lough Sheelin.  I understand all has not been lost and that there is hope that Lough Sheelin can be saved.  I hope that we have all learned from this saga.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I believe the Government's approach in controlling public finances is correct.  It is imperative that we stick courageously to our targets in the interest of future generations.  We must continue to look for job opportunities in the areas I have mentioned &mdash; in agri-based products, science and technology, our natural resources and construction.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to continue his efforts to promote the construction industry.  I am convinced that the docks site project will be a great success and section 23 concessions in my view will lead to many jobs being created in the building industry.  The days of large housing schemes, public or private, are fading.  There is a shift towards small selective house schemes.  We must assist the construction industry in every way possible.  We must listen and consult.  The buzz word at the moment is &ldquo;consensus&rdquo;<Col N="1659" /> and that is the formula for success by the Government.  In the years ahead we must continue to strive for consensus.  One major achievement by the Government was that they involved so many people in the process of consensus.  We must continue to explain what is taking place as we go along.  We must outline our problems and the solutions to them as we see them.  We must seek the support of our social partners.  We are in this together and we will make it if we work hand-in-hand.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank the Chair for calling me.  At the outset I should like to address the underlying aspects of the Bill which contains many <Col N="1660" /> elements that have been promoted by the Progressive Democrats since their inception, namely, taking control of the public finances so that they can be reduced which, in turn, would mean that taxation could be reduced and that real economic growth could take place here.  The Government have taken control of the public finances.  Elements in last year's and this year's budgets are leading us in that direction.  However, my party have difficulty with the thrust of some of those elements and I should like to offer suggestions to the Government for implementation in the future.</P>
      <P>One of the main provisions of the Bill which I regard as extremely important in terms of the climate it creates in tax collection is the amnesty for tax defaulters.  The provision in the Bill has to be seen as a useful tool in fighting tax evasion, as a once-off incentive to defaulting taxpayers.  Apparently it has been very effective and is bringing in amounts of tax from those who have already been assessed for tax.  However, it is not having any effect on those who are evading tax completely and are operating in the black economy.  On the evidence of figures published by the Government and others, it is difficult to understand how Ireland as a business keeps going.  The answer has to be that the black economy sustains economic activity while denying any benefits of that activity to the State as a whole.  What is needed urgently is a real onslaught on reducing personal taxation levels.  They must be systematically reduced having regard to their effect on the incentive to work.  At the same time as pursuing a policy of reducing taxation levels, there must also be a policy to pursue those outside the tax net.  It is essential that they should be done hand-in-hand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government are patently not concerned with the latter part of that strategy. In the latter half of last year they approved the transfer of the anti-evasion branch in relation to VAT in the Revenue Commissioners to the Collector General's office.  That must indicate to those outside the tax net that the Government are only interested in chasing those who <Col N="1661" /> are paying tax and do not have any interest in widening the tax base to include those who are evading tax.  There is real resentment among compliant taxpayers and Revenue officials that those who have defaulted over the years are getting special treatment.  The benefits of this amnesty, and there are benefits, must be weighed against the disaffection it caused among compliant taxpayers.</P>
    <P>There is also the danger that those who have defaulted in the past will do so again in the hope that another amnesty will be declared in the future.  Compliant taxpayers must also feel aggrieved that the system whereby interest on overpayment of tax is paid by the Revenue Commissioners at the rate of 1 per cent per month, tax free, is being abused.  Many of those who have been tax defaulters over the years and who are now taking advantage of the amnesty and thereby paying no interest on the outstanding taxes are benefiting to the tune of 12 per cent per annum, tax free, on overpayments of this year's assessed tax.</P>
    <P>It is very common that initial assessments sent to taxpayers overstate the amount of tax which will finally be due. That means that if a taxpayer pays the full amount of the assessment when presented with it, he or she will in the end be repaid the excess with interest, tax free, by the Revenue Commissioners. That is an attractive proposition as the net rate of interest gained, taking into account that it is tax free, is surely the best available in the city.  There is no provision in the Bill for a set-off of overpayment of tax against tax due or interest owing.  While a solution such as a set-off may not be technically possible under the terms of the Bill, surely it is not beyond the ingenuity of the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Finance to prepare a provision that will end the abuse of State money by those who have in the past reneged on their duty to pay their taxes.  I should like to call on the Minister to take note of what is happening and restore faith in some vestige of fairness remaining in the taxation system. Compliant taxpayers would be very appreciative.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1662" /> I must say that unemployment and emigration which were glossed over in the budget speech in January are not of great consequence in the Bill before us. There are a number of provisions in the Bill which are intended to go some way towards creating the right climate for investment and job creation.  I am thinking of the financial services centre, the repatriation of dividends of Irish companies abroad tax free and the section 23 tax reliefs on building, refurbishment and conversion of rented accommodation. However, I foresee a number of difficulties arising if we rely on those provisions to create jobs in meaningful numbers.  The Minister has said that the financial services centre has issued two licences for projects and that there are a further 20 in line for approval.  The number of jobs involved in those projects is in the region of 700 which means an average of 30 jobs per project.</P>
    <P>I wish the concept of the financial centre every success.  I believe Ireland is sadly lacking in carving out its own niche in areas of commerce or industry but the provision of employment via such a centre for financial services depends to an enormous extent on the personal tax and corporation tax climates here.  Firms will find it very difficult to persuade their executives to relocate in Dublin where the cost of living is so much higher than in many other cities and where the takehome proportion of salaries compares so unfavourably with other tax regimes.  I do not think we will see the financial services centre take off until there is some appreciable move to reduce tax levels.</P>
    <P>The encouragement of Irish companies to repatriate their profits or dividends, tax free if invested in projects which will benefit our economy, in particular in relation to the creation of employment, is also dependent for its success on the tax climate generally here.  If the main aim of such a scheme is to encourage job creation, the Government will have to look very seriously at the substantial payroll taxes obtaining.  If these are not reduced as a proportion of the total wage bill, firms simply will not be interested in investing in employment.  Neither the <Col N="1663" /> return to the employer nor employee is an encouragement to do so.  We must face the fact that the climate for investment here is still very hostile if jobs are to be the priority.</P>
    <P>As an example of how the tax reliefs provided for in this Finance Bill may work against the investment of funds for job creation, the reintroduction of section 23 of the Finance Act, 1981, giving tax relief in respect of small rented accommodation, must be carefully monitored. If not monitored this may well turn out to be a disincentive to the creation of jobs.</P>
    <P>The building industry is in the doldrums because of lack of real activity in our economy.  I am not aware of any great need at present for a major increase in the numbers of properties available for renting.  Certainly there is some need on a continuing basis for such properties to be made available.  However, the danger of attracting investors in property, with the use of this tax relief, is that it will concentrate investment in that sector as against investment in business and job creation, the latter also being wealthcreating.</P>
    <P>A number of years ago the circumstances prevailing rendered it very attractive to invest in property.  As a consequence other sectors were starved of the necessary finance or seed capital. We must be very vigilant to ensure that this does not recur.  That is not to say that this tax relief should not be available. However, I must repeat that it should be carefully monitored so that there is not an imbalance in investment in the refurbishment of such premises to the extent that other areas, which would be wealthcreating, would be deprived of such investment.</P>
    <P>While not specifically included in the provisions of this Bill I might refer to the question of the national lottery funds which should be examined again in relation to the creation of employment and the stemming of emigration.  The national lottery has succeeded beyond all expectations.  There is a much greater <Col N="1664" /> amount of money available from its proceeds than was ever envisaged.  Surely it is time we re-examined the need to divert all its funds for the purposes set out in the Lotteries Act?  There is room for diverting some of its proceeds into employment creating projects, particularly community-based ones.  This would allow people to contribute to the alleviation of the greatest social problem facing us at present and which we shall continue to face in the foreseeable future. I make my suggestion in the context of the stated Government thrust in favour of job creation.  In this respect I should point out that there are already administrative channels in existence.  It is a suggestion which would be welcomed by people throughout the country.</P>
    <P>I might deal now with the question of the withholding tax dealt with in section 7, its application being widened.  It is my belief there should be the concept of a withholding tax.  It was one of the recommendations of the Commission on Taxation. It has not been implemented by this Government in the context in which that commission envisaged its implementation. It is a laudable aim to bring as many people as possible on to a current basis of payment of tax.  With that in mind it is proper that all those who receive payments from the State &mdash; just like PAYE taxpayers &mdash; should have the tax withheld at source.  I believe that the withholding of tax should be implemneted on the same basis as applies to PAYE taxpayers.  The difference between the existing withholding tax system and the PAYE system is that, in many instances, the tax paid by professionals employed by the State is paid not just on their incomes but on turnover. I mentioned this in the course of a number of debates in the past year.  I mention it again because I believe it is basically unfair and inequitable.</P>
    <P>The Minister should set his mind to doing something about redressing that inequity.  Not alone is it inequitable but it is actually putting people out of business and onto the unemployment queues. That seems farcical when one considers the stated intention of this Government, <Col N="1665" /> which is to increase employment.  The reality is that, when a small firm of, say, consulting engineers, valuers, or others, allied to the building trade receive a fee from the State it does not cover simply their income.  It covers all their costs, turnover, staff salaries, any expenses incurred in the carrying on of their business. Therefore, the implementation of this withholding tax is putting an enormous strain on those types of businesses and on their cash flows which become non-existent.  If the Minister does not take action immediately the position will worsen.</P>
    <P>It should be remembered that the withholding tax applies to rural doctors practising within the GMS.  I say specifically rural doctors because they have encountered the problem that 95 to 99 per cent of their practices involve medical cardholders, allowing them no opportunity to have a cash flow by way of private sector medicine.  It is quite right that payments to them should be taxed.  But it should be remembered that a sizeable element of the payment made to a doctor practising under the GMS scheme is supposed to represent his costs, the provision of a surgery, a secretary, heating, light and so on.  It is acknowledged by the health boards that that is the case.  A specific proportion of the fee earned by a doctor is supposed to represent those costs and the remainder is supposed to represent his fee.  It appears to me to be untenable to allocate the withholding tax to the proportion which constitutes the doctor's fee and not to the practice expenses as a whole.  That is an omission from the provisions of this Bill.  That has been my concern over the past year since the introduction of this withholding tax.  It applies across the board.  Presumably some of the groups to whom this withholding tax is being extended under the provisions of this Bill will encounter the same problems. Whether or not they will, the same objections stand.</P>
    <P>With specific reference to consultants being brought within the withholding tax net, with payments henceforth being proposed to be made directly to the consultant for his part of any hospital fee by <Col N="1666" /> an insurance service, that is only right and proper since other professionals in many other fields who receive payments from a State body must pay withholding tax on their fees.  I see no reason why medical consultants should not have to do likewise.  I would abhor any move to pass that charge on to patients.  It is unworthy of any group representing consultants to so suggest.</P>
    <P>I might refer to the system of self-assessment to taxation introduced in this Bill.  There is no doubt but that it constitutes a move in the right direction.  The Commission on Taxation recommended that there should be a move towards self-assessment. As the Minister said in the course of his remarks, the various aims of that commission are those he is now proposing.  I foresee there will be difficulties and I know that the Revenue Commissioners are aware that there will be difficulties in the introduction of this scheme.  I also know that many taxpayers will not know how to handle it because they are not familiar with the revenue law.  There will, undoubtedly, be problems in the beginning.  I know that for the first year there is a certain optional quality but after that it will extend to everybody on a compulsory basis.  We have not done enough thinking about what needs to be done to have a smoothly working self-assessment system.  For instance, how do the Revenue Commissioners propose to obtain an accurate profile of a typical auctioneer, solicitor or doctor?  A profile is needed before they can decide whether a group of people who send in certain self-assessments are telling the truth.</P>
    <P>What international models have been used in devising this system?  What can we expect in its implementation?  I know in the United States they go to extreme lengths to establish what type of profile there is in regard to, say, a hairdresser or anyone who is self-employed.  They build up a profile by doing a huge amount of work at the beginning and they can rely on that basis.  We have heard nothing about how the Revenue Commissioners intend to implement this.  We have heard the rules regarding the taxpayers but not <Col N="1667" /> the <i>modus operandi</i> of the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>Fairness must be exhibited by the Revenue Commissioners.  Some people consider that this system will favour the self-employed because it means that apparently there is less scrutiny.  I believe that if the penalties are right and implemented properly a climate will be created whereby far fewer people will attempt tax evasion than has been the case to date.</P>
    <P>How, for instance, will the Revenue Commissioners differentiate between a small trader who simply makes a computational error or who misinterprets the law in computing his tax or filling in the self-assessment form and a small trader who deliberately misleads the Revenue Commissioners by omitting certain details?  That needs to be addressed.  At present it is addressed by having almost everybody investigated to an inordinate degree and that cannot be the solution under self-assessment or it will be a selfdefeating scheme.</P>
    <P>Is it known what percentage of those who will be assessing their own tax will be fully examined?  It is a small percentage in the United States but when they fully examine someone they literally take the place apart.  They come into your house, office or place of business and they even ask about your dry cleaning bills.  Without that kind of approach, this system will not be effective.  There will also be difficulties if those found evading or defaulting on tax payments are not subject to publicity, which will be uncomfortable and embarrassing for them.  The system will also be ineffective if they are not subject to court appearances and if the full rigours of the law are not applied to them.  Will there be imprisonment?  What kind of penalties will be involved?  We are entering a different phase of tax collection and assessment and we have not yet heard what way the Revenue Commissioners will make sure it will work effectively.  There is quite a different concept involved and I do not believe that the public, to any great extent, realise <Col N="1668" /> this.  I should like to know if the Revenue Commissioners realise it.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that, in order for self-assessment to work, the penalties must be a real deterrent.  They must be substantial and publicised because in a small country there is a danger that somebody knows someone who will put in a good word for them, which means that the system will fall apart.  I hope that we have reached the stage of maturity where we as a nation, having seen the difficulties which the State has experienced financially over the last number of years, see it as our duty to make sure that we pay what is due because, if we do, we will be better off as a nation.</P>
    <P>On a more practical note, the self-assessment system must also be accompanied by a simplification of the tax code.  Our tax code and legal system are extremely complicated.  Until the tax code is simplified, it is not fair to expect individuals to be able to make returns as they should.  Neither is it fair to expect everybody to go to an accountant.  There are many small traders who are singly self-employed and they simply cannot afford the extra overheads involved in consulting an accountant for a service which they should be able to do themselves if the code was simple enough. As the Commission on Taxation report indicated, that involves the elimination as far as possible of special allowances. There should be a downward thrust of tax rates and, as far as possible, uniform tax rates should apply across the board, not just in personal taxation but also in company taxation.</P>
    <P>I warmly welcome the elimination of the type of frivolous and obstructionist appeals to date.  There is no doubt that many appeals were a time wasting exercise which clogged the system and prevented the Revenue Commissioners from collecting money which was due.  It is only right that the taxpayer, if he wishes to appeal, should show good faith and make a payment as requested.  If it is found he is due a rebate, fair enough, but it is essential that a payment be made when an appeal is lodged.</P>
    <P>The Minister made great play in his <Col N="1669" /> speech of the fact that, as he believed, there had been a substantial bettering of tax relief and that people should be much better off.  In reality, we all know that that will not be the case.  He instanced the fact that personal tax reliefs this year will cost £91 million, in a full year they would be £152 million, and £400 million over the next three years.</P>
    <P>We should cast our minds back to the pay agreement that was negotiated between the Government and the public sector some months ago in which a commitment was made to pay a percentage increase to the public sector which there is no doubt this Government could not afford to pay and should have been the first to plead inability to pay.  The extra pay cost to the State this year will amount to about £100 million.  If you look at the tax reliefs the Minister is saying are being offered in this budget it seems that without giving a pay rise to the public sector we could have given everybody the benefit of further tax reliefs.  We could have concentrated them on the low paid if we had not spent that £100 million on public sector pay.  We could have concentrated them on the lower paid either by increasing tax reliefs at the lower end or by abolishing PRSI, as we have suggested on a number of occasions, on the first few thousands of pounds earned.  That is where we must start.</P>
    <P>We must make an effort to encourage people who are on marginal levels of pay (1) to stay at work and (2) to try to work their way up the ladder.  Where people who are on social welfare assistance or benefit are offered jobs which are, to be fair to them, going to give them less of a financial return than they get at present between the various allowances given to them, medical card and so on, it is not fair to ask them to take a job which will bring in less.  We should, therefore, concentrate our resources on trying to include as many people in the working population as possible and not try to exclude them.  Many people I meet day in and day out who are offered jobs, even part time, cannot take them up because either they would be financially worse off or they would be running the risk of <Col N="1670" /> getting all their payments cut off.  Is that crazy or is it not?  We are actually paying people not to work.  We are building it into our system that they should not work or it will be a penalty on them if they do.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt in my mind that a wrong decision was made when it came to negotiating a pay deal with the public sector.  That £100 million &mdash; or the £70 million which is absolutely involved in the pay deal &mdash; could much better have been used towards stimulating people's interest in working, the taking of jobs, promotion and so on at the lower end of the scale so that people are included, not excluded, from the working population.</P>
    <P>On a minor note, because it is an interest of mine, I welcome the extension of the tax relief to widowers that widows had up to now in the year of bereavement, I find it anomalous, to say the least, that in many instances either in the tax code or the social welfare code men who are in the same situation as women find themselves financially far worse off.  An instance was given to me recently of a doserted husband who had three children and was in receipt of about £20 a week less than a deserted wife with three children. That is disgraceful and there is no reason for it.  I have raised this matter in letters to the Department of Social Welfare and essentially they say, &ldquo;Sorry, we cannot do it; it costs too much.&rdquo;  I have got them to give figures for it, and it should be considered seriously because it is hugely inequitable.  I do not believe it would cost too much.  As a step in that direction I welcome the fact that widowers now are put on the same tax footing as widows from the year of their bereavement.</P>
    <P>The Minister has introduced what he calls a once-off levy on pension funds. This is a very shortsighted exercise because already the Minister has done an about-turn on it having heard the facts, and has excluded approximately 23,000 of the 25,000 pension funds that were in the business at the beginning.  Despite that, he still says in his speech that there will be no real effect on excepted yield. I would like an explanation of that.  I do <Col N="1671" /> not understand how that can fit in with the other fact.</P>
    <P>There is a mistaken impression that pension funds are somehow like insurance companies or large commercial organisations.  They are not.  To a large extent they are single pension funds or small groups of people who get together to provide for their own pensions.  They are the people we should be relying on. They have taken the responsibility of providing for their old age or their future and what have we done?  We have reduced the yield they can expect from this fund in this year and I have grave doubts as to whether this will not be continued next year and the year after.</P>
    <P>Another anomaly relating to the pension funds issue is that it has no effect whatsoever on the whole public sector because the public sector run an unfunded pension scheme.  The public sector do not provide for their future and, therefore, are not going to be hit by this. Once more, that is anomalous and reiterates to the man in the street that if you are working, providing, doing your job, we are going to get you.  That is not fair. I am not saying the public service are not working, but the Government are not providing for their future as they should be and are going on blindly as if there will always be money there to fund these pensions out of current expenditure, which we all know is in grave danger of not being true.</P>
    <P>The automated teller machine card duty which is being proposed in the Finance Bill is quite an unbelievable proposal from a Minister who must be aware of the difficulties in this country regarding the huge amounts of cash that have to be carted around the place almost every day of the week.  The Minister of State present should know as well because there have been numerous robberies from post offices and employment exchanges and the cash, because it is there, is at risk.  There is a movement to pay people directly by cheque.  This movement is being encouraged by Government, the employers and the trade unions.  It is for once a joint effort <Col N="1672" /> and what does the Minister come in and do?  He imposes a duty which effectively puts a stymie on the development of that trend.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his speech said that we must be prepared for the fact that electronic communication of money and so on is coming in the future and there is no reason why we should not look at this as a source of revenue.  I say to him that it is not established here yet.  Our country is extremely backward in relation to whether it will accept a cheque or direct credit as opposed to cash.  We simply have not got on the band wagon yet.  It would be fair enough for the Minister to come back in five or ten years when it is established and say, &ldquo;Now that it is an established business I am going to look at it at this stage.&rdquo;  The real objection everybody has to it is that he is putting a stop to a trend that has begun to gather momentum and get some degree of acceptance from the public at large.  It will not continue to do so if he persists with this duty.</P>
    <P>On the disabled drivers proposal it is disingenuous of the Minister to come into the House and say he is going to remove the benefits to disabled drivers of the reliefs they get and they are to take on faith that somehow this is going to be catered for in the future, somehow the health boards perhaps will have funds with which to do this&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnneMarieColley" hpid="Miss Colley Miss Colley">
      <NameTxt>Miss Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that somehow somebody will take care of disabled drivers and give them the relief they have enjoyed so far which, I have to say, is well deserved. To a disabled driver a car is an essential tool.  It is a replacement for the limb he has lost or of which he has lost the use and that essential tool is recognised by the existing reliefs.  The Minister has not spelt out the anomalies, the unfairness and the distortions that he says exist in the way those reliefs have operated.  He has not given us details and he is not saying how he will replace those reliefs. That is not acceptable and we will oppose <Col N="1673" /> their removal unless we know what is coming in.  When we know what is coming in and that it will work, we will look at it in a positive manner.</P>
      <P>Deputy Kitt who spoke before me referred to a committee which made recommendations on this matter.  The committee which made the recommendations was made up if six persons, two of whom represented disabled people, four of whom did not but represented the State.  I believe we cannot hand over in good faith to the Minister the notion that he will provide for disabled drivers if he is not able to come into this House and explain how he will do so.</P>
      <P>In conclusion, I commend the Minister and the Government on the moves they are making to rationalise the tax system, be it in the area of assessment or of collection.  The main difficulty I would have with what he has proposed is that he seems to ignore the real need for reducing the tax rates particularly at the lower levels.  This Government have made great play of the fact that they are aiming at having 66 per cent, two-thirds of all taxpayers, on a standard rate.  I should like to say that the standard rate of 35 per cent is completely unacceptable and that it is no great feat to get two-thirds of taxpayers on that rate.  What is required is that we reduce the standard rate and allow as many people as possible to pay at a lower rate, possibly 25 per cent, which is a reasonable amount in international terms.  To do that we should be moving towards widening the tax base. I know the Minister asked for ideas in his speech.  A number of ideas have been mentioned in the debate.  I have mentioned a few.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister and the Government are not addressing this urgent problem of the high levels of taxation with any sense of what actually makes things work in the economy.  The real incentive is in what I take home at the end of the week.  This is another missed opportunity.  Because of the haste after taking office last year the Government had to produce a budget and there was some reason to expect that they could not deal with the question of <Col N="1674" /> taxation in any real detail but they have now had an opportunity to show faith but that has not been the case.  They proclaim that their aim is simply to bring two-thirds of taxpayers to the rate of 35 per cent.  We will be a long time waiting for the economic recovery which this country badly needs if we allow ourselves to rest on that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>Initially, I want to refer to my maiden speech last year, on 14 June, when the subject, too, was the then Finance Bill.  I made the comment at that time that it was ridiculous to do our business in such a way that we were passing the Finance Bill at a time when almost half the year had elapsed.  I would like to put it on the record that I am very pleased that the Government looked at this matter and considered it important that the Estimates should be published prior to the end of the last financial year, that the budget would be placed before the House as early as possible in the current year and the Finance Bill immediately after that.  That is a much more businesslike approach and one that has been welcomed by all sides of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before dealing with some of the matters to which I want to refer in relation to the Finance Bill I would like to refer to a few points which have been made by previous speakers.  One of those matters, referred to by Deputy Colley in the course of her contribution, was the lottery fund which she admitted does not come under the Finance Bill.  She made the point that we should have another look at how the lottery funds are being dispensed and disbursed and that we should possibly consider other ways of spending lottery funds.  So far as I am concerned we have had too many looks at this matter and the funds are too widely dissipated at present.  We are in danger of dissipating the funds so much, right across the board, that we end up giving everybody a small amount and nobody sufficient for their means.  I would not like to see the lottery funds expended or dissipated any more widely.  I would remind Deputy Colley that within the current schemes, particularly in the <Col N="1675" /> environmental area, the grants being given for amenity schemes will provide much employment at local level.  All the grants in the sports area will also provide much needed employment, particularly in the construction area.  I think the Deputy will find over the next year that the dispersal of the lottery funds will have the desired effect of increasing employment throughout the country because grants are being given.  I would be wary of introducing another element that would have to be financed from the lottery funds.  The question of employment is adequately catered for under the existing schemes.</P>
    <P>Not only Deputy Colley in this debate but other speakers in a number of debates during the past six months have referred to the public sector pay deal in the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i> The general criticism they have levelled is that the money granted for increases in public sector pay could have been better spent and that it was not right that public servants should receive an increase of 2 per cent or 2½ per cent on average.  I do not go along with that.  The people who levelled that criticism and the charge that the unions were hoodwinked before they signed this agreement does not say much for the Opposition party's opinion of trade union executives and negotiators. Nobody was hoodwinked.  This was a good and fair deal.  The people who criticised the Government for allowing for a 2 per cent or a 2½ per cent increase in wages are the same people who have criticised the Government for not allowing the implementation of the report on remuneration for higher civil servants. They have criticised the Government for not implementing the recommendations of that report because they say &mdash; and I agree with them &mdash; that failure to do so would have an effect on morale.  If people asked public servants who are working hard to take a pay freeze for the next three years, I would not like to think what the response would be.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>Last night I advocated the inclusion of an age of majority card as a provision in the proposed legislation. This would give young people a sense of responsibility in relation to their own drinking and the long-term benefits would be very great.  We often notice among the adult population a lack of responsibility towards drinking and a lack of awareness of its many ugly side effects.  It would be well if the upcoming generation had a sense of responsibility towards drinking. There would certainly be an effect on young people if they had to produce a card in order to obtain drink.  There would be no compulsion to carry the card but the rule would be &ldquo;no card &mdash; no drink&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding penalties, Deputy Barrett has advocated an increase in fines.  That <Col N="1677" /> is a step in the right direction but he has not gone far enough.  He stops short of a sanction which would have a strong effect on those who sell drink.  Deputy McCartan said last night that dishonest publicans ought to be sent to jail.  I am not sure I would agree with that course of action.  We have too many people in our jails.  Jail is not the best answer for dealing with all misdemeanours.  There are strong reasons for seeking alternative sanctions for a number of offences.  I would not advocate jail for people who breach the licensing law by selling drink to teenagers. If licence holders in pubs, discos or other licensed premises were found to be repeatedly in breach of the law their licences could be suspended for a period of several days or even for a month.  This would have a most salutary effect.  If a licensed premises could be closed for even one day it would bring many people to their senses.  Off-licences are major offenders in respect of teenage drinking but if these premises were closed down for a week the penalty would be severe enough to act as a very strong deterrent. This could be done at no cost to the State. If that discretion were given to judges it would go a long way towards solving the problem which Deputy Barrett has brought before the House.  It would jolt licence holders and those who work in licensed premises into a sense of responsibility. We would engender a much more adult approach to drinking if we could enhance the sense of responsibility among young people who buy drink and among those who sell it.  I feel very strongly about the matter of penalties and it will be the subject of one of the amendments I hope to table on Committee Stage.  The other amendment will relate to the carrying of an age of majority card.</P>
    <P>Many of our problems here and in other countries derive from the general attitude towards drinking by both adults and teenagers.  The phenomenon of teenage drinking is not peculiar to Ireland. There is an enormous problem in America, in France, in England and throughout Europe where there has been an explosion of drinking among teenagers.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1678" /> No real research has been done into the reason but it is suspected that part of the reason derives from the constant advertising of drink products on television. This is a factor which we must take into consideration.  It is not too much to ask that advertisements which set out to make drink appear so glamorous as to be almost irresistable should not be shown on television during family viewing times. It might have some effect if such advertisements were confined to later viewing times.  There is some reason why so many young people are being drawn to drink and this is a measure which we could take without any major cost to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>A contributory factor seems to be that parents nowadays do not have the same control or authority over their children as they had when we were growing up. Certainly many parents do not seem to exercise the same control.  This is extremely serious.  If the problem does not lend itself to resolution under the provisions of this Bill when it becomes law, we might have to decide that some parents should be made responsible for their children's drinking habits, perhaps by paying fines if they allow their children to roam around the streets and become involved in teenage drink parties, with all the ugly side effects.  The depredations which they can cause have already been well described in the course of this debate.  In many ways this is a very unhappy country in which to grow old. In certain urban areas older people are living in fear of their lives or in fear of what may happen to themselves and their property.  Young people can think of nothing better to do on leaving a drink party than to terrorise old people in their homes, break windows and smash doors or break into vacant houses where they can carry on on their shenanigans late into the night.  This is having a very worrying effect on older people.  If this legislation does not solve the problem we will have to find stronger measures.</P>
    <P>I hope that all the discussion which has taken place on this Bill will jolt not only young people and publicans but also parents into some sense of their responsibility. A great deal of the problem derives <Col N="1679" /> from lack of responsibility on the part of many people.  It really applies to all of us. I welcome the Bill and commend Deputy Barrett for bringing it to the House.  I repeat my call to the Minister to allow this Bill to go through on its merits.  It is a specific piece of legislation aimed at a particular problem which needs to be addressed today.  I appeal to everybody on the Government side not to delay it for any reason, even by trying to incorporate it into the Government's Bill.</P>
    <P>In this case I believe the problem is so urgent that nothing that would delay the Bill by one day should be entertained at this stage.  Undoubtedly, having read the other Bill, I believe it will evoke a lot of very broad and wide-ranging discussion and will not go through the House very quickly.  Let us put our heads together and let us give united recognition to the enormity of the problem.  Let this Bill go through and become law and let us facilitate in every way we can the enforcement of the provisions of this Bill as quickly as possible.  We will be supporting the Bill, with amendments, when it goes to Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with Deputy Quill in thanking Deputy Barrett for initiating this debate.  We have had many issues discussed in Private Members' Time but I have found this to be a very worthwhile debate.  The contributions that have come from all sides of the House have been very constructive and positive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That we have a very serious under-age drinking problem is beyond doubt.  The more I delve into the issue, the more concerned and the more frightened I become.  The more you talk to teachers, youth workers, or to fellow parents the more you hear about what is happening out in the bad world.  It is not just cider parties.  The scene has become more sophisticated and now we are talking about drinking parties in houses.  We are talking about the use of vodka, gin and very heavy spirits being consumed by young children, children as young as 13 or 14 years.  As I have said, the more one <Col N="1680" /> delves into the problem the more worried one becomes.</P>
    <P>Many people have referred to the fact that legislation can do only so much, and I would agree with that.  The bottom line is that it all comes down to parental control. As parents we should all ask whether we know where our children are at any particular time.  I believe if this principle were adopted many of these problems would not exist.  I also believe we must have an open approach in our homes. Modern life demands that we talk to our children.  I would be the first to accept that many politicians like myself have not got much time to talk to children because of the nature of our profession.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is correct when she says you have to make time but we depend on our spouses and I know my own spouse does the job of communicating with our children very well. The issue is about parental control in the main and it is about knowing where our children are at any given time, particularly in the late hours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Legislation can help to deal with the problem but I suggest, and I think most people would agree, that drink is now a bigger killer of young people than drugs. In the UK it has been established that drink is a bigger killer than drugs and that is the way we are heading in Ireland. There is a very definite association between drink and crime and between drink and unwanted pregnancies, and many of the mothers in these cases would be as young as 14 years.  This is very worrying.  It comes down to the fact that we have to be aware of the problems and to educate our children accordingly.  I believe we can do more in our schools.  I have found that the anti-smoking campaign in our schools has been most effective. My own daughter has been involved in an anti-smoking project and she even convinced me that I should give them up. She has been most effective.  That is the type of strategy we should adopt with <Col N="1681" /> regard to drink.  I believe that a very strong campaign on the lines of the anti-smoking campaign in our schools would be most helpful.</P>
    <P>The points Deputy Quill made with regard to advertising are valid.  I would like to see very definite standards applying to advertising.  The image of the drinker as macho should not be accepted.  In fact, I would go so far as to suggest that it should be banned.  We should have responsible advertising in the area of drink.  Drinking in moderation is a marvellous social activity.  I would be the first to accept that.  In Ireland we pride ourselves on our love of conversation, music and song.  Drink is a wonderful thing but it is being presented as a macho type activity for people which it is not. Drink should be respected and it is not treated in that manner in advertising.</P>
    <P>What can we do with regard to legislation? Legislation can help to deal with the problem.  The Minister has produced and obviously Deputy Barrett has seen the Intoxicating Liquor Bill, 1988.  We are all trying to curb under-age drinking as well as introducing provisions to deal with other aspects of the licensing laws. The debate has been worth while and, at the end of the day, we will have legislation introduced in this House.  I join with my colleagues in asking Deputy Barrett to hold off for a very short period and to wait for the Government Bill.</P>
    <P>The legislation will make it more difficult for young people to obtain alcohol. It can assist the Garda &mdash; and they need assistance &mdash; in detecting breaches of the law and in bringing prosecutions and it can obviously introduce penalties.  Most people involved in the liquor business are responsible and do not supply drink to under-age persons but, as we are all aware, there are individuals who go outside the law and supply drink to young people.  I suggest they are in the minority. The debate is really about the abuse of alcohol and about education with regard to alcohol.  It is important that we repeat that.  I have heard other speakers refer to the problem of absenteeism in the work place and I hope a healthier attitude <Col N="1682" /> towards drink will result from this debate. Drink in moderation is a very good thing.</P>
    <P>The Minister's Bill amends the licensing laws and deals with special restaurant licences, prohibited hours, under-age drinking and extending the opening hours which will create an atmosphere where moderation will prevail.  I hope respect for drink will prevail.  We will be moving more in line socially with our European partners and with European practices.  I welcome the liberalisation of the licensing laws.  I welcome this approach.  The benefits in regard to tourism are evident and this is something we should all agree to promote.</P>
    <P>At present it is an offence to sell or to supply intoxicating liquor to young persons under the age of 18 years.  This is impossible to enforce because of the requirement under the 1924 Act that the person selling the drink did so &ldquo;knowingly&rdquo;, that is, knowing the person buying the alcohol was under 18 years.  I commend Deputy Barrett for addressing this issue.  It is a very complex area.  Deputy Barrett's Bill puts an added responsibility on the publican or supplier in selling or supplying intoxicating liquor to a person under the age of 18 years.  The Bill covers the sale of drink to persons under 18 and it covers the purchasing of drink by or on behalf of those under 18.  The Bill also gives new powers to a member of the Garda to seize bottles or other containers which they have reasonable cause to believe contain intoxicating liquor from persons under the age of 18 years.  I believe this is a most important area of legislation that we must address.</P>
    <P>I want to refer again to the problem of cider parties.  In the Dublin area in particular we have all heard complaints from local residents about the growth of cider parties in the city and county.  This problem arises among all classes of society.  We all hope to see the day when the Garda can go in and seize these bottles and I welcome this part of Deputy Barrett's proposal.</P>
    <P>Youngsters turn to drink because in many cases they do not have any alternative in their community or because their parents do not ensure that they have <Col N="1683" /> an alternative means of recreation.  There are alternative means of recreation in most parts of Dublin.  There are youth groups working in communities and many people are working voluntarily on the ground.  There are options for young people if their parents genuinely try to involve their youngsters in these activities. It is an adult responsibility.  It is not easy but parents should be obliged to ensure that their young children have other options.  The youngsters who get involved in cider parties and other types of undesirable activities such as congregating in open spaces and outside local chippers are the ones who should be encouraged to take part in other activities. I accept that we should continue to improve such options and the facilities that are available.  I have no doubt, from the evidence so far, that the national lottery will improve the options for our young people and will ensure they have alternative options other than getting involved in these infamous cider parties.</P>
    <P>Deputy Quill referred to identity cards.  It is important that this matter should be debated.  Deputy Quill was quite adamant that there should be an age of majority card for the over 18s.  I think that is basically the same as an ID card.  Some local voluntary community-based identification system could be established if the need arises, as no doubt it will at some future date.</P>
    <P>The control of under-age drinking is a family problem, community problem, a problem for our gardaí, publicans and those involved in the off-licence trade. However, it is primarily a community responsibility and if all those working in the community can come to grips with it that will be the desirable approach. People's privacy is being whittled away with the advances in technology and I would be very slow to infringe further on the privacy and confidentiality of the individual.  I accept that many people feel this is the only option but I would advance the voluntary approach to this issue at this point.</P>
    <P>Deputy McCartan made an interesting point in relation to a 17-year old drinking <Col N="1684" /> wine at a wedding.  I, too, would not like to see the local Garda rushing in and taking the glass out of his hand because a wedding venue is basically an extension of the home and I do not think either Deputy Barrett or the Minister for Justice, Deputy Collins, want to legislate for the family, whether in the home or at a wedding in an hotel.  I think it is a valid point and I support the points made by Deputy McCartan.</P>
    <P>The differences between this Bill and the Minister's Bill are minute but nevertheless they are important.  The Minister's Bill allows children under 15 years of age to be on licensed premises at any time during permitted hours if accompanied by a parent or guardian. The Private Members' Bill allows under 15s to be on licensed premises with a parent or guardian up to 8 p.m. only. Both Bills forbid children being on licensed premises at any time unless accompanied by a parent or guardian. That is obviously correct.  Not every public premises is conducive to the presence of children and it is a practice I do not encourage.  Unfortunately many of our pubs are drab and dark and some are unhygienic.  Obviously during the tourist season some pubs cater for entertainment for children.  I have experienced this in County Wexford where I holiday.  One pub has a children's night and the children can join their parents for musical entertainment in a public lounge.  It is a very clean place, very well run and the children are well catered for.  Obviously that is a common practice.  I think Deputy McCartan mentioned this practice in relation to Europe but I do not think he has to go too far to see that entertainment for children, who are accompanied by their parents, works very well in lounges here.  The Minister's Bill deals specifically with that kind of situation.  It faces up to reality, as does Deputy Barrett's Bill, but there are a few minor points I should like to deal with.  It is very difficult to legislate for this area because it is so complex.  The Minister has consulted very widely and he has arrived at a very practical consensus.</P>
    <P>Another point of difference between the two Bills is that section 38 of the <Col N="1685" /> Minister's Bill allows apprentices over the age of 16 to be employed in licensed premises.  The Private Members' Bill would only allow apprentices over the age of 18 to be employed.  I am aware that the Government have had representations from the Licensed Vintners' Association in Dublin pointing out that up to 600 young apprentices could become unemployed if this section of the Bill is passed.  Many of these would be students between the ages of 16 and 18 who are working part time in public houses.  Sixteen is generally the age for apprenticeships and I believe the Minister's proposal is the preferred one in this instance.</P>
    <P>The Minister's Bill which was published last Monday is a major Bill and a significant part of it deals with under-age drinking.  It is similar to the Coalition Bill which never came to the floor of the House.  Unfortunately we need comprehensive legislation in the area of under-age drinking and also in relation to restaurant licensing, to permitted hours and drinking in clubs.  I sincerely thank Deputy Barrett for initiating this debate. It has been most enlightening and worthwhile but with no disrespect to Deputy Barrett, I look on his Bill as a forerunner to the Government Bill.  Now that he has seen the Minister's Bill I ask him to hold off and wait for what I hope will be the speedy introduction of the Intoxicating Liquor Bill, 1988.  We have waited 64 years for this legislation and I ask Deputy Barrett for another few weeks.  We are all anxious to have legislation placed on the Statute Book before the tourist season in relation to the other issues but, more importantly, I am anxious that the Government will introduce their Bill which deals with under-age drinking and ensure that, from a legislative point of view, we deal with this issue in a comprehensive manner.  I want to repeat that it will only be a framework within which we will work and in the last analysis it will come down to parents, communities and society to ensure that the problem of under-age drinking is tackled.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelBarrett" hpid="Mr. M. Barrett Mr. M. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity of making a contribution to this debate.  I should like to thank Deputy Seán Barrett for introducing this Bill into the House.  I know the Government will accept it in principle but because the Minister has published his own Bill perhaps Deputy Barrett will agree to incorporate his Bill in the Minister's Bill which, in general, is the same in principle. The Minister has proposals in his Bill which deal with under-age drinking.</P>
      <P>This Bill gives us an opportunity to express concern about the problem of under-age drinking.  The abuse of alcohol is a major problem in Ireland today.  This is especially true when 15, 16 and 17-year olds indulge in alcohol.  Facts are beginning to emerge which show that the problem is getting greater.  More and more young people are starting to drink heavily early in life.  On the law of averages, many of they will become heavy drinkers and so the chain of misery will be added to.  Innocent people whose only crime will be falling in love with drunkards will have their lives clouded with misery.  This need not be the way because if we get a grip on the problem we can support young people in their determination to be sober.  But that is not happening.  Figures from the Irish Council on Alcoholism show that the age at which young people start to drink has come down drastically in the last 20 years. In 1970 one in ten under the age of 17 were regular drinkers.  Now the figure is one in three.  Over half of them have been drunk several times and there are teenagers under the age of 17 years who have been drunk on several ocaasions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question is often asked where these young people get the money to purchase alcohol.  The answer that I get is that the money is given to them by parents who do not bother to question them as to what they require the money for.  It is also given to them by older brothers or sisters.  Many young people do summer jobs and have babysitting jobs for which they get money.  There are many other ways as well.  Then there is the question of where the young people get the alcohol.  It is available in off <Col N="1687" /> licences, supermarkets and public houses, and according to the present law any young person over the age of 15 years can purchase alcohol provided it is in a sealed or corked vessel.  There is a great need to change the law.</P>
    <P>The vast majority of public houses, off-licences and supermarkets will not supply alcohol to under-age people but there are others that do supply it.  There is a serious problem in the Dublin area where alcohol is supplied to young people.  In a recent court case an off-licence holder in the Phibsboro area applied for the renewal of his licence.  The Garda Síochána were aware that this off-licence holder was breaking the law by supplying alcohol to people of a very young age.  The Garda therefore opposed the granting of this licence.  The judge agreed not to renew the licence.  However the off-licence holder appealed against this decision of the courts and his appeal was granted and, according to the law, once an appeal is granted one is back in business until such time as the case is held in another court.  This is the situation here.  This man is back in business and that will be the case until there is another court hearing.</P>
    <P>I heard of another case in my own constituency where the local people were concerned that the local public house in the Finglas south area were supplying alcoholic drink to very young children, and the tenants' association, of their own accord, decided to take this publican to court and had the support of the Garda. The justice heard several witnesses including the Garda and, after consideration, he decided to grant the licence to the publican because there was not sufficient evidence to prove that these young children were getting the drink in that public house.  The type of evidence he wanted consisted of photographs of the children coming out of the pub with the drink.  I know that the tenants' association spent a considerable amount of money trying to ensure that this individual would not be granted a licence, but their efforts were fruitless.  As long <Col N="1688" /> as district justices adopt that type of attitude it will be very difficult for the Garda to operate.</P>
    <P>There is an obligation on parents to face the possibility that their 16 year old son or daughter drinks.  This is something that many parents will not accept.  The statistics are not fantasy.  It should not be assumed that the neighbour's child is the only culprit.  Everybody blames the schools for not doing more.  I do not because I think most schools spell out the facts, the dangers and the problems in relation to excessive drinking and alcoholism.  There is a great need to change the attitudes of people towards the use of alcohol here.  It seems that we cannot celebrate anything in this country without alcohol.  No matter what the function, whether it is a death, a marriage or a christening, we must have alcohol. There are people who honestly believe that these things could not go on without alcohol.</P>
    <P>There are many people going to England now.  I emigrated to England myself. In England an Irishman is mostly described as an Irish drunk.  Television comedians describe Irishmen as Irish drunks.  When I emigrated to England I was a casual drinker myself and having worked there for a few years I saw the way that many Irishmen and women brought down the good name of Irish people by the way they abused alcohol. I decided to join the pioneers and have worked in the pioneer association in England and here while time permitted me to do so.  Since I became a Member of this House I have not been able to give the same amount of attention to it, but I recognise the great work that the pioneer association has done in England and it is still operating very satisfactorily for many Irish people.  It is almost accepted in England as an Irish association.</P>
    <P>There are many people going to England now.  They go to public houses because they are lonely and hope to meet friends.  In fact many people here boast about the amount of alcohol they can consume.  In England the average Englishman has a different attitude altogether. He may go out to drink every <Col N="1689" /> night but he does not drink a pint but a glass of beer, and he only drinks a few and does not come home staggering drunk. In other European countries alcohol is taken mostly with meals.  This is not so here.</P>
    <P>The people that have been involved in the manufacture and the promotion of the sale of alcohol have embarked on a massive advertising campaign.  Many if not all the advertisements are misleading. I am not surprised that young people are impressed, particularly by the television advertisements.  The impression they give is that if one has a pint one is better looking, stronger, more effective and has more sexual appeal.  In addition local authorities provide prominent places for the advertising companies to put up those huge advertisements.  Those promoting the sale of alcohol are prepared to pay because advertising pays.</P>
    <P>Many young people drink because of pressures which they have not the maturity to resist.  Some suffer from lack of confidence to face social situations without a crutch.  Some have not the courage face disappointments without an anaesthetic.  The person who finds judgments and decisions difficult when sober can be completely irresponsible when under the influence of alcohol. Many go to the public house to find friends but friends met there will remain friends only while such persons have money in their pocket.  When the money goes, the friends disappear.  A real friend is one who is prepared to lose your friendship in order to help you.  Real friends are scarce and are not to be found in public houses.  The physical and psychological danger of alcohol to the growing person is great.</P>
    <P>The abuse of alcohol is our greatest social problem.  We have the highest rate of alcoholism in Europe.  At present, there are almost 200,000 alcoholics in this country and quite large numbers of these are women.  When I was a young man women would not be seen in a public house but today it is a regular feature. Young girls in their place of employment make arrangements to meet in the public house.  Many would describe the public <Col N="1690" /> house now as a social centre.  With young people, there is always the danger of taking a few extra drinks.</P>
    <P>While I speak about 200,000 alcoholics, I am also aware that there are many more.  Those I have mentioned are those who go to hospitals or institutions for treatment.  There are many thousands who do not even admit to alcoholism, so we must take their numbers into consideration. No human tragedy seems to squeeze the life out of those who love the victim as does alcoholism.  No other experience produces that distinctive haggard look, the worn look that so often marks the spouse and children of the drunkard.  If pain is something that works its way into the eyes and gets written into the face, then there must be much pain in those who live their live in the shadow of somebody who is too fond of drink. Money problems bring their own difficulties and so does a vigil spent watching somebody dying of cancer over a period of months.  These are great afflictions which leave their mark, but the excessive drinking habits of a partner or parent seem to bring a form of weariness and physical ageing that outdoes all other griefs put together.</P>
    <P>There is a great problem for the hotel owner and those working in public houses in being able to establish the correct age of a teenager.  For this reason, there is a great need to introduce identification cards.  I cannot understand why everybody is not obliged to carry one.  I have no doubt that the identification card would benefit the holder as much as it would benefit the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>Under-age drinking has caused serious problems here, especially in towns and cities.  Cider parties are a regular feature, particularly in the city of Dublin.  Young people who take part in such parties have caused millions of pounds worth of damage in the city of Dublin through crime and vandalism.  Many of the places damaged include churches and schools. Young people coming home from cider parties make attacks on the old.  Bus crews are a regular target and the way our law operates the gardaí are sometimes <Col N="1691" /> powerless.  Even though they can apprehend the culprit, there is not much satisfaction to be got out of that because all they can do is send for the parents. Sometimes the parents refuse to come to the station so the gardaí have to take the young persons home.  When they arrive there, rather than being thanked for bringing the culprit home the gardaí are abused.</P>
    <P>Parents should be made responsible for young people and made pay for the damage which teenagers cause.  Until the law is changed, the situation will not improve.  Many buildings the taxpayer has contributed to have been the subject of vandalism and because of that community buildings under construction at the moment either have no windows or small windows to prevent the vandals from entering.  There is a great need to update the legislation on under-age drinking and, in general, on the sale of drink.  The Minister has circulated a Bill which deals with this problem and I have no doubt that it will be discussed during this session.</P>
    <P>I hope the proposals in this Bill will improve the situation, although I am not happy with some aspects of the Bill. There is no need to extend the hours of drinking.  Doing that is like sending for an oil tanker when there is a fire, rather than for the fire brigade.  The present hours of drinking should be sufficient and &ldquo;time&rdquo; should be &ldquo;time&rdquo;.  In Britain, when time is up the publican puts the towel on the pumps and nobody will be served after that.  We talk about the extension of drinking hours as being done to help the tourism industry.  Many tourists come to England and the pubs there close at 10.30 p.m.  They close at 2 p.m. in the afternoon and do not open until 5 p.m. or 6 p.m. in the evening.  On Sunday the pub will open from 12 noon to 2 o'clock and from 7 o'clock until 10 o'clock in the evening.  Why we want to extend opening hours to midnight I do not know. When the Bill comes before the House we will express our views on that.</P>
    <P>In relation to licences, I know that <Col N="1692" /> tourists might like to have the opportunity to have a drink with their meal but the Vintners' Association and I are concerned because the publican will be at a disadvantage.  The publican will be obliged to close at midnight while the restaurant can remain open until an early hour in the morning.  I am not worried about the tourism aspect because of the difference in the price of a drink here and in Great Britain or the North of Ireland. If a pint costs about 82p in Britain or in the North, a tourist here would have to add a pound to it.</P>
    <P>Parents have a grave obligation in relation to their children.  They should make sure they know where their teenagers are and on what they are spending their money.  I am glad to have had an opportunity to debate this serious problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to stitch into the record my wholehearted support for this measure.  During the past number of years since under-age drinking became a problem we have heard pious platitudes, a lot of well intentioned pleas and promises of positive action in relation to corrective action in the area of under-age drinking.  This is the first positive measure to redress this problem.  I commend Deputy Barrett for his determination and for his foresight in this area and for giving tangible proof that we have a terrible social problem.  Deputy Barrett has taken section 6 of a Bill which was put on the stocks by the previous Government but which they did not get an opportunity to introduce and put it into the form of a Bill and presented it to this House.  This Bill appeals to me because it is a narrow confined measure.  It narrows the focus to addressing the great social scourge we face, our greatest danger to the fabric of society, that is, under-age drinking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I commend the Government for coming hot on Deputy Barrett's heels with another measure, and while I would normally welcome a comprehensive measure in relation to intoxicating liquor, if a Bill is too diverse the emphasis is dissipated and the impact in relation to the key areas is very often lost and, when <Col N="1693" /> it comes to implementation, the provisions in relation to key areas are underimplemented or ignored.  We all agree that the problem is horrendous.  The stark realities of the statistics have brought this home in no uncertain fashion.</P>
    <P>Over the years there has been a slippage in standards.  In past years temperance was looked on as a virtue.  As a matter of course people were enrolled in the Pioneer Total Abstinence Association and it was a foregone conclusion that nobody dared to take a drink before the age of 18 or 21.  It was a foregone conclusion also that nobody entered ballrooms under the influence of drink.  A person who arrived at a ballroom smelling of alcohol, even without the appearance of having taken alcohol, would find it hard to get by the proprietors and, if they got past the cordon, they were shunned by the people inside.  There is now such a slippage in standards that recently a survey taken in Galway city indicated that 60 per cent of children had sampled alcohol by the time they reached the age of 12.</P>
    <P>I welcome this measure because it has prompted the Government to take action.  I have no doubt that, at the end of the day, some positive corrective measure will emerge.  While I would not advocate draconian measures my only regret is that the penalties are too lenient. I welcome this measure because of its narrow focus, because it is doing something and because it is goading the Government into doing something about the problem.</P>
    <P>Irrespective of what legislation is brought before this House I fully subscribe to the view of Deputy Barrett that the parents have the ultimate responsibility. We cannot expect the schools, the legislators, the gardaí or the publicans to act in <i>loco parentis</i> for our children.  They are our children and we have an obligation to know where they are, how they are behaving and in what state of intoxication or sobriety they return to their home at night.</P>
    <P>The major problem is that much of the slippage in standards goes back to laxity of parental control at all levels.  Parents <Col N="1694" /> are very often the sinners in relation to alcohol abuse.  There is a greater permissiveness and a greater tolerance of alcohol abuse.  All of those things contribute to forming the sad picture of life today in this country.  The social consequences are that children mitch from school or they arrive in school unable to take part in normal school functions.  In some cases children are sent home from school or are unable to sit for examinations. Levels of academic achievement have been badly impaired because children have been exposed to alcohol or because parents have been too lax in exercising vigilance in relation to their children's activities.  We have seen the horrendous consequences in terms of vandalism also which, sadly, is part and parcel of life here today.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to a group from my own county who have been one of the main instigators in putting the spotlight on the problem.  They are the Mayo identity card scheme group who were launched under the aegis of the vocational education committee.  They have operated a very successful scheme with the co-operation of responsible publicans.  I fully subscribe to the view stated in this House, on radio and on television by Deputy Barrett that we should push for the introduction of a national scheme of identification cards throughout the country.  I do not see anything wrong with that.  In fact I think it is very commendable and it will be a very valuable aid in the successful introduction of any legislative procedures in relation to alcohol.</P>
    <P>As I have said, we have seen over the years, unfortunately, a slippage in standards and that is why I welcome the deletion of the word &ldquo;knowingly&rdquo; and the placing of a responsibility on the publican to find out whether a person seeking a drink is over 18 years of age.  In the past the publican took pride in his trade and in knowing who his customers were but, unfortunately, of late we have seen a more mercenary type of publican &mdash; the Johnny-come-lately &mdash; who is not too worried about standards and who does not give a damn unless it is going to affect the cash register ticking up considerable <Col N="1695" /> receipts at the end of the day.  They have to accept an equal share of responsibility for this sad state of affairs which has necessitated the introduction of this legislation.</P>
    <P>Apart from the Government measure being too comprehensive, my only regret is that it will delay once more the introduction of legislation.  The more we delay, the worse the problem will become.  In conclusion, let me say that whichever measure sees the light of day I hope it will be rigidly implemented and that there will be a massive publicity campaign to make parents and everybody involved in the intoxicating liquor business fully aware of its implications.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I intend to be brief.  There seems to be a general acceptance that drink is a major social evil in this country, that the abuse of alcohol has long since reached epidemic proportions and that there is a necessity for us to review our attitudes towards alcohol and its consumption. The Minister in response to Deputy Barrett's introduction of the Bill welcomed it and what it was trying to achieve.  I have no quibble with the Bill but I wonder, as we have two pieces of legislation reaching the Chamber at the same time, one narrow and one broad, whether we are using our time in the best way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take issue with Deputy Higgins when he says that the Government proposals are too broad and that Deputy Barrett's measure acted as a catalyst to produce the Government's proposals.  No catalyst was needed, as the political will to bring forward proposals already existed and it is a bit disingenuous and inaccurate for Deputy Higgins to suggest otherwise.  I also take issue with Deputy Higgins when he says that the Government proposals which have been circulated are too comprehensive. It strikes me as extraordinary that a Deputy would put abroad such a view because the reality is that the sale and consumption of alcohol and the place it holds in the Irish psyche is a complex <Col N="1696" /> issue which has to be handled in broad legislation.</P>
    <P>In congratulating Deputy Barrett for bringing forward his proposals I would suggest to him that he hold them back and incorporate them into the proposals being put forward by the Minister.  I think that would make sense and that we do not dignify politics by seeking spurious arguments between ourselves in this House.  There are no differences between us on this issue.  It is a question of emphasis rather than content and as Deputy Barrett, Deputy Higgins and all those on the benches opposite know, the will to introduce the changes exists.  I would also point out to Deputy Higgins that his party only relatively recently vacated the Government benches and that as he himself said legislative change in this area is long overdue.  I am sure while his party were in Government that he was champing at the bit in an effort to get this legislative change introduced but evidently he was unsuccessful and that the champing on this side of the House has been more successful.</P>
    <P>Deputy Higgins and others who have spoken tonight dealt with the nub of the issue which is the part alcohol plays in Irish social life.  I think that the abuse of alcohol poses a far greater danger to the fabric of society than many of the relatively minor problems which seem from time to time to attract the headlines.  It is true that we have a problem with drugs but thankfully it is a relatively minor one.  Sadly, it is increasing but I hope we can address ourselves to that problem.  It is also true we have a problem with AIDS but thankfully that too is a relatively minor one and it should not get the degree of attention it is getting. What is without contest is that we do have a major problem with alcohol and that certainly does need controlling and more attention than it is getting.  In that respect having two Bills before the House at present is welcome in that it will allow many Deputies to ventilate their views on this problem.  I hope they will carry those views out of this Chamber and that, when engaging in social activities <Col N="1697" /> in their constituencies, will put into practice what they would preach here.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, the abuse of alcohol starts at a very early age.  We seem to suffer from an extraordinary lack of confidence &mdash; Deputy Higgins touched on this &mdash; in that young men and in more recent times young women feel that they cannot go into a disco, ballroom or party unless they have fortified themselves with the spirit, and this is tragic.  I wonder whether this points to a wider problem which is that we do not seem to be able to address this evil or ill.  We have not been able to inculcate into successive generations a sense of self-esteem, selfworth and self-confidence to the degree where they would be able to reject the concept of the hard man or nowadays the hard woman.  We need to educate our children to see through the myth of alcohol and we need to address this issue outside of narrow legislation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barrett, Deputy Higgins and several others referred to the need for parental control but the hard fact is that one cannot legislate for standards.  Standards are either there or they are not and as other Deputies have said it is true that there has been an extraordinary slippage in standards in society.  I have four young children and when travelling around my constituency I am always amazed when I see young people who are clearly under age being served drink in pubs and off-licences. While there is the culpability of the young people themselves, two other groups of people are also culpable &mdash; their parents and those who serve them alcohol.</P>
    <P>One of the most important things that is happening in regard to this issue is that we are removing the word &ldquo;knowingly&rdquo; which has operated as a very narrow cloth behind which people have hidden.  As I have said, it is impossible to legislate for standards.  Who scores and who is first to the post in parliamentary terms is not of consequence.  What is of consequence is how we, as political leaders, inculcate some sense of direction into society.  In this regard perhaps we cannot legislate <Col N="1698" /> for parental standards but we can certainly decry the slippage in parental standards that lies behind this problem.</P>
    <P>The question of control on the sale of liquor has been dealt with and I do not wish to deal with it in any extensive way but it strikes me that in addition to parental control, to a slippage of parental control, there has been a remarkable slippage of standards in the trade.  There is no doubt about that and there is no point in our trying to disguise that fact.  Unfortunately, there are people who are the owners of off-licences and people who run supermarkets where alcoholic drink is sold who do not give a damn for the consequences of their actions and we need to address that.  I believe that in the more comprehensive measures that the Minister has introduced, that matter among other issues, is addressed.  We need to look at the issue of off-licence sales.  Some of the Deputies, particularly from Dublin and the urban areas, who have spoken on this Bill have dealt with the tragedy of off-licence sales.  I am sure you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, as a man who knows your constituency well, are fully familiar with this.</P>
    <P>It is extraordinary that very young people can be served in off-licences.  This Bill does not deal with that matter and that is why I favour the more comprehensive approach of the Minister.  It is extraordinary that traders can operate with relative impunity.  They can cock a snook at society and get away with it.  It is extraordinary that we do not seem to have any way of adequately policing the legislation.  The proposal from the Minister that the Garda be empowered to take from young people alcoholic beverages and impound them is a very welcome change.  When the Minister's proposals come before us I will be suggesting that we take that a step further.  I would like to see some form of indelible marking on every beverage container in an off-licence. It would not necessarily be costly to do that.  If we then found a pattern emerging in any particular area we could trace the problem to a particular off-licence.</P>
    <P>As I have said at the outset, alcohol is <Col N="1699" /> costly in society, not just in terms of cost to those who buy it or, as one Deputy said, to families who are broken by it but to us all.  It undermines the Irish potential.  It is the opiate of the Irish people.  It is necessary that we adopt a more mature attitude towards drink and educate our young people to have a more mature attitude towards it.  If I seem critical of Deputy Barrett's proposals, that is certainly not my intention.  I congratulate the Deputy on introducing these proposals. They are valuable proposals but I urge him to accept that they will be covered in the Bill which is to be circulated by the Minister.  It would seem to be more sensible if we all got together in this House and in the other House to ensure a speedy passage of that Bill.  In so far as there may be lacunae in that Bill we should all ensure that they are closed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>When I saw the text of the Minister's Bill I intended to write to him about it.  Anyone who has any experience of the way in which the criminal law is operated in relation to publicans will be aware that district justices are conscious of the fact that a licence and the business which is based on a licence is a very costly thing to invest in. The sanction of mandatory disqualification or elimination of a licence is so terrible a punishment that, it is fair to say, the Judiciary flee from resorting to that remedy.  They use every possible means to avoid taking away a publican's licence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to say to the Minister that what would be an effective system and would be enforced by the courts is a system whereby district justices would be entitled, for a matter of a week, two weeks, a month or three months, depending on the severity and the gravity of the offence, to tell a publican to close his premises.  If a big pub in Dublin is told to close down for a week for serving a young person, its management would certainly make sure that the offence never took place again.  That is a sanction that is workable and it is one that the Judiciary would use.  It would have a dramatic <Col N="1700" /> effect in securing compliance with the hours laws, the under-age drinking laws and every other form of law.  The penalties provisions in the Minister's legislation seem to be slightly inadequate.  If you really want an effective law which the Judiciary will enforce you should bring in the power to temporarily suspend publicans' licences.  That would achieve a dramatic revolution in enforcement of the law.</P>

      <P>I wish to make one very short comment in reply to Deputy McDowell.  It is the intention of the Government, if the House agrees, to have the Intoxicating Liquor Bill, which I circulated last Monday, before the House for Second Reading next Tuesday.  I wish to say for the benefit of all parties in the House that I would not want anybody to think that I have a monopoly on what is best in this area.  I would welcome for full discussion, without any time restrictions, proposals from any side of the House that will help us all to deal with this problem which we recognise and thanks to Deputy Barrett for facilitating us up to now.  If we work together on this matter we can have good legislation on our Statute Book very quickly which is what we all want.</P>

      <P>I will begin by thanking all those who contributed to the debate. I covered many of the points that were made when I initially presented the Bill. A very positive approach was adopted by all the speakers.  It is generally recognised that legislation is only part of what can be done in this whole area.  That is the role we have and we cannot ignore it. Unfortunately, it has been ignored for 64 years and as a result we are facing many problems today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One problem in particular is in relation to the sale of drink from off-licences.  As the Deputies on this side of the House <Col N="1701" /> are well aware the facilities we, as Opposition Deputies, have for research, consist of oneself and one's constituency secretary doing all the probing.  When I was doing some research in this area I was fascinated to discover that when legislation was passed in 1924 it permitted the sale of alcohol from off-licences to anybody over 15 years of age, provided it was sold in a corked and sealed container and that that container was capable of holding in excess of one pint.  I think that is where we got this flood of sales of flagons of cider from off-licences. Anyone who has examined the statistics will see that cider is probably the second or third in line in relation to the consumption of alcohol by young people. Beer is consumed more than cider and spirits is not too far behind.  I am talking about 12 and 13 year olds in case anybody thinks I am being a spoil sport in talking about semi-grown people of 17 or 18 years of age.</P>
    <P>A positive approach was adopted throughout this debate.  I said at the outset and I still hold the view &mdash; I recognise that by agreement the Whips hold the view &mdash; that perhaps the best way of dealing with this matter is not to pursue this Bill through a special committee of the House but to deal with the matter by way of the legislation published recently by the Minister.  It is quite obvious from the debate that has taken place that the one positive thing we achieved is that we narrowed the discussion on this whole area to concentrate on the problem of under-age drinking.  If we had more wide-ranging legislation dealing with the opening and closing hours of pubs and the issue of special restaurant licences as well as under age drinking, we would not have highlighted the problem of under-age drinking over the past few weeks.  It was of tremendous benefit to have separate legislation dealing with this problem.</P>
    <P>I am still of the opinion &mdash; and I do not say this in a narrow political sense &mdash; that it would have been wiser if the Minister when publishing his legislation had recognised that there was already a Bill before the House dealing with the problem of under-age drinking and his Bill could <Col N="1702" /> have concentrated on opening and closing hours and the issue of special licences for restaurants.  I say that in all sincerity because for far too long when introducing legislation we have tried to cover too many areas.  In other countries when they introduce legislation covering many areas, it is common to break it up into separate Bills and deal with each Bill separately.  The benefit of doing that is that it focuses attention on a particular problem and continuously reminds us of the need to review and update that legislation, as we should be doing.</P>
    <P>I said before and I say it again, any Minister for Justice, whether from my party or from the party across the floor, has a very difficult job dealing with security, prisons, the Garda Síochána and the Northern Ireland problem as well as law reform.  The Department is far too big for any one individual to deal with such a wide area.  The problem is that there are various pieces of out-of-date legislation which it is impossible to update if it is left to one Minister.</P>
    <P>That brings me to another point.  When I was Government Whip and Whip of my party I tried strenuously to get my party to accept the view that when in Government the onus is not always on the Government of the day to produce legislation. It is an accepted principle that parties in Opposition, or individual Deputies if they wish, should feel free to produce legislation.  Because a party in Opposition or an individual Deputy produces legislation that does not take from the Government of the day.  The Government should not feel they have to produce a Bill because the Opposition did.  We have to change that attitude.</P>
    <P>If we are asking for changes in legislation to be implemented we have to change our attitude in this House.  We still have the idea that it is up to the Government to produce legislation.  So far the Fine Gael Party in Opposition have produced five Private Members' Bills and I hope we produce many more.  If the Government do not like them they should vote against them, but if they like them they should let them pass and make changes on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1703" /> The legislation produced by the Minister is practically word for word the same as that produced by the Coalition Government on 17 December 1986.  For that reason I must ask why it has taken 12 months to produce the Government Bill.  Admittedly there are a few minor changes but by and large it is the same as our Bill.  As regards the part of the Ministers Bill dealing with under-age drinking, it is practically word for word the same as my Bill before the House tonight, but with two minor amendments. The first is allowing for apprentices over the age of 16 years to be on licensed premises.  I would have been prepared to accept an amendment to that effect on Committee Stage because I accept that we should have made such a provision.</P>
    <P>The second minor change is that it permits children to be on licensed premises, accompanied by their parents or guardians, at any time.  I do not have any particular hang-up about that.  However, in my view, it is not appropriate to see young children being left abandoned in public houses while some irresponsible parents are drinking.  I say that deliberately because there are a very large number of responsible parents who bring in their families when they are having one or two drinks, particularly when they are on holidays.  Once something is put into legislation it applies to everybody.  We cannot legislate for some people and ignore others.  Once we have this provision in the Bill we are making it legal for the irresponsible parent to abandon his children in the public house while he is drinking.  In my view that is not good for society, nor is it an example to give young children in their tender years, ten, 12 or 14 or younger.  I warn against that, but that too can be discussed on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>As I said, with the exception of those two changes there is no difference between my Bill and that produced by the Government and I fail to see why the Government decided to follow me and produce similar legislation.  My only concern is to see legislation dealing with this <Col N="1704" /> matter on the Statute Book and whether it be in the name of the Government of the day, in my name or that of any other Deputy, I am not particularly concerned. I have taken a great deal of pleasure in promoting this legislation.  I have taken a great deal of pleasure on behalf of my party in having the opportunity of highlighting the problem and having a wide-ranging discussion on the problem.  I am delighted we were able to do so on a rational basis across party lines.  This augurs well for the future.</P>
    <P>I do not have time to go through some of the points made in the debate but the point which was mentioned most dealt with the issue of identity cards.  It is very peculiar that the same coverage was given to this problem by the media when there is nothing about identity cards in the legislation, yet we spent most of our time discussing that issue.  However, it was a worthwhile discussion and I hope the Government will take note of it.  Despite what has been written and said, in many cases in an irrational way, by some people about the issue of identity cards, it is not the view which is widely held by the majority of the elected representatives in this House.  The Progressive Democrats, The Workers' Party, members of Fianna Fáil and members of Fine Gael have come out openly and said identity cards are a good idea.  Maybe we could argue about the detail or the precautions that would have to be taken if such a system were introduced, but it is clear to me from the letters which appeared in our newspapers over the past few weeks following the interview I gave about this issue that I am winning.  About 70 per cent of the letters were in favour and 30 per cent against the issue of identity cards.</P>
    <P>It pays not to be afraid to open a discussion or to make your point, even though you think the majority may be against you.  It is interesting to note that if one makes a suggestion to deal with abuses of the social welfare system there is uproar from some of those who complain bitterly about those abuses.  We had better make up our minds whether we want to head into the 21st century with <Col N="1705" /> modern technology assisting us or whether we want to live with our heads in the sand afraid to face up to issues. People of my age group, and older, can learn from the positive attitude of young people who see nothing wrong in having to have identity cards or in having to carry some form of identification.  In fact, they could save themselves some embarrassment by carrying identification.  It is interesting to note that the issue that was touched on by most speakers in the debate was not related to the legislation, but we can learn from that.</P>
    <P>While Deputy Roche was endeavouring in his contribution to be constructive I got the distinct impression that he did not devote a lot of time to reading the provisions of my Bill.  He said I had not covered certain issues which I had dealt with when moving the Second Stage debate, such as off-licences.  It is my view that by moving this legislation I have stirred the Government into action.  I criticise the Minister for waiting 12 months to introduce his Bill and I am glad we had a short debate on under-age drinking.  I do not want to hinder the passage of any legislation or to adopt a selfish approach in regard to any Bills and for those reasons I will not be putting this matter to a division.  However, I should like to warn the Government that we will be pressing to have their legislation put through the House in the near future.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I should like to thank the Chair for facilitating me this evening and I am glad the Minister of State at the Department of Health is here to reply to the points I will raise.  On Good Friday a man was brought by motor car to Limerick Regional Hospital entering the casualty unit at approximately 2.40 p.m.  He had a letter from his doctor which admitted him.  After about two hours waiting in casualty his companion who had driven him to the hospital became restless and worried about his condition.  A number of people in casualty had approached him and expressed the view that the man looked extremely ill.  The driver of the car approached a doctor and a nurse and after a wait of about two more hours he was examined and the driver helped the man to re-dress. Four hours had elapsed from the time the man had entered the hospital.  Another wait of approximately two hours ensued and at about 9 p.m. a member of the medical staff came back to him in casualty and the man was admitted to the hospital at about 9.30 p.m.  He died on the following Thursday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The issue was raised with the Mid-Western Health Board by a former Member of the House, Willie O'Brien, and local papers gave publicity to the incident.  When the issue was raised with the Mid-Western Health Board, the deputy CEO of the board, Mr. Robinson, confirmed that the man had spent six hours waiting in casualty.  He also said that the casualty unit was exceptionally busy on Good Friday.  Extra staff had been allocated after the closure of Barringtons Hospital on the previous day. Two nurses and a doctor, according to the deputy CEO, half of the staff on duty, were involved in resuscitating a drug overdose victim for almost six hours.  This patient, according to the Mid-Western Health Board, could not be moved from casualty.  The deputy CEO also said that 65 persons were treated in the casualty unit on Good Friday, 28 of them had <Col N="1707" /> X-rays and 16 of them had diagnostic tests of one sort or another.</P>
    <P>The publicity surrounding the revelation of these events has brought to light another case.  On the same day a 79 year old man attended at casualty and was refused admission to the hospital. This decision was reached after a long delay.  The man's family claim that the delay was approximately four and a half hours while the Mid-Western Health Board say that the delay was three hours. That man was taken home on Good Friday having been between three and four hours at the hospital but on the following Monday he was admitted to the hospital in a state of collapse.  He died on the following Wednesday.  His general practitioner stated that in his opinion he was in need of hospitalisation on Good Friday.  The Mid-Western Health Board deny this.</P>
    <P>Barringtons Hospital was closed by the Minister for Health, Deputy O'Hanlon, on Holy Thursday.  I do not intend to redebate the Barringtons Hospital issue but despite a decision of this House the Minister, and the Government of which he is a member, closed the hospital.  It was pointed out in the House that it would not be possible to make alternative arrangements for the very large numbers who were treated at the casualty unit of Barringtons Hospital.  The closure of that hospital has had a devastating affect on the casualty services provided in Limerick City in particular and in the mid-west region.</P>
    <P>At present the regional hospital cannot cope with the volume of patients attending its casualty unit.  This is not the fault of the over-worked staff; it is the Minister's fault.  The Minister failed to take the advice of the House and he ignored a majority vote of the House.  He has also failed to fulfil commitments he made to the House in the course of the debate on Barringtons Hospital.  I should like to quote from that debate, as reported at column 2360 of the Official Report of 16 February.  The Minister said:</P>
    <P>The closure of Barringtons as a <Col N="1708" /> public hospital does mean that certain facilities at St. John's and the Regional Hospital in Limerick will have to be strengthened.  This applies in a particular way to the accident and emergency departments at these two hospitals.  I have already announced that I am making available a capital grant of £400,000 for this purpose &mdash; £150,000 at St. John's Hospital and £250,000 at the Regional Hospital.</P>
    <P>These amounts are sufficient not only to provide a first-class casualty unit at each hospital but also excellent day hospital facilities in both hospitals which is in keeping with the best practices in modern day hospital management.</P>
    <P>The two incidents I have outlined and many others I could go into which did not end as tragically will show clearly that the Minister for Health not only ignored a majority decision of this House but failed to fulfil the solemn commitments he gave this House in the course of that debate.</P>
    <P>In the course of that debate on 16 February 1988 the Minister for Health, talking in the context of the number of people being treated in the three hospitals in Limerick, in out-patients and in casualty, contrasted them with the fewer numbers being treated in Galway, saying, and I quote from column 2362 of the Official Report as follows:</P>
    <P>These figures deserve some explanation and I will be having immediate discussions with the Mid-Western Health Board as to how the Limerick figures can be reduced.  It would seem that many of those who go direct to the casualty units in Limerick do so for rather trivial reasons and should have been more properly treated by their general practitioner.</P>
    <P>Has the Minister had those immediate discussions with the Mid-Western Health Board?  Have the Mid-Western Health Board been putting pressure on the staff in the casualty units in the Regional Hospital in Limerick and in St. John's Hospital not to admit anybody they think might constitute a trivial case?  Under the instructions of the Minister for Health <Col N="1709" /> and of the health board, are not the staff fearful that they will be held responsible for the admission of trivial cases with the direct consequence of incidents such as those I have outlined here this evening?</P>
    <P>It is not acceptable that such things should happen.  I know there are problems encountered in many institutions, that no system is infallible, but when two serious mistakes occur in the one day the Minister for Health who took the decisions must bear heavy responsibility.</P>
    <P>I am demanding an inquiry by the Minister for Health into those two incidents. I want an inquiry initiated and a report to this House by the Minister on the adequacy of casualty services in Limerick now that he has, in his stubborn fashion, closed the hospital which was providing casualty services for the majority of those requiring them.  I want those results brought into this House so that they can be debated.</P>
    <P>The Mid-Western Health Board have been an efficient health board.  The staffs in their hospitals are above reproach but now the Mid-Western Health Board is under the auspices of a new chief executive officer.  I understand that person has a very good record, is a very effective, efficient public servant but he is also the chief executive officer of the Midland Health Board.  It is not appropriate that a person who is already responsible for one health board area should be assigned to another in a temporary, part time capacity.  That is not satisfactory.  I demand of the Minister for Health and his Department that they make an immediate permanent appointment to the position of chief executive officer in the Mid-Western Health Board.</P>
    <P>It gives me no pleasure to come into the House this evening and raise these issues.  I am not by nature an alarmist; I do not become involved in the politics of propoganda or of the latest tragedy, but these incidents are of serious concern.  I urge the Minister of State present not to give me a glib answer, pretending that eveything is right, because everything is not right.  I would like action this evening and if such is not forthcoming I shall pursue the matter further.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>We have now received a preliminary report from the health board. That report indicates that while the number of attendances at the Casualty Department at Limerick Regional Hospital was not exceptionally high on that day the medical staff did have to spend several hours treating an extremely serious emergency case.  That patient required constant attention from approximately 1 p.m. until after 6 p.m.  I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that such a life and death situation will always receive priority treatment in a casualty unit.  Unfortunately in such circumstances other cases, which may be serious but not of such immediate urgency, will have to put up with a certain amount of delay.</P>
      <P>The patient referred to by the Deputy arrived at the casualty department at approximately 2.40 p.m. but following initial registration was not seen by the doctor on duty until after 4.30 p.m. mainly because of the other emergency case.  After examination a number of tests were ordered, the patient was then seen by two doctors from the surgical team on duty that day.  It was decided that he should be admitted as an in-patient after an X-ray had been taken.  Finally he was admitted to a ward at 9 p.m.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1711" /> I accept that even allowing for pressure in the Accident and Emergency Department and the X-ray Unit on that day the waiting period experienced by that patient was unduly long.  I might add that the improved staffing arrangements for the casualty department, already announced, are now in operation.  Furthermore, the health board have asked the hospital administration and the matron, together with the medical registrar in the casualty department, to review existing procedures in order to ensure that patients who are definitely going to be admitted to hospital are not kept waiting an undue length of time before admission.  At present the health board are preparing a comprehensive report on this incident which I understand will reach my Department by Friday next.  When the Minister, Deputy O'Hanlon, examines this report we will communicate further with Deputy Noonan in regard to this incident.</P>
    <P>I am fully confident that the arrangements now being made for improvements to the casualty unit at Limerick Regional and St. John's Hospital will ensure that a satisfactory level of emergency services are available to the people of Limerick.  I am also sure that Deputy <Col N="1712" /> Noonan is aware of the condition of the individual involved but I will not disclose confidential information regarding a patient.</P>
    <P>We have no details in relation to the second case.  The person was refused admission on Good Friday but he was subsequently admitted.  I will, of course, ask for a report on the case and I will communicate with the Deputy in due course.</P>
    <P>I cannot accept that the casualty department in Limerick Regional Hospital is failing to cope with the workload. Both cases to which the Deputy referred occurred on 1 April and the undertaking given to the House in relation to St. John's and the Regional Hospital have been fulfilled.  Contrary to what the Deputy implied, no pressure has been put on the staff to depart from the normal medical guidelines in relation to the diagnostic treatment of patients.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the Deputy's concern in relation to this case but he will realise that there was an emergency case being treated on that day.  I hope there will not be a recurrence of the situation in this or any other hospital.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 8.55 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 21 April 1988.</P>

      <P>Consultations with bodies responsible for genealogy and tourism have been held over the past few months by the Department of the Taoiseach.  Following these discussions, a task force on genealogical services is being established to consider future action in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, the International Fund for Ireland are funding a consultancy, in <Col N="1574" /> association with Bord Fáilte and the Northern Irish Tourist Board, on certain proposals which the fund has received for assistance to develop genealogical services for tourists on an All-Ireland basis. The result of this assessment should be available in two to three months and will have wider application to our genealogical services generally.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, steps are being taken to provide a satisfactory service to the public at the main national centres which hold sources of genealogical information. These include the Office of the Registrar General, the Public Record Office, the National Library and the Genealogical Office.  In that context, the refurbishment of the reading room in the Public Record Office in the Four Courts has now been completed and the Heraldic Museum in Kildare Street will be open later this year.</P>

      <P>I have no proposal from any airline for the inauguration of scheduled air services between Ireland and Australia at the present time.  As I informed the House last December in reply to a previous question, I am very keen to develop tourism traffic from Australia to Ireland and in this regard I announced a major new fares initiative to boost tourism traffic from that country.  Under this new arrangement, Australian visitors to London are able to travel on to Dublin at no extra cost.  All the indications are that this initiative will result in a substantial increase in Australian visitors to Ireland this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards services from Canada, I <Col N="1575" /> should inform the Deputy that negotiations on a new bilateral air services agreement between Ireland and Canada have taken place in Dublin.  These discussions, which will be resumed shortly, are intended to facilitate the restoration of direct links between Ireland and Canada.</P>
    <P>I am happy to inform the Deputy, however, that notwithstanding the absence of direct scheduled links between Ireland and Canada a substantial increase is expected in the level of charter traffic from Canada to Ireland this summer.</P>

      <P>I am anxious to ensure that shopping facilities for visitors to the national cultural institutions are further developed and improved.  In addition to providing sources of revenue for the individual institutions, the production of replicas and publications based on the national collections is a means of further enhancing and publicising our cultural heritage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Major efforts have been and are being made to improve the shopping facilities in the National Museum of Ireland by the introduction in 1987 of a wider range of sales items, including publications.  In addition, the National Museum has recently produced replicas of items from its own collections and is considering a number of similar projects at present with a view to increasing the range available in 1988.  It is also the intention to upgrade the shoppinig facilities in the museum during this year by fitting out a purpose built shopping area.  The precise location <Col N="1576" /> and layout is under detailed consideration by the museum, the Department of the Taoiseach and the Office of Public Works at present.</P>
    <P>As regards the National Library, the Heraldic Museum at present being developed in 2-3 Kildare Street will be opened to the public in 1988.  The question of the provision of shopping facilities will be considered in the light of the experience of visitor numbers etc. during the year.</P>
    <P>Finally, in the case of other cultural institutions which are administered by boards of management, for example, the National Gallery, Royal Hospital, Kilmainham and Chester Beatty Library, every encouragement is being given to promote the development and expansion of the shopping facilities in these institutions.</P>

      <P>The carriage of smoke hoods is not mandatory on Irish registered aircraft.  A suitable smoke hood has not as yet been developed.  However, States which are to the forefront in aeronautical design and manufacturing activity have been engaged on research in this area and my Department are keeping in touch with developments.  I might mention that measures have been taken to minimise the hazard of smoke in aircraft cabins by, for example, requiring the use of fire blocking material in passenger seats and the marking of emergency escape paths.</P>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that developments on all aspects of passenger safety are monitored continuously by my Department with a view to ensuring the safety of passengers flying on Irish registered aircraft.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Registrar of Titles that all applications for registration are processed on a regional basis in the Land Registry.  Consequently there is no specific section dealing exclusively with the registration of Land Commission vesting orders.  There are at present 10,722 applications for registration of Land Commission vesting orders awaiting completion.  These applications are normally not as urgent as other applications because registration of title takes effect retrospectively from the date of vesting and in general are dealt with at present only as the need arises.  I am informed, however, that as a matter of policy the Land Registry give priority to any application in respect of which it is brought to their attention that exceptional conditions involving hardship, such as bridging finance, exist.</P>
      <P>It would not be possible to ascertain the average time taken to deal with such cases without an examination of a substantial volume of records.  This could be achieved only by diverting staff now engaged on more urgent casework.</P>

Specific requirements as to the spending of the £300,000 were not imposed on the company.</P>

      <P>It is not the practice for the terms of such leases to be disclosed by the Office of Public Works.  To ensure fairness both to the State and to the developers, the rental income of the State will be related to the rental income of the developer.  The rental to be paid by the developer must take account of the very significant cost involved in the marina, including operating, maintenance and financing costs and the commercial risks involved.  The project has been examined in detail and the rental income will be set to maximise the return to the State while ensuring that the project can proceed on a commercial basis.</P>

      <P>The proposed marina at Dún Laoghaire <Col N="1588" /> harbour did not go to public tender, because it is not being undertaken or funded by the State.  While it has been public knowledge for some time that the Government are anxious to see development of a commerical public marina at Dún Laoghaire, the proposal from Marina Developments (Ireland) Limited is the only comprehensive proposal which, has been submitted which will meet the Government's objectives in Dún Laoghaire.</P>

      <P>The area of the marina at Dún Laoghaire will be leased by a private developer, Marina Development (Ireland) Limited, from the State, which will retain ownership of the area.  The marine furniture will be owned by the developer.</P>
      <P>This undertaking is a private development and will be run by the developers. It will be a matter for Dún Laoghaire Borough Corporation to offer advice as it sees fit, in the same way as it may currently advise the Office of Public Works on other aspects of harbour management. There will be conditions in the lease to safeguard the harbour, and the State's involvement, notably in the areas of the usage of the marina, the availability of berths for members of the public and visiting yachtsmen, the protection of the environment, the repair and maintenance of the marina structure, and access to the harbour land and sea areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A technical liaison committee, comprised of officials of the Department of the Marine and of the Office of Public Works and the developers will review and report to me on the designs and construction of the marina and will monitor the effects of the marina development <Col N="1589" /> on the harbour.

Officials of my Department have had meetings with the manager of Dún Laoghaire Borough Corporation and with other local interests such as yachting and sail training enthuasiasts.

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that, given the autonomous nature of the universities, it is primarily a matter for these institutions to determine the content of the courses which they offer to students who are pursuing third level studies. However, it is understood from the Higher Education Authority that while there are no formalised courses available aimed at combating sexism and sex stereotyping, nevertheless, the topic is included in the Higher Diploma in Education courses under various subject areas and there are many references to and treatments of gender imbalance in those courses.</P>
      <P>With regard to Thomond College of Education, Limerick, the position is that the college have four four-year undergraduate post-primary teacher training courses.  Each of the four courses has modules aimed at combating sexism and sex stereotyping in education.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 65 and 66 together.</P>
      <P>My Department have agreed in principle to grant aid the provision of separate extensions at St. Patrick's junior and senior national schools, Skerries, so as to provide overall permanent accommodation in twelve classrooms for each school.  These extensions would replace the existing prefabricated classrooms at the schools.  Because of the on-going difficult financial situation in relation to primary school buildings, I am not in a position to say, at this stage, when the provision of the accommodation might proceed.</P>
      <P>In view of the Deputy's interest in the matter, I will ask my Department's professional advisers to inspect the schools, especially the prefabricated classrooms, to see if any improvement works could be recommended for grant aid pending the provision of the extensions.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is understood to be referring to the passage in my budget address of 4 February 1988 wherein I stated that the additional capital allocated in 1988 to my Department for the national schools building programme would enable me to make allocations to individual schools in such fashion as to achieve the maximum impact over the widest possible number of schools.  The schemes in question, I indicated, would be confined to the provision of classrooms with normal basic facilities.  As consultations with all of the schools which are interested in proceeding on the basis outlined have not yet been concluded, I am not in a position to provide the Deputy with the information which she has sought.</P>
      <P>The level of grant which may be offered to individual applicants remains as heretofore a matter for negotiation between the school authorities and my Department in the light of the circumstances of the case.  Outside of that context, there is no question of reduced grants.</P>

      <P>The council are also considering the broader curricular issues of physical education in the school curriculum.  An initial exploratory meeting between the executive of the council and interested parties was held on 28 March, 1988, at which it was decided to recommend to the council that a working party on physical education be set up to advise on these curricular issues.  I am awaiting the outcome of these discussions.</P>
