      <P>With regard to item No. 8, there is a proposal to change the method of taking Priority Questions. This is a change from the procedure which was adopted by this House some time ago and I am objecting to the fact that this change is being proceeded with without a debate in this House.  This matter was not discussed at the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  I understand it was a deal done between the Whips of the Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, Progressive Democrats and Labour Parties. I want to express&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Order of Business, may I ask if the Taoiseach will make time available during the course of today for <Col N="1807" /> the House to be informed about the outcome of yesterday's Inter-governmental Conference meeting?  It is a little unusual in that, from reading press reports today, there is more than the usual amount of briefing and counter-briefing going on and I think it would help this House if we had the opportunity of having some fuller information about what went on at that meeting before us so that we could discuss it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The precedent is well established that reports on the meetings of the Anglo-Irish Conference are confined to the communique.  The Deputy knows this because he was one of those who established that precedent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but so far there has not been a meeting of that conference in such extraordinary circumstances, nor has there been a meeting which has been the subject of so much briefing and counter-briefing.  I note the Taoiseach's reluctance to deal with the matter in the House, but I ask him if he would at least devote some of his remarks during his speech on the Adjournment debate to this issue?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

      <P>The House will recall that we decided to take amendments Nos. 19, 23, 32, 34, 36, 40, 42 and 43 together with amendment No. 1 in the name of Deputy Mervyn Taylor.  We also agreed to take amendments in the name of Deputy Seán Barrett and a number of amendments in the name of The Workers' Party.  I take it that we will adhere to that procedure and debate all those amendments together.  If necessary, I will repeat the amendments to the House.  Deputy De Rossa was in posession.</P>

      <P>When the debate adjourned we had been discussing whether or not it would be acceptable to have a system of classification for guidance only whereby the censor would classify videos for the guidance of parents and others renting videos.  I was seeking, as I understand was Deputy Mervyn Taylor, a system of classification whereby the lessor of the videos would be obliged to ensure that persons who were excluded from viewing because of the classification would be excluded.  The lessor would be responsible for ensuring that a child <Col N="1816" /> would not view certain types of video, for instance.  I indicated that I would be generally satisfied with the sort of proposal the Minister was making with regard to classification for guidance purposes, taking into account the point made by the Minister that it would be difficult to police the kind of system which I was proposing, and taking into account that I believed that having a guidance system introduced would relieve the censor of the constraints which would be on him as things stand.  I felt that as things stand the censor would be constrained not to pass videos which he felt might get into the hands of young people for whom they might not be suitable.  If the censor could classify, for guidance purposes, it would assist him in doing his work.</P>
      <P>At the close of the discussion I asked if the Minister could indicate the kind of classification he was talking about and what legal obligation would be on the lessor in relation to how the system might be expected to operate.  From correspondence from the Video Alliance of Ireland, I know they have a voluntary system of classification.  They have a U classification suitable for all of the family and particularly aimed at young children &mdash; that is U with a C.  The letter U on its own is suitable for all, but of general interest to all of the family.  The letters PG indicate that parents should use their discretion and that the video is not suitable for very young children.  The number 15 indicates that they are suitable for people of 15 years of age and over.  Where they are marked with the number 18 they are suitable for people of 18 years and over.  They say that these symbols serve as guidelines only and no responsibility or liability attaches for the content of the film.  They also say that there are exempt uncertified titles.  Will the Minister clarify if that is the kind of voluntary guidance system he is proposing, or if it is some other variation of it?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Since we last debated this I met a number of people from the video industry.  It is obvious that their understanding of what we mean when we talk about a limited supply certificate and <Col N="1817" /> what they think might happen as a result of it are two different things.  I spent a considerable number of hours with two people debating this issue and I hope that at the end of the day I persuaded them that what we were talking about was reasonable.</P>
      <P>The Minister said that he would consider a classification system for guidance purposes, but there is a problem about that.  The real problem is not whether the videos come in from Britain with the labels about which Deputy De Rossa spoke, or whether the labels are attached to them here.  The problem is that this legislation obliges the censor in law to do certain things.  If the censor complies with the Act he will have to sit down and look at each video and decide whether or not to grant a certificate.  The point is being missed in this debate.  It is all very well to stick on labels for guidance purposes, but we are asking the censor to issue a supply certificate.  The censor should not be put into a position where he cannot give a certificate because although the work would be suitable for an 18 year old or an adult he is conscious of the fact that if he issues a certificate the video could be supplied to a ten year old.  That is quite ridiculous.  The chances are that in such a situation the censor would not issue a certificate because he has no option.  That would be equally ridiculous. This is why I am arguing so strongly on this issue.  I only want to give the censor another option so that he need not refuse a certificate altogether but can impose an age limit of 18, or whatever.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Deputy De Rossa's wording about a supply certificate.  I recognise that you cannot decide on who is going to view a video once it leaves the supply centre.  We cannot legislate for what goes on within the home, but at least we can control to whom the video is supplied, which in itself is some attempt at indicating to parents the suitability for viewing by children.  After that, it is up to parents to decide.  It is hoped that they will use commonsense.  I would look for another option for the censor rather than having him decide that since the video can be supplied for viewing by anybody <Col N="1818" /> from infancy onwards, in keeping with section 3 of the Bill he will not issue a certificate.  This would be ridiculous.  It would be equally ridiculous that the same censor when watching a film can decide whether or not to impose an age limit on the film.</P>
    <P>The video industry have informed me of their real concern, which is that the legislation will result in long delays. Somebody has been telling them that there is a little of the nod and wink stuff going on here, that even when this legislation is brought in the censor will not be looking at these videos at all.  It is not right that we should fool people.  We are legislators and if we pass laws we should see that they are implemented.  There should be no nod and wink stuff.  I do not want to be part of an Assembly that passes a quite stupid law.  I am very anxious that we have some form of classification.</P>
    <P>The difficulty is that these supply people think that they must supply the video to the censor who will view it and give it a certificate.  They say that in Britain prior to releases of the work the company involved send a copy of the video to the censor who makes his decision and gives it one of the labels about which Deputy De Rossa spoke, as being suitable for 15-year olds, 18-years olds, or unlimited viewing.  The video is then released.  They are afraid that there will be a delay between the release in Britain and here and that, as a result, people will be crossing the Border to get a tape or video work because it is popular. Such a delay would cause serious problems.  I have told the industry that if a company are releasing the work they will send a copy at the same time to the Irish censor as to the British censor so that the decisions can be made at roughly the same time.</P>
    <P>They also spoke about extra costs imposed, but I cannot see where they come in.  In accordance with this Bill, somebody must affix a label indicating that the film censor has granted a certificate and it will have to be on the spool or some other part of the video work.  If that has to be done, surely a lable can be <Col N="1819" /> affixed showing that it is for unlimited viewing or, say, 18 years upwards.  That will not cost any additional money.  It is important that before we complete this legislation the Minister or his officials meet the people in the industry and find out their real concern, which is in relation to classification.  There is a great deal of misunderstanding about.  I am not trying to be awkward.  To put a censor into a position where the only thing that he can do is grant or refuse a certificate, without giving him any intermediate option, would be stupid.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Following on the points made by Deputy Barrett and looking at the entire group of amendments that are now being taken together, I am as anxious as anybody in this House to facilitate the Minister.  However, there are unresolved contradictions in relation to the text of the Bill.  It has come from the Seanad and it is clear now that the Seanad version will be amended by the time the Bill completes Report Stage in this House.  It behoves us, if we can, as Deputy Barrett has said, to seek to clarify what exactly is meant by some of the terms being used.  On the question of definitions which figures in the first amendment of my colleague, Deputy Taylor, I certainly agree that if you are going to use language in any form of regulations that language should be specific. He is calling for a clear definition of a child.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two or three paradoxes occurring at the same time.  I want to make one point because it affects all the amendments being taken.  It is very important that the final version of the Bill when it becomes an Act would be one that strikes a reasonable balance between the viewing rights of an adult and the quite clearly damaging effects of inappropriate material on children.  On that adjustment I am inclined to be slightly conservative.  I do not agree with those who have seen published articles from a jurisprudence point of view, arguing that there is a direct and undisputable connection between the viewing of violence <Col N="1820" /> and the actual commission of crimes.  In fact, other research would show in relation to the crime of rape that the entry of violent images into the fantasy world and imagination of a child is something that, while not being direct in a casual relationship, can be connected with the form of the act of violence &mdash; or the act of domination as it should more accurately be called &mdash; in terms of research literature on rape.  That is for another part of the Bill.  On the other hand, it is very important to avoid the heavy hand of State censorship.</P>
    <P>That is one set of paradoxes.  Another arises in relation to the question with which we are now effectively dealing, that of classification.  Following on from Deputy Barrett's point, if the object of classification is to address the issue that I have just mentioned, that is to protect people who, we hope when the Bill is finished, will be accurately defined, at the same time there is a real worry as to whether the underlying problem &mdash; this is the second dimension to it &mdash; is an economic one, or one which is associated with large scale piracy.  All sides of this House would be appalled at the present position which is one of very low standards and, effectively, a total robbing of the right of copyright and so forth by people who are illegally in the trade.  The question is, is the classification system that will be offered by the Minister a real disincentive to the illegal operators?  Will it stop the supply of this material, or will it be an additional cost on the legitimate part of the industry which is trying to straighten out the trade, if you like?  If it becomes an additional cost on the legitimate part of the industry, surely the net effect will be for them to highly price their products by comparison with the cheaper and more unacceptable ones from the illegitimate side of the industry.</P>
    <P>We come then to another problem.  If the classification system is to be at once recommended but not statutorily required or enforceable by sanction, and it becomes a cost, will it not, in effect, be as likely to affect the distribution of minority classed videos as it is to affect the pornographic ones?  This legislation <Col N="1821" /> is bristling with difficulties.  The whole system of effective labelling is still totally unresolved.  I support the point made by Deputy Barrett that if talks with those who are genuinely concerned within the industry and anxious to regulate it would be of assistance, they should take place.</P>
    <P>My whole purpose in intervening at this point is to try to be of assistance in the legislation.  There is one point that worries me in relation to procedures.  It is the time of year when legislation gathers momentum often to drag with it its own dark consequences and we do not want that to happen in 1988.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to put Deputy Higgins's mind at rest, this legislation will not gather any momentum here today bearing in mind the assurances I gave Deputy De Rossa and Deputy Colley that I would consider certain matters before Report Stage.  I said I would give time to Members of the different parties to table amendments if I was unable to proceed. We are trying to process the legislation as best we can.  I do not know where Deputy Barrett got the idea of nods and winks.  I have not had any meetings with the videogram personnel so any political charge that might be made against me in this area is unjust.  However, there has been a number of meetings with the videogram personnel and officials of my Department and I am sure Deputy Barrett is not making any allegations against officials in the Department of Justice.</P>
      <P>We had a thorough discussion on this group of amendments on Committee Stage on 30 November.  The arguments for and against classification were examined in considerable depth and towards the end of the discussion I said that a valid argument had been made that classification would be of help to parents and that I would be prepared to give further consideration to the matter to see if I could come up with something along the lines that had been discussed.  I had in mind a system that would give information to parents for guidance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said, classification was one of the key issues when the legislation was being drafted.  The decision not to provide for <Col N="1822" /> it was not taken lightly but after consideration of all the relevant arguments. When I promised to have another look at the argument I was conscious of the fact that careful consideration would have to be given to any decision to change the Bill now in so far as classification is concerned.  Such consideration, as was pointed out on the last occasion and again today, would involve consultations with the Film Censor, the Department of Finance and the Irish Videogram Association. I was glad to hear that Deputy Barrett had consultations with the videogram people since we referred to this matter&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>That is fair enough, I am not making any point about it except to say that the Deputy was probably informed that we also had discussions with people in the industry.  Since we discussed the matter last, we had discussions with representatives of the Irish Videogram Association and with the Film Censor to see if we could do something along the lines suggested here. There should not be confrontation in any shape or form because we all want the same thing.  We also had a long discussion on the matter on Second Stage.</P>
      <P>It was clear at the meeting to which I referred that a decision to provide for classification would involve radical change in the logistics of the proposed system for the examination of the industry. However, logistics are not the be all and end all in this matter.  When we last discussed the matter, I accepted that the additional costs involved would not be a stumbling block to a proper system. Deputies know that section 32 provides that the costs will be met by fees.  We must also consider whether the additional costs involved can or should be met by the industry.  I am certain they should be but that can be discussed at a later date.</P>
      <P>Deputy Barrett was right in saying that classification would involve extra delay in bringing all video works within the ambit of the Bill.</P>

      <P>The people in the industry believe that this will be the case.  On Section 3, paragraph 25 of the explanatory memorandum does not require that the official censor should examine every video work before granting his certificate. In many cases he will be able to judge, from the title or his knowledge of the producer or otherwise, that the work is unobjectionable; but if it turns out that this is not the case, he will be able to make a prohibition order under section 6.  He does not have to go through everything with a fine comb.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>In section 3.  Let me finish what I was saying.  It is argued that classification by the Film Censor would give information to parents and others concerning the contents of the work.  That is a strong argument but whether it is true in practical terms must be examined in detail, which is the purpose of the discussions we initiated.  As Deputies are aware, there is an indication on video cassettes as to the age group for which the work is suitable.  The reconsideration which I promised will take a certain amount of time and I am not trying to rush the Bill.  Even if the House was unwise enough &mdash; I say this deliberately &mdash; to agree to an unwise suggestion that we should finish the Bill today, it would still take a while to get things going. However, I am not looking for anything like that as the Bill must be processed properly.  I will consider all the points on Committee Stage and there will be ample time for Members to table amendments on Report Stage.</P>

      <P>I am quite happy with that.  I have always found the Minister to be honourable.  When he says he will do something he does it.  I want to make this case because the industry are concerned and I do not think their concerns are real, but if I am mistaken, perhaps the Minister would put me right.</P>
      <P>My understanding is that in the video industry there are distributors, wholesalers and retailers.  I imagine the producers of the video would apply to the censor for a certificate.  This Bill does not refer to distributors, it refers to wholesalers and retailers.  I imagine a retailer or a wholesaler would not apply for a certificate&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I imagine companies like Paramount who make these films would apply for a certificate and if the censor gives it, that will go on all the films.  Therefore, I cannot accept the industry's concern about delays.  Presumably when they present the film to the British censor it will be presented to the Irish censor at the same time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>If they apply to the British and Irish censors at the same time, that would help us with another problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>The industry's concern about delay is eliminated.  Now we come to the second cause of concern &mdash; cost. Where is the extra cost?  The certificate will either say that this film is for unlimited supply or, what I am suggesting, <Col N="1825" /> limited supply.  All we have are two labels and somebody will have to pick one label. Whatever the censor decides is the label that will be put on these videos.  I cannot see where these huge additional costs arise.</P>
      <P>I am asking these questions because it is important for the industry that they are put on the record.  If I am wrong I will be glad to hear where I am wrong.  The Minister so far appears to be saying I am right.  I cannot see why the industry should be so concerned if videos are classified.  My advice to the industry is &mdash; and Deputy De Rossa and Deputy Higgins made the same point &mdash; that if there is a classification system there is a better chance of some videos being available on the market which might otherwise not be allowed.  If there is a classification system, some videos might get a limited supply certificate, but if the Bill is passed as now presented, the only other option would be for the censor to refuse a certificate.  That is where I believe the industry will have a problem. They will have to appeal and this will involve extra cost.  This is where the delay comes in.  There is provision in this Bill to appeal the censor's decision.</P>
      <P>In my view it is better for the industry that the censor has another option. Instead of refusing he should have the option of issuing a certificate for over 18, over 16 or whatever.  Who am I to say whether an adult should not be able to watch a particular video?  I agree with Deputy Higgins that it is a completely different ball game when you are talking about children.  If I am wrong perhaps the Minister would put me right before we deal with the other sections because these points have been raised with me by the industry.</P>

      <P>I have every confidence in Séamus Smith, the current censor and knowing him, he is not the kind of person who would be worried about the difference between the pornographic and the erotic effect of Donald Duck but my point is the taking up of the costing of the classification system.  It is only fair to those who are anxious to see what the classification system will be like, what its cost will be and what its effect will be that this question be dealt with.  I understand their case is not that the costs arise in relation to rejected material but in their assumption, and from reading the legislation, of a general requirement of submitting material for classification within a system that is in itself stopping short of any legal sanction.  My point to the Minister remains the same.  If you were putting in good scouting conditions for those in the trade who are trying to operate within professional standards and it stops short or does not touch the principal source of all the problems this Bill is addressed to &mdash; illegal operators and those who are operating in the industry without standards &mdash; what will the net effect of it be but to make procedures more cumbersome and more expensive for the general body of material submitted for classification for those who are trying to have standards within the industry?  At the same time it will not necessarily make life more difficult for the illegal operators whom we all know are the principal source of the material to which there is a consensus we would take objection even though there would be differences between us in terms of levels of definition.</P>

      <P>I find myself going back once more to the basic approach of this Bill which was to outlaw certain videos because they were gross in some way, to take them completely out of circulation and say they were not suitable for viewing at all.  The industry themselves have sought such a Bill.  They know and knew <Col N="1827" /> costs were going to be attached to such a Bill and they have accepted that.  They knew an appeal mechanism would be written into it.  They accept that approach, I am sure, and the fact that costs will be associated with it, so I do not understand what Deputy Barrett is talking about in repeating what he believes to be a problem the video industry will see themselves as having.</P>
      <P>The amendment we are dealing with relates exclusively to whether there should be classification of some kind.  I argued originally here on Committee Stage and on Second Stage that there should not be classification because it cannot be implemented.</P>

      <P>Having listened to the debate on Committee Stage the last day I would be willing to accept that if there were a system that could be in some way implemented and would aid those looking for guidance I would support that.  However, once more we have to draw the distinction between works viewed on a video machine and works viewed in a cinema and admit that the legislative restrictions one can put on viewing in a cinema are entirely different from those one can put on the viewing of a video work.  Given those difficulties in enforcement, we should consider the Minister's proposal for classification that he would be willing to make on Report Stage or willing to work on in a positive way.</P>
      <P>Deputy De Rossa has indicated he is willing to withdraw his amendment in relation to this problem.  If we are to get through this Bill not just today but at all, we should move along and see what progress we can make.  We have discussed this classification issue in detail and in depth, and I do not think I am hearing any new arguments this morning that pertain to it.  We should move on and come back to it on Report Stage and take into account what the Minister is saying.</P>

It is accepted by the Minister that some form of classification is required and it is really a question of what form that classification will take.  I have raised two points in relation to it and I will put the matter on record.  As things stand, (1) the censor has to reject or accept a video and I believe he will tend towards the conservative, as it were, in rejecting, because he will believe that if he allows it through it will get into the hands of people for whom it is not suitable, young people in particular; (2) if he has already passed a film for adult viewing only, it automatically gets a certificate for general release and he has no right to put a classification on it.  I argue that he should have a right to put a classification on it even if only for guidance, as the Minister suggests.  I accept the Minister's good intentions in this regard and I ask the House to await his proposals with regard to them.</P>

      <P>I thank the Deputies for what appears to be consensus in the House that amendment No. 1 will be withdrawn and the other amendments in the group will not be moved to give me an opportunity of doing as we have agreed. Deputy Colley is right when she says we cannot forget the basic purpose of the Bill.  I will give the matter a very thorough examination.  We have had meetings with the Film Censor and the Irish Videogram Association.  I am not worried about passing on additional costs to the industry. Naturally I presume they would prefer this did not happen but that is of no consideration to this House.</P>

      <P>In page 5, line 43, to delete subsection (3) (c).</P>
      <P>I put this down to get information from the Minister to clarify exactly what is involved here.  As I understand it, section 2 provides for exempting certain categories of videos from the restrictions in the Bill.  The one specifically referred to in amendment No. 7 is subsection (3) (c) which exempts supplies of videos outside the State.  I find that difficult to understand. If we are restricting the availability of video nasties to our own citizens why are we happy to allow videos of this nature to be distributed from this State to other states and to the citizens of other states?  Obviously there would be concern about video nasties in terms of the violence, the gross pornography and so on, but another aspect of it is the use of this State for the promoting of fascism.  We know at the moment that material is printed here which promotes what is called the National Front in Britain, and I understand a very small group of National Front activists operate here in this State.  Because this type of material is banned in Britain, Ireland is used as a base where this material is printed.  I heard recently on one of these talk shows of which the Minister for Communications feels there are too many on our radio&mdash;&mdash;</P>

If this section is retained we will be allowing the State to be used as a base from which <Col N="1831" /> that type of material, and video nasties that deal with violence and pornography, can be produced.

      <P>Once again, without appearing to be totally submerged in complexity, I should like to say that I agree entirely with the comments by Deputy De Rossa about Ireland being used as a clearing ground for material.  He is right that in the absence of legislation dealing with incitement to hatred and so on, our position has been abused by those who print grossly offensive, racist and fascist material.  There is evidence of that. However, we keep coming back to the question of fundamental principles.  If we have standards, if we are against a product being submitted because it is on a theme of domination, violence or a mixture of both, it does not make any sense to be saying that we are of a higher sensitivity and that it is all right for somebody else.  I can see that logic being applied in regard to standards for pharmaceutical supplies.  We can have standards here but they may not apply to Africa, for example.</P>
      <P>However, those points having been made, we must constantly return to the principles of the Bill and what will happen in practice.  When selling a pound of butter on the European market the Kerrygold seal might be of assistance, if we are to believe the advertisements, but we must ask what impact the Bill will have on our clearing process for videos and so on.  To what extent can it be applied to those who are exporting material?  Will they be required to have the Irish stamp of approval on their product? Will it be a recommendation or a hindrance?  Obviously, that question cannot be answered until we know the impact of the legislation.  I have some sympathy for the Minister's position but Deputy De Rossa has a point in asking the Minister to outline the circumstances that led him to seek such an exemption.</P>

      <P>I find a curious element of hypocrisy in all this.  I am not accusing the Minister of that but there is an element of hypocrisy in regard to this issue in the Bill.  It appears that it is in order to protect our own from the evils of pornography, video nasties and so on, but it is all right if we produce such videos for export.  I am not talking about erotic films or Donald Duck films but about films that are quite offensive.  On the one hand we are arguing that it is an offence to supply videos which may lead to crimes of one type or another but we are prepared to allow such videos to be produced here and supplied to other states, for example, Northern Ireland.  That may leave us in the position of being used as a base for the production of such material. That may suit some entrepreneurial types who may see a gap in the market and consider it their role to fill it.  Whatever about taking steps to prevent that happening to specifically exclude the supply of that material from the State is a mistake. For that reason I should like to press the Minister to delete the provision. That provision begs the question, why was it included.  Why not set up an industry to produce that material?</P>
      <P>This is not the same as a person deciding that he or she has an ability to write certain material because in the production of videos actors, camera people, editors and so on must be employed.  In my view we are leaving Ireland open to becoming a base for the production of this type of material.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I have tabled an amendment in regard to this topic.  I do not understand why the Minister has <Col N="1833" /> included this provision.  The Bill deals with the supply of videos on the Irish market and I wonder why the Minister is anxious to point out that exempted supplies includes supplies outside the State.  We are talking about videos that will be available here and we do not have a provision to deal with those who produce such material here for distribution outside the State.  Presumably, those who produce such films can continue to do so if their intention is to supply a market outside the State.</P>
      <P>There is a lot in what Deputy De Rossa has said.  If we are talking about standards I presume we are referring to those that apply in any civilised society.  I do not see why we should outline the standards we want and say we do not care if people produce material here that may upset citizens of other countries.  When one considers the number of TV satellite stations coming on stream one wonders if we are wasting our time trying to control videos.  It may be that those we will ban will be seen on a satellite channel in the future.  In my view Europe should decide on certain standards and apply them in relation to videos and what is shown on television.  If we do not we will be fighting a losing battle.  I do not think we should make it obvious that we want certain standards here if we do not care if people produce videos that are banned here.  In other words I do not see why it is mentioned at all.</P>

      <P>I would be in sympathy with what both Deputy De Rossa and Deputy Barrett have said about there being an element of hypocrisy in the Bill regarding video works which are for supply here and which must be placed before the censor and those which go outside the State and do not have to go before the censor but it may come down to a drafting difficulty because there is a prohibition in section 4 regarding the supplying of a video recording containing a video work in respect of which a supply certificate is not in force.  The word &ldquo;supply&rdquo; here is defined as supply in any manner whether or not for reward and therefore includes supply by way of sale <Col N="1834" /> etc.  Every kind of supply is covered whether for export or not.</P>
      <P>Because of the manner in which the Bill is drafted you must exclude those videos that are being supplied for consumption outside the State.  This is unfortunate because it leads to the conclusion that we have two different sets of standards. It seems that one would have to redraft the Bill in a number of areas in order to get around that problem.  There is another Bill going through the Houses of the Oireachtas relating to incitement to hatred and it occurs to me that the particular difficulty Deputy De Rossa foresees and which exists to a certain extent in this country in the supply of material, whether video or written but which is definitely an incitement to hatred, could be caught by that other Bill.  It should be aimed at it.  I would be in sympathy with taking out a provision which excludes &ldquo;outside the State&rdquo; specifically except that I think the rest of the Bill might run into trouble then.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>What we are talking about is supply and an exemption.  In effect we are putting in place virtually the same regime that is already in place for the film industry.  If a full length feature film is made in Ireland it does not need to go before the censor provided it is not being shown here.  It can go immediately out of the country and then it is up to the censors in whatever country it is sent to to deal with the film.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>With respect we will come to that in section 4.  What the Minister is saying might be a description of events on the ground but it is not necessarily something that fits in easily with the wording in the Bill before this House. Section 4 (1) states:</P>
      <P>A person who supplies or offers to supply a video recording containing a video work in respect of which a supply certificate is not in force for the time being shall be guilty of an offence unless&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(a)  the supply is, or would if it <Col N="1836" /> took place be, an exempted supply, or</P>
    <P>(b)  the work is an exempted work.</P>
    <P>There is a problem of reconciling that language with what the Minister has said but there is another more practical problem about it &mdash; and this point has been made already &mdash; and that is that this particular set of commodities is arranged for the exemption market.  If that kind of category is created in the consumer mind I warn the Minister that it is like people going through the film advertisements to see what classifications are on them.  The Minister is setting up another classification system.  We need to look at this both in the way it is worded in the legislation and how it will work out in practice. There is the unresolved problem which Deputy De Rossa mentioned and to which Deputy Colley drew our attention, that is, that some of the concerns many of us have can be handled by the other legislation, for example, the incitement to hatred which legislation, I understand, will have a speedy passage through this House.  There is other amending legislation, including the Bill to deal with rape, to come before the House and which will seriously affect this Bill in relation to some of the definitions of what is prohibitable material.  The Minister should reflect in advance on some of these difficulties as they arise.  We are dealing with section 2 and this will arise again on section 4.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I still do not understand the reason this section is in the Bill. The Minister says it concerns supply, that is fair enough but can he explain what effect would arise from the deletion of this section?  In what way would those who produce and supply videos at present for export be affected by this Bill if this section was not included?  The Minister said we are dealing with supply but there is not much point in going to the trouble and expense of making a video if it is not going to be supplied to somebody, it has to be supplied to somebody at the end of the day even it is only to one's friends. <Col N="1837" /> As I see it we are giving a nod and a wink to the emergence of a video nasty manufacturing industry in the State by having this section in the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Minister replies to that, since he is also the Minister with responsibility for trade and marketing, I would ask him to draw on his experience in that area and to bear in mind the question of what the effect would be if we were selling to the larger video market.  For example, if we are sending this product with the seal of approval of the Irish Republic, to Northern Ireland or Britain, would that be a major trading advantage?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is being a little disingenuous in bringing an exports dimension into this matter but I admire his approach.  However, I would argue that laying another burden on the manufacturer of videos in Ireland would be an additional constraint to trade.  If the Deputy wants me to wear my trade hat I would be all for not having an additional certificate required from the manufacturer who has responsibility only for exporting.  The Deputy has encouraged me to take that line of argument.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am standing in for the Minister.  We have to be clear about what we are trying to do here.  Deputy De Rossa asked what would be the effect of not having this section in the Bill.  The effect of not having section 2 (2) (c) in the Bill would be that any video manufacturer in Ireland would be required to go to the censor for a certificate that the video was suitable for showing to an Irish audience before it is exported.  It may never be shown to an Irish audience and therefore impractical to adopt this approach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In most countries, and I use the word &ldquo;most&rdquo; until I get a fix on the total, the censorship procedure does not take place at the point of manufacture but rather at the point where the film is likely to be <Col N="1838" /> shown.  It could be argued that the censorship procedure should take place at the point of manufacture but that is entirely a different question.  Perhaps that would be the way to deal with this matter but it is up to each jurisdiction to decide on what it is going to allow be shown in its jurisdiction.  We are being entirely consistent with the procedure that is used in regard to full length feature films.  A full length feature film made here need not be submitted to the censor if it is meant for showing abroad only.  If the film is meant for viewing here then it has to be submitted to the censor.  It is an eminently practical solution which is also used in many other parts of the world.  Each country operates different standards and we should not impose our standards in regard to video works on the French, for example.  It is up to the French to decide what standards they want to apply in their own country.  It would be quite cheeky to attempt to do so and that in effect is what we would be doing if this section was not contained in the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that it would be very cheeky of us if we were to tell the French what they should do&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;or what they should watch, but I suggest that it would not be very cheeky of us if we were to tell them that the type of film they want to watch is not going to be allowed to be made in this country.  If we were to insert the words &ldquo;within the State&rdquo; into the definition section this would not be necessary. It would be far better for us to do that than to leave the wording stand as it is.  I would find it very difficult to justify that wording.  In this legislation we are trying to prevent video nasties from being shown in this country but the approach we seem to be adopting is that we will not allow them be shown in this country but that we will allow them be made in this country.  That is the interpretation I would put on the wording contained in <Col N="1839" /> the Bill.  I would find it quite horrifying and totally hypocritical if we were to adopt that approach.  This should not be allowed happen in any civilised society. If we think a particular type of film promotes violence then surely we should not encourage people to get involved in the making of such films.  I suggest that one way of getting around this problem is to include the words &ldquo;within the State&rdquo; in the definition section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnneMarieColley" hpid="Miss Colley Miss Colley">
      <NameTxt>Miss Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to delay the House on this matter but it is very important that the interpretation of the words contained in the definition section should not be enlarged by the Minister of State.  I am not familiar with the legislation in regard to feature length films so I cannot claim to have any expertise in that area but I have looked through this Bill which defines the word &ldquo;supply&rdquo; as &ldquo;supply in any manner&rdquo;.  I am not saying that just because a video work is made in this country it should be submitted to the censor but rather it should be submitted at the point where it is being supplied, be it is for export or for supply to a world distributor.  Therefore it will be caught by this definition.  A very suitable solution to this problem would be, as Deputy Barrett suggests, to insert the words &ldquo;within the State&rdquo; into the definition section.  One could argue that any legislation passed by this House can only apply within the State but questions have been asked, arising out of the wording contained in section 2 (3) (c), as to whether it does nor does not. Therefore this matter should be clarified. Therefore if we included the words &ldquo;within the State&rdquo; within the definition section we could delete section 2 (3) (c).</P>

      <P>If the Deputy supports that idea then I would be quite happy to take another look at the wording because what I want to achieve is to permit video films to be made in Ireland for export without them having to be viewed by the Irish censor.  I am being dead straight about this.  That is what I am trying to achieve.  I take it from what Deputy Colley says that that is also her objective, but I am not so clear as to whether that is Deputy Barrett's objective.</P>

      <P>The view that has been expressed by the Minister of State would correspond with the broad view being expressed here in relation to this Bill.  My purpose in raising this issue in the first place was that we appeared to be inviting people to say an invitation has been extended to produce video nasties here and that there would be no problems as long as they were going to be supplied to Northern Ireland, Liverpool, Glasgow, London or Paris.  I believe that kind of invitation should not be extended under this legislation.  The compromise proposal made by Deputy Barrett is a good one, that the words &ldquo;within the State&rdquo; be inserted into the definition section.  Whether we permit the making of video nasties to go ahead in this State is, as Deputy Barrett has said, a question to be dealt with under other legislation. One question which needs urgent attention is whether we permit fascist type material to be printed within the State.  I am aware that the Incitement to Hatred Bill has passed through the Seanad and I hope it will come before the House in the new year.  We will deal with that question to some extent under this Bill.  Generally we appear to be agreed that the question of whether we censor material going abroad cannot be dealt with under this Bill and the question of whether that material should be made here or not also has to be dealt with under another Bill. This Bill should not invite those who might want to produce that kind of material to say: &ldquo;Here is a loophole and it is an invitation to us to carry on&rdquo;.  That <Col N="1842" /> is why we should delete section 2 (3) (c) from the Bill.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 7a:</P>
      <P>In page 6, subsection (1), to delete lines 3 to 13 and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(a)  the work depicts to a significant extent acts of force or restraint associated with human sexual activity, or</P>
      <P>(b)  the work depicts to a significant extent the mutilation or torture of, or other acts of gross violence towards, humans or animals, or</P>
      <P>(c)  the work depicts to a significant extent human urinary or excretory functions.</P>
      <P>or is designed to any extent to stimulate or encourage anything falling with paragraphs (a) or (b) above or could reasonably be regarded as so doing.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1843" /> The main purpose of this amendment in the name of Deputy Taylor is to give us a form of wording which can be operated. The wording in lines 3 to 13 of section 3 are extremely vague and built into them is an assumption which I do not think is sustainable.  Section 3 (1) (a) (i) says &ldquo;would be likely to cause persons to commit crimes ...&rdquo; whereas paragraph (a) of Deputy Taylor's amendment says &ldquo;the work depicts to a significant extent acts of force or restraint associated with human sexual activity...&rdquo; The wording used in the amendment is an acceptance of acts of sexual violence which is consistent with new, sensitive and more modern interpretations of acts of sexual violence.  I want to give the Minister and the Government fair warning that when legislation on rape comes before the House I intend to oppose any regression to 19th century definitions of rape which technically refer to an entirely penile definition of rape or which, in addition, seeks to retain any notion about the fear of becoming pregnant.</P>
    <P>The relevance of those remarks to the amendment I have moved is that the wording suggested by Deputy Taylor accepts that acts of sexual violence are more usually characterised by the impulse of domination and by the impulse to humiliate a person by means of sexual gratification.  It is only those who, from a sociological point of view, I might call &ldquo;flat earthers&rdquo;, would argue that a woman who said there was no prospect of her becoming pregnant was therefore not really raped.  Someone who argues that should head for some of the weirder and remoter areas of Islam &mdash; I do not want to insult Islam because it is more progressive than that in many respects. The thinking behind the wording in this amendment is that the section should be more precise, egalitarian and fairer from the point of view of what is involved in the actions referred to.</P>
    <P>Subsection (b) of amendment 7a states &ldquo;the work depicts to a significant extent the multilation of torture of, or other acts of gross violence towards, humans or animals...&rdquo;.  I believe this wording <Col N="1844" /> would to a significant extent protect people in terms of the balance of material in a video.  It is necessary at times for artistic purposes to retain certain images in a video but it is entirely different when the representatives symbol is distorted totally so that it appeals to a sadistic impulse or whatever.  This is entirely different from the use of material in a balanced way for artistic purposes and hence the inclusion in Deputy Taylor's amendment of the words' &ldquo;the mutiliation or torture of, or other acts of gross violence towards humans or animals...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I might say in this regard that we are not taking into account in this discussion &mdash; and I know it has taken place before &mdash; the conjunction of two sets of covert actions.  There is an element of seediness in relation to the viewing of excessively cruel and sadistic kinds of videos.  There is a seediness and covertness to that but there is equally a seediness, covertness and an illegality in the distribution and supply of videos from under the counter by someone who is not a member of the regulated part of the industry.  One keeps hitting off part of the damage being done by illegal operators under paragraph (b) of the amendment which is closely related to paragraph (c) which refers to &ldquo;human urinary or excretory functions&rdquo;.  A considerable amount of work has been initiated by some people associated in the Kinsey Institute in Indiana University which clearly identifies these as categories over which there should be no trouble.  The use of the words &ldquo;stimulate or encourage&rdquo; in the amendment is better language than the language used in the Bill in another way.  Section 3 (1) (a) (i) of the Bill states &ldquo;would be likely to cause persons to commit crimes&rdquo;.  One would be in the courts for years if one used that language because one would not be able to show a causative relationship between viewing a video and the commission of a crime.  It is clear, from having looked at the literature on crimonology on rapists and murderers who have been interviewed, that it is the methodology of the crime which is at once facilitated or made easy when a person draws on their <Col N="1845" /> imagination which has been twisted and this affects the form of the act rather than the commission of it.  If one uses the older language of causal relationship it would be a very easy defence to say that X did not cause Y whereas if one argues that X clearly facilitated the commission of Y one would use the language in this amendment and be on much sounder ground.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>To a large extent we are dealing with the heart of the Bill in this section and we are into the area of whether or not a video or film can incite a person to crime.  I have said before in relation to this Bill that I am not convinced that it does incite a reasonably well balanced individual to commit crimes or acts of violence.  My understanding is that films or videos of this kind are more likely to disgust and anger people who view them.</P>
      <P>We must draw the distinction between the type of &ldquo;nasties&rdquo; we are trying to deal with and the erotic film.  One person's erotica may well be another person's pornography and <i>vice versa.</i> This Bill is not intended to deal with erotic films but with films or videos which may incite people to commit crime.  It is an extremely difficult thing to define.  The difficulty is reflected by the number of amendments attempting to define more precisely what we mean by incitement.</P>
      <P>Our amendments Nos. 8, 10 and 11 are attempting to reach a balance between what is perceived to be needed and the protection of the right of the individual adult to view material which he or she regards as suitable.  Amendment No. 8 proposes to delete part of subsection (1) and to substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(i) would be likely to cause persons to commit crimes, by inciting violence, or by stirring up hatred against any group of persons on account of their race, nationality, religion, gender or sexual orientation, or&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While we seem to be happy enough to ban films which we think will incite people to hatred on account of a person's religion, race or nationality, the Minister in the <Col N="1846" /> Seanad was unwilling to take on board the fact that incitement to hatred can also occur because of a person's sexual orientation.  In this enlightened age it is not unreasonable to expect that when we are dealing with the issue of incitement we should include sexual orientation to ensure that this type of video is not circulated.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 10 is as follows:</P>
    <P>In page 6, subsection (1), line 8, to delete &ldquo;any&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;grossly&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This is an attempt to define more closely what we are trying to achieve.  The censor will be obliged as things stand to ban any film, the viewing of which would tend by reason of the inclusion in it of any obscene or indecent matter to deprave or corrupt a person who might view it.  We feel that the word &ldquo;any&rdquo; gives too wide a brief to the censor.  The question of what is obscene and what is indecent is largely a matter of personal taste.  We would be happier if the words &ldquo;grossly obscene&rdquo; and &ldquo;grossly indecent&rdquo; were part of the guidelines on which the censor would operate.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 11 states:</P>
    <P>In page 6, subsection (1), line 12, to delete &ldquo;depicts&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;incites&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This is another attempt to define things more closely.  It is unreasonable to ban something simply because it depicts gross violence and cruelty.  A film of a good standard might include scenes of this kind as part of its message, which might be quite moral.  I have read reviews of a film in circulation in the United States which deals fairly explicitly with rape and contains scenes which are quite disturbing. The net effect of the film is moral since it clearly makes the case against rape and against the view that a woman is responsible for her own misfortune.  I do not know what view our censor will take if the film arrives here.  We need to be more precise in the terms we use in defining what the censor may or may not pass. I am not arguing that what I propose is the best way.  Deputies Taylor, Colley <Col N="1847" /> and others have indicated that it should be done in a different way.  Our purpose is to ensure that undue pressure is not placed on the censor to eliminate films which would otherwise pass if he had a freer hand.  I stress again the need to include sexual orientation as one of the issues which the censor should take into account when deciding whether a film incites hatred.</P>
    <P>It is interesting that we are proposing to ban the supply of videos which would depict gross violence or cruelty, including mutilation and torture of human beings or animals, but we fail to legislate for the banning of enclosed hare coursing which, by any standards, involves gross violence, cruelty and multilation of animals.  We will be in the curious position that we will not be entitled to watch this kind of mutilation on video but we can go to the country and watch this activity live, without any restrictions as to age or sex. There are differing views as to whether hare coursing is cruel.  I believe it is but some members of my party do nor hold that view.  There are divided opinions in other parties on that issue.  I draw the attention of the House to the fact that we are proposing to ban the depiction of gross cruelty to animals on video but we are quite happy to allow gross cruelty to animals by way of hare coursing to occur freely and without hindrance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputy De Rossa is right in saying that this is the core of the Bill because it is the reasoning on which the censor must base his decision. Essentially it is the only direction he is given as to what decision he should make about a video work, whether to allow it to be supplied or whether to prohibit it. Given that that is his only advice from us, the legislators, I shudder to think what faces him if he has to implement the words: &ldquo;that he is of opinion that the work is unfit for viewing because the viewing of it would be likely to cause persons to commit crimes whether by inciting or encouraging them ....&rdquo;.  That wording is very wide in its definition and would be impossible to implement.  Not <Col N="1848" /> alone would the censor have problems in deciding what would or would not be likely to cause persons of whatever ilk to commit crimes but if it were tested in the courts they would have great difficulty in deciding what the real definition should be.</P>
      <P>It is for that reason that I sought to include amendment No. 9 which proposes to change that wording to read that the viewing of it &mdash; that is the work &mdash; would incite or encourage persons to commit crimes whether by inciting or encouraging them to do so or by indicating or suggesting ways ....  In other words, the definite incitement or encouragement must be clear in the video.  It is not good enough simply to say &ldquo;it would be likely to&rdquo; because that would be an extremely subjective definition and what may be likely to cause me to commit crimes can be very different from what may be likely to cause other people to commit them.</P>
      <P>When passing legislation we must make it as clear and as definite as possible from the point of view of the public so that they will know what they have to adhere to and also from the point of view of the censor who will have to make decisions on that basis.  The enforcement of this legislation depends on the courts being able to properly define it.  It seems the film or video must actually incite or encourage persons to commit crimes. Otherwise it should not come under this definition.</P>
      <P>On Second Stage I referred to a number of innocent films that have been extremely popular over the years and which, to my mind, would definitely fall within the terms of section 3 (1) (a) (i) because they depict how a crime has been committed and ways of avoiding detection. I mentioned a couple of them such as &ldquo;How to Steal a Million&rdquo; and &ldquo;Top-kapi&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>How is the censor to decide whether it would be likely to cause you or any other person to commit a crime by giving the general idea of, first, executing the crime and, secondly, avoiding detection?  The Minister has made my point entirely.  Whatever formula of words we come up with in the &mdash; it may be that we will not come up with a definite formula until Report Stage &mdash; this definition is not closely defined enough.  It will not allow the censor to make a proper decision.  It will, as Deputy De Rossa has said, constrain him so that he may not be inclined to give a supply certificate when there is no good reason in many instances for not doing so.  If a case is appealed it will certainly cause difficulties in the courts because it will be impossible to apply such a subjective definition.  The Minister and the Minister for Justice should think again about this definition. It is at the very heart of the Bill and if it is not right the Bill will fall and will not take effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not tabled an amendment to this section for the simple reason that I was holding fire until Report Stage, if necessary, until I got some explanations from the Minister.  Deputy Colley was right in saying that we could argue all day as to what is the best wording. What we are trying to do here is to find words that one would regard as basic commonsense.  At the end of the day we appoint a film censor and hope that the individual involved uses basic commonsense. I do not envy any parliamentary draftsman or the officials in <Col N="1850" /> the Department of Justice who have to put words like this into a section.  There is a lot of merit in what Deputies Michael Higgins, De Rossa and Ann Colley have said.  I do not know which wording is the best.  I would not like to see somebody interpreting a set of words in a way that was never intended.  The wording in section 3 (1) (a) (i) could cause problems. It highlights the reason there should be some form of classification.</P>
      <P>What may incite or encourage persons to commit crimes by indicating or suggesting ways of doing so or of avoiding detection can vary between an adult and a child.  This highlights the need to give the censor some discretion.  He can decide that in accordance with the wording of the Act an adult would not be affected by a certain film but at the same time he has to be conscious of the fact that a ten year old could be affected.  He will be faced with a terrible dilemma of either granting or refusing permission to see the film.  That is the kernel of the problem.</P>
      <P>From the record of our censors in the last number of years we have been very fortunate that they have been people who have used their heads.  There has been the odd quibble but by and large I do not think anybody has complaints.  The censors have done a fine job and I hope that will continue.  I would not like to see the censor's hands tied behind his back in terms of doing his job and using commonsense. This section ties in with classification. Whatever words are used will depend on the person who will be viewing the film.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said that some of the films Deputy Colley listed certainly would not cause him any great difficulties but I wonder would they cause difficulties to a 14 or 15 year old.  This is for the judgement of the censor.  Whatever set of words are used, the censor has to have some discretion.  Above all, let us not put ourselves in a position where somebody will walk into our clinics or meet us in the street and ask us why a film with an over 18's certificate, that can be viewed by persons of 18 years and over, is on sale or for hire in the local video library <Col N="1851" /> where anybody can walk in and get it. That is the kernel of the problem.  Once a film gets clearance from the censor and a video is produced the censor is obliged to issue a certificate in accordance with the provisions of this section.  Therefore the position is that he looks at it and says to himself this is a film for over 18's and anybody can have it as a video.  That is quite ridiculous.</P>
    <P>I do not know what is the best set of words to use here.  In my view it all depends on who the viewer will be.  The package classification and the provisions of this section should be taken together. I hope we will look at this as a package on Report Stage in order to ascertain whether we are producing sensible legislation. There is no point in amending one section like this one and not doing so somewhere else.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to comment on the amendments and the relevant sections.  I should say that, at the drafting stage, the criteria in existing legislation in relation to censorship was examined closely.  The two relevant sets of statutes are the Censorship of Films Acts, 1923 to 1970, and the censorship of Publications Acts, 1929 to 1967.  The wording of British legislation was considered also, in particular the wording of the Obscene Publications Act, 1959 and the Video Recordings Act, 1984.  In addition, the requirements of today's world were taken into account, in particular the special characteristics of video works.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The wording of sections 3 and 6 was arrived at only after quite an amount of consideration and teasing out what was required.  One would like to arrive at the position where there would be very detailed criteria to enable the Film Censor to make a decision.  On the other hand, he must have scope to judge video works on their merits having particular regard to the way in which topics are dealt with in any given work.  Here I agree very much with Deputy Barrett that we should <Col N="1852" /> allow the maximum amount of discretion to the official censor.</P>
    <P>In the course of the Second Stage debate on this Bill and again this morning there was reference to the film entitled &ldquo;How to Steal a Million&rdquo; as a film which showed how to commit a crime and get away with it.  The question was asked, &ldquo;Would it be banned under the criteria set out in section 3&rdquo;.  I know that it did get a certificate for viewing in cinemas here.</P>
    <P>Deputies are aware that section 3 (2) provides that the official censor shall not refuse to grant a supply certificate in respect of a video work in respect of which a general certificate or a limited certificate under the Censorship of Films Acts, 1923 to 1970, is in force.  Accordingly, the version of this film which got cinema certificates here would get a supply certificate also.  The position then is that a video work would not be refused a supply certificate simply because it portrayed how to commit a crime or avoid detection.  The Film Censor would have to be of the opinion that the work would be unfit for viewing because its viewing would be likely to cause persons to commit crimes, whether by inciting or encouraging them to do so, or by indicating or suggesting means of doing so, or of avoiding detection.</P>
    <P>One circumstance in which this would arise is when a particular crime is depicted in such detail and in such an attractive manner as to be likely to incite people to commit the crime.  A possible example might be a detailed portrayal of how to steal a car without having the ignition key.  A similar example would be a detailed description of how to inject oneself with drugs.  However, the kernel of the matter is that the official censor would have to be satisfied that the work was unfit for viewing because its viewing would be likely to cause persons to commit crimes.  Obviously that would not be the case in the large percentage of video works which portray a crime of various types.</P>
    <P>Another example might be the way in which violence towards humans is depicted in a film.  Deputies will be aware <Col N="1853" /> that one of the main categories which will be outlawed under the provisions of this Bill will be those video works that depict violence against humans or animals. There is no doubt that there are many such video works available, but they will be banned under this Bill because the Film Censor will be of the opinion that they depict acts of gross violence or cruelty towards humans or animals.</P>
    <P>However, there will be other video works which depict gross violence or cruelty towards humans which will not be banned.  Some Deputies will be aware of a recent film entitled &ldquo;Platoon&rdquo; about the war in Vietnam and showed some of the terrible violence suffered by soldiers in that war and some of the terrible violence and cruel acts that they, in turn, inflicted on other human beings.  However, the film treats these violent and cruel scenes in a manner that does not glorify them or in any way invite imitation.</P>

      <P>It clearly makes the case that such violence and cruelty is wrong and harmful not only to its victims but also to its perpetrators.

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not that information available.  Should a comparable work come before the official censor initially as a video work he would have to consider it in the context of whether it was unfit for viewing because it depicts acts of gross violence or cruelty towards humans.  If course that is a decision that the censor himself will have to take.  I <Col N="1854" /> think I have clearly indicated that there is a basic difference between the violence and cruelty depicted in a film such as &ldquo;Platoon&rdquo; and the violence and cruelty depicted in so-called video nasties.</P>
      <P>A further point I might make about the criteria contained in sections 3 and 6 is that they have to be read very carefully indeed.  For instance, section 3 does not provide that a video film should be refused a supply certificate simply because it depicts acts of gross violence or cruelty towards humans.  One must go further back in the wording of the section to find that the censor must be of the opinion that the work is unfit for viewing because it depicts acts of gross violence or cruelty towards humans or animals.</P>
      <P>I have already outlined the different types of films dealing with violence.  The point I am making here is that a very careful reading of the wording of the section is absolutely essential, reading it as a whole and not piecemeal.</P>
      <P>There are two points I want to emphasise particularly in relation to the criteria to be applied by the official censor.  There is, first, the ground stated in sections 3 (1) (b) and 6 (1), that a work depicts acts of gross violence or cruelty, which is different from the two grounds stated in section 3 (1) (a) &mdash; conduciveness to crime and depravity &mdash; in that the depiction of gross violence or cruelty itself is to be a ground for banning a video work, provided that the depiction is so bad as to render the work unfit for viewing, whereas the other grounds depend on the effect that viewing of the work would be likely to have on the behaviour of its viewer.  In other words, the depiction of gross violence or cruelty may have a general degrading effect on people even though it may not necessarily be likely to cause them to imitate the violence or cruelty depicted, or otherwise to conduce to crime or immoral behaviour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second point I would make is that the violence or cruelty depicted must be gross violence or cruelty.  Obviously it is difficult, in legislation of this kind, to satisfy all points of view but I am convinced that the words &ldquo;gross violence or cruelty&rdquo; constitute the most appropriate <Col N="1855" /> test.  To say only &ldquo;violence or cruelty&rdquo;&mdash; even with the condition that the video work must be unfit for viewing &mdash; seems to me to be a feeble test and one too vague to apply in the present context. The word &ldquo;gross&rdquo; serves to convey the idea that the violence or cruelty is depicted in a way which, by any reasonable standards, should be regarded as inexcusable.  This appears to me to be the correct test.</P>
    <P>I might now refer to the amendments specifically.  I will begin with amendment No. 8 in the names of Deputies De Rossa and others which seeks to change section 3 (1) (a).  I do not accept that the wording proposed in the amendment constitutes an improvement on the existing wording. In so far as the wording relates to incitement or hatred, Deputies will be aware that a Bill to prohibit incitement or hatred on grounds of race, religion or nationality is at present on the Order Paper.  The purpose of that Bill is to put on the Statute Book one of the measures necessary to enable this country to ratify the UN Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.</P>
    <P>Under the Bill it will be an offence to distribute, show or play a recording of visual images or sounds that are threatening, abusive or insulting and are intended or are likely to stir up hatred on the grounds specified.  Thus, the stirring up of racial, religious or national hatred by means of the distribution, showing or playing of videos will be covered in the incitement legislation.  Incitement to hatred on any other ground or against any particular named group would be outside the scope of what I am trying to achieve in the incitement to hatred Bill and I would regard a provision on incitement to hatred on any ground as being totally unnecessary in the context of this Bill, as well as being outside its scope.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 9 in the name of Deputy Colley will not be any great improvement on the section as drafted. Under the section as drafted the official censor has to consider whether the viewing of the video work would be likely to cause persons to commit crimes whether by inciting or encouraging them to do <Col N="1856" /> so.  The amendment would require the censor to consider whether the viewing of the work would incite or encourage them and so on.  But the censor is not a clairvoyant, and surely the natural question for him to ask himself is &ldquo;would this work be likely to incite viewers, to cause people to commit crimes?&rdquo;&mdash; not &ldquo;would it incite them?&rdquo; A censor could not approach it with that sort of certainty. How would a censor know that something would incite someone to violence?  A censor would know that it might be likely to incite people but he would not know that it would incite them.  That is why the word &ldquo;likely&rdquo; is a more practical approach.</P>
    <P>As regards amendment No. 10 which proposes replacing &ldquo;any&rdquo; with &ldquo;grossly&rdquo; at line 8 of page 6, the words &ldquo;indecent&rdquo; or &ldquo;obscene&rdquo; have to be read in the context of the subsection as a whole.  This requires that the censor must be of the opinion that the work is unfit for viewing because the viewing of it would tend, by reason of the inclusion in it of any obscene or indecent matter to deprave or corrupt persons who might view it. Accordingly the word &ldquo;grossly&rdquo; is unnecessary as it is already a requirement that the obscene or indecent matter would tend to deprave or corrupt viewers.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 11 proposes to delete &ldquo;depicts&rdquo; and replace it with &ldquo;incites&rdquo;. This would alter completely the purpose of this subparagraph.  As I have already said, the portrayal of acts of gross violence or cruelty towards humans or animals would be sufficient for the refusal of a supply certificate if the censor was of the opinion that that made the work unfit for viewing.  Some videos are so horrific in this regard that the wording of the subparagraph as it stands is clearly necessary. Accordingly, I am convinced that a change should not be made.</P>
    <P>Deputy Taylor's amendment, as outlined this morning by Deputy Higgins has a close resemblance to section (2) (2) of the British Video Recording Act, 1984. <Col N="1857" /> There is no special merit in the British provisions as compared with ours.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no special merit in their wording over ours.  Perhaps the chief difference in substance is that the amendment requires that the video work should depict gross violence etc. &ldquo;to a significant extent&rdquo; but this is unnecessary in our Bill, because the same purpose, that of giving the censor a reasonable discretion to consider the extent of the possible harmful effect of the video work is served in our Bill by the requirement that the censor must &ldquo;be of the opinion that the work is unfit for viewing&rdquo; because of the objectionable feature in question.  If the work contains the objectionable feature only to an insignificant extent, the censor could not ban it under the Deputy's amendment, although he might recommend cuts in a doubtful case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnneMarieColley" hpid="Miss Colley Miss Colley">
      <NameTxt>Miss Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Minister's view that differs between violence portrayed in a film or video for the sake of violence, and violence which is incidental to a general moral view which is taken by the film.  One can think of many films containing severe violent scenes which reinforce the moral view the film takes. To differentiate between those and films which portray violence for its own sake is essential in this legislation.  Films that depict violence for the sake of violence are the ones this Bill is intending to remove from circulation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The difficulty I have with this Bill is not the thrust of the section but whether it can be enforced in its present form.  The only words causing difficulty are those words &ldquo;would be likely to.&rdquo; I differ with the Minister when he says that my amendment would impose a duty on the censor which would mean that he must express a certainty about the video and its incitment or encouragement to commit a crime or to avoid detection and so on. The censor is required to be certain.  In his role he is required to make a decision with regard to films in relation to whether <Col N="1858" /> a film is suitable for a 15 year old or an 18 year old or whatever.  The censor must be certain about his decision because it will be implemented.  If we are to differentiate between films which portray violence for the sake of violence and those that portray violence simply as an incidental to the moral view being taken in the film the censor should be entitled to look for elements in the film which incite or encourage people to commit crimes.  That should be the thrust of his searching of the film.  If the section is more loosely defined the censor does not know on what criteria to judge.  If the end result that the Minister and the Department want is to remove from circulation films which incite people to commit crimes, why not just say it instead of beating around the bush and leaving things wide open at every level at which decisions will be taken, first with the censor, then moving on to the appeals board and to the courts?  I can see that happening.  At least if the censor is definitely looking for elements in a film which will incite a person to commit crimes he knows what he is about, the distributors know what they are about and the difficulties are reduced.  The mind boggles at the kind of claims that could be made.</P>
    <P>Deputies have said in this debate that the present Film Censor is somebody they would entrust with the kinds of tasks involved in this Bill.  They have not had any problems with the Film Censor nor with his decisions since he has been appointed.  However, we do not know what sort of person will be in that job in the future.  We must ensure in this legislation that the wishes of the Oireachtas which represent the wishes of the people are as closely as possible represented in the legislation.  If we leave the section as it is, we could find that our wishes will not be upheld, that they will be distorted and watered down, or that our wishes will be increased beyond what we intended.  We should not leave open that possibility.  We should be specific.  If we do not want people to be incited or encouraged to commit crimes we should say that and not introduce the element of <Col N="1859" /> uncertainty where the words &ldquo;would be likely to&rdquo; are introduced.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Other speakers have said that this is the very heart of the Bill and I quite agree.  It is something that must be got right.  It is also the section with which I am least happy.  A number of its assumptions are very questionable. I think it is possible to reconcile some of the arguments that have been made within what one might call a minimalist specificity.  By that I mean that the whole thrust of this section should not be such as to create the impression that a kind of moral dictionary had been written which had been handed to the censor and that now the censor would take decisions of taste and, indeed, moral decisions that, in a way, allowed the viewing public and the discretionary adult public to abdicate entirely from decisions of taste or of a moral kind.  It is in that sense that I am using the phrase that I favour a minimalist approach.</P>
      <P>If one can say that, one is not contradicting, either, the possibility of being specific within a minimalist approach. Here I come immediately to the point being made by Deputy De Rossa.  The disadvantage of the present formulation is that it is generally vague and at the same time does not meet any of the real concerns.  What I mean by being specific within a minimalist approach in this section is that there are things that have been mentioned.  For example, amendment No. 8 in the names of Deputy De Rossa and other Deputies, includes the phrase &ldquo;would be likely to cause persons to commit crimes, by inciting violence, or by stirring up hatred against any group of persons on account of their race, nationality, religion, gender or sexual orientation...&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have only one quibble with my colleagues on this side of the House both Deputy De Rossa and Deputy Colley.  It is in relation to a point I had made earlier. Frankly, I am not impressed by any of what I have heard from the Minister of State or the Minister for Justice in relation to answering any point about <Col N="1860" /> causality.  The published reports in the seventies in the United States and later in Britain and a number of other countries have clearly rejected a causality thesis for the idea of depicted material being causally related to crime.  There is but one report that sustains such a view and that is a mid-eighties report heavily influenced by the moral Right under the Reagan Presidency which had a blunderbuss approach towards what it saw was the corruption of morals by pornographic materials in the United States. What the people who avoid these arguments are missing is that the nature of the visual medium is that its formative influence on attitude and orientation is an accumulative process and it is as much subliminal as direct.  In fact, it is far more subliminal.</P>
    <P>Let us declare a hypothetical vacancy in the censorship office for a moment and say we are handing the censor this document on which he is supposed to operate.  No doubt he will put it on the wall, look at it and see the words, &ldquo;would be likely to cause persons to commit crimes&rdquo;.  What is there to guide him in this?  The Minister of State might convey this to my good friends in the Department with whom I have had a lot in common for nearly 20 years on this issue of the study of the nature of crime in Ireland for which there is the thinnest research. I have been working in this field since 1969.  We have the least amount of evidence on the nature of the committing of crimes.  There is nothing to guide anybody in relation to crimes of sexual violence. They have not been studied.  The censor asks himself if a video would be likely to cause a person to commit a crime.  With respect to him, everybody can have an opinion on that.  I know people who say that &ldquo;Dallas&rdquo; and &ldquo;Falcon Crest&rdquo; are deeply corrupting, in a more sinister way, of the social values of the Irish public and I listen to these people.</P>

      <P>And &ldquo;Neighbours&rdquo; I <Col N="1861" /> shall not go down that road of what might possibly provoke or influence attitudes.</P>
      <P>Let us be blunt about it, that is unworkable. We come to the phrase &ldquo;whether by inciting or encouraging...&rdquo;.  I do not go along entirely with the arguments that the material must directly incite or encourage because I know that the nature of the visual medium is not of that kind. One does not have to have a person saying &ldquo;Go on and do it&rdquo;.  It would be bad television, bad visual material.  The nature of the medium is one that is indirect and formative rather than direct. Why these assumptions are being dragged in, I do not know.  I would prefer something minimalist but adequate, that did not create the impression that any Bill or office of the State, including the censor, can remove personal responsibility from adults at different levels of vulnerability, sophistication and literacy but within that minimalist approach there should not be such vagueness that it could mean anything.</P>
      <P>Let us take the position of a future conservative censor.  He has some material submitted to him.  The moral entrepreneurs take off after him, creating a sense of moral panic around a particular film and saying that people will be dragging their innocent children to see it. Even if you put a label of a film as suitable for over eighteens, someone will tell you that their ten year old child wept and was corrupted for life by that film.  They will organise meetings and invite daft public representatives to listen to them.  The poor censor, having been clobbered once, will have this guiding bible that the easiest way out of difficulty is simply to ban as much as possible in that area.  The hair literally stood on my head at the Minister's reply that in preparing this section he had a look at the Censorship of Publications Act of 1929, amended in 1967.</P>

      <P>You have, indeed.  I, unfortunately, have looked at the 1929 <Col N="1862" /> Act and the Oireachtas debates surrounding it.  All I can say is that I congratulate the present Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Lenihan, for realising in 1967 that the shutters might be opened and the national must let out to some small degree.  The idea of looking at the legislation of 1929 is singularly unconvincing.</P>
      <P>Deputy De Rossa's point is that they want to have it both minimalist and sufficient. You must surely realise that the greatest real lobby, those who do not want damaging material are people who are worried about violence against, particularly, women and children.  Why not accommodate some of that by some of the formulations that have been suggested? I would not be able to recommend to the Labour Party that they should support this section or these wordings without the amendments that have been tabled being very seriously addressed.  As it stands, I do not think that I could recommend that the section be supported.</P>

      <P>It is very nice to have the opportunity of introducing this very important Supplementary Estimate which is for an additional sum of £22.836 million which is offset by additional receipts of £5.1 million and savings on various subheads totalling £17.735 million. The net amount to be voted, therefore, is a token sum of £1,000.</P>
      <P>The main items where additional expenditure arise are farm improvement programme, additional grant-in-aid for Teagasc, special premium on exports of beef to the United Kingdom and general disease control and eradication.</P>
      <P>On the capital side, I am providing an extra £8 million under subhead L. 1.  This subhead covers the various schemes aimed at encouraging on-farm investment as well as such measures as the young farmers installation premium and the western package.  The £8 million is being provided to accelerate clearance of all the outstanding grants due under those schemes.  As Deputies know, because of the limitations of the funds available there have been delays in the payment of those grants.  Not only will all these arrears now be cleared but in future grants will be paid as they arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In seeking this extra £8 million from Government I was particularly conscious of the fact that capital works undertaken by farmers by way of new buildings and <Col N="1864" /> improvements are extremely valuable in creating employment in rural areas. Farmers continue to plough a good deal of their income into these kinds of activity and I am glad to say that the indications are that investment has been very bouyant this year.  As well as reflecting the buoyancy of farm incomes generally, this situation is a clear expression of confidence by farmers in the future of the industry.</P>
    <P>Much of the current farm investment is going into the provision of facilities for control of pollution from farm waste. This is a welcome trend in view of the incidents of river pollution and fish kills in the past.  Not only did those incidents do serious damage to the rural environment but they also damaged our image abroad.  That image of an open, pollution-free rural environment from which we produce pure, natural and wholesome food is one of the most powerful marketing tools we have for boosting sales of our farm products.  Farmers themselves now recognise that fact and indeed it is a tribute to their sense of responsibility that incidents of river pollution were very few during 1988.  It is clear that while the country benefits in many respects from the favourable green image we have throughout the world &mdash; for example in the areas of tourism and industrial investment &mdash; the main risk from any erosion of that image attaches to our food exports.</P>
    <P>The very generous rates of grant now available in disadvantaged areas for animal housing and for provision of waste storage and anti-pollution facilities are a powerful incentive to farmers to make those investments.  These high rates of grant became possible when I succeeded earlier this year in securing a 70 per cent rate of EC recoupment under the revised western package.  Apart from enabling grants of 45 per cent to 55 per cent to be paid, that rate of recoupment was a significant breakthrough in the context of the increased structural funds that will be accruing to us.  Incidentally, the package we have been negotiating for the last few days in Brussels will have further evidence of that rate of recoupment when it is concluded.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1865" /> Turning to the main non-capital items, I am providing additional grant-aid of £8 million for Teagasc &mdash; the Agriculture and Food Development Authority.  As Deputies will recall, the Government's objective in setting up Teagasc was to ensure that by combining our agricultural research, training and advisory services we would establish a strong single agency for the effective delivery of the support services vital to the agriculture and food sectors.  The critical importance of these sectors was again underlined by the recent Teagasc report that agricultural output is set to exceed £3 billion this year, for the first time.</P>
    <P>It will be recalled that I provided in the Teagasc legislation for priority to be given to the training of young farmers and to food research.  In addition, I left the House in no doubt about the commercial orientation which the new Authority would be expected to have.  Good intentions alone, of course, are not enough.  I, therefore, appointed as members of the Authority a team of highly motivated people with excellent credentials.  I took the view that only a high-calibre Authority could provide an efficient and cost-effective service relevant to the present and future needs of those sectors.  I am particularly pleased by the manner in which the chairman and his colleagues have set about the task of welding the existing services into a dynamic organisation which will be geared to play a pivotal role in developing the Delors philosophy, involving the development of family farm units, the enhancement of rural society and the preservation of the environment.  This will benefit not only the rural community but our economy as a whole.</P>
    <P>With increased farm income and the development of new market outlets, the great challenge facing Teagasc is to build on the impetus created by these developments so that we can realise our aim of being a dominant force in world markets.</P>
    <P>I expect to have the Authority's detailed proposals on the reorganisation of the services very shortly.  I know &mdash; and have been impressed by &mdash; the members' willingness to explore all avenues in their <Col N="1866" /> efforts to meet the Government's objectives in establishing Teagasc.  I have indicated many times in the House that the Authority would not lack essential funds and I am now happy to deliver on that commitment by providing an additional £8 million this year under subhead B. 4.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the ESRI survey recently published which stated that 40 per cent of young entrants to farming had no educational qualifications and that a further 40 per cent had only group or intermediate certificates.  This gives a false impression although I am not accusing the authors of intending to do so.  The figures in the report relate to a period up to 1982 and the position has changed dramatically since then.  The report is six years out of date and that should have been noted in the comments which following its publication.  Of the 2,000 young people entering agriculture annually, about 90 per cent participate in comprehensive training programmes run by Teagasc and of those over 60 per cent have leaving certificates.  A further 30 per cent have intermediate or group certificates, leaving under 10 per cent with no qualifications.  I hope this will get at least as much publicity as the facts relating to 1980 or 1981 which caused so much concern and reaction.</P>
    <P>Teagasc have a first-class vocational programme for young farmers, principally the three year certificate in farming course.  The introduction of this course &mdash; and the fruit it has so obviously borne in the meantime &mdash; is one of ACOT's finest achievements.  I have every confidence that Teagasc will prove equally innovative in the services it will provide to agriculture.</P>
    <P>The £3 million provided for under subhead L. 7 is necessary to enable payment of that amount in variable premium on beef exports to the United Kingdom.</P>
    <P>Irish exports of cattle and beef to the United Kingdom qualify for benefit under the UK variable premium scheme. These payments are made directly by the UK authorities to my Department calculate the amounts payable to individual meat factories.  It is now estimated that receipts <Col N="1867" /> from the UK authorities in 1988 will reach £16 million, an increase of £3 million on the original estimate.  There are a number of reasons for this increase, the principal ones being a higher level of beef exports to the United Kingdom than was originally anticipated and a fall in the value of the Irish pound against sterling. The additional £3 million now being sought is balanced by corresponding higher receipts from the UK Government under subhead M. 25.</P>
    <P>Under subhead C. 3, which relates to general disease control, it is necessary to make special provision for an extra sum of £2.2 million.  This arises out of the very rigid policy which we in this country have followed down through the years in order to keep the country free of exotic animal diseases.  Let me assure the House that we will continue to folow that very rigid policy because of our unique reputation in the area of animal health control.  The kind of diseases I am talking about are, for example, foot and mouth disease, swine fever, Newcastle disease in poultry, and so on.  These highly dangerous diseases are scheduled as class A diseases under the Diseases of Animals Act.  They are exotic to this country and the fact that we are free of them gives us an exceptionally high health status for trade purposes.  This status guarantees the access of our meat and dairy products to the most demanding &mdash; in terms of health standards &mdash; importing countries all over the world.</P>
    <P>In order to maintain that status, we follow a policy of immediate compulsory slaughter of animals or birds whenever we get an outbreak of one of the scheduled diseases and in such cases full compensation is paid for the animals or birds slaughtered.</P>
    <P>Avian influenza is a scheduled class A disease and, following the policy I have just outlined, when outbreaks of this disease were encountered in County Monaghan in 1983 and 1984 the flocks involved were duly slaughtered compulsorily. Since then the matter of compensation has been in dispute with the flock owners concerned.  The dispute hinged round the precise value that <Col N="1868" /> should be placed on breeding stocks.  The flock owners were dissatisfied with the level of compensation offered to them and decided to institute court proceedings for a very much higher sum.  In the event, the matter was settled prior to the court proceedings and to the satisfaction of both parties.  The sum being provided now represents the outcome of that settlement.</P>
    <P>I should say that we have been very fortunate in that we suffer very few outbreaks of class A diseases and up to now we have managed to cope with them very effectively whenever they have occurred. Such outbreaks of disease as have occurred, like the one for which funds are being provided in this Estimate, have been quickly identified, contained and eliminated.  The relatively small cost to the Exchequer in such cases is a small price to pay for preservation of our disease free status.</P>
    <P>I would like to reiterate the importance of total co-operation from all sections of the community, particularly from people coming into the country at airports and other points of access.  I was very conscious of this today.  People may take these notices from my Department as matters of routine but they are not.  They are very important notices meant to guarantee a very unique health status. We have enjoyed the co-operation of the public at large and the farming community, but it is vitally important that that co-operation continues, particularly over the Christmas period.</P>
    <P>It must be said, however, that with the ever-increasing volume of movement between here and Europe &mdash; both of people and of goods &mdash; the risk of introducing disease is greater than ever.  Simultaneously the size of production units is tending to increase and that has cost implications when it comes to compensation. We cannot, therefore, relax our customary vigilance at ports and elsewhere or fail to take every legitimate precaution to avoid introducing disease.</P>
    <P>The additional provision of £700,000 under subhead K4. is required to meet payments due to the land bond fund in respect of land acquired by the Land <Col N="1869" /> Commission.  These payments represent the difference between the cost of servicing the bonds and the total receipts from the use of the land and were underestimated in the 1988 Estimates.</P>
    <P>I would like to draw special attention also to other items in the Supplementary Estimate.  The first is the provision of £0.5 million to the Racing Board under subhead H. 3.  This amount is being provided in 1988 as an incentive towards the refurbishment and improvement of racecourses throughout the country.  The allocation is a tangible indication of the Government's support for the racing industry and of the extremely valuable role which racing plays in attracting and entertaining visitors to this country.</P>
    <P>Most of the £0.5 million has been allocated to Fairyhouse racecourse which has now been brought up to a standard as a centre for national hunt racing that rivals the best known racing centres elsewhere. Smaller grants are being allocated to a number of smaller racecourses around the country to encourage them to carry out the improvements that will provide a more comfortable environment and better facilities for their patrons.  By doing this, these smaller courses can build up better attendances of visitors and punters alike.</P>
    <P>The other item is the provision of £55,000 under subhead H. 4 to the Equestrian Federation of Ireland towards the cost of sending a national showjumping team to the Olympic Games in Seoul. The House will recall that the Government intervened to guarantee this sum when it became apparent that there would be no prospect otherwise of having a team in Seoul.  The Government considered that for Ireland &mdash; the country recognised worldwide as the home of good horses &mdash; not to have a team at the Olympics would be a very serious omission indeed.  A number of the interests associated with the horse industry supported that view.</P>
    <P>It has been said, of course, that our team did not do all that well in Seoul. That is a point of view but considering the rushed preparation and the non-availability of some good horses at the time, <Col N="1870" /> the team faced an enormous challenge. The important thing is that an Irish team was there.  I believe lessons can be learned from this year's experience and that we have every opportunity to be much better geared for Barcelona in 1992.</P>
    <P>The programme for the development of the non-thoroughbred horse industry which I introduced recently and which has been very well received all round will, I believe, provide a solid foundation for the longer term production of good horses.</P>
    <P>Under subhead L. 10, a sum of £160,000 is being provided to meet expenditure in the current year on the Government's pilot programme for integrated rural development.  This programme was launched last October in a number of specially selected areas and will operate for a trial period of two years. In the light of the experience we shall gain a decision will then be made as to whether the programme should be extended.</P>
    <P>Special co-ordinators have been appointed in all but one of the pilot areas. Recruitment is under way to fill the outstanding post and a co-ordinator will be appointed to the remaining area &mdash; south Kerry &mdash; as soon as possible after Christmas.  The task of these co-ordinators is to assist the local communities to draw up their own set of priorities and to facilitate them in bringing their plans to reality.</P>
    <P>I must emphasise that the programme does not establish any new grant-giving agency.  The objective is to encourage the community to make more effective use of the aids already available and the co-ordinators have been specially trained in this work.</P>
    <P>The Government's approach to integrated rural development is fully in line with emerging EC policy and our thinking is remarkably similar to what the Commission themselves had to say in the paper on &ldquo;The Future of Rural Society&rdquo; which they published recently.  Indeed, our initiative has attracted a lot of interest in Brussels and the Commission have <Col N="1871" /> indicated their willingness to make a contribution towards the cost of the programme. They will, of course, also learn from the experience we will gain in operating the pilot phase of the programme. And we ourselves will be in a favourable position to avail of the additional amounts soon to come on stream as a result of the new arrangements for the future operation of the EC's Structural Funds.</P>
    <P>Under subhead E. I am providing £142,000 for residual payments under the consumer subsidy schemes for liquid milk and butter, which were terminated on 1 January 1987.</P>
    <P>A sum of £79,000 is being provided under subhead G. for the winding up expenses of Bord na gCapall.  This winding up operation is continuing and the amount sought is required to pay the board's proven creditors without further delay.</P>
    <P>The Supplementary Estimate also takes account of additional receipts of £5.1 million under subhead M. for appropriations-in-aid. This is a net sum which also takes into account deficiencies in receipts under some headings.  The main excesses arise in receipts from the EC in respect of intervention stocks losses and additional receipts under the exchange rate guarantee scheme.  They also include offsetting additional receipts of £3 million already referred to in respect of the UK variable premium scheme, and additional EC receipts under the western drainage scheme of £917,000.</P>
    <P>The main deficiencies arise in respect of receipts from the EC in respect of market intervention and disadvantaged area schemes.  The drop in market intervention receipts is due primarily to lower stock levels than were originally anticipated. The reduction in receipts under the disadvantaged areas schemes is directly related to the level of 1987 payments under these schemes which reflected a drop in cattle numbers.</P>
    <P>I can confidently commend this Supplementary Estimate to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister here this afternoon.  I appreciate he has <Col N="1872" /> had three very exhausting days in Brussels and it was probably a special effort on his part that got him home in time for this Supplementary Estimate.  If he needs any strengthening of his resolve in relation to standing firm on the beef regime proposals, the New Zealand butter issue and so on, if I can help him in any way I will be delighted to do so. He has our support from this side of the House in standing firm and I hope he will come home with what the industry needs in those areas.</P>
      <P>In regard to the Supplementary Estimate before us, particularly one of the more controversial aspects of it, subhead B. 4, the extra £8 million for Teagasc, it may seem strange when I say that £8 million is totally inadequate.  The Minister will be expecting us to tell him it is totally inadequate, but has there ever been a case of a Government getting their figures so wrong as in the case of establishing Teagasc?  ACOT and AFT faced into 1988 with a 40 per cent cut in their budget.  A sum of £23 million odd was offered to them and subsequently to Teagasc when they were amalgamated. Now I understand that in a DPS Supplementary Estimate yesterday or the day before £3 million, the cost of the voluntary early retirement scheme, has been provided plus this £8 million.  The Minister will correct me if I am wrong. Therefore, effectively something over £11 million in Supplementary Estimates is going to Teagasc this week, £11 million on top of a budget of a mere £23 million. Nearly a 50 per cent increase was necessary in the Supplementary Estimate for such a major organisations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How could the Minister have got it so wrong at the beginning of the year?  There were very few other instances when so much money was involved in running an institution, an organisation, when a Minister had &mdash; perhaps &ldquo;audacity&rdquo; is the wrong word &mdash; the neck to come back and say, &ldquo;I was out by 50 per cent; I want another £11 million on top of £23 million&rdquo;.  Apart from how appallingly wrong the Minister and his Government have got the whole Teagasc scene, the Minister is still away below what he <Col N="1873" /> should be giving them.  Even with this £11 million Teagasc will be moving into next year with a deficit of £4 million from this year on top of a pay bill shortfall alone of £10 million plus another £1.25 million in administration shortfall.  They will start work on 1 January over £15 million short.</P>
    <P>A prominent economist stated earlier this year that there is inadequate recognition of the contribution the agriculture and food industry is making to our national economy.  Obviously, there is inadequate recognition by this Government and this Minister as the figures before us today testify.  Do I have to remind the Minister that the agriculture and food industry represents 27.6 per cent of total exports?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad I do not.  How could he have forgotten it when he was striking the Estimate for 1988?  How can he forget it when he is talking to Teagasc, understanding &mdash; I assume &mdash; the importance of that body to our agriculture and food industry?  Eighty-seven per cent of the raw material for the agriculture and food industry is home sourced.  For every £100 of exports generated by the manufacturing industry £54 is paid for in raw material imports.  Another £17 goes on profit repatriation, leaving a mere £29 out of every £100 worth of exports within the Irish economy for the manufacturing area.  Let the Minister contrast that, if he will, with every £100 of agricultural exports where imports account for a mere £18 with virtually no profit repatriation, leaving over £80 to our economy for every £100 worth of Irish exports.  In other words, where the import content and profit repatriation of industrial exports are taken into account the net export value of agriculture is equivalent to all our industrial exports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the 20 years 1960-80 we doubled agricultural output, quadrupled our use of fertilisers, drained a third of our farmland and modernised most of our farmyards &mdash; great achievements by any standards.  Now we are faced with market <Col N="1874" /> saturation problems, production controls, the elimination of surpluses, seta-side, extensification and, I am glad to say, an environmental awareness that imposes strict disciplines on all of us.</P>
    <P>The farming community continue to need advice, education and soundly based research more than ever.  They need help in the use of modern technology, increasing efficiency and competitiveness and the improvement of margins.  They need direction in relation to market led development to stay ahead of our competitors.</P>
    <P>Teagasc will have to continue to provide the answers for farmers and for a dynamic processing industry, backed by research with efficient monitoring service to ensure high quality exports.  The success of this enormous industry, most important in this country, is endangered and threatened by a Government who have failed to recognise the contribution our agriculture and food industry has made and can continue to make to our national economy.  Let the Minister not quote to me these interim figures we get from the Central Review Committee and the list of approved jobs.  I want real jobs, not lists of approved jobs, not lists of FEOGA and IDA grant-aided processing plants that are not yet on stream and that have a questionable source of product even when and if they come on stream.  I do not want to be told about the creation of new jobs which result in poaching other jobs, matched by redundancies in other plants.  A net increase in jobs, not an approved figure of jobs is what we are interested in.</P>
    <P>Let us look at the facts in relation to ACOT-AFT, now Teagasc.  Let us count them in pounds, shillings and pence which, if we are honest, we will admit is the way every farmer sees them. Johnstown Castle's research on alternative sources of nitrogen has saved Irish farmers over £15 million per annum. Johnstown's research on sulphur has indentified a million hectares of grassland which can increase production by 15 per cent or £75 million per annum for the <Col N="1875" /> expenditure of a mere £5 million on fertilisers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy and take that as a compliment.  The highly efficient, low cost production systems developed at Moorepark have been worth millions of pounds to dairy farmers. Research breakthroughs in silage preservation at Grange have saved farmers over £7 million per annum and have saved this country £12 million in imports. AFT's research on nutrition and feed formulation has increased pig production efficiency by 15 per cent &mdash; and they have needed it &mdash; a saving of £15 million per annum on feed costs.  Creagh, in County Mayo, continues to provide a vital service to the agricultural needs of our marginal land areas especially in relation to hill sheep, mixed stock systems, drainage, etc.  The Minister should not smile, it is extremely serious and he will be presented with a decision in the next day or two.  I think he will find them waiting on his desk over in Kildare Street when he gets a chance to look at them.</P>
      <P>Oak Park was responsible for Cara, the new seed potato, saving our historical seed potato industry from extinction. AFT's role in the £17 million mushroom industry has gone virtually unnoticed, let us be honest.  They were behind all the research and development there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Commentators have stated that the biggest gain for Ireland in the Single Market in 1993 will be the opportunity to develop our food industry.  None of us disagrees with that.  It follows that we should have an increase in jobs and wealth, using indigenously sourced raw materials.  Nobody can argue but that <Col N="1876" /> Teagasc have the most important role in this development.  The next few years are vital.</P>
    <P>What, then, are the preoccupations of this body, of eminent, skilled and experienced men and women working in Teagasc?  What are their occupations or preoccupations as we talk this afternoon? I will tell the House.  They should be developing the green cert for our young farmers, and I accept fully what the Minister has said in relation to the latest ESRI report.  The facts in that report are based on figures that are six to eight years out of date and I support fully the Minister's correction in the light of the misconception that might arise from that report.</P>
    <P>The green cert has to be developed even further for our young farmers.  We need new research programmes.  Is developing the analytical services for our food companies the preoccupation of these men and women in Teagasc at the moment and for the last few months?  No, it is not.  I will tell you what the major concern of these highly experienced and skilled people is; will even more of them now go under the voluntary early retirement scheme?  Do they wait until they are pushed out or shoved around the country, billetted to various research stations because of physical rationalisation of the centres or do they just wait until they become further demoralised?  The one effect of the Minister's initial Estimate for this year was to create such demoralisation that he probably increased the uptake in VER.  If that is what the Minister intended to do he has been successful, but he should have been honest, because compulsory redundancy, even if got at in that way, is not part of the <i>Programme for Recovery.</i> It is not part of the social partners' agreement.</P>
    <P>Teagasc is serving an industry that directly employs 200,000 people and servicing a gross output of more than £3 billion with enormous potential for growth.  They look to 1989 with an estimate of only £27.5 million.  The revised estimate for this year is £31 million but Teagasc will start next year with <Col N="1877" /> less than the revised estimate for this year.  When the Book of Estimates for next year was published I laughed at it &mdash; it is factually incorrect because of today's Supplementary Estimate &mdash; because I got the impression that there will be an increase next year of 19 per cent.  I hope that figure will be corrected by the Minister. I appeal to the Minister to ensure that no deficit is carried over to next year and, secondly, to bring the 1989 estimate for Teagasc in line with the revised 1988 estimate which, effectively, has been increased by 50 per cent.</P>
    <P>Dr. Pierce Ryan has stated that agricultural research and development must provide farmers, food processors and policy makers &mdash; that means the Minister and, hopefully, some of the rest of us at a later stage &mdash; with the knowledge needed to adjust the national and international economic forces in the future.  I should like to plead with the Minister to allow Teagasc to do that for all our sakes.</P>
    <P>I should like to raise a number of other interesting points in relation to this Supplementary Estimate.  I can be forgiven if I mention a point I raised on the Order of Business this morning.  I sought permission to raise on the Adjournment the shortfall in funding for the trip of our showjumpers to the Olympics in Seoul despite unequivocal promises by the Minister at a press conference on the Thursday of the Millstreet show.  At that conference the Minister promised to underwrite the shortfall.  The Government had intervened and insisted that a team be sent at a time when the equestrian authorities had decided otherwise. I have tabled parlimentary questions in regard to this matter; I have contacted the Minister's office on three occasions, raised the matter on the Order of Business this morning and, afterwards, spoke personally to the Taoiseach about it.</P>
    <P>I am delighted with the Minister's announcement today on the revised Supplementary Estimate, which is different from that issued in the last few days, increasing the grant from £40,000 to £55,000 for the EFI.  I should like to thank the Minister for that and to ask him to convey my thanks to the Taoiseach for <Col N="1878" /> his interest in this matter.  The shortfall would have caused major problems for the EFI, a body to which many equestrian organisations are affiliated.  If the extra money had not been paid the Cospoir grant to that organisation next year would have had to be used to pay bank overdrafts. Thanks to the interest of the Taoiseach and the Minister that organisation will be solvent next year and the many groups that cater for children and old people will be able to continue in operation.</P>
    <P>If I may be slightly mischievous I should like to make one point about this matter.  If one adds up the additional sum required, £17,736,000, and one adds up the figure under savings on subheads one gets a figure of £17,735,000 leaving a difference of £1,000.  However, unless my sums are wrong, the addition is incorrect. I should like to know if getting the sums wrong invalidates a Supplementary Estimate. The figures do not tally.  I can see why it has happened: it was because there was a change in the figure for the EFI between the announcement of the Order of Business and the commencement of the debate on this Estimate.  I hope we will not be told that the Supplementary Estimate has been invalidated because the figures are incorrect.</P>

Under subhead H. 3 &mdash; Grant-in-Aid to the Racing Board &mdash; £500,000, I should like to ask the Minister for an assurance that this new subhead will be included in the Book of Estimates next year.  In my view the hype of the Tourism Task Force has <Col N="1879" /> been foisted on the Department of Agriculture and Food and they will have to pay what we thought would be coming out of the £1 million the Tourism Task Force received.  I support this allocation and I appeal to the Minister to deliver a similar amount next year because many of our racecourses are below standard. The facilities at some of them are appalling. Horse racing is a tremendous tourist attraction.</P>

      <P>Under subhead C. 2. there are savings of £1,850,000 under the TB eradication scheme but this sum of money should go to increase the cost of compensation for reactors, particularly in the dairy and weanling sector.  There are savings under subhead D. 4., Bord Glas, of £160,000 but the total Estimate for Bord Glas this year was £168,000. It appears that they have spent £8,000 producing glossy literature and holding press conferences.  The Minister should tell us the truth in regard to this.  Under subhead L. 3., aid to less favoured areas, there is a saving of £1,600,000.  There is confusion as to what the Minister will or will not do in regard to an extension or reclassification of those areas.  The Minister should come clean on that issue. Nothing is being done and there is no <Col N="1880" /> specific application to extend or reclassify any area before the authorities in Brussels, despite all the waffle.

      <P>I should like to support the Minister in his efforts in Brussels. It is important that there should be a satisfactory outcome to those negotiations particularly in view of the importance to us of our beef industry.  It is important at this stage to reach a satisfactory conclusion in the Mulder case. When the House was debating the Second Stage of the Bill to amalgamate ACOT and AFT I suggested that that amounted to an effort to have an advisory and research service on the cheap.  I have been proved right.  I have never witnessed such a lack of enthusiasm and shortsighted approach to a fundamental arm of an industry that has a gross output of more than £3 billion.  The Government will not come up with 1 per cent of that figure for adequate advice, training and research.  There has been a lot of talk about the importance of the efficiency the industry requires and of the need for a properly funded organisation.  The requirement of £11 million is obviously not going to be met through the Supplementary Estimate.  I should like to ask the Minister how he proposes to deal with the projected deficit next year of between £12 million and £14 million.  Will this be an annual event?  Will we be asked to pass Supplementary Estimates annually?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not wish to get involved in a slagging match but it appears that the Minister is anti-research, anti-science and <Col N="1881" /> anti-training.  Those who watched the television programme &ldquo;Yes Minister&rdquo;, will be acquainted with the character Sir Humphreys, the senior civil servant who managed the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>It is time the Minister put the &ldquo;Sir Humphreys&rdquo; of the Department of Agriculture in his place because such people cannot be objective about Teagasc.  Such people are only interested in saving their own bacon at the expense of the people who are providing the service on the ground.</P>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister if the much publicised audit in the Department of Agriculture will be made public.  It is important, not only for the staff of the Department but to assure the public that there is no wastage or overstaffing, that that report is published.</P>
      <P>I have certain sympathies with this organisation because what is needed is a definite clear policy on agriculture and solutions to the major problems that are facing the different sectors.  Maybe then the new organisation could plan ahead.</P>
      <P>The obvious intention to halve the organisation is going to lead to a service for farmers who can afford it and is going to discriminate against the small and low-income farmers who need this service more than anybody else.  If we fail to invest in agriculture a large number of potentially viable farm businesses will cease to exist.</P>
      <P>The Government have a social obligation to try to maintain viability for smaller farmers.  If we do not increase our stock numbers it will be the larger and better off farmers who will end up with the limited supply resulting in small farmers being forced off the land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Research must have its own independent arm with its own budget to <Col N="1882" /> ensure a degree of continuity in the work programme.  It is important to ensure the efficient transfer of research results to the overall industry.  It is essential that the formal linkages between research and the advisory and training arms of Teagasc are established by way of specialists and extension.  Research is not a day to day business, consequently it is essential that the programme is properly planned and is carried out over a sufficient period to render the results meaningful.</P>
    <P>The programme must be relevant to the needs of the farming community and the industry in the years ahead, rather than a piecemeal response to day to day problems.</P>
    <P>The programme must reflect the general policy directions of the body over a given period.  There is a lot of talk about the new body being divided into regions. I would suggest that to avoid duplication, research should not be regionalised.  That does not apply to advice and training.</P>
    <P>Another area where the new body should take a more active role is the area of testing of sugar content and of tare of sugar beet.  The annual dissatisfaction in this area comes up at this time every year and while I accept that the BGA represent the farmers' interests in the sugar factories it is a totally unsatisfactory situation.</P>
    <P>I am aware of farmers achieving quite different results from independent testing of sugar content and tare and with all due respects to the BGA what goes on in the laboratories of the sugar company can only be correctly monitored by qualified people in this area.</P>
    <P>It is not uncommon this year to have tare contents up to 50 per cent.  I am aware of an individual case where it went as high as 64 per cent.  Because of the dissatisfaction the only way to restore confidence between the sugar company and the farmer is to have Teagasc take over this entire area.</P>
    <P>There are numerous good reasons Teagasc should not be under funded but I have not time to go into them now.  One topical area is that of pollution control.  I know from my own experience in Kilkenny, that the staff in Teagasc are <Col N="1883" /> over worked because of farmers' willingness to do everything that is physically and financially possible to correct this problem.  The whole area of pollution control is an added responsibility on Teagasc and for that reason we should not be penny pinching.</P>
    <P>The implications of a half baked research advice and training service are very serious.  It is vital for agriculture to develop and to be able to compete with the biggest and the best in Europe.</P>
    <P>There is only one other point I want to make and Deputy McCoy will deal with some other areas.  In relation to animal disease it is important that we should consider the possibility, despite the Minister's views, of importing calves into calf-to-beef cattle units because there is a shortage.  Controlled importation of calves would be a means of alleviating the problems.  At present we see unreal value for calves.  If we are to prepare for the future we should overcome this problem by importing now rather than later.  I will conclude because I know Deputy McCoy is anxious to intervene.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCoy</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Department of Agriculture and the Minister for the most responsible handling of a recent difficulty which arose in the poultry industry.  Under class A diseases I would ask him to consider, where he has had to make a special allowance this year, those who do not have to compulsorily slaughter but who did in the past two weeks in the interests of the industry and in the interests of the disease free status we all want maintained for Ireland.  These people will suffer a very severe financial loss.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the Common Agricultural Policy it is no wonder it is coming <Col N="1884" /> under much pressure when one sees many of the schemes operating to the benefit of fewer farmers each year, when we see the number of people in full time farming and those who are no longer able to get into farming because of quota restrictions being forced to go on the job market. In mainland Europe there is very strong questioning to why the Common Agricultural Policy should be supported when it is supporting fewer people each year. We have allowed go by the board some of the founding principles, such as keeping people on the land and also locating the production of various agricultural outputs in places where the natural resources are most conducive for growing them. In addition, we are now in the ludicrous situation of a set-aside in wheat in this country.  The EC is the largest importer in the world of feeding wheat but we in Ireland find we must ask our farmers not to grow wheat and in return we are to compensate them at the rate of £75 an acre, which is totally uneconomic.  On the other hand we are trying to develop a pig industry which is an alternative industry and we will require wheat to feed the pigs.  In other words, we will end up sending out our hard earned currencies to the world market to buy infeeds while we pay our own farmers £75 an acre to do nothing.  This is a counter productive measure and it will be detrimental for rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>In relation to food, which has to be the area of a way forward to compensate for the loss of employment inside the farm gate, there is no doubt that our environment must be correct because we suffer from distance from the market and insularity which does not help marketing in many respects.  We are being asked on all fronts to dismantle the support and the case we have made over the years for keeping Ireland a disease free country. This has enabled us to keep certain processed meats from the Irish market.  All these things are now coming under threat.  It will be very difficult for the Minister to play the game he was able to play heretofore.  We must create an environment for attracting international <Col N="1885" /> research and development to this country.</P>
    <P>In that regard we must get our patents area in order.  We signed the patents agreement in 1973 but as yet we have not ratified it.  New products need to be patented and a lot of money is spent on research.  We need to put this matter into perspective and we must stand by those who have established plants and are complying with proper controls.  Recently it was brought to my notice that 50 per cent of the confectionery made in this country is manufactured in plants which do not comply with proper controls.  This has caused problems for those who have spent money on research and who are complying with proper controls.  There are also problems in regard to the nonpayment of VAT on finished goods.  We must not allow the cowboy operators to lower standards and put our industry under a cloud.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>Being Labour Party spokesman on agriculture I am conscious of the myth or public perception that the Labour Party seem to be anti-agriculture and anti-farmer.  I want to positively dispel that myth and remind Deputies that a portrait of Michael Davitt hangs in the foyer of this House.  He was champion of the small family farmer and was recognised as a socialist.</P>
      <P>At the core of the Supplementary Estimate is the amount of money to be allocated to Teagasc, £8 million.  When the Bill establishing Teagasc was going through this House we sought to have explained how this agency was going to be funded.  This is now being done, in hindsight, to an inadequate degree.  I believe that training, advice and education are of importance in any industry, particularly agriculture.  The money being provided in this Supplementary Estimate, £8 million, is not going to allow adequate training and education to be provided and certainly an adequate amount of funding is not being made available to undertake the necessary research and development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because of earlier decisions and a decision to request only the amount <Col N="1886" /> stated in the Supplementary Estimate advice can no longer be made available to those farmers who are most in need of such advice.  Staff are not available to provide such advice and when they are in a position to do so they charge a fee for their services.  The new thinking seems to be that there are no free dinners any more and everybody must pay for what they receive.  There is a very large number of uneconomic farm holdings, in fact the largest producers, and it would be madness to say that such farmers would have to pay for any advice provided.  I am aware that Teagasc have adopted a system whereby such farmers would be able to get such advice free of charge but the reality is that the officers of Teagasc are under pressure to bring in money to fund their activities.  As a result of this many people have been put on the long finger and we now have a two-tiered system as a result of the Minister's earlier decision.</P>
    <P>Research and development and new technology are of primary importance and I am concerned at the lack of any clear policy directive being given to the national food centre from the Minister's Department.  They appear to be the masters of their own devices on a day-to-day basis without any clear policy directive being given to them.  This matter should be attended to by the Minister as quickly as possible as I believe that all areas of agricultural activity should be combined with those areas.</P>
    <P>In a recent statement the Minister referred to an increase in income of 15 per cent over last year for farmers but what the Minister did not say is that this was a 15 per cent increase on a previous low figure and that it did not apply across the board.  This increase in income was achieved in areas where money was being spent.</P>

There is devastation in rural areas and the working class in rural areas are emigrating. The Minister is presiding over this colossal scale of devastation, yet he comes into the House and paints a rosy picture and claims that there has been a 15 per cent increase in the incomes of farmers.</P>
      <P>I suggest that the Minister take a look at land structures and establish an agency along the lines of the old Land Commission which would be given teeth to tackle land structure problems to look also at the possibility of introducing a land tax, and to give the moneys raised to a land agency established to tackle land structure problems.  I will conclude on that point and thank the House for allowing me to divide my time with Deputy Kemmy.</P>

Unfortunately all too often in the past debates on agriculture have been confined largely to Deputies who give their full backing to the constant demands and pleas of farmers for handouts, price supports, subsidies and grants of all sorts.  This sort of all-embracing fellow feeling and their critical support of this country for the Common Agricultural Policy have done nothing whatsoever to tackle the real problems of agriculture in this country and in the Community as a whole.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I have to confess that I am shocked at the Minister's answer. Would the Minister not agree that at a time when Ireland's image abroad is unfortunately being damaged every day of the week by the continuing tragedy of the problems in Northern Ireland that it is essential for a Minister for Tourism to lead and to spearhead the fight to attract tourists to this country?  Will the Minister say why he has not made any of these visits abroad and also if he has joined in any joint ventures with his Northern Ireland counterpart in order to work together to sell this island abroad and to counteract the bad image we have?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that I am leading the drive for improved tourism in this country.  I answered the question specifically in the terms in which it was asked, about what happened since October and what my plans are.  I rely very heavily on the judgement of Bord Fáilte as to when a ministerial presence is profitable for their tourism drives and I am available to them every time that they so decide.  I want to make that quite clear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the Northern Ireland tourism link-up, there is a very good spirit <Col N="1890" /> of co-operation between the two tourism developments boards.  I have a very good relationship with the tourism people along the Border and as the Deputy and the House know the international fund for Ireland is specifically geared towards providing tourist facilities in that area which will be seen to be of mutual benefit both to the people in the Six Counties and to us.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has stated that he relies on Bord Fáilte but in view of the fact that Board Fáilte have repeatedly said that they and everyone else rely on the Minister to give the lead in tourism and in view of the targets set by the Government in their <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>&mdash;these targets were not set by Bord Fáilte because they do not have the authority to set them&mdash; surely it is the Minister's responsibility to lead this battle and it is he who should be abroad selling this country.  Will the Minister reconsider his decision and instead of staying at home for six months during the crucial time when we should be selling the country abroad will he consider undertaking some major promotional trips in the next three months?</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Tourism and Transport the latest information available to his Department on (a) the number of tourists and (b) tourist revenue in 1988 so far; the way in which this compares with 1987; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Data on tourist numbers are available for the first nine months of 1988.  In this period, Central Statistics Office estimates show overseas visitor numbers at 1.897 million, an increase of 228,000 or 13.7 per cent on the corresponding period in 1987.  Bord Fáilte market estimates, which include traffic coming via Northern Ireland, show an increase of about 13 per cent.</P>
      <P>In so far as tourism revenue is concerned, the latest information available from the CSO relates to the first six months of the year.  In this period, out-of-State tourism revenue, including carrier receipts, is estimated at £296 million, an increase of £28 million or 10.4 per cent on the corresponding period last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that the figure given for revenue accruing from foreign tourists is very much below what was estimated in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> would he also agree that because of the intransigence some move must be made on both sides to end the rod licence dispute which is having an effect on the tourism industry?</P>
      <P>Will the Minister comment on the fact that the target given in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> for jobs in the tourism area is 25,000 jobs but he recently gave a figure of 12,000 jobs and the central review committee on the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> said that it would be a total of 5,000 jobs?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>First, with regard to revenue, as I have indicated revenue has increased by 10.4 per cent.  With regard to job targets the Deputy rightly pointed out that the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> outlined a 25,000 job objective. We are well on the way to achieving that objective because that 25,000 job objective was in the context of the five-year programme.  We, and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, are confident that we will achieve our objective.  The third point the Deputy made was in relation to the road licence dispute.  The House knows that I have been very anxious that this dispute should be resolved and I am <Col N="1892" /> confident that before the angling season of 1989 starts in earnest this problem will be resolved.  As the House knows this is the responsibility of my colleague, the Minister for the Marine, and he is making every effort to resolve that dispute.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Tourism and Transport if he will outline his policy in relation to (a) passenger handling and (b) cargo handling at the State airports; whether the time is right to open up competition in passenger handling; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 3 and 26 together.</P>
      <P>Aer Rianta as my agent are responsible for the management of the State airports, and passenger and cargo handling at the State airports is carried out by companies appointed for that purpose by Aer Rianta.  The policy in relation to passenger and cargo handling is to provide services for all carriers using the State airports which are efficient and reasonably priced and which facilitate the continuation of the extremely high operational and safety standards which exist at the airports.</P>
      <P>With regard to passenger handling at Dublin Airport a detailed and comprehensive review of passenger handling arrangments at the airport was carried out by my Department in conjunction with Aer Rianta in 1987.  As a result of this review new passenger handling arrangements were introduced at Dublin Airport in January 1988.</P>
      <P>The main features of the new arrangements involve:</P>
      <P>(i)  a formal agreement between Aer Rianta and Aer Lingus under which the latter have been granted sole rights to engage in passenger handling for third party carriers for a period of three years;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(ii)  a substantial reduction ranging <Col N="1894" /> to over 30 per cent depending on aircraft type on the published charges for passenger handling which previously applied;</P>
    <P>(iii)  a formal mechanism under which carriers who are unhappy with the standard or cost of the service offered or provided by Aer Lingus can appeal to Aer Rianta.  The responsibility of Aer Rianta in this regard is to ensure that the Aer Lingus service is efficient and reasonably priced and their findings on any appeal are binding on Aer Lingus;</P>
    <P>(iv)  continuation of the right of any carrier to engage in handling its own aircraft;</P>
    <P>(v)  permission for a carrier already engaged in self handling to handle for any carrier for whom he acts as general sales agent;</P>
    <P>(vi)  carriers engaged in self handling may be allowed by Aer Rianta to co-operate in relation to the sharing of equipment, etc.</P>
    <P>Many of the features of the revised arrangements at Dublin Airport are entirely new and I am satisfied that they represent a significant improvement on the situation which existed previously.</P>
    <P>In the case of Shannon and Cork Airports a comprehensive examination of passenger handling arrangements is now being carried out by Aer Rianta, following an earlier request from me to the company that the position at these airports should also be reviewed.  I am advised by Aer Rianta that this examination is now well advanced and that the company expect to be in a position to submit recommendations to me on this matter in the near future.  When I receive these recommendations they will be examined as a matter of urgency by my Department.</P>
    <P>With regard to cargo handling at the State airports significant advances in this area have been achieved in the last two years.  A detailed review of the cargo handling arrangements and facilities at the airports was finalised by Aer Rianta <Col N="1895" /> with the assistance of a firm of consultants last year.  Arising from this review specific steps have now been taken by the company to upgrade and improve the cargo handling facilities at the State airports. These steps include:</P>
    <P>(a)  changes in work practices and upgrading of facilities to facilitate speedier and more efficient processing and clearance of freight;</P>
    <P>(b)  the provision of a 24-hour customs service for cargo clearance at Dublin Airport;</P>
    <P>(c)  construction of a new fast freight terminal at Dublin Airport which was opened in March of this year;</P>
    <P>(d)  the appointment of second cargo handlers at both Dublin and Shannon Airports;</P>
    <P>(e)  plans for the construction of new cargo warehouses at Dublin and Shannon Airports, work on which is expected to commence shortly;</P>
    <P>(f)  plans for the appointment of a second cargo handler at Cork Airport.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for a comprehensive reply.  Will he agree that the 30 per cent reduction for passenger handling services only came about because Ryanair were on the scene looking for the opportunity to do the passenger handling which has now been given to Aer Lingus?  Will the Minister undertake when the three-year period expires in two years' time that Ryanair and any other carrier will have a full and fair chance of getting that concessioin from Aer Rianta?  Competition should be strengthened and not weakened.  Will the Minister agree that the reduction was caused by Ryanair's coming in?  These regulations never existed until there was competition.  Will the Minister undertake that Ryanair and any other airline will get a fair opportunity to tender for this service?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>This deal behind closed doors stinks to high heaven.  Does the Minister condone this deal?  As Deputy Hussey has pointed out, Aer Lingus were able to reduce their charges by 30 per cent when there was a mention of competition. One can only imagine what profits they were making when they were getting the full whack.  Why does the Minister not terminate this agreement immediately and see to it that people are allowed to tender for ths lucrative contract?  Surely all airlines, particularly Irish airlines, are entitled to compete. Would the Minister not agree that there is obvious discrimination in this case?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not agree that this agreement should be terminated. Ryanair and Club Air applied to my Department for permission to engage in third party handling and they were given that permission.  Neither one nor the other would have been able to take on the full complement of passenger handling at Dublin Airport.  I am committed to an even playing field in competition for all airlines using Dublin Airport and for fair and open competition for such things as passenger handling by companies who are capable of carrying out the task.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Griffin</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Tourism and Transport if, against the background of the completion of the Single European Market, he will indicate his Department's plans for the development of the maritime transport sector especially in respect of Dublin, Cork, Waterford, Limerick and Rosslare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The development of the maritime transport sector and of the ports mentioned, with the exception of Rosslare, is the responsibility of the Minister for the Marine.</P>
      <P>As regards Rosslare, I am informed by Córas Iompair Éireann, who operate the port, that their present development programme at the harbour will be completed in time for the 1989 tourist season.  The programme includes a new passenger terminal building, a customs clearance building and coach hall, a new rail platform, covered walkways between ships' sides on the pier and the terminal building, the reclamation of 6.5 acres from the sea for vehicle parking and the erection of a new breakwater.  These facilities will ensure that the terminal compares very favourably with those at other leading European roll-on/roll-off ports.</P>
      <P>Plans are being drawn up by CIE for further major developments at the harbour and I expect to receive them shortly. Developments at Rosslare in the light of those proposals will be submitted for consideration for assistance from the European Community Structural Funds in the context of the completion of the Single European Market.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanGriffin" hpid="Mr. Griffin Mr. Griffin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Griffin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed that the Minister did not answer the question as put to him.  An information leaflet issued by his Department dealing with the deregulation of transport in the Single European Market referred to the essence of the question I put down.  Is the Minister <Col N="1898" /> not aware that as we speak Irish industrialists in the South are totally disadvantaged <i>vis-à-vis</i> their Northern counterparts to the extent of 16 per cent and that is even before the channel tunnel is completed or, indeed, the introduction of the TGV high speed trains which are proposed to travel in Europe at speeds in excess of 200 kilometres per hour?  Would the Minister inform me if he is in support of the EC Transport Infrastructural Fund which Transport Ministers hope to set up in Europe, with a budget of approximately £485 million?  Will the Rosslare project be funded from that proposed EC transport infrastructural fund?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The latter point is quite a complicated one and I will take it first. In the European Council there are some very strong objectors to any separate transport infrastructural fund.  The result has been that for a number of years certain funding has been available on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis for transport infrastructure.  As the Deputy mentioned, we are fully in support of a transport infrastructural fund but we have not been able to win a case in the Council because some people are totally opposed to such a fund.  With regard to the Deputy's reference to the substance of my reply, I want to point out that I replied accurately to the question in so far as it refers to my Department.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>In June 1987 the Cuban authorities indicated that they had an interest in negotiating an air services agreement with Ireland which would make provision for Cuban airlines to operate services to and from Shannon airport.  My Department responded to the effect that Ireland would be very happy to negotiate such an agreement.</P>
      <P>Since then I have had discussions with Cuban officials in the matter and I have confirmed that Ireland will be happy to conclude an air services agreement and that I am prepared to authorise Cuban airlines to commence services at Shannon in advance of a formal agreement should they wish to do so.  A request for rights to operate such a service is awaited.  In the meantime, discussions about the terms of an air services agreement are expected to commence early in 1989.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>They have not given any indication so far.  I had a visit from a Cuban official some time ago but there were some internal problems that delayed any advance in this area.

      <P>We would not be promoting the idea were it not for the fact that we are expecting to get benefits from it.  It links in, to a certain extent, with the position regarding Aeroflot but there is a slight problem.  Cuban airlines may get their fuel from Aeroflot at Shannon but Aeroflot are anxious to get hard currency for all sales there.  At present Cubana are more interested in some form of barter which is difficult in the circumstances.</P>

      <P>I was not specifically referring to tour operators or travel agents but to State companies who seem to think they have a right to put private operators out of business by charging totally uneconomic fares.  Is the Minister aware that, <Col N="1902" /> for instance, CIE bus fares from places such as Cork and Galway cost £5 return? In my opinion, and in the opinion of many people, that is purely to put private operators out of business.  The economic fare is not £5, it is about £15 or £17.</P>

I want to put on the record of the House also my appreciation &mdash; as the Deputy herself has done &mdash; of the fact that this substantial investment research is being undertaken by ITIC.

    <Speaker pid="PatrickOMalley" hpid="Mr. P. O'Malley Mr. P. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Tourism and Transport if he considers that further reductions in air access fares from continental Europe will be a major factor in ensuring that the targets for tourism set out in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> will be attained; the action he is taking at EC level in that regard; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Air fares from continental Europe to Ireland have been reduced significantly in the last two years.  For example, the lowest fare from Paris in summer 1988 was 20 per cent lower than that in 1987 and from Frankfurt a similar comparison shows a reduction of 30 per cent.</P>
      <P>These reductions have been brought about as a result of the more competitive air transport policy which I have pursued since taking up office, aided by the EC air transport liberalisation package implemented from January 1988 &mdash; on foot of decisions taken in December 1987 &mdash; and by bilateral arrangements negotiated by my Department with foreign administrations including an extremely liberal agreement with the United Kingdom.  As a result of these initiatives, traffic from continental Europe increased by approximately 14 per cent in the first eight months of 1988, compared with the same period in 1987.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe there is ample scope for further reductions in air fares to Ireland from Europe.  However, such reductions require the agreement of the other States concerned and this is often not readily <Col N="1905" /> forthcoming.  I understand that the European Commission will be producing, during 1989, proposals for the next phase of air transport liberalisation in the Community. The second phase of liberalisation is due to come into effect on 1 July 1990.  I expect that the terms will be finalised during the Irish Presidency in the first half of that year.  In this context, I shall be seeking a much less restrictive fares régime, as well as more flexible capacity-sharing arrangements and increased opportunities for market access for Irish carriers.</P>
    <P>Generally, I can assure the Deputy that I shall continue to avail of every opportunity to press vigorously, in the interests of tourism development, for further reductions in air fares to Ireland from continental Europe.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has indicated that there is ample room for further reductions.  What type of figure is the Minister talking about?  Has he been in contact with his counterparts in other countries in this respect? Has he been endeavouring to get an agreement on a specific package of reductions he believes possible?  If so, what have been the results of that endeavour?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a rather long supplementary. With regard to the United Kingdom, the country with the highest percentage volume of traffic into this country, I should say that I signed, with Lord Brabazon, last year a liberal agreement, one which I have said in the Council of Ministers in Europe would act as an exemplar for a similar agreement at European level.  Within that agreement, both with regard to fares and capacity, there is the most liberal régime possible. For example, one country only can decide on a fare; the two countries do not have to agree to it unless it is a predatory fare. With regard to France &mdash; where there is a new government &mdash; we had been negotiating strongly with the previous French Government for reductions in fares and a more liberal capacity service to France.  As I indicated in the course of my reply, we made some headway in <Col N="1906" /> that direction.  In addition we achieved a certain capacity agreement under which Ryanair could operate as well as Aer Lingus.  As I have said, we have achieved a reduction in fares of 30 per cent from West Germany into this country.  I should like to emphasise something I said in my reply, which is that, when the chips are down, individual countries, even members of the EC, hold out very hard for their self-interests.  I suppose one cannot blame them for doing so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that a 14 per cent increase is pathetic particularly when the number of tourists coming here from continental Europe is so low?  Furthermore, would he agree that air fares will not continue to reduce forever?  What plans has the Minister, in tandem with reduced air fares, which will attract a larger number of tourists from Europe about which we have all been speaking for the past few years?  What else is taking place?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I reject the Deputy's suggestion that an increase of 14 per cent is not significant in this context; it is a very significant increase.  I might add that it is one that applies across the board to France, Germany and, in particular, Italy.</P>
      <P>The second point I might make has to do with the Deputy's question as to what, other than fare reductions, we are doing about achieving an improved number of tourists from continental Europe.  We are mounting a very strong and targeted marketing campaign for which the Government provided £5 million at the end of this year and which the industry &mdash; again I must say to their credit &mdash; matched with another £5 million.  We are targeting the markets with that money in order to increase the numbers of tourists coming here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9 and 15 together.</P>
      <P>My position in relation to Swansea-Cork Ferries has not changed since my replies to questions on 16 and 22 November and the statement of the Minister of State at my Department in the Adjournment Debate on 29 November, 1988.</P>
      <P>As I have indicated, the Government would be prepared to consider an Exchequer grant of £500,000 to assist the company in promoting and marketing a service for the summer season of 1989, subject to the condition that the company would submit to me proposals for viable operation in 1989.</P>
      <P>I understand that efforts are being made in the Cork-Kerry area to raise the necessary finance to support the ferry service.  I wish these efforts well.  I hope the company will be able to come back to me with fresh proposals.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelBegley" hpid="Mr. Begley Mr. Begley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Begley</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister justify to the House why £43 million was given to B &amp; I in the last few years, subsidising every passenger to the tune of £20 a head and yet the Minister deliberately ignored that 30,000 cars and 130,000 people were coming into the Cork-Kerry region and for the sake of £1½ million he is prepared to close down this ferry?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I reject the Deputy's suggestion that there is in my Department any lack of consideration for this service.  The decision by Government to make £500,000 available was an improvement on what was available to them last year.  Secondly, I reject the suggestion that this House has voted subsidy money ever to B &amp; I.  It is a State-owned company and the company have been provided with equity in the normal course of a commercial arrangement.  We asked <Col N="1908" /> them to put their house in order, to become commercially viable in the quickest possible time.  They actually produced a plan which they are working on. It has been very successful this year. There was no unfair competition.  They had to deal with competition&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Without getting into the issue of B &amp; I, I am merely stating for the Official Report that there was an investment of £43 million over four years in B &amp; I and whether one calls the money being asked for in relation to the Swansea-Cork Ferries a subsidy or an investment a rose by any other name is still a rose.  We do not mind what the Minister calls it.  He can call it an investment if he wishes.  That is not the issue.  The issue is that £43 million were given to B &amp; I, and the Minister is not prepared to respond to the request for an investment of £1.5 million to secure the future of this ferry. That is the background to my question.</P>

Secondly, through research done in my Department in the Kerry and Cork regions, we are aware of the substantial benefit that the Swansea-Cork Ferries provide for that region.  The original allocation of £500,000 was made as a once off payment out of the tourist fund.  I managed last year to get £300,000.  This year, as against operations in 1989 at the end of the year, I succeeded in getting £500,000 as an earnest of my commitment for tourist reasons.  That money&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I was under the impression that an application, as mentioned by Deputy Deasy, had been sent to his Department for Aer Lingus to operate an internal flight between Waterford and Dublin and, if so, will the Minister look closely into the matter to ensure that passengers will not be diverted from the local regional airports on the basis that another airline are using their position on a ridiculously cheap fare to remove passengers from that airport and put that airport out of business?  This is a very important issue.  As his Department are also funding the development of these regional airports, surely it would be a contradiction if that were allowed to happen.

      <P>Payment of the general increases under the agreement on pay in the public sector in so far as they relate to commercial State bodies such as CIE is subject to the ability of the organisation to meet the cost involved.  Assessment of the ability to pay factor and the consequent approach to payment of the general increases are matters for each organisation's management in the first place. Payment of the first phase to CIE staff under the agreement commenced on 1 October 1988 for regular wages grades staff and on 1 December 1988 for salaried staff.  CIE have not entered into negotiations with unions or staff about paying the second phase of the agreement due on 1 October 1989, and I have not issued a direction in the matter to the board.</P>

      <P>I appreciate that ability to pay is a matter for CIE and not for the Minister.  The position with regard to CIE, as I understand it, is that delays on implementing increases are not based on inability or ability to pay but on the company introducing other demands of the employees not contemplated within the terms of the national wage agreement.

    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Tourism and Transport the main difficulties he foresees for Irish road hauliers <Col N="1920" /> surrounding the introduction of full cabotage in the EC: and the way in which he proposes to overcome them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I should explain at the outset that the issue raised by the Deputy, i.e. that of cabotage, refers to the point-to-point haulage of goods within a state by hauliers based in another member state.  At present, this type of operation is not permitted within the EC member states but the European Court of Justice has ruled that the Council of Ministers has an obligation under the Treaty of Rome to introduce cabotage within &ldquo;a reasonable period of time&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>There is concern among Irish road hauliers that operators from other member states whose basic transport costs may be lower than those obtaining here would be able to undermine the Irish haulage industry, if full cabotage were to be introduced. While I have some sympathy with this concern, their fears may be somewhat overstated.  Cabotage is a two way process and will provide Irish hauliers with opportunities to expand their limited penetration of international markets, particularly in the context of the 1992 Single Market.</P>
      <P>The cabotage question has been under consideration in the Council of Transport Ministers but no agreement has yet been reached.  The incoming Spanish Presidency will be pursuing the matter during the coming six months with a view to resolving the issue, possibly on the basis of a phasing in of cabotage arrangements over a number of years.  The Deputy can be assured that I will be mindful of the interests of Irish hauliers in these discussions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>The road haulage industry employs upwards of 5,000 people and it is very important.  What attention is the Minister giving to the overriding question which concerns all road hauliers here and which will have to be dealt with before full cabotage is introduced?  I refer to the difference between the South and the North in terms of tax regimes and general costs for road hauliers.  It is quite different <Col N="1921" /> to talk about other countries on the mainland of Europe as Irish hauliers are faced with this grossly unfair competition from Northern Ireland.  What does the Minister intend to do, as a first step.  before we proceed to full cabotage?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>That is precisely what I meant when I said I had some sympathy with this concern.  Being from a Border constituency, I am fully aware of the position. Irish hauliers suffer considerable disadvantages with regard to the price of diesel and the price of the vehicle. However, our tax is not as expensive as that applying in other countries.  In the Council of Ministers it became apparent to me that in some countries an ordinary truck is taxed at the rate of £5,600 per annum.  This heavy tax must be taken into consideration in the context of a part solution to the cabotage problem at European level.  As 1992 approaches, other Departments and other people will be necessarily exercising their minds with regard to the difference in excise duties on vehicles and fuel.  A step by step solution seems to be the only one which would not put our hauliers in serious trouble.  I understand that the hauliers approve of my suggestion in regard to taxation.  Instead of using the territoriality principle, which is being pushed very hard by powerful European states, we should have a tax which is an average of all the taxes in the Twelve countries.  Our hauliers would prefer that to the very high taxes which the territoriality principle would imply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that there is considerable illegal cabotage by Northern Ireland hauliers in the Republic?  Is he further aware that 50 per cent of all lorry loads leaving this country go from Northern Ireland and that the ferry rates from Northern Ireland ports to the UK are half of what they cost in the Republic's ports?  These aspects should deeply concern us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of the extent of illegal cabotage although I have heard reports in my own area that it <Col N="1922" /> exists.  This is a matter for my inspectorate and the Garda Síochána.  On two occasions I gave instructions to my inspectorate to go to the area to check as vigilantly and frequently as possible.  I have not merely a national interest in the matter but also a personal and regional interest in seeing that it is applied.  I do not have the exact statistics in regard to the number of hauliers using the Larne-Stranraer ferry but it is substantial.  I cannot deny or verify the Deputy's figure of 50 per cent.  The figure was high because there was trouble at Dublin port last year.  However, the problem has been resolved and Dublin port is now recovering. It must be cheaper to travel from Northern Ireland because the journey is very short from Larne to Stranraer.  I am sure the Deputy has made the crossing as I have on a number of occasions and you can see your destination when you set out from Larne.  However, the short sea journey is, in a sense, counteracted by the long road journeys that have to be made by the hauliers when they go to the North and that applies even more to the south of England.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I raised this as a Priority Question because of its implications for the Luxembourg agreement on fifth freedom rights.  I have several supplementaries to ask.  Aer Lingus applied to the Department of Transport on 3 July for permission to run this joint venture freight service with Lufthansa via Birmingham. There was no reply from the Department.  Why did the Department not reply to Aer Lingus before Aer Lingus began that flight service on 3 October?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is telling me something of which I am not aware. According to the information I have, in August Aer Lingus asked the Department to request the United Kingdom authorities to grant fifth freedom cargo rights.  Both Aer Lingus, Minister Paul Channon and Lord Brabazon have been made aware of our concern in this area, both by me personally and by strong correspondence, copies of which I can let the Deputy have if she wishes.  The dispute is whether the agreement of 14 December 1987 on fifth freedom rights applied to cargo or whether it was specifically confined to passenger transport.  We maintained it applies to cargo as well as to passengers and we will maintain that position until it is proved differently.  As I said in my reply, we are meeting the Lufthansa people and the British authorities early in January to resolve this problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>

    <Title>Supplementary Estimates, 1988. - Vote 33: Agriculture and Food (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £1,000 be granted to defray <Col N="1954" /> the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1988, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Agriculture and Food, including certain services administered by that Office, and of the Irish Land Commission, and for payment of certain grants, subsidies and sundry grants-in-aid.</P>
    <P>&mdash;(Minister for Agriculture and Food).</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimKemmy" hpid="Mr. Kemmy Mr. Kemmy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kemmy</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the adjournment I was saying that most Irish politicians have in the past adopted a low and critical attitude to the Common Agricultural Policy and to farmers in general.  Rarely if ever outside this House is the Common Agricultural Policy criticised.  This uncritical attitude has led to a lack of an agreed regional policy, dear food, large food surpluses that are expensive to store as Deputy Stagg commented, and, above all, lopsided agricultural development. This means Irish efforts are not concentrated on the development, regional or social funds or on the other important mechanisms and policies necessary for the country as a whole, but have concentrated on the Common Agricultural Policy which is a mistake and has resulted in many lost opportunities.</P>
      <P>How many times have we heard in debates on agriculture in this House that the Common Agricultural Policy functions as a regional policy?  That is nonsense because that description is simplistic, inaccurate and confusing.  The Common Agricultural Policy will have to change and our perception of it will also have to change because the other 80 per cent of our population&mdash;the non-farmers &mdash;must be considered.  In other words, financial aid to agriculture must be measured not from the point of view of putting more money into farmers' pockets but from a much wider perspective.  The sooner this kind of expensive and selfish madness is ended the better for all of us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No one can deny that the Common Agricultural Policy has created costly and unwanted food surpluses and has damaged Third World agriculture.  It is also <Col N="1955" /> clear that the Common Agricultural Policy has served the interests of agricultural big business, has encouraged environmentally damaging farming techniques and has led to uneven economic development throughout the EC and throughout this country.  In this connection, there should be an opportunity for us to cash in on Ireland's increasingly unmerited image among Europeans of being clean, unspoilt, unpolluted, etc. The promotion of agricultural industry based on the image of organic farming would be very important in this context.</P>
    <P>The fact that agriculture accounts for two thirds of the EC budget is testimony to a gravy train out of financial control, and also reflects the relatively low level of public spending by the EC on regional social policies.  The recent increases in &ldquo;structural expenditure&rdquo; to tackle unemployment and regional under-development agreed at the Brussels Summit is a poor response given the scale of the economic and social problems in Ireland and throughout the EC.</P>
    <P>As a people and a Community we must face reality sooner or later.  For a start we will have to face the fact that the Common Agricultural Policy will have to be drastically reformed.  The Common Agricultural Policy was originally set up to make European agriculture more efficient and productive and to bring order and stability to the marketplace. What has happened?  We now have expensive butter and beef mountains, overflowing wine and milk lakes and this year every man, woman and child in the EC will have to pay £110 in higher food prices and £59 in higher taxes to keep the Common Agricultural Policy going. These figures are worth concentrating on.</P>
    <P>There is an old saying that there are more ways of choking a cat than pouring hot butter down his throat, but in a world where millions are starving and many more millions are on the poverty line, EC wine is being turned into paint and EC butter into lipstick as a direct result of the Common Agricultural Policy.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1956" /> Our farmers must diversify their products to meet the changing needs of European markets.  At present we have only a mere toehold on this market and that is not good enough.  Our survival as a people could very well depend on far more enlightened and effective responses from our farmers and their organisations. The importation of hundreds of thousands of pounds worth of food, including a wide variety of vegetables, is a continual scandal which we cannot justify. There is no reason we should not grow our own food, including vegetables.</P>
    <P>In regard to taxation, farmers always say they are willing to pay their fair share of taxes but not just yet.  As long as I have been in politics &mdash; for the last 25 years&mdash;the farmers, most of whose leaders come from the Golden Vale area where I come from, stand up and say, &ldquo;Yes, we will pay our taxes but not just yet&rdquo;.  No matter what scheme we try to devise for them, they will find some argument, some disagreement, some loophole. That attitude must go.  The farmers must play their part in the financing of this country.  They have got away with murder for far too long.  The land tax seems to be the fairest way and the progressive way to impose taxes on them.  I appeal to the Minister concerned to use whatever influence and power he has to push and force the farmers into the tax net.  We cannot continue to subsidise them as we have been doing.  They admit they are paying £30 million to accountants to doctor their books.  How much better it would be for all of us if they paid £15 million which I believe they owe&mdash; not £30 million &mdash; to the Exchequer directly.  We would all benefit from that. I hope the Minister when replying will address himself to the question of taxing farmers because for too long every politician has evaded it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>It is interesting to note the contributions that have been made to this debate.  A previous speaker said he and his party would not wish to be seen to be anti farmer.  Deputy Kemmy has made a very good contribution and we in The Workers' Party want to make it clear <Col N="1957" /> that we are not anti farmer.  We want to put forward good, constructive points and not the kind of thing we have heard from the Government party and the main Opposition party.  A number of important items are covered by this Estimate. It is not possible to refer to them all in any detail but a few specific items need to be mentioned.</P>
      <P>One of the biggest allocations, £8 million, is for agricultural research, education and advice.  We welcome that.  All these areas are vitally important and everyone would accept the need to invest substantially in them if we are to make the best possible use of our agricultural resources.  There is a greater need now than ever before to modernise and adapt to the changing needs of the market.  The present methods of producing from the land will have to change within the next few years.  Change will be forced on farming because the present levels of intervention payment will not continue indefinitely.</P>
      <P>Legislation was passed this year merging AFT and ACOT to form Teagasc. Despite our reservations, we are hopeful that the new body will give the necessary boost to education and training for farmers, but it seems Teagasc have been starved of the resources necessary to do their work.  It is ironic that this should happen when farming incomes are reported to be increasing substantially.  I note in my area the development, which we welcome, in Mitchelstown Co-operative where it is proposed to increase the number of jobs by 40 in whey processing to cater for markets at home and abroad.  I would mention also the recent takeover of Horgan Meats at Charleville by the Halal Group.  There have been 200 jobs lost there but I hope Halal will employ that number and many more because of the potential in that business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A speaker referred to something which I thought a little out of the norm, that is the Sugar Company's tare assessing process.  From the public statement issued and from my knowledge of the Sugar Company and the way they do business I would say their tare processing would stand up to any scrutiny.  Let me <Col N="1958" /> put on record also that in my area, the Mallow Sugar Factory, because of their efficiency, can cope or compete with any factory in Europe at present.</P>
    <P>I note a substantial increase in the allocation for disease control and eradication. The failure of successive campaigns by a number of Governments to end disease in our cattle has been one of the greatest financial scandals in the history of the State.  More than £1,000 has been spent on various campaigns in the last 20 years and we are no nearer to having a disease free cattle herd than we were at the start.</P>
    <P>The vets have made huge sums of money from the campaign: £10.6 million in 1983, £8.3 million in 1984, £11.9 million in 1985, £11 million in 1986 and £12 million in 1987, a total of £50 million in five years.  Much of the work done by vets in this area could be done by competent technicians but there seems to be a reluctance to take on vested interests of the veterinary profession.  I would like the Minister to indicate how much of the Revised Estimate allocations will be going on veterinary fees.  No reference is made to sheepscab control.  There is an alarming outbreak of it in County Cork. There is a sixfold increase in the outbreaks this year and a national policy is needed to control movement, dipping and the indentification of sheep.  Some county councils still do not have a veterinary surgeon appointed to do this more efficiently.</P>
    <P>One area in which money has been saved and is being returned to the Exchequer in this Estimate is subhead D.4, money allocated for An Bord Glas. The Government have failed to get An Bord Glas off the ground and functioning despite all their promises.  It is ludicrous that a country with so many natural advantages as Ireland should import £1,000 million worth of food products each year and it is particularly scandalous that we import £200 million worth of fruit and vegetables annually much of which could have been produced at home.  The failure of successive Governments and of the farming bodies to ensure that job creation in agriculture was fully <Col N="1959" /> developed and robbed people of tens of thousands of jobs that would have ensured from the proper use of development of our land.  It has meant also that the country has had to import hundreds of millions of pounds worth of foodstuffs that could have been produced at home.</P>
    <P>I have referred to Holland as an example we should aim to follow in this area.  They have 4 per cent of their total agricultural land under glass.  We should aim at least to put 4 per cent of our agricultural land into horticultural production with a good proportion of this under glass, based on the Dutch experience. This could create an additional 40,000 jobs on the land with as many as 50,000 additional jobs in processing. Unfortunately, there is little or no tradition in horticulture in this country, and that is why a body like An Bord Glas are so necessary.  It is regrettable that this organisation are not being put into action yet.</P>
    <P>A substantial part of this Estimate relates to various EC schemes, and Irish agriculture has to accept that the days of the CAP as we know it are over.  Despite the fact that hundreds of millions of £s have been poured into farming from the CAP, we have an abysmal level of productivity and a declining number of jobs. Some big farmers are doing well out of the CAP but it has done nothing for the rest of them.  It has also added substantially to the food bills of the consumers. The British consumers' association estimated recently that CAP was adding £13 per week to the food bills of families in Britian.</P>
    <P>I note also in this Estimate an allocation for subsidies on milk and dairy products for human consumption, presumably relating to payments due for the period before their abolition.  The decision to scrap food subsidies was one of the most shameful made by the Coalition Administration, and was a severe imposition on the poorest and weakest sections of Irish society.  Both bread and <Col N="1960" /> milk are items on which low income families rely very much, and they are products for which there is, in most cases, no alternative.  Prior to the removal of the first part of the food subsidies in 1984, a pint of milk cost 21p.  It now costs 31p in Dublin and slightly less in country areas, representing an increase of almost 50 per cent.  Butter was less than £1 per pound and is now £1.40.  The price of a standard loaf of bread has increased by 75 per cent since the food subsidies were first cut.  The fact is that as a result of the abolition of food subsidies, and the failure to ensure that payments were adequately increased, there is a shocking level of poverty here which has been graphically described in recent reports of the Combat Poverty Agency and a number of &ldquo;Today Tonight&rdquo; programmes.  Many families on social welfare can simply no longer afford such essentials as bread and milk.</P>
    <P>Part of the Estimate also relates to the winding up of Bord na gCapall.  The decision to scrap Bord na gCapall was a particularly shortsighted one and should be reconsidered.  There is a need for a body to promote horse breeding, outside of the thoroughbred area.  This can be a useful source of additional income for small farmers.  There is, particularly, a demand abroad for Irish draught horses and for Connemara ponies.  The number of registered Irish draught mares went down from 92 in 1985 to 63 in 1988, which seems to indicate a declining interest by farmers in this area, when the Government should be doing all possible to promote it as a possible alternative source of farm income.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to receipts from the EC in respect of market intervention and disadvantaged area schemes and said that the reduction in receipts under the disadvantaged area scheme was directly related to the level of 1987 payments under those schemes which reflected a drop in cattle numbers.  That is a scandal and as a result we have to import calves from England.  When will the Minister make a statement of his intention to increase the number of disadvantaged areas?  I am sure he has received many submissions to fit the criteria for this <Col N="1961" /> scheme.  It is important that we encourage people to stay in farming and they should get the benefits that are available. The Minister should give us some indication of his intention in regard to that scheme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be brief.  A lot of what I have heard so far is historical and does not relate to what is happening.  We heard a lot about the abuse of the CAP but the problems within the CAP have, by and large, been solved.  It is not fair that people should say that we have abuses of the CAP and many surpluses. The days of surpluses have virtually gone. At present the Minister is defending the last bastion of surplus in the EC, the stocks of beef that are in intervention.  It is imperative that he wins the day in regard to that product even if he has to invoke the veto.  We have got rid of butter stocks and skimmed milk powder stocks and there is not much abuse in those areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main point I should like to make is that the threat to Irish farmers does not come from within Europe but from within GATT, the worldwide organisation for trade.  If the Americans get the agreement of a significant number of EC countries it is possible that aids and subsidies to farmers will not just be seriously eroded but may eventually be eliminated.  In the course of a parliamentary question I suggested that a Cabinet Minister of the Government attend all meetings of GATT from now <Col N="1962" /> on to defend our position because we know that the Americans want to get rid of subsidies.  The British and the Dutch also want to do so.  If a country like Germany, the major power, decides to go along with that policy we will be in serious trouble.  The battle will not be in Europe or on the Common Agricultural Policy; it will be on international trade involving every country in the world.  It is important that we have a Cabinet Minister present at those talks.  I hope the Minister bears that in mind.  The Government should take that suggestion on board.</P>
    <P>I agree with what Deputy Kemmy had to say in regard to land tax.  It is time that the Government had a rethink on that issue.  It is a scandal that so little taxation has been taken in at a time when farmers are willing to pay at least twice as much through the medium of a land tax.  It was a serious error by the Government to promise in the course of the election campaign that they would not introduce the land tax.  If £70 million can be collected and if we can eliminate the anxieties of many small farmers who have to fill in tax forms we should introduce such a tax. If we can double the take why not do so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Jim Tunney">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I must remind the Deputy that he is thieving in ministerial pastures.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to congratulate the Minister on providing £500,000 for the refurbishment of race courses, in particular Fairyhouse.  In my view Fairyhouse is as good a National Hunt course as there is in England or Ireland and it needs that type of investment badly.  The track is perfect but the facilities are pretty dreadful.  That money is badly needed and it will be well spent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. O'Kennedy) Michael O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the House for the response to this important Supplementary Estimate.  I also thank Deputy Deasy for raising a matter that I did not mention, the importance of the GATT negotiations.  I assure him, and the House, that I am conscious of the importance of those negotiations.  With <Col N="1963" /> my French colleague we uniquely managed to get an agreement from the Council of Agricultural Ministers which was not thought of, much less talked about. That decision was of immense benefit at the Montreal mid-term review.  It meant that there was a solidarity which otherwise would not be there.  The presence of a Cabinet Minister at those discussions was a deliberate decision taken after consultation with my French colleague and the Commission.  Had we all gone to that meeting we would have put a focus on agriculture that the Americans wanted. It is important that our strategy is right. Had all Ministers of Agriculture gone to that meeting the Americans would have had what they wanted, agriculture up front.  I can assure Deputies Deasy and Doyle that while it is up front in our priorities our attendance at particular meetings is a matter of judgment.  We are keeping in touch with the negotiations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy Deasy said, it is time we stopped attacking the Common Agricultural Policy.  We can leave that to non-Community countries.  Very significant disciplines have been introduced and in Ireland we are redirecting the thrust of that policy to maximise employment. Ireland is the only country in the European Community in the position where 10 per cent of our gross national product, 20 per cent of our total employment and 30 per cent of our total exports derive directly from the agriculture and food sector.  Those who would simply look at agriculture and food as being for farmers &mdash; I do not suppose Deputy Sherlock would insist on that &mdash; are overlooking the essential fact that this is uniquely a crucial element in this economy.  I have an obligation to enhance and expand it at every level for the primary producer, who must be healthy, to the processor and the employee, and we are doing that. I do not have time to demonstrate how except by indicating that for the market focus we are becoming a dominant force in European agri-food as is evident from what is happening in the agri-food sector in new and major companies.  That cannot be done without a healthy basic <Col N="1964" /> primary producer.  I hope from now on we will stop putting them against each other because they are totally interrelated in this economy.</P>
    <P>I have no responsibility for tax any more than the Minister for Education has responsibility for taxing teachers or the Minister for Health for taxing doctors. My only job is to enhance the income of the primary producer.  Without going into any detail all I would say is I am doing my best and I think we are achieving results.  Taxes follow as a matter of consequence. I will continue to do all possible to enhance the income of the primary producers and the tax will, on the basis of this Government's policy, be levied on the same basis as every other sector. Nobody is going to listen when Deputy Doyle says this Government are endangering agriculture and that this Government have shown no concern for agriculture.  I will leave that statement on the record of Deputy Doyle because I think this is a classic case where, as the Romans used to say, <i>res ipsa loquitur,</i> the facts speak for themselves.  I do not have to defend or vindicate what I or my Government colleagues are doing for agriculture because the facts speak for themselves.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been some comment during the course of the debate about the fact that the increase in agricultural incomes was not even across the <Col N="1965" /> board, that many of the smaller farmers did not enjoy the same advantage.  I accept that.  I would like to say two or three things about our policy and I hope my good friend and colleague, Deputy Deasy, will not take objection to one of those points.  First, we took action to protect that small person over the last four years in terms of the quota which is a very special asset now.  It was the power of the cheque book that determined who could buy a quota.  I stopped it.  It is now the young farmer and the small farmer who gets priority.  Second, in relation to small farmers there has never been such a focus on the western development areas, the western package, the special rate of grants and the whole scheme for disadvantaged areas.  Incidentally, I want to inform the House of the good news that early in the new year the surveyors will be out on the field examining all the areas for extension of the disadvantaged areas.</P>
      <P>Part of the package which we have not yet concluded &mdash; it is under discussion now &mdash; is for a very significant scheme of income aids for small farmers which I have been promoting at European Community level.  We want to get the right kind of income aid scheme.  I want to assure this House and the public that this is priority for us, to create the conditions in which the healthy can better themselves but above all to ensure that the family farms and the small farmers are protected. In the short time that is available to me that is all I can deal with.  I thank Members of the House for the points they have made.  On a procedural point I want to read into the record&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. R. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £1,450,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1988, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, including certain services administered by that Office, and for payment of certain loans, subsidies, grants and grants-in-aid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Supplementary Estimate arises because of additional expenditure under the currency exchange loss subhead, and the need to provide additional funding to Eolas, KDW and IPC.  The total involved is £5.9 million but this is reduced to a net increase of £1.45 million by savings arising in relation to departmental salaries, the IDA and SFADCo <Col N="1967" /> capital allocations, the Market Entry and Development Scheme operated by CTT, and increases in appropriations-in-aid.</P>
    <P>An additional £3.410 million is required in relation to the currency exchange loss allocation, which is intended to meet the cost of exchange losses arising from the foreign risk cover provided by the Exchequer in respect of certain of the Industrial Credit Corporation's foreign borrowings for industry.</P>
    <P>Expenditure in this area is influenced by a number of factors, principally the level of foreign borrowings, the repayments due and the difference in the exchange rates at the time of the drawdown of the loan and the exchange rates prevailing when repayments are due. Because of these factors, it is difficult to forecast accurately the level of expenditure required under this subhead in any given year.</P>
    <P>The principal loan schemes in respect of which my Department cover ICC for exchange losses are: (i) The European Investment Bank Scheme, through which ICC provide loans to small and medium manufacturing firms for fixed assets investment; (ii) The working capital loan scheme, through which ICC provide loans for working capital for small and medium manufacturing firms; (iii) The working capital for exporters scheme, through which ICC provide loans for working capital for small and medium manufacturing firms to expand and open up new export markets; and (iv) general purpose foreign borrowing, through which ICC provide long term loans to Irish industry for various purposes at commercial Irish interest rates, rather than at concessionary rates, as with the other schemes.</P>
    <P>Additional funding is required in 1988 because of the following factors: First, the need to include losses from a World Bank scheme, which was established some years ago to aid development in the industrial and wholesale distributive sectors.  Losses under this scheme were dealt with previously by netting off losses against amounts owed by ICC in respect <Col N="1968" /> of Central Fund advances.  The interest now payable to the Exchequer by ICC each half year is reducing, and is no longer sufficient to cover exchange losses on the World Bank scheme.  A sum of £750,000 is required in this regard; Second, the adverse exchange rate movements against the IR£ since July 1987 when the 1988 exchange loss forecast was made.  The additional amount required in 1988 for this reason is £1.2 million; and third, the fact that ICC were unable to complete the detailed analysis necessary to make a claim, for £860,000, under the working capital loan scheme by the end of 1987; and, finally, a re-evaluation by ICC of losses under this scheme in 1988 resulted in an additional requirement of £600,000 this year.</P>
    <P>It is proposed to provide an additional £1.8 million to Eolas.  Deputies will be aware that Eolas was established in January of this year under the Science and Technology Act, 1987, which effected the merger of the National Board for Science and Technology and the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards.  Eolas inherited an accumulated deficit from the IIRS of the order of £1 million and the supplementary grant being proposed here today is intended to clear this deficit and to provide necessary additional funding for the agency's 1988 operations.  This will place Eolas on a sound financial footing and will enable them to concentrate their energies on the important and fundamental part they have to play in our economic and industrial development.</P>
    <P>The Government decision to establish Eolas was based on the view that a strong and well developed scientific and technical base, integrated with industry, is essential, if Ireland is to be economically successful in today's keenly competitive, high technology world.  Eolas was intended to be a vital element in creating the proper and most effective framework in which the development and expansion of our industry, through science and technology, can take place.  Over the last 12 months, the agency has made considerable progress in gearing itself up to effectively perform its role.  I would like to take this opportunity of thanking the <Col N="1969" /> chairman and members of the board and the staff for their efforts in bringing this about.</P>
    <P>As one would have expected, the past year has been a difficult one for the agency.  There was a need for large-scale reorganisation and relocation; staff numbers had to be slimmed down to make the new body more cost effective and to eliminate duplication; priorities had to be reassessed in the light of Government policy and resources had to be marshalled towards more effectively meeting the essential technological needs of Irish industry.</P>
    <P>With 1992 just a short time away and the opportunities and challenges of the European internal market becoming ever more pronounced, it is my belief that indigenous Irish industry needs to concentrate on raising the technological level of its operation and, thereby, producing higher quality products which can stand the heat of the competition which 1992 will bring.  Eolas is the agency which can best help Irish industry in this regard and I am glad to say that they have made a very worth-while beginning in this task.</P>
    <P>The functions of the agency are wide-ranging, some operated on a commercial basis and some in an industrial development mode.  It promotes and co-ordinates national investment in science and technology; it seeks to optimise European Community funding for science and technological research in Ireland; it provides a national technical information service; it provides technical consulting and testing services; it monitors industrial research and development projects and it operates national quality and standard programmes.  The Government see these services as being vitally important to Irish industry and are providing the necessary resources to Eolas to deliver them in the most effective way.</P>
    <P>The agency is also responsible for the management and execution of the programmes being funded under the Government's science and technology development programme.  The programme was set in train in 1987 with a budget of £3.1 million, was funded to the same extent in 1988, and will have a <Col N="1970" /> budget of £8.2 million in 1989.  The programme is spearheading niche development in a number of key areas such as biotechnology, advanced manufacturing technology, microelectronics and in 1989 will be initiating programmes in other areas.  The common theme running through all the actions funded in the programme is the transfer of new scientific and technical knowledge to Irish industry to enable it to compete and to develop new jobs.</P>
    <P>As I have said, Eolas has a key part to play in implementation of Government policy in this area.  It also, of course, has a key advisory role in the development of policy.  In this regard, I might mention that the agency is currently putting the finishing touches to a draft strategy for science and technology in the nineties. This programme will be especially related to the exploitation of science and technology in support of future industrial development.  I expect to have this draft plan submitted to me early in 1989 and I, and my Department, will be giving it very careful consideration.</P>
    <P>The proposed supplementary grant of £1.8 million is a very clear indication, I think, of the importance the Government attaches to the activity of Eolas and will be of considerable benefit to the agency in performing their tasks.</P>
    <P>It is proposed to provide additional funding of £600,000 to KDW.  On 3 June 1988, the Dáil approved a Supplementary Estimate to provide Kilkenny Design Workshops Limited with additional grant-in-aid of £250,000 to enable the company to continue trading pending the sale of their assets.  This Supplementary Estimate was necessary, as the House was informed at the time, because of a serious deterioration in KDW's financial position which became evident in the early part of this year.  The House will recall that, primarily due to losses in the London retail operation, as well as the operating loss incurred in Ireland in 1986, considerable trading debts and substantial liabilities in respect of bank borrowings had accumulated.  The immediate objective was to stop the haemorrhage of losses and to realise <Col N="1971" /> funds for payment to creditors.  This necessitated the taking of hard commercial decisions: to close the London shop; to sell the shops in Dublin and Kilkenny; and to dispose of other assets, including properties in Kilkenny.</P>
    <P>The Government were anxious to safeguard, in so far as possible, the positions of the many small companies and craft enterprises which were owed moneys by KDW and it was considered essential that the disposal of assets should be proceeded with in an orderly fashion to maximise realisations, to provide a continuing outlet for craft goods and to enable the company to come to satisfactory arrangements with their creditors.  The Government were also anxious that the shops, in Dublin and Kilkenny, which are important outlets for high quality, well designed Irish craft goods, would continue as such under new ownership.</P>
    <P>The ambitious target of disposal of assets, while at the same time ensuring continuity for suppliers, is nearing successful completion.  The sale of the Kilkenny shop in Dublin was by public tender and on 18 November it was announced that it is to be sold to the highest bidder, Blarney Woollen Mills Group.  The group, who have some 285 Irish suppliers, operate very successful retail outlets in Blarney, Dublin and the UK, in addition to owning a knitwear factory and hotel and leisure complex in Blarney.  Blarney Woollen Mills have undertaken to retain all 37 staff in both the shop and the restaurant.</P>
    <P>The Government have at all times been conscious that KDW are an integral part of Kilkenny's culture and heritage and make an important contribution to the thriving tourism industry there.  In particular they recognised that the KDW properties at Kilkenny, which KDW had restored to a very high standard over the past 25 years, were of special historical importance located as a cohesive unit opposite Kilkenny Castle, enhancing the tourist amenities there.  It was the wish of the Government that the necessary sale of KDW assets in Kilkenny should <Col N="1972" /> not adversely affect or diminish these aspects.</P>
    <P>This view was also strongly held by the people of Kilkenny who welcomed the announcement made on 21 November, that the ownership of KDW's properties in Kilkenny &mdash; Castle Yard and Butler House &mdash; was being transferred to a civic trust which is being established in the city.  An acceptable cash consideration will accrue to KDW and the decision will ensure that the activities which are currently being carried out in Kilkenny will be continued and that the historic and aesthetic qualities of the complex there will be secured.</P>
    <P>The outstanding debts of KDW, particularly trade debts and bank loans are in excess of £2 million and the sale of assets will go only some of the way towards clearing those debts.  It is proposed that a further sum of £600,000 should be provided now to enable KDW to pay the more pressing debts.</P>
    <P>Finally, it is proposed to provide additional funding of £90,000 to the Irish Productivity Centre.  The centre's grant-in-aid for 1988 at £440,000 was £147,000 less than that provided in 1987.  I have, been concerned about the effects of this cut on the business advisory and labour management services provided by the centre to industry.  I consider that an additional £90,000 would enable the IPC to continue its very valuable work of providing subsidised management consultency services to small firms and of developing more effective and constructive human relations in companies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to have this opportunity to make a contribution on the Supplementary Estimate and in the time available to me I would like to comment on a number of areas.  One would have to be concerned about the reductions in funding to Córas Tráchtála, during the past two years in particular, as these are certain to have an effect on the quality of services provided by specialist marketing staff in Dublin and overseas.  Córas Tráchtála have had to accommodate the reductions in their <Col N="1973" /> 1988 grant-in-aid by introducing a voluntary staff severance scheme under which some 40 highly qualified staff have left the organisation.  They have also had to introduce charges for services they provide and these have placed a further burden on many hard-pressed industries.</P>
      <P>They have also found it necessary to revise their incentive grants programmes, introducing a scheme whereby the financial incentives given to industry are to be repaid to Córas Tráchtála over ensuing years.  Córas Tráchtála are also hindered by the present embargo on promotions and recruitment and continue to lose specialist marketing staff to provide industry at an ever-increasing rate.  I am deeply concerned that, at a time when there is a growing need to provide the range of services demanded by industry, particularly in the context of 1992, the capacity of Córas Tráchtála to respond is being undermined by a haemhorrage of highly experienced and specialist personnel through a combination of losses to the private sector&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelLowry" hpid="Mr. Lowry Mr. Lowry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, a Leas Cheann Comhairle, I take your point.  This is happening at a time when everyone accepts <Col N="1974" /> that strong, consistent and forceful marketing is essential.  This point is highlighted in the following extract from &ldquo;The Ireland and Marketing Report&rdquo; to the Sectoral Development Committee prepared by the Consultative Committee on Marketing which states:</P>
      <P>There is an urgent need to upgrade the marketing performance of indigenous Irish industry.  Over the years many companies with the technical competence to produce excellent products have been losing business to imports as a direct result of poor marketing performance.  Eighty per cent of Irish companies are small, employing less than 50 people and as a consequence, the owner-manager has to perform many functions including production, accounting, selling etc.  Often the vital area of marketing is ignored.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been clearly established from evidence available that the home market currently provides enormous opportunities for Irish manufacturing industry to meet domestic purchasing requirements which are serviced by imports. Import substitution represents annual new business potential for Irish firms worth in excess of £2 billion annually. The extra sales potential of £1.2 billion is comprised as follows: food and non-food grocery, £200 million; clothing, £120 million; furniture-carpets, £105 million; household goods including gifts, etc. £90 million and industrial products, £750 million. The scale of opportunity is indicated by the high level of imports in the Irish economy.  Ireland's total imports of goods and services are equivalent to 53.4 per cent of GNP compared with a European Community average of 28.5 per cent.  In manufactured goods, import growth accelerated following Ireland's membership of the European Community.  In the short term much of this growth was predictable but the trend has continued. Between 1979 and 1984 the value of manufactured imports, in current prices, rose by 86 per cent.  The benefits of a sustained marketing thrust by Irish manufacturers to win an increased share of home market sales are significant and <Col N="1975" /> would include the following: steady expansion by existing manufacturing firms; scope for new business ventures; maintaining employment and creating new job opportunities throughout the economy; halting the import propensity of Irish industrial and domestic purchasers and stimulating the indigenous sub-supply sector; increasing the sophistication of Irish industry in production, product development and marketing and developing the export potential of Irish firms.</P>
    <P>A number of reasons can be advanced for the growth of manufactured imports. The most important has been poor marketing performance.  The Sectoral Development Committee in their report on marketing identified this weakness in marketing as the area most in need of improvement in Irish industry as a whole. A major upgrading in the marketing skills of indigenous industry is needed if the competitive performance of indigenous industry is to be improved.  Of the many firms which depend exclusively or mainly on domestic sales, survival will depend critically on their ability to increase or at least maintain market share.  Obviously cost effectiveness, production and marketing are very important factors in job creation.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to emigration and job creation.  Unemployment and the rising tide of emigration are the modern day cancers of our society.  It is obvious that Government policies are totally inadequate and making no real progress in arresting this unacceptable <i>malise.</i> While we expect and are entitled to demand proper leadership from Government, the public must be prepared to play their part in this task, especially during this peak spending period.  They should be conscious that there is a direct relationship between buying Irish-made products and jobs.  This is beyond argument. For example, we import over £1 million of clothing every day of the year. There are enough garments imported every week to keep 18 factories, each with 100 workers, busy for 48 weeks of the year.  There are clothing imports from <Col N="1976" /> Third World countries where those employed are paid little better than in slave labour terms.  I know we all like to find a bargain, but one must ask at what price?  Surely some of these people in Third World countries are being exploited by us through our purchasing choice of products.</P>
    <P>A great deal is being written and spoken about 1992.  One thing we can be certain of is the need for greater professionalism in all aspects of business, product development, marketing, and retailing.  There is, of course, a great challenge in Europe and a great opportunity for our exports to Europe but we must not overlook our home market.  Manufacturers in Ireland need a secure home base: we are Europeans but we are Irish first.  Our market is more open than those of our European neighbours.  Import penetration here is double that of other European average.  Urging, as I do, support for our home industries is nothing more than enlightened self-interest.</P>
    <P>We all want our families and friends to be able to work and live here in Ireland. Every pound we spend on imported products simply goes to make jobs for people in other countries.  How many of us, for instance, are wearing Irisn made footwear? The national average would put nine out of every ten of us wearing imported shoes.  We are entitled to freedom of choice &mdash; and I do not for an instant wish to lessen that freedon of choice &mdash; but such freedom is denied us if the choice is not available in our shops. At present we import over £250 million worth of building materials and £55 million worth of imported furniture per year. Every £1 imported represents lost job opportunities for our young people.  We cannot overstate the importance of supporting Guaranteed Irish products.</P>
    <P>Is there a family in this country who have not been touched by the blight of unemployment?  We are unanimous in our desire to stop emigration, to reduce unemployment, to see jobs saved, and new jobs created but if we persist in spending vast amounts of money on unnecessary imports we simply fuel unemployment.  The amount of money <Col N="1977" /> spent, particularly at this time of year, will create jobs but the question is: will those jobs be created here at home for our families or for people of other countries? We know we need jobs for our people now and in the future.  We know that jobs can best be made through production, whether agricultural or industrial production, and yet we continue to import the very products we produce ourselves and then we wonder why factories close.  Last year we imported more than £70 million worth of chocolates and sweets and over £27 million of newspapers and magazines.  A small number of people and organisations do the importing but a large number of us end up buying these imports.  The silent majority in this country take the easy option by their very silence.  I urge all of us to speak up and be heard, asking and demanding that Irish made products be on offer.</P>
    <P>I want to conclude by referring to the recently published review of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> carried out by the Central Review Committee in relation to job creation figures.  In this programme job creation and progress are measured by figures which give an inaccurate picture.  The total figure of 14,943 jobs estimated is for first time jobs, 89 per cent of which are in manufacturing industry.  It does not allow for replacement job numbers and only 3 per cent of the labour force are employed in first time jobs.  Forty seven per cent of the Irish labour force of over 1.3 million people are employed in the service sector and only 23 per cent in industry.  The Industrial Development Authority's brief is for internationally traded services but this accounts for only 1,375 jobs. The IDA area covers 88 per cent of the population, which accounts for 3.5 million people, whereas SFADCo with their wide-ranging powers cover 10 per cent of the population.  The figures indicate that the IDA have managed to create only 12,500 jobs while SFADCo have created almost 2,000 jobs.  This leads one to the conclusion that the ratio of job creation by the IDA is unsatisfactory.  I suggest that the IDA should be given a wider <Col N="1978" /> brief to include all service industries and tourism, similar to SFADCo and Údarás na Gaeltachta.  Perhaps the Minister would say how many of the SFADCo job figures were IDA-transferred.</P>
    <P>The Government should use the CSO employment statistics instead of first-time jobs as a measure and we would then get a true reflection of the position.</P>
    <P>The IDA are giving their sales people in the field too much credit for new job opportunities.  They are placing too much emphasis on this aspect, to the detriment of existing industries who are not receiving the support and attention they require.  In many cases job losses have resulted from that neglect.  It is not wilful neglect but obviously IDA executives and their people in the field are so concerned about reaching job targets that they are forgetting about the jobs being lost behind the scenes.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Lowry has given a very interesting and commendable contribution on matters pertinent to Industry and Commerce generally but in respect of debate of this kind the Deputy is requested &mdash; indeed obliged &mdash; to comment in the main only on what is provided for in the Supplementary Estimate.  I know that Deputy Martin Cullen will oblige accordingly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister in presenting the Supplementary Estimate has laid great stress on telling us that £3.4 million has been saved because of reductions in the capital budgets of SFADCo and the IDA and in the very important market entry and development programmes run by CTT.  Productive capital moneys that could be used are being transferred to write-off a current expenditure loss.  The Minister is telling us that the figure is not £5 million but £1.45 million because of the saving of £3.45 million he has been able to make.  That is not the manner in which the figures should be presented. There is a real loss of £3.45 million which could be used to create jobs but it is being transferred to write-off currency exchange losses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with the Minister that Eolas <Col N="1979" /> has a very important future in the development of technology but I do not believe that he and his Department have defined the role of Eolas.  The Department instituted this year a technology pilot programme.  Apart from a few appointments and more co-ordination between industry and some of the educational institutes, not much is happening. Does the Minister mean a technology pilot programme based on what has happened in the United States or the recent type of technology park which has been created in the UK, where there is to be £400 million worth of development?  We cannot say a technology park is to be created here if we do not have the wherewithal to create the environs for the high technology industries we need to attract.  A great deal of discussion is taking place as to whether we should concentrate on computers or pharmaceuticals or whether all these things should be components in a technology-orientated economy.  Those decisions have not been taken.  At the core of any technology developments which have occurred has been a sophisticated technological institute or university which the private sector can feed into with their own investment.  Highly educated students become part of and relevant to the private sector and they become involved in industrial research at an early stage.  It is ridiculous to imagine that this country with such a small population base and an insufficient amount of capital has the wherewithal to develop research and development laboratories on its own.  We simply cannot do it.  I contend that Eolas, under the Department, should be looking at the Development of a central technological research unit into which many industries, large or small, could feed.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that Eolas seeks to optimise European Community funding for science and technology research in Ireland.  I was glad to hear the Minister put this point on record.  I was hoping some efforts would be made to co-ordinate European funding in this area. Under the aegis of the Department of <Col N="1980" /> Industry and Commerce, it is an area which provides great opportunity for employment creation and the attraction of foreign industries.  There is an onus on the Minister to spell out the role of Eolas and say where it is going.</P>
    <P>The importance of the role played by CTT is being lost in a bit of a haze.  CTT is an extremely important body and the export potential from Ireland is tremendous, particularly in the context of 1992. Real benefits could accrue to CTT as opposed to the IDA.  There is overlapping between the two bodies in certain areas and it is not always clear which of them is responsible and who should take the lead.  We need to know how the IDA and CTT are to develop in the future.</P>
    <P>Many companies are sitting back and simply talking about what might happen in 1992.  For an enormous amount of industry throughout Europe 1992 has already happened.  Many of them made their plans years ago and others are involved in doing so at present.  It is essential to get the message across that this is happening now.  The emphasis must be changed in order to remove from industry this relaxed attitude that 1992 is still a few years away.  There will be great bonuses with the creation of the Single European Market in regard to the creation of jobs, the development of exports and the centralisation of distribution networks within Europe, but all these things are already in the process of development. This message must be put across to industry.</P>
    <P>The whole purpose of Supplementary Estimates and the granting of finance in different areas is job creation.  If the figures the Minister has given were accurate and could stand on their own, that would be fine.  What we are not taking into account is the unfortunate job losses that are occuring in the manufacturing sector.  Our rate of growth is not comparable to stabilising the unemployment figures or to substantially reducing them.</P>
    <P>The creation of jobs is not something that is isolated.  It is related to poverty and taxation.  I took great umbrage with the MRBI poll in <i>The Irish Times</i> recently in which people were asked if they <Col N="1981" /> wanted tax reductions or if they wanted something done about poverty as if they were not related.  Of course they are related, and job creation is at the base of the problem.  The Department of Industry and Commerce must turn their minds to this and must be clear and concise in what they are doing in this regard.  In the area of industry and commerce clear decisions have not been taken as to who will lead the policy development.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the Kilkenny Design shops.  What happened in that regard was unfortunate.  It was inevitable that the shops would have to be sold off. The fact that a trust has been set up in Kilkenny is a step in the right direction. Finally, I would like to congratulate the Minister on being appointed Minister for Industry and Commerce and I wish him every success in that capacity.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. R. Burke) Raphael P. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. R. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Deputies for their contributions to the debate on this Supplementary Estimate. Deputy Lowry commented on the continuing need for the support for Irish goods.  Much of the efforts of the Department of Industry and Commerce, the State agencies associated with them and the community as a whole, would be helped dramatically if there was a conscious drive by the people of Ireland to change the attitude in relation to the support of Irish goods.  At present we import 57 per cent of all goods used in this country and we supply only 43 per cent.  If we could increase that figure to 50 per cent it would mean that an extra £1 billion worth of home produced goods would be purchased.  High quality home produced goods and services are available.  In turn, that £1 billion would provide 30,000 jobs for our people.  Surely it is not too much to ask that we try to achieve that target. In the lead up to 1992, to accept Deputy Cullen's point, we should try to get that message across to the people.  When that is compared with the efforts of the IDA, CTT, SFADCo, Údarás na Gaeltachta, Aer Rianta, Aer Lingus and so on, it is a very high goal and one which we must aim at as a Government and as a people. <Col N="1982" /> This goes far beyond Government initiatives and encouragement; it is as a people that we must rally behind the promotion of the excellent goods and services we are selling on the world market.</P>
      <P>The world market does not owe Ireland a living.  This year we have succeeded in selling over £12 billion worth of goods abroad.  If we can sell these goods abroad why can we not sell them at home?  I can assure the House that a far greater effort will be made in the future to complement the efforts of the Minister of State with responsibility for trade and marketing who has been so active in this area in the 20 months since he has been appointed.</P>
      <P>In relation to the point made about the role of science and technology, the House will be aware that this role was clearly laid down and defined in legislation.  It is being pursued vigorously by Eolas in addition to the wide range of programmes operated by them.  The Government science and technology development programme is spearheading development in a number of areas.  Again, the Minister responsible, Deputy Seán McCarthy, has been very active in this whole area and in encouraging Eolas to get involved in research and development in new technology so that we can get our indigenous and exporting industries in place for the challenges of the future.  We want to be able to take advantage of the opportunities that will be presented to us in the future, particularly by a rapidly expanding market in the EC.</P>
      <P>As far as CTT and their role is concerned, I should like to state that as a new Minister I must look at the agency to see if everything is being done according to the needs of the country rather than checking to see if the agencies are performing as they did before.  It is not enough to provide extra money for them or to deal with matters on a day to day basis.  What I intend to do is to consider all the agencies under my Department, including CTT.  When I mention CTT I must state that a national marketing plan is about to be launched and that body have played a major role in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I share Deputy Cullen's view in relation to 1992.  There is so much talk <Col N="1983" /> about 1992 that one would think nothing is going to happen between now and then. That is not the attitude being taken by the Government in their publicity campaigns and the series of meetings being organised by every Government Minister.  We are continuing to put the message across to industry that preparations for 1992 should be undertaken now.  By the end of this year, for example, 50 per cent of all the directives dealing with industry and the change that will take place in 1992 will have been passed by the Community.</P>
    <P>As far as the position of Kilkenny Design Workshops is concerned, I accept Deputy Cullen's comments that measures have been put in place in Kilkenny city in regard to the buying of the shops and so on.  I also share the point made in relation to job losses.  One of our goals has to be not just job creation but also job maintenance and it is in that regard that the support of Irish goods is needed. Yesterday a novel scheme was launched, the patron and mentor scheme.  Under the patron scheme, major companies, plc's and private companies, will adopt, so to speak, small indigenous companies and try to help them with management expertise.  With the mentor programme we will use the experience of retired executives, again for the benefit of smaller companies.  We want to try to keep these companies in operation in order to maintain employment.  It is no good creating jobs on the one hand if, on the other, we are losing them.  Thankfully we have reversed that trend in the last 12 months.  The labour force survey of April showed that there were 6,000 more at work than the previous year, the first time that has happened for many years past.  Again I am anticipating, through the Small Industries Division of my Department and the jobs targeted in the <i>Programme for National Recovery,</i> a successful year in 1988.</P>
    <P>I thank Deputies for their contributions. I thank Deputy Cullen for his congratulations on my appointment.  I can assure him that I and my two Ministers of State will be available to any <Col N="1984" /> Member of the House on any issue which they feel would in any way produce extra jobs.  Jobs must be our target, not merely as a Government, but as a country, and we are open to any assistance or advice we can receive no matter from what quarter it emanates.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJoeCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Heretofore some developers were allowed to run riot and exploit taxpayers' money claiming compensation for planning permissions refused by local authorities.  In my constituency the Red Rock site in Sutton is a prime example. This site is unique.  It is one of the few unspoiled sites on the north side of Dublin city frequented by thousands of Dubliners.  The scenic walks of the Howth peninsula begin from that site. The building of houses on that site would ruin the area forever and would open up the Howth peninsula to speculative builders and developers who do not give a damn about the environment.  It would result in the rape of every green space in the Howth area, leading to a Hong Kong-type development in the area.  This site was owned by the same person since the early fifties.  Land in the area was fetching less than £500 per acre at that time. Sutton Park, not far from Red Rock, containing 82 acres, fetched £27,000 when put on the market in 1972.  This site, containing under 10 acres, was the subject of a compensation claim for £2.105 million through a purchase notice served on Dublin County Council. Dublin County Council defended the claim and, when the case came before the courts, the developer dropped the price to £800,000.  Dublin County Council were compelled to swop land with the developer valued at £600,000 and pay him £125,000 in cash.  I hope the Minister can assure me that the provisions of this <Col N="1985" /> Bill will prevent these types of outrageous claims.  If the Minister can give me that assurance, then I can welcome the Bill.</P>
      <P>I welcome the provisions of section 14. However, I would encourage the Minister to amend the Bill, making the provisions of this section retrospective, in other words, to include all existing claims now before Dublin County Council. Under the provisions of section 25 an arbitrator cannot assume that services are available.  I would welcome those provisions if the Minister could assure me that an arbitrator cannot disregard zoning or assume that sewers and other services are available.</P>
      <P>I might take this opportunity to congratulate the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Noel Treacy, on having made an order which establishes Baldoyle estuary as a nature reserve.  This welcome order was made following strong representations from the Baldoyle Estuary Preservation Society, supported by Dr. Richard Nairn of the Irish Wildlife Conservancy and many other bodies, such as residents' associations, who wish to preserve fast-diminishing amenity areas.  Following a motion I tabled in Dublin County Council, seconded by a councillor of the Minister's party, Councillor Liam Greaven, the council, by a majority vote, requested the Minister to make that order.  I thank him for that.  However, it will not guarantee 100 per cent protection of this amenity.  The Planning Authority and An Bord Pleanála are exempted under section 12 of the Wildlife Act.  What is now needed is a special amenity area order to fully protect this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The estuary was the subject of a planning battle with a developer who wished to build 2,500 houses on the old Baldoyle racecourse.  That developer proposed a sewerage disposal or toll system which would run through Baldoyle estuary and discharge off Portmarnock beach. However, residents' associations and community groups combined, through objections to Dublin Corporation and a public hearing of An Bord Pleanála, defeated that outrageous proposal.  We now need a special amenity area order to <Col N="1986" /> protect Baldoyle estuary and the Howth peninsula.  Dublin County Council are considering a special amenity area order for the Portmarnock area.  That should be extended to include the Baldoyle estuary and Howth peninsula.  However, special amenity area orders take a long time to process.  I would ask that the Minister would include, in planning legislation, a more efficient and faster method of processing such orders.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer briefly to the lack of proper planning.  Here I should like to instance the sewage disposal system which services the north side of Dublin city.  The system to which I refer is the north Dublin drainage scheme.  This sewer starts at Finglas and services every housing and industrial estate on Dublin's north side, discharging raw sewage at the nose of Howth.  This sewerage finds its way onto Dollymount beach, Burrow beach and Sutton and Portmarnock beaches and Donabate strand.  I understand that this is a screen system and, if we are to have clean water in Dublin Bay, it is imperative that a proper sewerage disposal system be incorporated in the north Dublin drainage scheme.  A similar system has been installed on the south side of the city.  I am aware it would cost a lot of money.  But, if we are to have beaches which merit the European blue flag for clean beaches and not have the pollution witnessed on north side beaches this summer, we must find the money immediately to remedy this danger to people's health.</P>
    <P>Another serious problem is the lack of a proper water supply on the north side of the city.  Week in, week out residents of Howth village, Howth peninsula, Baldoyle and Sutton complain of interrupted full pressure water supply.  This is caused because the present water supply system cannot adequately provide for the number of dwellings erected in the area over the past ten years.  The Dublin County Manager proposes to submit a scheme shortly for the replacement of old, corroded mains.  A new water pump was recently installed in the Sutton area. However, this poor infrastructure cannot cater for all dwellings in the area.  Proper <Col N="1987" /> planning, with a special amenity area order, is urgently needed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>
      <P>The scandal that has obtained in recent years in the area of compensation for refusal of planning permission has been well and truly documented. I compliment the Minister and the Government on having introduced this long overdue Bill.</P>
      <P>The orderly development of our towns, cities and amenities is in everybody's interest.  That was recognised as far back as the turn of the century when formal planning did not take place until 1934 by way of the Town and Regional Planning Act.  That Act was subsequently amended and updated by more recent Acts.  The rapid changes experienced since 1934 and the growth in our population have meant that that Act had to be amended.  The orderly planning to be seen in this country is in marked contrast with the disorder abundantly evident in some major urban areas of the Third World.  These Planning Acts should be updated constantly.  Indeed where legislative weaknesses are being abused by individuals or organisations it is incumbent on the Minister for the Environment to introduce legislation such as this.</P>
      <P>I am glad the Minister has agreed to accept amendments to this complex Bill on Committee Stage.  He so intimated in the course of his remarks on Second Stage.  The whole question of planning and of planning permission is one in which every public representative has an input.  However, this Government must consider the abuses of section 4 of the County Managers Act.  Some local authorities use this section a lot.  I compliment the county councils and urban councils in general for the mature manner in which they used this section although certain county councils have abused the Act.  I am not sure whether it comes within the ambit of the Minister in this Planning Bill to do anything about that but the whole question of the role of local authorities in relation to planning must be seriously looked at some time in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I compliment the Minister for bringing <Col N="1988" /> this legislation forward and I wish it a speedy passage through both Houses.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>Brevity seems to be the order today.  Our spokesman on the Environment dealt extensively on Second Stage with this Bill as have other speakers so I will not delay the Minister in concluding this Stage.  However, I must make a few comments since I would like to think that a Bill which I introduced in Private Members' Time in May last, moved the Minister in getting on with considering legislation in this whole area to the extent that the Minister has now produced a Bill.  At the time, the Minister had promised a Bill in the following session which would have been a year ago. The Minister having rashly promised legislation at very short notice perhaps saw the difficulties of introducing a comprehensive Bill such as this.  I do not take the Minister to task for not producing the Bill last year.</P>
      <P>There are many difficulties in producing a Bill to amend and consolidate the law on planning compensation.  Over many years Ministers have recognised the difficulties in this whole area and attempts to bring in legislation have withered because of the difficulties faced.  At least we can give the Minister credit for coming in here with a Bill which attempts to tackle the problems.</P>
      <P>Having read the Bill on several occasions I am of the opinion that we do not need to amend the Planning Acts with regard to the compensation provisions. What we really need is an amendment of the Constitution, specifically the part relating to property rights, so that the common good could be more specifically stated and social justice in that whole area would be underlined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When one sees the escape routes allowable under this Bill to the speculators and get rich quick merchants one realises that it will not have the impact it was hoped it would have, in dealing with people who have over the years exploited the constitutional provisions relating to the ownership of property for their own benefit. People have the right to develop property but on all too many occasions <Col N="1989" /> the people who made the quick buck had no interest in this country, in its people or in the land.  I hoped that this Bill would end the activity of such speculators, but having considered the Bill I feel it will not tackle the problems.  It may produce some small additional obstacles but at the end of the day we need to go back to the population and seek an amendment to the property rights in the Constitution. In the long term it is the only way to deal with the areas this Bill endeavours to tackle.</P>
    <P>This Bill certainly does not protect the local authorities against speculators in their already powerless financial positions. It will be somewhat more difficult for speculators to operate but because of the terms of the Constitution a Bill cannot stop the operations of speculators.</P>
    <P>The main flaw in the Bill which has been adverted to on several occasions is in paragraph 9 of its Third Schedule. Paragraph 9 of the Third Schedule provides that permission may be refused without compensation where the development would contravene materially any development objective of the development plan which was in operation at the time when the applicant for planning permission acquired his interest in the land.  This provision will apply to interests acquired in land otherwise than by inheritance or family settlement subsequent to 20 October 1988, the date of publication of the Bill.</P>
    <P>That negatives a great deal of the thrust of the Bill in dealing with the problems I hoped would have been addressed, namely, the escape route for so many people who had acquired land in the past by exploitation and who can and will for many years to come continue that exploitation despite the operation of this Bill.  A company in existence before 20 October 1988 with land to develop can continue in existence <i>ad infinitum.</i> As in the &ldquo;Brook&rdquo;, men may come and men may go but the company goes on for ever.  The shareholders and directors may change but the ownership of the company continues and the entity continues.  Well meaning people who bought land before October may for some reason be taken <Col N="1990" /> over and sold out, and a different set of attitudes may exist in the company and that may lead to exploitation under paragraph 9 of the Third Schedule.</P>
    <P>Taking that into account and the fact that an inheritance or family settlement has no limit to it, this part of the Bill opens up the possibility of a way of getting around the good intentions of the Bill.  This shows the weaknesses and the Minister cannot really bring in a comprehensive Bill on compensation under the Planning Acts unless the Constitution is changed.  When we introduced our Private Members' Bill in May 1987 we were aware that there could be a constitutional attack on that Bill.  The Minister refused to accept the Bill for that reason and suggested that the advice given to him by his legal advisers was that the Bill would not stand up to a constitutional attack on it.</P>
    <P>In order to make this Bill acceptable under the Constitution, the Minister has had to make so many exceptions and allow so many loopholes that it negatives the real intent that we hoped would be there.  The Third Schedule, paragraph 9, is an important area which flaws the Bill to such an extent as to make it a very pale shadow of what we expected to see before us.  Even people who acquire land after 20 October can make use of some conspiratorial activity and to make very large sums of money certain individuals will go to great lengths in this respect. One can find that arrangements have been made with inheritors or owners of land which can be quite unknown to the planning authorities.  Applications could be put in under original names with the real ownership and real benefit of planning applications after 20 October not being known, and compensation would be paid out.</P>
    <P>The Minister will have an answer to my next question but I hope it will be adequate.  There is a difficulty for local authorities who have to give planning permission which may attract compensation if a development covers land in the ownership of two or more people. Under this Bill, one of those owners may have been an owner before 20 October <Col N="1991" /> 1988 and one or more may have become owners after that date.  Would the Minister explain to me and to the House what the situation would be if the person who had the land before October 1988 successfully claims compensation because of a refusal by the planning authorities or An Bord Pleanála whereas any other individual who came into ownership after that date cannot?  Even with this Bill the matter may be open to constitutional attack.  Perhaps the Minister will at least remove that doubt about unfairness from my mind.</P>
    <P>I looked forward to this Bill because, among other reasons, it led to my introducing the Planning (Trees and Woodlands) Bill to which my party gave full support.  We hoped it would help to stop the despoilation of trees and woodlands which had occurred in Coolattin.  On that occasion the Minister was advised that the Bill would probably fail under constitutional attack and he could not accept it.  He was not prepared then to take the chance of accepting the Bill but amending it.  We waited to see what provisions he would introduce in this new Bill to meet the possibility of further erosion of the woodlands throughout the country.  I must say that what we find in the Bill fails totally to deal with a situation like that in Coolattin.  It may make it a little more difficult for Bridge Farm or companies like that to continue what they have been doing but I can assure the Minister that they will continue their operation.  It has in no way solved the problem of Coolattin. This was a problem that the people of Wicklow and those from all over the country who were particularly interested in our woodlands had documented over several years.  Those interests will be terribly disappointed with the provisions of this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Schedule which points out how the Bill will apply is very weak, indeed. Section 21 deals specifically with trees and woodlands.  In that section compensation may be claimed where the trees are declared to be of special amenity value or interest.  As far as I know, trees included in that section are individual <Col N="1992" /> specimens or very small numbers of trees and not woodlands.  Woodlands would have to be replanted.  Preservation of a proportion of the trees comprising woodlands not being greater than 20 per cent is specified as an essential condition of the consent because of special amenity value or of special interest.  The phasing of the felling or extraction of trees comprising woodlands over a period of up to 20 years is specified as an essential condition because of the special amenity value or special interest.</P>
    <P>That does not at all take into account what we were discussing in May and June of last year.  It certainly does not apply to the entire Tomnafinnsoge Wood with 67 acres of oaks, but to only 20 per cent of that woodland.  The location of that percentage, apparently, can be decided on by the owners.  They can reduce the woodland into little strips in order to take away 80 per cent of it.  This can be done over 20 years, although that is an improvement.  However, 20 years in the case of the replanting of oaks is a very short time indeed.  There will be no apprearence of any plantation between those strips in the 20 year period if that is the decision made by the developer.  I well accept that this is an area that could be amended on Committee Stage.  Nevertheless, that whole area dealing with woodlands is a disappointment.  Deputy Roche in the House in 1987 contended that the Minister would deal with the matter very comprehensively.  In a Bill such as this he has found, as others have done before him including myself, that it is very difficult indeed to deal with the Constitution.  To that extent the Bill is totally inadequate and the difficulties in dealing with that particular problem are well shown up.</P>
    <P>In the Second Schedule dealing with, I think, section 15 of the Act, the provisions of sections 56 and 57 of the Principal Act are re-enacted, specifying classes of development in respect of which the refusal of planning permission will not attract compensation.  One of these is development in an area to which a special amenity area order relates.  If that was the solution to all our problems, <Col N="1993" /> if the passing of a special amenity area order would stop compensation having to be paid, surely this is worth considering further for woodlands like Coolattin and other areas of beauty which might be named for planning permission followed by a refusal by a local authority, thereby attracting compensation.  Would the Minister please comment on that?  It seems too simplistic a suggestion to apply a special amenity area order to stop development, or to stop the award of compensation.  Would the Minister explain the meaning of that section?</P>
    <P>One other section which interests me, a very small section, has not been commented upon by anybody else, to my knowledge.  It is section 20 which provides for compensation for damages suffered when a hedge is removed or altered as a result of notice under section 44 of the Principal Act.  We do not like to see hedges being removed as, generally, they have been there for many years.  Hedgerows &mdash; the old English word &mdash; are a feature of my constituency and it is sad to see them being removed because of expanding agricultural activity.  If a local authority requires somebody to remove a hedge to improve the view on a road, will they be required to pay compensation? Deputy Jacob and I sit on the same planning committee and we know that local authorities are endeavouring to make developers grow hedges to cover up developments which may intrude on the landscape.  It is interesting to note that local authorities may have to pay compensation if, in the interests of safety, they order a hedge to be removed.</P>
    <P>The Minister has tried, in the Bill, to collate planning laws in relation to compensation. There are many good provisions in the Bill but its main purpose is to amend and consolidate the law on planning compensation and to deal with the difficulties discussed by other speakers at great length throughout this debate.  The Bill fails in this regard.  In many other respects it is a good Bill and many of the improvements included in it are overdue.  Perhaps the Minister was not as busy in the Department of the Environment as I was in office.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1994" /> As I said, the main purpose of the Bill is to consolidate the law on compensation and in that respect it has failed.  Deputy Quinn, our spokesman, said we will be opposing it.  If the Bill passes Second Stage we will be tabling a number of amendments on Committee Stage to improve it.  The Bill is a great disappointment considering the promises made in May and June 1987.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AndrewBoylan" hpid="Mr. Boylan Mr. Boylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this opportunity to make a brief contribution to the Bill.  I have been listening to the comments made over the last number of weeks.  I noted that many Deputies were anxious to contribute.  Their remarks were very constructive and proper planning control is very important.  If there is not strict control, everything else falls out of line.  Generally, I welcome the Bill although it does not solve all our problems. I am sure that amendments will be tabled which the Minister will take on board.</P>
      <P>Many of the problems in our cities and towns in regard to development are caused by Government policy driving people into towns and villages when there is ample space in rural areas for them to develop, to build nice homes and to live in a clean atmosphere.  Of course, services would have to be provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 13 refers to compensation. Speculators try to use the law to make a killing out of a local authority and that must be stopped at all costs.  It has not spread to the country yet but, obviously, it is a problem in Dublin.  One case involving a large amount of compensation is under appeal at present and, if successful, the rot could spread very quickly.  There are no grounds for a development company being entitled to compensation if they are not allowed to connect to the local water and sewerage facilities.  If a local authority provide these facilities, they immediately increase the valuation of the land.  Unfortunately, some development companies see that as an opportunity of using facilities provided by the State and indeed they should be asked to make a contribution if they use the facilities.  Too much is expected of <Col N="1995" /> local authorities in providing these services. It is hard enough to provide for their own housing needs.  In my county, local authorities generally look at the overall development that might take place in the years ahead and the costs involved in providing services.</P>
    <P>There can be a refusal of planning permission when building would cause serious air or water pollution or pollution connected with the disposal of waste. That is a major, serious problem and an industrial development company would not be entitled to compensation if they were refused planning permission on those grounds.  I have evidence that we are not strict enough in applying the law in regard to pollution and disposal from industry.  Industry is badly equipped to dispose of their waste products.  They allow them to drain into rivers and streams in the afternoons and at night when the industry is closed.  Our pollution officers should pay attention to this.</P>
    <P>Planning permission may also be refused where the development would materially contravene the objective of a development plan which was in operation at the time the developer acquired his interest in the land.  A development company could not expect compensation for a refusal where the local authority had a different plan for the area.  The local authority must have full knowledge as to how their area will develop.  This could be done in conjunction with the local elected representatives who know what people want in their area.  It would apply to industrial development, housing or a green area which would provide parks and playgrounds, which are very important.</P>
    <P>I listened with interest to Deputy Kitt the other evening when he spoke about a very famous football pitch in Dublin city about which there has been a lot of talk.  I have no doubt that down the years many people put a lot of effort into providing that facility and it would be a pity to see somebody taking over that pitch to build houses or flats.  How much better off and happier people would be if they <Col N="1996" /> moved into the suburbs or into the country where they would have more space.  I do not understand this mentality of bringing people into the centre of our towns and cities.</P>
    <P>Recently I was in Holland which has a population of 15 million.  Amsterdam has a population similar to that of Dublin, and Ireland has a population of three and a half million people.  Planning in Holland ensures that no one region will become stronger than another and all regions have the same input to development. That cannot be said about Ireland.  Our capital city and our larger cities are getting major injections of capital funds for development but the west, north and north-east are being neglected and depopulated.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 15 of the Fourth Schedule deals with planning permission without compensation relating to the preservation of buildings of artistic, architectural or historical interest.  That is very important.  For far too long old buildings which could never be replaced were knocked down.  Many of these were of historical interest and could easily have been restored with a little thought and planning.  They were replaced by what I would call plastic buildings which did not blend into the area.  I see no reason the planning authority should pay compensation to anybody who is asked to restore a building to its original state. That is one aspect of this Bill to which I give my total support.</P>
    <P>We had an instance of this in my county where the courthouse had fallen into disrepair. We decided to save the building rather than replace it with a modern single storey building.  Now the work is nearly completed and many people who objected at the early stages and said the cost was prohibitive now realise that we took the right decision because the building is a great addition to the town.</P>
    <P>Another area I am very interested in preserving is trees, hedgerows and plants. This is vitally important.  At one time too many people were inclined to clear a wooded area and build there.  Many architects and engineers put a lot of thought into developing certain areas. <Col N="1997" /> They built houses in beautiful settings ensuring that people there had a great deal of privacy.  These far-seeing people did not bring in the chain saws to knock down in five minutes what it took 150 years to grow &mdash; oak trees, chestnut trees, sycamore trees and so on.  Unfortunately far too many of these trees are disappearing from our countryside.</P>
    <P>I was interested in what Deputy Kavanagh had to say about a local authority being liable to pay compensation if it was decided that hedgerows would have to be moved in the interests of safety.  It is sad if hedgerows have to be moved but I can understand that this might be necessary to improve our roads.  If hedgerows have to be moved or cut back, I see no reason why a new hedgerow could not be planted, and I would insist on that being part of the plan submitted to the council.</P>
    <P>With regard to development outside our towns, the Government should provide initiatives.  I would put this on a par with a party, where, when the music starts nobody gets up to dance but when the first couple take the floor, others soon follow.  If young couples were encouraged to move from our towns or cities and build bungalows in country areas, grants could be given.  When the first bungalow is built, other people will be attracted to the area.  In the past 15 to 20 years excellent group water schemes have been provided throughout the country.  This means that sewerage facilities would not be a problem but there is a problem providing electricity.  It is a scandal that a young couple with the initiative to move into a country area and build a bungalow would be expected to carry the total cost of providing electricity to their home &mdash; maybe five, six or seven pole lengths at a cost of from £1,200 to £6,000.  This is a burden no young couple should be expected to carry.  It is stipulated that any further development between the bungalow and the point of connection to the electric power would mean that compensation would be paid by the newcomers to the couple.  It is wrong that that young couple should be expected to carry that cost.  The State should step in <Col N="1998" /> and electricity supplies should be provided at a nominal cost.</P>
    <P>Our county roads would not encourage a young couple to drive into the country to see a site, never mind build a bungalow. The Government will have to take their share of the blame for the state of our county roads.</P>
    <P>In my view it would be wrong that the local authorities should be held up to ransom by speculators.  I would not condone that.  The local authorities should be given every protection because they do not have the finance to fight off this type of speculator.  It would be a great pity if the local authorities, in case they might have to pay heavy compensation costs, did not provide proper planning in the areas for which they are responsible.</P>
    <P>I compliment all the other speakers who made very constructive contributions which I hope will help to improve planning and development.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>My contribution will be brief.  I am glad to have the opportunity to speak on this Bill which is long awaited and welcome because it brings all the elements and requirements of planning under the umbrella of one single piece of legislation.  On this point alone, apart from the meritorious aspects of the Bill, the Minister is to be lauded and complimented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For many years the provisions of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Acts relating to compensation have given rise to considerable public disquiet.  Many issues which have arisen have resulted in court decisions which have had the effect of weakening the efficiency of our planning legislation which was enacted in the interests of the common good for the proper planning and development of our living environment. Awards of compensation against planning authorities as a result of planning decisions have weakened the role of such authorities as guardians and planners of our amenities.  Some of these decisions were taken by An Bord Pleanála who are not liable to pay compensation. It is quite equitable that the 1963 Act should contain provisions for <Col N="1999" /> the payment of compensation to protect the constitutional rights of property owners adversely affected by planning decisions.  However, it is also necessary that there be limitations on the extent of protection afforded in view of the basic principle of the Act which I quote: &ldquo;An Act to make provision in the interest of the common good for the proper planning and development...&rdquo;.  It is the extent of the limitations in the 1963 Act which has resulted in numerous, often divergent, instances of case law.</P>
    <P>The Local Government (Planning and Development) (No. 2) Bill, 1988 aims to amend and consolidate the law on compensation and to amend the sanitary services code so as to tie it in with the modern planning process.  The Bill repeals the compensation provisions of the 1963 Act and relates these provisions with amendments whereby planning authorities may refuse or attach conditions to a planning permission without incurring a liability to compensation. Moreover, this is achieved having regard to the right of individuals, bearing in mind the need to act in the interest of the common good.</P>
    <P>The main features of the Bill are as follows: (1) development may be refused without liability to compensation not just where water supplies or sewerage facilities are deficient but where capacity is required for prospective other development; (2) development may also be refused without liability to compensation if it is premature, by reference to any order of priority for development indicated in the development plan.  The reason for this provision is that the exclusion of compensation under section 56(2) of the 1963 Act in cases refused through prematurity by reference to deficiency in existing services did not cover the situation where the capacity of existing services was required for prospective other development of greater priority, including local authority development; (3) refusal of planning permission which would cause serious air pollution; water pollution or pollution connected with the disposal of waste will be non-compensatable.  This <Col N="2000" /> expands the existing provisions to take into account situations which have become much more prevalent than they were in 1963 and require specific listing as non-compensatable rather than relying on the more general public health grounds previously used; (4) compensation will be excluded where planning permission is refused because development would materially contravene an objective of a development plan which was in operation at the time the developer acquired his interest in the land.  This provision will apply to land acquisitions arising after the date of publication of this Bill, with the exception of acquisitions by inheritance or by family settlement; (5) conditions may be attached to a planning permission without compensation in relation to the preservation of buildings or artistic, architectural or historical interest or features of such interest which form part of the interior of structures; (6) and this is an area in which I am particularly interested, tree preservation orders made embodying conditions without compensation, requiring a proportion of woodlands to be preserved or the felling of trees to be phased.  This provision is essential for the preservation of our indigenous woodlands which are under serious threat as the present compensation situation has posed such a serious financial difficulty to planning authorities that they may have had to allow wholesale felling.</P>
    <P>We are all too familiar with what has happened in my county to the famed Coolattin woods.  In Wicklow, in the Shillelagh area, we saw in recent years the rape of our God-given heritage.  We saw the great oak woods of Coolattin ravaged at the convenience and discretion of the speculator.  We saw these great vintage oaks being indiscriminately felled and exported solely for the purpose of lining the pockets of individuals.  We saw the complete absence of any sensible planned programme.  We saw no properly rescheduled replanting for the benefit of posterity, for the wellbeing and consideration of the generations to come. We saw no economic spin-off for the Shillelagh hinterland, for the county of <Col N="2001" /> Wicklow, and we saw no consideration afforded to the national interest.</P>
    <P>While this devastation was going on, while the great oak woods of Coolattin were being plundered, the local authority, namely Wicklow County Council, could do nothing but stand back and look on.  They had to stand idly by and watch this wrong being perpetrated under their very eyes because they were rendered powerless to prevent it.  The legislation at the council's disposal was so inept, so porous and so totally and completely inadequate that these so-called local powers that be had to cower back in trepidation.  The big stick of compensation was held over their heads and the proper legislation which could and should have been at the disposal of the local authority was simply not there. Rather was it in the corner of and at the convenience of the speculator.  I am glad to say one spring morning in 1987 our present Taoiseach and our present Minister for the Environment arrived into the village of Shillelagh in an effort to halt this carnage and between them they knocked a few heads together and perhaps, albeit temporarily, succeeded in setting some machinery in motion&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;to save these great oaks.  That area is called Tomnafinnogue Wood.  Now, thanks to the initiative of the present Minister, Deputy Flynn, section 21 will provide planning authorities with real power in this regard.  As I have said, I am particularly interested in this part of the Bill.  My County Wicklow colleague, Deputy Kavanagh, mentioned it when he was speaking.  I am concerned and anxious to hear the Minister reassure me on that point later.  This provision is essential for the preservation of our indigenous woodlands which are under serious threat as the present compensation situation has posed such serious financial difficulty to planning authorities that the wholesale felling has had to go on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another amendment in the Bill is the <Col N="2002" /> very necessary and overdue repeal of section 24 of the Public Health (Ireland) Act, 1978.  As a result, connection to public sewers will no longer obtain as a right of the person connecting.  It will be subject to consent of the sanitary authority. The right of supply of water for domestic purposes will no longer obtain in the case of unauthorised development. Experience of planning authorities over the years has underlined the need for these amendments which will also assist in limiting cases where compensation claims could arise.</P>
    <P>I welcome wholeheartedly this Bill which has such major implications for the future of our people in our beautiful country.  I congratulate the Minister on his compilation and introduction of the Bill and I trust it will pass into law as expeditiously as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Taking up on Deputy Jacob's remarks, if this Bill is to pass into law it will need major revisions on Committee Stage. Deputy Keating, on Second Stage, pointed out to the Minister that we on this side of the House are very unhappy with certain aspects of this Bill and, of course, intend putting down many amendments on Committee Stage to make it more meaningful legislation.  At the moment in relation to the main substantive issue which this Bill addresses it is fundamentally flawed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>According to the Explanatory Memorandum the main purpose of the Bill is to amend and consolidate the law on planning compensation. The awarding of huge sums in compensation to applicants refused planning permission on the grounds that their plans contravened certain aspects of the local development plan was nothing short of a scandal.  It is not right that such people should be entitled to massive sums of money.  The Minister will acknowledge that the Progressive Democrats introduced a Bill last May to tackle the question of compensation.  At that time the Minister suggested that we should withdraw our Bill on the grounds that he would be introducing a similar measure within a short time.  He accepted <Col N="2003" /> that such legislation was necessary and, according to the Official Report, volume 380, column 214, he said the legislation he would introduce would remove the liability for compensation in any case where the refusal of permission was on the grounds that the proposed development would conflict with an objective of the development plan.</P>
    <P>The Minister has not introduced measures that would underpin his promise in the House last May.  Section 13 provides that compensation will be excluded where planning permission is refused because the development would contravene materially any objective of a development plan which was in operation at the time when the developer acquired his interest in the land.  That provision will apply to land acquisitions otherwise than by inheritance or family settlement, arising after the date of the publication of the Bill, 20 October 1988.  If that provision is passed the Minister will be recognising that a refusal by a planning authority of planning permission on the grounds that a plan contravenes a development plan should not be compensatable. However, the Minister states that a person who owns the land prior to 20 October last is entitled to compensation. That, in my view, makes a complete nonsense of the objective of addressing the compensation issue in a meaningful way.  Not alone does that provision apply to those who own the land prior to 20 October but it also applies to their heirs and their heirs.  That means that for many years to come the owners of such land will be entitled to compensation. That is a major loophole and it indicates that the Minister is not living up to the undertaking he gave in the House last May.</P>
    <P>Companies who owned such land prior to 20 October will, in selling their shares, effectively transfer the ownership of the land to another party.  We are all aware that most property development is carried out by companies and I do not see the Bill prohibiting them from obtaining substantial sums of money in compensation. In other words, the Bill is a <Col N="2004" /> farce because it does not guarantee that a refusal on the grounds of contravening an objective of a development plan will not be compensatable.  That is not what we want and it is our intention to table an amendment to deal with it on Committee Stage.  We will be urging the Minister to amend the section.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge that there are useful provisions in the Bill.  They are not tied to a time limit.  Development may be refused without liability to compensation not just where water supplies or sewerage facilities are actually deficient, but also where their capacity is required for prospective other development.  That is useful, as is the provision that development may also be refused without liability to compensation if it is premature by reference to any order of priority for development indicated in a development plan.  Some of the claims for compensation would have been refused if those provisions had been enacted.  I am glad those loopholes have been closed and that there is no qualification on them.</P>
    <P>We all have heard of the massive claims lodged with local authorities arising out of a refusal to grant planning permission. Many of the claims do not succeed and I understand that in the region of £100,000 has been paid out in the greater Dublin area on foot of such claims.  However, local authorities confronted with claims for compensation are forced into granting an applicant the permission he is seeking in the first instance in order to ensure that they will not have to make major payments.  Under the present law most of those claims for compensation would succeed.  I am sure the Minister will agree that that is not an orderly or proper way for planning and development to proceed. It is equivalent to having a gun to the head of a planning authority.  It is unfortunate that as a result of that predicament there have been major contraventions of development plans and a hotch-potch approach to the whole question of planning and development.  There is not much point in setting down standards in a development plan if a person is able to drive a coach-and-four through them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2005" /> I should like to refer to a number of provisions that were included in the Bill produced by the Progressive Democrats but have not been written into the Minister's Bill.  In our Bill we dealt with the problem of unfinished housing estates. There is no mechanism to deal adequately with such estates.  People have great difficulty in getting a builder or developer to comply with the terms of the planning permission and complete the roads, footpaths and open spaces in those estates.  Many young couples who have moved into new houses in estates in the Greater Dublin area, and other centres of population, are exasperated by the failure of builders or developers to comply with the obligations set out in the planning permission.  Some builders have been required to lodge a bond with the local authority to ensure that they complete the development, but although there is a threat that the bond may be used to complete the work, we still have a situation where an estate can remain in a status of not being taken in charge.  The bond has not been called into play, it has not been utilised and the frustration of the people in such estates goes on and on.</P>
    <P>There must be a way of addressing this problem.  In my experience the bond or money that is lodged with the local authority to ensure completion of an estate is normally not called upon, except in circumstances where a builder goes into receivership or liquidation.  Very often the amount of money that the developer lodged originally with the country council is totally inadequate to cover the costs of the outstanding works that need to be completed.  At the time the permission was granted &mdash; it could be several years old &mdash; the amount of money provided could be inadequate some years later.  In any event, there are major problems in this area and some provision should have been included in the Bill to cover the difficulty in which people find themselves.</P>
    <P>In our Bill, introduced last May, we had provided for a mechanism that, in our opinion, would assist greatly in this difficulty.  We felt it would be appropriate <Col N="2006" /> that a court, where it was considered reasonable that a developer should have completed the outstanding works on an estate, at a particular point in time, could appoint a planning receiver.  The receiver would then be entitled to sell off the assets of the developer and, indeed, to enter on the land, take possession of it, sell off the undeveloped portion or whatever assets he so wished and apply the proceeds to completing the outstanding works.  These works tend, in the main, to be footpaths, street lighting and open green spaces.  Environmentally the estate is in an appalling condition if these matters are not put in hand.</P>
    <P>If people want to sell their houses, having occupied them for several years, they have great difficulty in doing so.  It would be appropriate that at conveyancing stage, when the documents relating to the sale of the house are being sold, that certification should be produced confirming that the builder has complied with all aspects of the planning permission and, in particular, with the aspects of the permission that relate to the completion of the estate.</P>
    <P>Phased development is another factor that should be introduced more regularly into planning permissions.  If a large estate is completed section by section there is at least a prospect of ensuring that the sections of the estate are completed and brought up to the standard required before the balance of the estate is completed.  That was a provision we had in our Bill in May.  I am disappointed that the Minister has not addressed that issue.  He seems to be happy with the position which prevails at present.  As I have outlined, it is a chaotic situation and is causing great hardship and difficulty for many couples.  When the Minister is introducing legislation relating to the whole planning area it was an ideal opportunity for him to incorporate into that Bill the measures we had provided in our Bill.</P>
    <P>In relation to planning matters there are a few other items I would like to mention briefly.  We have what are known as section 4 motions passed by members of local authorities.  They can instruct the <Col N="2007" /> county manager to reverse a decision he had made in relation to any particular planning permission.  Unfortunately, these section 4 motions have resulted in some very poor developments in rural areas where there is now a lot of ribbon development which is highly undesirable and, of course, it would have been far better if that development had never taken place.  In many cases these are the direct result of section 4 motions having been passed by the elected representatives of the particular planning authority.  We are not suggesting that elected representatives of a local authority should not have such powers.  In order to ensure that there is more consensus about the way development occurs in rural areas we would recommend that the mejority required to pass a section 4 motion should be increased to a two-third majority of the elected representatives. In that way there would be less prospect of bad decisions being arrived at as a result of that form of obtaining planning permission and it would be more representative of the views of local representatives in any given area.</P>
    <P>We are also keen that there should be de-exemption.  At present the State, its agencies and, indeed, local authorities are exempted from applying for planning permission.  We feel that all development here, irrespective of who is undertaking that development, should be subject to the same laws.  Individuals and companies have to go through planning procedures, comply with the planning requirements and, indeed, with the by-law requirements, and State agencies and local authorities should similarly comply.  It should be compulsory for them to apply for planning permission in any developments they undertake.  The only exceptions that come to mind regarding the State would be facilities that are required for security or defence purposes, but above and beyond that all State agencies should have to comply.  I cite here in particular the ESB.  There is no obligation on the ESB to apply for planning permission to erect pylons.  They are a major <Col N="2008" /> scar on the countryside and environmentally they are causing a major problem. I am instancing the ESB as one of the State agencies that does not have to comply with the procedures of getting planning permission, having it vetted and having conditions applied.</P>
    <P>In the last 20 odd years, as we are all aware, there has been a major expansion in the Dublin area out into the western suburbs.  This expansion has brought its own problems.  We have heard about them many times in this House.  The Labour Party, some weeks ago, had a special motion in Private Members' Time addressing specifically the difficulties that are faced by the community who live in Tallaght.</P>
    <P>In the sixties, as a result of studies which were carried out by Professor Myles Wright, a decision was made that there should be three satellite towns on the western fringes of Dublin, namely, Tallaght, Clondalkin-Lucan and Blanchardstown.  There are many people who are convinced that Professor Myles Wright actually got his miles wrong when he made that decision and we are living with the adverse consequences of that decision ever since.  As we are aware, infrastructure development is still lagging very far behind, even though the houses have been provided in the towns I have mentioned.  The whole planning process in relation to those developments has been disastrous and people are forced to live in an environment that is highly unsatisfactory, where there are very few infrastructural resources available to them.</P>
    <P>It is my view and the view of my party &mdash; perhaps it is too late in terms of what needs to be done &mdash; that it would have been far better to concentrate expenditure on developing the city centre where the infrastructure exists, without going out into virgin countryside and displacing all the people from the city centre and having huge costs imposed because of extending infrastructure into the peripheral areas.  We will be supportive of any plans to restrict the growth of Dublin outwards.  In other words, we will be very supportive of the schemes <Col N="2009" /> which provide incentives to undertake development in inner city areas.  We would like to see these schemes extended so as to allow residential developments, as distinct from commercial development alone, take place.  Perhaps it is too late to talk about this aspect in the sense that a lot of development is already taking place, but to bring back life to the inner city, any housing to be provided in the future should be provided within the environs of the city and we should restrict the growth of Dublin outwards.</P>
    <P>I would now like to refer to the bureaucratic hurdles one has to jump when one applies for planning permission.  Most developers approach the planning process as if it was an obstacle course.  It is very unfortunate that they should approach that process in that frame of mind.  It really boils down to a question of the way in which the planning process is administered.  It seems to generate its own meaningless requirements.  My party feel that if an area is designated for housing, for instance, the developer should be allowed to design suitable house types, and that a passive approach should be adopted to any changes the developer may like to make in the design of the house type given the fact that the area in which he is building has been designated for residential development.</P>
    <P>If a builder wants to make a relatively minor change to the plans he submitted and received approval for, he effectively has to go through the whole planning process all over again.  The planning process can be very time consuming.  The builder must receive a reply within two months but one also has to take into account that a third party may object and as a result it may be necessary to have an appeal heard by An Bord Pleanála with perhaps a six months delay before the builder finally receives permission.  This is nonsensical where it has been clearly established that the builder is building in accordance with the objectives of the development plan in a certain section of the city which has been designated for residential development.  There could be up to a six months delay before a builder gets permission to make a minor change <Col N="2010" /> in the house type.  The same applies in the case of by-law approvals.  In the case of by-law approvals one has to submit their plans and specifications for approval and this is extremely time consuming and adds to the expense of the end product. Consequently, the consumer is lumbered with that also.</P>
    <P>At least it can be said of our built environment that we can undo it if it is quite disastrous.  Perhaps the much maligned bulldozer can be used creatively in the future to eliminate some of the abortions which have been erected but we cannot undo the damage which has been caused to the natural environment as a result of pollution.  The first and foremost objective of any planning legislation should be the protection of the natural environment.  We can undo any damage caused to the built environment although there are many examples where we have failed to do this.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, the substantive issue dealt with in the legislation introduced by the Minister is the compensation issue. In other words, this legislation would prevent the payment of compensation in circumstances similar to those where compensation was paid heretofore. While there would be some improvements in the present position as a result of this Bill it does contain one major flaw which I dealt with at some length in the earlier part of my contribution.  People would still be allowed to seek the payment of compensation where local authorities refuse to grant planning permission on the grounds that a development breaches the objectives of the development plan.  Those who owned land prior to 20 October last, and their heirs, would still be entitled to claim such compensation and because of this the Bill is fundamentally flawed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other Deputies I welcome the introduction of this Bill and would like to seek clarification from the Minister in respect of a number of sections.  In general, the main purpose of the Bill is to amend and consolidate the law on planning compensation.  The Bill also seeks to amend certain provisions of <Col N="2011" /> the sanitary services code so as to regulate connection of premises to public sewers and water supplies in a manner more consistent with the modern planning processes.  I would like to remind the Minister that many of the local authorities have not adhered to that objective. We have seen modern sewerage schemes erected in towns all along our seaboard but despite this sewage has been deposited into our bays without having been treated in a treatment plant.  Is it the Minister's intention to make it mandatory that all modern sewerage schemes be eligible for funds which are available from his Department to ensure that plants are erected for the treatment of raw sewage?  Enormous problems have been caused throughout the country in this respect.</P>
      <P>How can the Minister expect private individuals to adhere to the objectives the Minister has set out in this Bill when his Department will not answer the demands made by local authorities for funds to be made available for the erection of treatment plants, where necessary, in the major towns all along our seaboard so as to tackle the very serious pollution problem in our bays as a result of raw sewerage being deposited into our bays?  If the Minister is genuine in his attempts to streamline this planning and development Bill he must first and foremost start in his Department.  When the Minister is replying to this debate I should like him to respond to this request.  I know only too well the serious damage which is being caused by major sewerage plants which have been set up all over the country but which have no treatment plant attached to them.  We cannot allow this practice to continue because if we do we will kill off the attractiveness of bathing, fishing and living in many areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Planning decisions can be very controversial, particularly those in relation to commercial and private developments. The Minister must take steps to ensure that no matter what happens every application will be dealt with on its own merits.  No matter what type of pressure is put on him by individuals, and even by <Col N="2012" /> prominent individuals in his party, he must ensure that a very definite ruling is given in respect of every development.</P>

      <P>Environmental issues must be taken into account but there is a limit to conservation.  We must remember that we cannot live on fresh air and cold water.  I know they are the basic ingredients for living but we must have something else as well, otherwise our youth will have to emigrate.  I come from a constituency which has been devastated by emigration and where the old are dying out and the young are flying out.</P>
      <P>The Minister must have liberal aspirations so far as industrial development in rural Ireland is concerned.  It is a well known fact that industries have been centred in built-up areas &mdash; this is the policy that has been pursued for the past 20 years &mdash; such as Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Waterford and Galway.  What has been the result of over-industrialisation in those areas? The result has been a complete denuding of the population of rural Ireland &mdash; an exodus from rural Ireland to the bright lights of those towns and cities.  Satellite towns have sprung up overnight in those major cities and desolation has sprung up in rural Ireland.  That is poor planning in any terms.  What has been the result of this planning? There are smog problems in Dublin and Cork and atmospheric problems in every major city.  There are no atmospheric problems in rural Ireland because there are no industries there.  If industries were evenly channelled out, as they should be, between the western and eastern seaboards, between towns in the south-west and west and Dublin city and Cork we would not have the problems we have today.  This was bad planning on the part of successive Governments who failed purposely to arrest it and I am afraid the present Minister is also feeble in his efforts to arrest the problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am coming to that point.  Funds should be made available to correct deficiencies or damage by local authorities in promoting over-industrialisation in any area.  If this is not done I believe the purpose of the Bill will be defeated.  Section 21 provides for the replanting of woodlands as a condition of felling.  I agree with that provision.  I do not see why mature trees should not be cut down if the same species of tree or a similar species is replanted in their place. Because of our geographic situation this country is ideally suited for the growing of trees and we could grow some of the best timber in the world if the trees were planted.  The Minister must insist that whenever a mature tree is felled it is replaced by a sapling of the same species. In that way the next generation will be able to avail of proper planning, in other words, compensation for trees which have been felled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>State-sponsored bodies should be obliged by law to restore to its original description any property which has been damaged.  Like Deputy Pat O'Malley, I believe that the Electricity Supply Board should not be allowed to place pylons or electricity supply poles in scenic areas. It is important that underground cables should be used as far as possible.  No State-sponsored body should have the prerogrative of going ahead with their plans without first getting planning permission from the local authority.  It is vital for the preservation of Ireland that we ensure that State-sponsored bodies have to apply for planning permission on the same lines as an individual.  If there are objections to a development there should be a speedy process which the Minister can use in dealing with these objections. The Minister should know only too well the vacuum which has been left by another State-sponsored body, Bord na Móna, who have left cutout bogs in the midlands which are now full of weeds.  If obnoxious weeds are growing on a farmer's land he can be prosecuted but Bord na Móna have not replaced, as they should have, the cutout bogs and restored the area to the way it was before they entered it.  The Minister should ensure <Col N="2014" /> that as a State-sponsored body they are required to replant that area with trees, if possible, to make it more attractive for visitors and get rid of the briars, nettles and obnoxious weeds which are growing there at present.</P>
    <P>I should like to direct the Minister's attention to section 15 which provides that notwithstanding the provisions of sections 13 and 14 the Minister shall have discretion, subject to certain exceptions, to make an order enabling compensation to be paid if he is satisfied that it would not be just and reasonable in the particular circumstances that payment of compensation should be prevented.  This decision is not a good one and I maintain that the Minister should delete the provision. It should be left to the planning authorities to decide.  Although I have the greatest esteem for the Minister, I do not think any Minister should have the capacity to establish the compensation to be paid.</P>
    <P>This Bill is a step in the right direction. Let us hope that we can eliminate the anomalies in planning administration. We must make sure that proper planning laws prevail.</P>

      <P>Deputy Sheehan referred to the smog problem in Dublin. I am very proud to have been directly responsible, as a member of the then Government, for the decision to bring natural gas to Dublin.  It was done against very vigorous opposition and at considerable political cost to that Government. History will show that my decision was a valid one.  Although many critics offered various analyses of the cost structures involved in the deal to bring natural gas to Dublin, the cost of not having natural gas, which is a smokeless fuel, and of having infinitely more smog would be far greater.  These considerations put that decision in its true context as one of the most important decisions of this decade so far as environmental planning is concerned.  I belive it was one of the best and most courageous decisions of the Government of which I was proud to be a member between 1982 and 1987. <Col N="2015" /> It is important in introducing a contribution on a Bill of this kind to refer to the history of planning legislation.  There did exist a time before there was planning legislation.  Some of the best and most architecturally pleasing towns were planned before there were planners or planning departments in corporations. Georgian Dublin is essentially the result of private arrangements made by people without the requirement to obtain planning permission, yet it is a beautifully symetrical development which puts into the shade many of the results of the centralised planning operations we now have.</P>
      <P>Planning did not essentially come in until the late 19th century when it was used to regulate the height and width of streets.  The Housing and Town Planning Act of 1909 enabled county councils to make development plans and it became obligatory under the 1919 Act in respect of towns with a population in excess of 20,000.  Planning has become more and more intrusive ever since and we now have very heavy planning mechanisms.</P>
      <P>This Bill regulates the paying of compensation to people who did not get planning permission.  Let us consider that if there was not a requirement to obtain planning permission, if we did not have this tremendous State-imposed regulation of building, there would be no need to give people compensation for not getting planning permission.  We have the odd situation that the State has to pay out substantial sums of money because of controls which the State itself decided to impose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is accepted that we should have planning regulations and I would have to admit that I have not studied the subject in sufficient detail to be in a position to state categorically that we could do without our planning controls.  In a debate of this kind, should we not stand back and adopt what is known as a zero budget approach?  This they have done in the United States.  We start from the bottom line and consider whether, if we were doing the job all over again, we would start from here.  There are serious <Col N="2016" /> questions to be asked as to whether planning, as we conventionally understand it, is the right way to deal with environmental problems.</P>
    <P>There are substantial delays involved in obtaining planning permission and our system is one of the slowest in Europe. We will be competing in the post-1992 era with every other economy in Europe. Our service sector, just as our manufacturing sector, is competing directly with the other economies in Europe.  One amendment which might be introduced to this Bill would require the Minister for the Environment to report annually to the Dáil on how delays in obaining permission for commercial developments in this country compare with delays for similar developments in other member states. That would give some comparative data on how we compare in terms of speed in coming to a decision about planning matters.  I understand that it takes about four or five months to obtain planning permission for a major commercial development.</P>

These figures are based on a 1979 study of industrial development published by Slough Industrial Estates.  At that time it took eight months to obtain planning permission in Britain.  The British authorities have since done something to speed up the time in which planning permission will be granted for commercial developments. The Minister should undertake a major study to determine how well we compete as a planning administration &mdash; I speak collectively of the local authorities and Bord Pleanála &mdash; with other countries who are competing with us for service and manufacturing industry.  If the period of four months here is compared with six weeks in Belgium, then undoubtedly a <Col N="2017" /> business which wants to become established quickly in Europe will tend to want to go to Belgium rather than Ireland.  This is a problem which needs to be addressed throughout the country.  It is not good enough to say we will do something in respect of certain designated areas in Dublin or other urban areas such as down town Castlebar.  It is equally important that commercial development anywhere in the country should be facilitated speedily.</P>
      <P>Because of the operation of planning controls there is a certain professional élitism involved in the way in which people must go about obtaining planning permission.  People who are qualified in planning are the people who run the planning departments of corporations and county councils.  Therefore, people who want to get planning permission tend frequently to have to use the services of other people who are also qualified in planning activities and who previously may have been employees of planning departments of county councils or corporations. That creates a situation in which there is a planning élite talking the same language and there is an artificial advantage for people who use the services of those who are qualified in planning. In essence a sort of planning industry is created, which lives off the rest of the community.  This arises because of the professionalism that tends to dominate the minds of those who have been trained in planning.</P>
      <P>Given that this is a very heavily engineering-based profession, I do not think this is necessarily the best way in which decisions should be taken.  There is a danger here, as there is in other professions, of creating a dominant élite who are in a position to make a very good living for themselves because they control the access to certain rights of people and they have an exclusive competence in regard to particular types of information. It should be a matter of concern to anyone who wishes to be a critic, as I think we should all be, of any existing arrangements which cost money that there may be a dominance of this kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a number of alternatives to <Col N="2018" /> planning controls which might be considered. I am not making a systematic presentation as to how exactly this might work, nor am I suggesting that the entire planning Acts should be thrown out simply because I am suggesting alternatives but I hope the Minister and the Department will look at alternative ways of achieving the objectives of planning. Before outlining these I should mention what I understand to be the objectives of planning.  The main one is to prevent developments that are intrusive or cause nuisance to other people.  The other objective would be to maintain a certain aesthetic merit in the environment in which people live.  The main concern of planning legislation is in regard to nuisance caused to other people either by pollution, by interfering with their ancient lights or with any of their other rights such as access to their premises and so on.</P>
    <P>Let us remember that people were anxious to ensure that their ancient lights are not interfered with or that their environment is not polluted long before we ever had planning controls.  There were methods in law, long before planning controls ever existed, for dealing with problems that people have with their neighbours.  That legal method of dealing with such problems was the law of nuisance which is part of the law of tort. Perhaps what the State should be trying to do is to facilitate private individuals to exercise their rights under the law of nuisance, to be able, if they think a nuisance is likely to be created by a particular development, to take legal steps <i>vis-á-vis</i> the person who is proposing to do so and to enter into private covenants with that person that he will not do things that would interfere with them, which private convenants would be capable of being enforced by means of the normal law of tort without any direct involvement of the State.  That would be a much more flexible arrangement in the sense that it would allow private arrangements to be entered into.</P>
    <P>The Minister might say that this is impossible, that it never happened, never <Col N="2019" /> could happen and never will happen anywhere in the world.  It would not happen unless the Government took some steps to facilitate it by arranging certain changes and clarifications in regard to the law of nuisance as it applies at present and making assistance available to local community groups to obtain the necessary information and legal advice so that they can enter into private covenant arrangements with the people who propose to make developments in their area. Certainly it would not happen spontaneously without some assistance.</P>
    <P>There are a number of cities in the United States where there is no planning department or planning control and where planning permission, as we understand it, is not required but there are restrictive private covenants in existence between the residents of the area and people operating commercial or other activities of a physical kind which could interfere with them.  For example, Heuston, Pasadena, Beaumont, Wichita Falls and Laredo are towns in the United States where such arrangements operate. The largest of these is the city of Heuston which, I think everybody will agree, is a very big city.  There is a mixed use pattern of development in that city.  Private restrictive convenants are entered into by residents of the city with developers, amounting to 10,000 covenants covering two-thirds of the entire city of Heuston. There is planning control in Heuston but it operates without the need for a planning department or for civil servants to make decisions on the basis of what is good for the people.  The people themselves make arrangements with other people, under the law of nuisance, and decide on the appropriate method of dealing with the problem.</P>
    <P>Given that planning and planning delays cost money, given that the State should only interfere when it has to in the normal private arrangements that people make, and given that planning introduces rigidities and provides for the views of the few being imposed on the many, we should be prepared to look at alternative <Col N="2020" /> arrangements in respect of certain categories of activity rather than operate under the present arrangements.  I hope the Minister will respond to those comments. Needless to say, I am not expecting him to announce that he will take such radical ideas on board straight away. Knowing the Ministers concerned as I do &mdash; I speak of the Minister present and of his immediate political superior, both of whom are prepared to consider new ideas &mdash; I hope they will consider this idea. They should not accept that this is impossible or that there would be problems with the planning authorities as regards what the people in the planning department of Dublin Corporation would do if there was no such thing as planning control.  That argument should not put the Minister off if such arrangements can be made.</P>
    <P>Having made that more radical critique of the planning regulations and planning law I will return to the more mundane concerns in regard to the law as it stands.  I want to make two points before referring to specific provisions in the planning Acts.  In regard to my own county of Meath, I have been very concerned about the fact that a number of people have been unable, perhaps because of over-development in that county in the seventies, to get planning permission to build a house close to their parents.  I am thinking in particular of farming families where a son or daughter is working in farming and wants to live near their parents who are continuing to work in farming.  It makes no sense at all to tell a farmer's son to go and live in a town, because he will have to drive out every day to the farm whereas, if he can get permission to build a house on his father or mother's farm, there will be less traffic, when the objectives of planning legislation &mdash; which are to reduce traffic and nuisance &mdash; will be achieved.  The Minister, as should county councillors, should urge the planning authority to do everything in their power to facilitate people living on their own farms.</P>
    <P>I might also make the more general point that it is extremely important that <Col N="2021" /> young people be facilitated in living as close as possible to their parents when they marry, or at least to the parents of one of the spouses.  Increasingly we are affected by the circumstances of elderly people living and, frequently, dying alone, dying undiscovered for quite some time because their family are not living close to them because they could not get a house sufficiently close that would be suitable on account of a variety of restrictions in the housing area.  There is, first, the fact that new county council or city corporation houses are being built only on the outer suburbs whereas parents are living in the inner city.  The second reason is that the market in second-hand houses in the inner city is artificially depressed by the fact that we apply heavy stamp duty to sales of houses in the inner city. Houses in the inner city do not come on the market because they are artificially penalised, whereas we have stamp duty exemption on new houses in the outer suburbs.  Therefore, there is an artificial subsidy drawing people into the outer suburbs away from inner cities because of the discriminatory application of stamp duty as between new and old houses.  If we had an equalised stamp duty application as between new and old houses we would have a more vibrant housing market in areas where older people are likely to be living, when their children would be afforded a better opportunity of buying houses in those areas suitable for them and be capable of living close to their parents.  Many people could be kept out of institutions, a lot of money saved by taxpayers and health boards if people could be facilitated in living close to their parents.  That should be a specific objective of all planning legislation.</P>
    <P>If we are to have planning legislation we should endeavour to use it to create an integrated society here.  I am very worried about the fact that, over the last 25 years &mdash; which is evidenced in the recent developments in regard to differential developments in house prices&mdash; we have two Dublins.  We have one part of Dublin where everyone wants to live, where house prices are shooting up; where, if you like, the well-off can live in <Col N="2022" /> a ghetto, where the only other people they meet are others who are well-off. They can live their entire lives from morning to night without ever meeting anybody from a substantially different social background to theirs.  That is replicated in other parts of the city where large corporation or county council estates have been built.  The only people who live there are people who come from a social background which is such that they have not sufficient money to buy a home of their own and have to rely on the local authority to provide them with one.</P>
    <P>What are we doing?  We are creating two Dublins.  We are creating circumstances in which the natural co-operation that exists between people of various social backgrounds is being eroded.  This obtains in the Minister of State's constituency as it does in mine. People mix together in community organisations, in the GAA or in a community council, so that if they want to build a hall or initiate anything else, there are people of all backgrounds and expertise each of whom has something different to contribute to their community.  For example, I would imagine that in some of the more expensive suburbs in Dublin, if one wanted to get people together who had experience in, say, carpentry or in the building of houses, one would find it difficult to find them among the inhabitants of the area unless they happened to be people who were very interested in do-it-yourself work because it was their hobby.  That would not be a problem that would obtain in rural Ireland because of the blend of different social groups.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether it would be appropriate to use the provisions of planning legislation in any way to deal with that problem.  Certainly it is a major problem in this capital city and country generally, in that we are insulating people from one another.  It is no wonder we see these very polarised debates, for example, about taxation because people do not meet people from other groups. It is very easy to stigmatise people from other groups as either the rich or as people who do not want to work, both <Col N="2023" /> of which are distortions simply because people do not live close to one another.</P>
    <P>Perhaps one way in which one might deal with this in regard to planning permission would be to endeavour to ensure that permission was granted only on a basis that would ensure a mixture of house types, of public and private housing, in various developments so that we did not get this &ldquo;ghettoisation&rdquo;&mdash; if that is English; I am not sure it is &mdash; in our major cities.  In that regard the planning legislation does have the capacity to address some of the fundamental problems of poverty in our society.  Poverty in our society exists for a variety of reasons. I suppose it would be fair to say that the biggest reason for its existence is people not having enough money.  It is also aggravated by the fact that they do not have access to educational opportunities, to people with other lifestyles who could provide them with information, motivation and assistance to break out of the moulds in which they find themselves. To some extent I think the problems of poverty here are aggravated by the fact that people are living in housing developments where all the other people are in the same position as themselves and do not have the opportunity or the leadership to deal with their problems.  I know that is not the main reason for poverty, I am not making such a claim, but it is part of the problem and that part of it at least is traceable to housing and planning policy in regard to the creation of ghettoes in our major towns.</P>
    <P>Speaking here, as I do, in the presence of two members, or former members, of local authorities, one of whom at least, sitting closest to me, probably has been wrestling with this problem for most of his political life, I am sure there are many qualifications he would wish to add to the rather general statements I have been making about this city.  For that reason I am glad he has already spoken and does not have the opportunity to contradict anything I have said.  We should have a debate about the contribution of planning to &ldquo;ghettoisation&rdquo;, stigmatisation and poverty in our major cities.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2024" /> There are a few question I want to pose arising out of the provisions of the legislation.  Under section 4 of the Principal Act a large number of types of development are exempted from planning permission, that is development by a county council, corporation and so on. I would think those exemptions should be abolished.  It might sound somewhat ridiculous that a county council would have to apply for planning permission to themselves to do certain things.  But we should remember that the planning process is not simply a question of getting permission.  It is also a question of giving notice, of allowing people to object and of hearing those objections.  The very fact that a county council do not have to apply for planning permission means they do not have to anticipate these sort of questions in their original plans, as would an individual from the private sector wishing to make a planning application.  If we are to have planning controls at all there is no reason there should be an exemption for local authorities from the requirement of obtaining planning permission. Of course, the State itself is also exempt from planning permission.  That, too, is something that should not continue.</P>
    <P>Section 39 of the Planning Act, 1963 says that the council of a county shall not effect any development in their county health district which contravenes materially the development plan for that health district.  I pose the question: who is there to enforce that provision?  I cannot see section 39 being enforced by a county council against themselves.  They will hardly take themselves to court for breaching their own development plan. There is a lacuna in section 39 in that the Minister should be given power under section 39 of the Principal Act to take action against a local authority who breach their own development plan.</P>
    <P>There is a provision also under the Act for a co-ordinated development plan to be entered into by a number of local authorities in respect of a particular area and the Minister may require the plans of two or more planning authorities to be <Col N="2025" /> co-ordinated in respect of matters specified. Will the Minister give some information in his reply as to how many instances have existed in recent years in which the Minister has taken the initiative of requiring local authorities to coordinate their plans under the provisions of section 22 of the Principal Act?  It would be interesting to see whether or not that section is consistent with the other.  There is a case for the Minister to make such an order with regard to planning arrangements as between Dublin County Council and Meath County Council.  Dublin County Council are building houses right up to the county boundary: they are building major urbanised areas and on the other side of the boundary Meath planning authority are saying there should be virtually no development.  This is one area where there is need for a co-ordinated approach between the planning authorities in the two counties to ensure that nothing untoward happens and that the accident of administrative geography as between Meath and Dublin does not cause incorrect decisions to be made.</P>
    <P>Section 48 of the Planning Act, 1963 gives a planning authority power for the compulsory creation of public rights of way over land.  I am referring particularly to public rights of way for walking.  In Britain short and middle distance walks in the country are becoming very popular with tourists.  One of the most attractive features of Britain as a country to visit is the availability of rural walks which are integrated right across the country.  In any part of rural Britain one sees signposts indicating public walks and rights of way and people can get maps to follow them.</P>
    <P>In this country, although we have well established walking routes in the areas of high scenic value, like Killarney and such other places, we do not have such an arrangement with regard to the more settled rural areas, which means that the only people who have any right of access to rural parts are the landowners or farmers. As a farmer, I can appreciate that farmers do not want people tramping all over their land because of the dangers to <Col N="2026" /> stock, as a result of gates being left open, and because of damage to crops if they are trampled on.  However it is important in the light of recent statements that have been made about the development of agriculture in the world at large to recognise that we are now moving into an era in which farmers in rural Ireland will have to rely to a greater extent on tourism as a means of providing at least a proportion of their livelihood.  The attraction of Ireland for tourists will be greatly enhanced by the availability of pedestrian rights of way over various rural areas.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister report to the House on the use that has been made of section 48?  I note that it provides that rights of way should be entered into a register.  It would be interesting to know from the Minister how many local authorities have registers of rights of way that have been created under section 48.  The Minister might discover that many local authorities have not created any right of way under the provisions of section 48, perhaps because it costs too much money.  If the Minister and the Government are interested in developing rural tourism it might be appropriate to use some of the money being made available by the EC authorities for the development of rural tourism as part of an integrated rural development programme to enable local authorities to purchase rural rights of way so that people would have the opportunity of seeing a larger part of Ireland than they can now see from our busy roads.  At the moment many tourists find that they can only look at rural Ireland by stopping their car on a busy road, where somebody might run into the back of them, and looking over a hedge.  That is not as it should be if we want people to appreciate rural Ireland.  I hope the Minister will take seriously the difficulties in regard to the lack of implementation of section 48 of the Planning and Development Act, 1963.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to the fact that State companies of State bodies did not require planning permission, as mentioned by Deputy P. O'Malley.  The Electricity Supply Board are exempt from planning permission.  Is that correct?</P>

      <P>The Department of Defence, the Department of Agriculture and the Department of the Environment, for example, do not have to apply for planning permission.  I contend that that is wrong.  They should be required to apply for planning permission in the same way as others, allowing other people to lodge objections.  No doubt the Minister will come back and give his or others' views on that subject.  I refer specifically to section 84 of the 1963 Act under which before undertaking the construction or extension of any building a State authority</P>
      <P>(a)  shall consult with the planning authority to such extent as may be determined by the Minister, and</P>
      <P>(b)  if any objections that may be raised by the planning authority are not resolved, shall...consult on the objections with the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has the power to lay down rules in regard to the undertaking of any building by a State authority in regard to consultation with the planning authority and dealing with any objections which may be raised by the planning authority under section 84 of the Act.  Under section 84 of the Act those who are required to comply here, are, a member of the Government, the Commissioners of Public Works and the Land Commission. Is this done publicly?  Does the Minister lay down in public the criteria which he used in outlining the extent of <Col N="2028" /> consultation which must take place with the planning authority by a State agent or by the State itself?  Are the criteria available in any public place where they may be consulted by members of the public?  It is important, if the Minister for the Environment is exercising powers to regulate the activities of his fellow Ministers and other State authorities in regard to this matter, that the public and the Dáil should know exactly what are the rules and regulations in practice under which he does this.  Could the Minister in the course of his reply give examples of the use he has made of section 84 to regulate major developments undertaken by State authorities?</P>
    <P>Perhaps this legislation has been amended subsequently but it seems that section 84 is a case by case section, in other words, the Minister must lay down rules for consultation in respect of each individual development by an individual Government Department.  If that is the case, I imagine it is probably not implemented in practice because there are so many developments undertaken that it would be impracticable.  If it is not the case, if there is a general guideline laid down by the Minister under section 84, I will be interested to know and have made available to me the contents and text of such a general requirement.</P>
    <P>Under section 18 of the 1963 Act the Minister may require a local authority to pay money to somebody who has appealed against a decision of a planning authority.  Is that the section with which we are dealing here, or is it other sections in regard to compensation?  I will be interested to know if there have been any cases in which a Minister has made a direction requiring payment under section 18 of the Act, or does this occur under other sections in regard to compensation elsewhere in the Act, section 56, 57 or so on?  If these latter are the sections used for compensation, what is the point of and the context for the use made of section 18?</P>

      <P>I should like to thank the Deputies for their contributions to the debate. <Col N="2029" /> These have ranged over many important issues of policy and of principle.  So far as possible I shall try to respond to them. Some Deputies have also raised quite detailed points on the drafting of the Bill or on its application to very particular cases.  I have noted all these points but do not think it would be appropriate for me to deal with them at this stage.  We all agree that the Bill will benefit from amendment on Committee Stage.  I see that stage as the natural stage for discussing these matters in greater detail.</P>
      <P>The Bill has the limited but important purpose of revising the law on planning compensation.  While its long title is wide enough for accommodating amendments about other planning matters, as a matter of policy we should resist the temptation to defuse the central purpose of the Bill in this way.  I hope to present separate legislative proposals on environmental impact assessment within the next few months and a miscellaneous review and updating of other aspects of planning legislation could be appropriate for a further Bill some time after that.  I am not therefore attempting to deal with the large number of points raised by Deputies on very general planning matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill is concerned with compensation and we would like to keep it to that.  It has been deliberately designed and brought forward quickly to deal with what we all perceive as a pressing problem of compensation.  My view is that, by and large, we should stay within this framework.  On this basis I have regard to a number of important comments from Deputies as falling outside the scope of this Bill.  Deputy Shatter, for example, mentioned the need for greater co-ordination of the development plans of the three Dublin planning authorities.  As he himself acknowledged, this is a very wide question involving, ultimately, the structure of local government overall in the Dublin area.  I accept the importance of the issue but not its relevance to the present Bill.  The Deputy also asked for assurances about the capacity and expertise of local authorities to operate environmental impact assessment requirements. I have full confidence in the ability of <Col N="2030" /> local authorities to discharge this requirement which I notified to them through circulars of July 1988.  However, as I have said, full treatment of the subject of environmental impact assessment is for another day in this House, when, as I have said, I hope to introduce a separate Bill to deal further with this matter.</P>
    <P>Deputy Quinn spoke knowledgeably and at some length about the history of the building or development land question. As he himself expressed it, this issue is a first cousin only of the compensation question which this Bill sets out to address.  It relates to local authorities pursuing an active land acquisition policy by themselves, buying up land and promoting development, either in green field or inner city situations.</P>
    <P>This Bill deals with a different set of circumstances where typically a planning authority is trying to restrain rather than promote development.  The key issue of the Bill is not the terms on which local authorities should be enabled to acquire land, but on what terms should they be allowed, in the common interest, to prevent or restrict development of land by others.</P>
    <P>So while I am grateful to Deputy Quinn for his very able exposition of the background to the building land question, I have to regard the issues at stake in this Bill as somewhat different.  I am not minimising the knowledge I know Deputy Quinn has in these matters and, indeed, it was educational for us all to listen to what he had to say from his wide experience in the matter and all matters relating to land, architecture and so on. However, I would ask him to bear in mind that some of the matters raised were somewhat different and not appropriate for this Bill.  They may well be very appropriate in other circumstances.  I accept, of course, that in the rules for determining the amount of compensation there is overlap between these two questions, and I will be returning to this later.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies spoke broadly about problems of planning in their areas, whether urban problems, as dealt with by Deputies Kemmy, Flood, Kitt, Quill, Lawlor, Kavanagh and Pat O'Malley this <Col N="2031" /> evening or rural problems, as dealt with by Deputies Dempsey and Durkan.  I have taken note of the many general points involved in connection both with possible advice to local authorities and with a review of miscellaneous provisions in planning legislation.  I should mention that work on revising and consolidating the extensive body of planning regulations is already under way in my Department.</P>
    <P>Deputy Shatter, Dennehy, Farrelly and Pat O'Malley this afternoon all mentioned the specific problem of unfinished housing estates.  I had to argue, reluctantly, in May of this year that the provisions of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Bill, 1988 &mdash; sponsored by Deputy Keating, would not give an effective solution to this question. I regard the problem however as a real one.  It is something that must be addressed and I will be considering urgently whether new legislative and/or administrative measures should be deployed to deal with it.  It is hoped that it will be dealt with in the latter way because then we could perhaps get the matter cleared more quickly, but certainly it must be dealt with.  I am willing to take advice in the matter from Deputies on all sides of the House in this regard. It is a problem that has continued to all our knowledge in every part of Ireland, to a greater or lesser degree depending on the effectiveness of local authority administration one way or other for quite some years.  Many administrations have failed to come up with the solution that covers the whole matter.  If it requires legislation to deal with it, so be it. However I would hope that it could be dealt with administratively.  If not, then the other course will have to be taken</P>
    <P>Two broadly different kinds of view were offered by Deputies on this Bill. The first set of views, represented by the Government side, and by Deputy Shatter and others, supported the general thrust and principles of the Bill, subject to varying views as to the degree of amendment which would be desirable on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2032" /> The second set of views opposed the Bill.  Deputies taking this line wanted the Bill is impose even greater restrictions on the circumstances in which compensation should be paid.  Deputy Keating was outright in his opposition but Deputy Quinn was considerably more qualified in his opposition.  Deputy Keating gave the impression, rightly or wrongly, that he did not very much care if planning compensation was completely abolished.  He referred to the spurious notion of a land owner suffering a projected loss due to a planning application being turned down. He also said that it was as logical for a planning authority to have to pay compensation for refusing planning permission as for the IDA to have to pay compensation for refusing an industrial grant application.  These are forthright views but ones which will not commend themselves to responsible opinion in this House.</P>
    <P>Deputy Keating professed to see little merit or importance in the many provisions of the Bill, other than the Third Schedule, paragraph 9.  According to the Deputy, these other matters were peripheral or ones which should have been dealt with long ago.  I regard this position as extraordinary and I am content to note that it was not widely shared among the Opposition speakers who contributed.</P>
    <P>The Bill's provisions on water supply and sewerage address real constraints on local authorities which have arisen from well publicised court judgments.  Similarly, section 14 is designed to deal with the so called &ldquo;undertakings&rdquo; procedure of the 1963 Act which was found unsatisfactory in the Grange Developments case.  The shortcomings of the &ldquo;undertakings&rdquo; procedure which, incidentally, were not addressed by Deputy Keating's Bill, were the immediate reason for the award of the £2 million against Dublin County Council in that case.</P>
    <P>Deputy De Rossa made it clear that his aspirations regarding public control of land go beyond what would be permissible having regard to Articles 40 and 43 of the Constitution.  Without wishing to comment on these aspirations in themselves, I have to remind the Deputy that <Col N="2033" /> Article 15.4.1º forbids the Oireachtas to enact any law which is, in any respect, repugnant to the Constitution or any provision thereof.  Deputy De Rossa, however, reserved his position on the Bill so that he could wait to see what my attitude was to the points raised in the debate.  I will deal later on with the main issue of concern to him and Deputy Quinn in a way which, I hope, will allow those Deputies to support the Bill.  I should like all sides of the House to support the Bill.  Its principle was accepted by all Deputies.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flood spoke convincingly about the practical virtues of this Bill for planning authorities.  He and Deputy Dennehy emphasised the importance of using the physical planning system as constructively as possible to encourage development.  Deputy Dennehy also made the valid point that sensible administration of planning law by local authorities and An Bord Pleanála was essential.  It is certainly true that, in the area of compensation, the law alone cannot guarantee full protection to local authorities.  The law needs to be complemented by good administrative judgment and practice.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies referred to the report on planning compensation which was circulated by the Irish Planning Institute in mid-October 1988.  I should explain that the Bill was on the point of publication when I received this report &mdash; in fact, it was at the printers &mdash; and its provisions cannot, therefore, directly reflect the influence of the IPI report. Despite this, I am satisfied that there is reasonable convergence on many issues between the Bill and the IPI report. There are also differences on the extent of the force to be given to zoning and on the approach to determining compensation, which I will deal with in a general way later on.</P>
    <P>Deputy Quinn asked me to comment specifically on the IPI recommendation that zoning should be made mandatory for rural as well as urban areas.  The present legal requirement is that development plans must embody zoning objectives for urban areas, but that it is at the <Col N="2034" /> discretion of county councils whether and to what extent to include zoning objectives in development plans for non-urban areas.</P>
    <P>I would like to observe, first, that this issue is fairly independent of the question of planning compensation.  If zoning is to be made mandatory for all areas, then one would want to see this justified in overall planning terms and not just because of its possible relevance to compensation issues.</P>
    <P>The case for mandatory zoning of non-urban areas fails this test of coherence in overall planning terms.  Assigning objectives to every piece of land in the country for use solely or primarily for a particular purpose would be a huge administrative task and would be demanding on scarce personnel resources.  In respect of many areas, this zoning would be an unnecessarily detailed and restrictive exercise, since the land would be compatible with a wide range of uses.  It is significant that even in the UK, where pressure on the countryside is much greater than in Ireland, zoning is not mandatory for, and is not applied to, all rural areas.</P>
    <P>Deputies Shatter and Farrelly were concerned about the inclusion in the Bill of section 15, which empowers the Minister for the Environment, in certain circumstances, to direct that compensation should be paid.  I can assure the Deputies that there is no ulterior motive for including this provision.  It wholly restates existing law, under which ministerial directions to pay compensation have only twice been issued in the 24-year history of the 1963 Act.</P>
    <P>I can, of course, appreciate the Deputies' misgivings about the discretionary power conferred on the Minister for the Environment by section 58 of the 1963 Act and proposed by section 15 of this Bill.  If policy considerations were the only thing at stake, I would have a preference for dropping this provision.  I would ask Deputies to accept, however, that in including this provision I have only acted bona fide on the legal advice that it will strengthen the constitutionality of the Bill.  That was appreciated by Deputy Kavanagh on two separate occasions in <Col N="2035" /> his contribution's but I must refer to this element of it which was addressed by other Members.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies argued that noise should be added to air, water and waste pollution as a non-compensatable reason for refusing planning permission. Noise is mentioned in the Fourth Schedule, paragraph 25, as a matter which may be regulated by planning conditions, without compensation.  In general, one would expect the noise aspect of a proposed development to be satisfactorily controllable by planning conditions rather than by itself to require outright refusal of permission.  However, I will have the point examined between now and Committee Stage, and if it stands up to scrutiny, so be it.  I would not go to the stake on it, but Deputies might reflect on what I have said as may be a means of catering for it without necessarily having it added in.  We will see.</P>
    <P>Deputy Roche and others welcomed section 21 which will strengthen the hand of planning authorities in securing preservation of woodlands.  I will look at Deputy Roche's drafting suggestions with a view to Committee Stage.  Understandably, Deputies focused strongly on the provisions of the Third Schedule, paragraph 9.  Opposition speakers were concerned about the possibilities of circumventing this provision and I am certainly open to suggestions for strengthening it on Committee Stage.  I indicated that earlier and I am confirming it now.  Let me say, however, in a general way that I am convinced this provision will make its mark.</P>
    <P>As regards the possibility that company ownership of land would not be adequately caught by paragraph 9, we will have this further examined at the highest level.  Deputy Keating asked me to do that, and it will be done.  This would only of course be an issue in the minority of cases where land immediately prior to 20 October 1988 was in company ownership. I will look also at the merits of placing an invalidating prohibition on contracts between an eligible owner of <Col N="2036" /> land and a developer with a view to sharing out potential compensation arising for the landowner.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to note that Deputy Shatter, as spokesman for his party, is able to accept the structure of the solution proposed by paragraph 9 of the Third Schedule, subject to possible loopholes being tightened up on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I take some encouragement also from Deputy Quinn's helpful statement of his party's position.  He also has made it clear that he could accept the structure of the solution proposed by paragraph 9, provided that the commencment date of 20 October 1988 is removed from it.  I will consider this suggestion closely between now and Committee Stage.  I must tell the House honestly however, that after a preliminary examination which I had carried out while the Second Stage was in progress, I see serious problems with it.</P>
    <P>The fact is that, in the 25 years of operation of the 1963 Planning Act, the status of zoning objectives has only been an indicative one.  Zoning objectives have never been, in themselves, a non-compensatable reason for refusing a planning permission.  This was the situation intended by the Legislature in 1963 and it has not been revised up to now.</P>
    <P>For reasons which I have argued in detail in my opening speech, I am not prepared to accept that compensation should in every possible case be precluded where a development proposal is inconsistent with zoning.  Zoning can, and is, frequently revised by local authorities and I would regard it as excessive that a landowner purchasing land on the basis of a development zoning could be denied all prospect of development by a subsequent non-development zoning without any access to compensation.  I ask Deputies opposite to appreciate that as the basic thinking for the Bill as so framed.</P>
    <P>Deputy Quinn's proposal is different. He is suggesting that I retrospectively apply the principle that where land was acquired under a certain zoning, and that zoning remains in force, then any proposal to contravene that zoning should <Col N="2037" /> not attract compensation.  The problem with this proposal is that it would retrospectively make the objectives of development plans relevant to the question of compensation, despite the fact that when the landowners acquired their lands, these objectives were irrelevant to the question of compensation.</P>
    <P>This proposal would also have somewhat arbitrary effects.  It would exclude landowners from compensation where the zoning of their lands had remained unchanged, but admit landowners to compensation where this zoning had been changed.  It would be very hard, in equity, to defend this different treatment to existing land interests, given that zoning was not intended, prior to this Bill, to affect the right to compensation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kavanagh recognised the limitations in what is possible with due regard to the provisions of the Constitution in this area.  Indeed, many Deputies have referred to aspects of constitutionality in this whole question of planning compensation.  The present Bill, having been certified by the Attorney General, carries the presumption of constitutionality for all its provisions.  In saying this I am not ruling out that there may be other possible solutions to the problem at hand within the constitutional constraints, but as Deputies have said, the constitutional provisions on property have a relevance in this area and we should try to bear this in mind when framing Committee Stage amendments.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kavanagh was also concerned as to the adequacy of the Bill to guarantee the protection of trees and woodlands. I recognise his legitimate concern here. Deputy Boylan and Deputy Jacob also expressed great interest in this area.  As I indicated in my Second Stage speech, I do not believe planning legislation is competent to handle all the issues involved but the Deputies will recognise that the two new provisions in section 21, that is, the provision for the preservation of up to 20 per cent of trees in woodlands and the power to phase the felling of trees in woodlands without compensation, will bring about a significant improvement in <Col N="2038" /> the legislative power to protect and preserve trees and woodlands.  That was generally accepted by all who contributed on this very important issue.  Deputy Kavanagh's involvement pressed the matter along at some speed&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>That matter could be considered because of the reference the Deputy made to certain species of trees. In general, the Deputy will agree that what was proposed at the framing stage might have seemed adequate, but we can talk about it.</P>
      <P>I will consider very carefully and sympathetically any amendments the Deputy might bring forward in that area, and in all other areas, too, because I would like us to get a consensus.  To my way of thinking planning legislation should be passed by the House collectively, and the House should not divide on certain aspects because planning applies to all and sundry.  I will seek a consensus in this and in other regards.</P>
      <P>I have made clear my willingness to consider seriously Committee Stage amendments to this Bill.  It is reasonable, as a condition of this offer, that I should ask Deputies to table any substantive amendments as soon as possible.  In that way I would have reasonable notice of them before deciding my position on Committee Stage and with a view to getting expert advice from a legal, administrative or whatever source necessary to give good opinion to the House by way of advice, direction or assistance in these matters.</P>
      <P>That said, I thank all who contributed. It was a good debate which brought forward many interesting points which I am prepared to consider further on Committee Stage next term.</P>

      <P>The only substantive element in this Supplementary Estimate is the provision for disaster relief which will enable my <Col N="2040" /> Department to pay £100,000 to the Irish Red Cross in respect of medical supplies sought by the Soviet authorities for the relief of victims of the earthquake in Armenia last week.</P>
      <P>The other items are simply normal transfers between subheads which have taken place during the year and which have to be brought to the attention of the Dáil when a Supplementary Estimate is introduced.  They involve increased expenditure in respect of our contribution to the European Development Fund, and in respect of the Inter-Governmental Committee on Migration who handle the travel arrangements for refugees coming to Ireland under the series of Government decisions on admission of Vietnamese refugees to Ireland.  It is not possible to predict exactly the demands on the various subheads in the Vote in any year given the nature of the programmes involved and the shortfalls in the two cases I have mentioned have been met from savings on other subheads. Details of the excesses and savings are set out in the covering statement before the House.  Savings were possible because of favourable exchange rates.  I might add that as a result of a carry-over of £627,000 approximately from 1987 expenditure on the bilateral aid programme for 1988 will be in excess of £10.5 million.</P>
      <P>On Wednesday, 7 December 1988, the northern half of the Soviet Republic of Armenia suffered a major earthquake which caused massive loss of life and unprecedented damage to housing and infrastructure.  The most recent official estimate for casualties puts the death toll at 55,000, with 10,000 more being treated in hospitals and a half million people left homeless.  The total population of the stricken area is put at over 700,000.  The major cities of the area have been devastated and other towns and villages have been almost completely destroyed.  The city of Leninakan with 300,000 inhabitants is reported to have suffered 80 per cent damage while the city of Spitak, with a population of 50,000 people, has been virtually wiped out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Just one week ago &mdash; last Thursday &mdash; the Minister indicated to this House that <Col N="2041" /> the Government would assist in any way they could should the USSR wish to have assistance.  On 10 December 1988, following consultation with the Soviet authorities as to their needs, the Government decided that funds would be provided for the medical supplies requested by the Soviet authorities and that this assistance would be channelled via the Irish Red Cross Society who are working with the League of Red Cross Societies to Coordinate Humanitarian Assistance for Armenia.</P>
    <P>The Irish Red Cross are also co-ordinating the efforts of voluntary groups and suppliers of medical products and are working closely with Aer Rianta at Shannon Airport who have also donated medical supplies and with Aer Lingus and the customs authorities.  The airlift of supplies is being organised by Aer Rianta in close co-operation with Aeroflot, the Soviet national airline, which operates through Shannon.</P>
    <P>I would like to draw to the attention of the House the fact that the relief effort from Ireland, as indeed from some other countries, is being carried out as a joint operation with the Soviet authorities who have kept us informed through our embassy in Moscow and their embassy in Dublin as to requirements.  Free transportation is being provided on Aeroflot flights to Moscow.  There the supplies are consigned to the USSR Red Cross for rapid transportation to the stricken areas of Armenia.</P>
    <P>I would also like to take this opportunity to ask any group thinking of providing assistance to contact the Red Cross who have the list of the requirements as indicated by the Soviet authorities and who can arrange bulk purchases of the necessary supplies.</P>
    <P>The extent of the catastrophe has triggered a massive international relief effort and many countries have allocated emergency funds for the provision of a range of relief materials while others have sent specialised rescue squads and earth-moving equipment to assist in the search for survivors trapped under the <Col N="2042" /> tons of rubble.  The most recent information puts total moneys from the European Community and its member states at over £7 million.</P>
    <P>The rescue operations, which have been complicated by low weather temperatures and the survival needs of the hundreds of thousands of homeless people, are still proceeding.  However, the prospects of rescuing more people alive from the rubble have, I am very sorry to report, significantly diminished.</P>
    <P>As manifested by the international response to the disaster, events of this nature serve to diminish the barriers between nations which reflect their adherence to differing political and economic systems and challenge us to transcend those barriers in the common name of humanity.  This massive tragedy has brought great pain and grief to the people of the Soviet Union.  We sympathise with those who have lost their families and friends, their homes and their familiar landscapes.  By contributing to medical supplies which have been sought by the Soviet Union we are glad to be in a position to respond in a practical way to the crisis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to take this opportunity of expressing the sympathy of the Fine Gael party with the peoples of Armenia and the USSR on the dreadful tragedy they have suffered.  We welcome the Government's response although we regret it was relatively slow in coming over a weekend when there was instant response from most other countries.  Late this afternoon, having had an opportunity to look at the Estimate which was available only then, I found that one of the striking and shocking things about this is it seems &mdash; and the Minister will tell me if I misread it &mdash; that this has been funded by a cutback in the bilateral aid programme; we have provided £99,000 extra for disaster relief in Armenia by a number of means, one of which was an £82,000 cutback in subhead C. which is our bilateral aid programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>We are looking for £99,000 tonight from the Dáil.  We are providing it from there.  We are looking for the excess money from the Dáil.  That is what we are here for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>And we are finding that from juggling about in the Department. Effectively, it is a cutback in the bilateral aid programme.  The Minister referred to the fact that last year he was able to carry over £600,000 from that fund.  That money could have been used for works in regions that experience disasters almost every month and, certainly, every six months.  It is shocking that we have funded this project in this way.  I could not believe what I read this afternoon. Originally we were told that the money would come from the lottery fund but last night we were told that there was a change by the Department.  Today we have been told that £83,000 will be taken out of the bilateral aid programme which had been cut to the tune of £12 million in the last two years.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I mentioned to other Deputies that in regard to Supplementary Estimates a Minister seeks the permission of the Dáil to provide an amount which has not already been provided.  In their contributions Members are expected to refer to that and the purpose for which the money is being provided.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>About three weeks ago I asked the Minister if he had any intention of introducing a Supplementary Estimate for disaster relief.  On that occasion I was thinking of a sum of money to cover this year and next year because we could be called upon again to give assistance. On this occasion the call for help has come not from the developing world but from the USSR.  We can expect to be asked for aid in 1989 but we do not have any plan to deal with such requests.</P>
      <P>In the Estimate for 1989 the Minister has provided a nominal sum of £1,000 for disaster relief.  The Minister has presided over an unprecedented change in regard to such relief.  I do not think I will be able to accept any explanation put forward by the Minister.  We must be able to respond immediately to the crises that occur regularly in the Third World.  If we are serious about providing relief we must have a plan.  Disasters do not occur occasionally; they are a way of life on many continents and sub-continents.  If we do not provide an adequate sum of money in the Estimate for such relief we will have to resort to taking money from areas of great need, as the Minister is doing tonight.</P>
      <P>I do not share the view that we should look to the lottery funds too often but we understood that the funds for the relief work would be coming from that source. Lottery funds have been used for many projects.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Progressive Democrats I should like to unreservedly support the Supplementary Estimate.  I should like to suggest that there are occasions when it is appropriate for us to go into the minutiae of how policy evolves but in the context of a tragedy like this I suspect that this is not an ideal opportunity for doing so.  The over-riding concern of the discussion is to facilitate the joint expression of sympathy and solidarity with the people who suffered so greatly in the tragedy in Armenia, to express to the government of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, and the people of Armenia, our sympathy and make resources available to them.  I support the Government's initiative.</P>
      <P>I should like to suggest that where such tragedies occur, and where it is not possible to plan for them, it should be open to the Government to create a fund from which they can draw without having to go before the Dáil for approval of a Supplementary Estimate like that before us. I understand that that has not impeded the work of the Red Cross and the other excellent agencies, some semi-State bodies, who have been engaged in the air-lift and the remedial action to date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State should consider establishing on a statutory or formal basis a committee which Members have been <Col N="2046" /> requesting, to deal with international affairs.  It would then be possible to thrash out the issues we are concerned about in international politics, international co-operation and international interface in a constructive fashion.  We would be willing to put our best foot forward and make positive contributions so that we could assist in the structural arrangements for the disbursement of such funds when such tragedies occur.</P>
    <P>In my view that would facilitate the commitment by the Government to ensuring that UN targets in relation to overseas aid generally are met and would not be sacrificed under any circumstances to the understandable rigours which governments have to endure in trying to cope with national finances.  I am convinced that if the Government, perhaps in the wake of an inter-party approach of that nature, took an initiative and informed the public that they would match pound for pound the public's contributions on occasions like this it would be warmly and widely welcomed.  I do not believe there is a person here who would begrudge those who may have been buried alive, as in the case of this tragedy, and could not be rescued by virtue of delay in the provision of machinery or manpower.  Our nation has a proud tradition in responding to international tragedies.</P>
    <P>My hope is that there was not any delay occasioned by the necessary bureaucratic hoops through which the Government have to go through these days.  If there was a delay I suggest to the Government that they should seek a legislative initiative to allow them to respond immediately as a sovereign, elected Government to such tragedies, wherever they may occur. We are pleased to commend the Supplementary Estimate.  We hope it will be adequate but, if it is not, we will be happy to support a further request for funds. We would like to commend the Minister, and the Taoiseach, for their prompt and humanitarian response in the circumstances.</P>

      <P>I should like to thank the Minister, and the Government, <Col N="2047" /> for responding in such a generous way to the appalling catastrophe in the Soviet Union.  Last weekend I was critical of the fact that the Government had been so slow in responding but now I must congratulate them on their action.  The sum of money is significant in Irish terms although in terms of the scale of the catastrophe it may in world terms be seen as small.  It will be appreciated by the people of the Soviet Union as a gesture by the Irish people in their time of need irrespective of considerations regarding its size.  It is significant also that the Irish people voluntarily, both individually and through various organisations, have responded in an extremely generous way as they have done in relation to other catastrophies of this kind.  I hope, as a result of initiatives taken by the Soviet Union mainly that the appalling arms race which absorbs so much of the world's resources, and which the Soviet Union and the United States, as well as others, have been engaged in for the best part of the last 40 years, will now slowly come to an end.</P>
      <P>It must be said that many of the problems in terms of world hunger and development would be far more quickly resolved if the massive expenditure on arms, East and West, was reduced.  I have seen the figure quoted that the amount of money spent annually on the arms race would feed the world.  It is a disgrace that so much resources, not just in terms of money, but in terms of manpower and technology and a whole range of other things are used in the arms race.  I have no doubt that the position in which the Soviet Union found itself in maintaining their side of the arms race has resulted in their lack of preparedness in dealing with the catastrophe with which they are now faced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very pleased with the way our Government have responded.  The Irish people in responding in this humane way to this tragedy have been motivated by the growing trade and cultural links between the Soviet Union and Ireland. It has enabled Ireland and people the world over to see the Soviet people as <Col N="2048" /> human beings and not as some caricature built up by 40 years of cold war rhetoric. The initiative is important and I hope that the money is used soon and effectively.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish, very briefly, to join with my colleague, Deputy De Rossa, on behalf of The Workers' Party to add a voice of unison in the House tonight in extending our deepest sympathy to all the people of Armenia and of the Soviet Union as a whole who have suffered such an appalling tragedy.  I also want to add a voice of unison in welcoming the proposals of Government in forwarding this gesture by way of aid directly to the people of the Soviet Union to help in remedying the problems with which they are now faced.  The amount of money involved is not significant but we must appreciate that it is a fine gesture on our part.  I do not think we should be concerned about the extent of it.  The fact that it is being made so willingly and with the support and agreement of this House is what is important.</P>
      <P>A feature of this disaster is that both within and outside the House there has been a quick and willing response to a dreadful appeal.  The fact that this is the first international appeal from the Soviet Union to people abroad generally to help indicates, among other things, the appalling extent of the tragedy.  I do not think we have realised the extent of the tragedy.  More than 55,000 people lost their lives so tragically in those fateful hours on Wednesday 7 December.  But in the depths of disaster we can find light. The fact that our European friends in the Soviet Union are appealing abroad to the other countries indicates major changes both within and without the Soviet Union in our attitudes towards them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope that at the time of this disaster we will take the positive side of this co-operation as an initiative and that we will look positively at the things that are happening and changing within the Soviet Union and not take the line adopted by some western spokespersons that it is all a ploy or some clever footwork.  There are fundamental things happening for good in the Soviet Union and we should <Col N="2049" /> all respond to those positively.  We should respond in particular to the initiative of President Gorbachev who recently indicated a unilateral decrease in the arms and military personnel within his own country.  Deputy De Rossa has indicated the impact that that arms race in industry has on the whole availability of resources, both East and West, to deal with disasters such as this and to deal with the wellbeing of mankind generally.  The discontinuation of the crazy arms race is the most effective way in which we can confront and deal with the need for aid anywhere in the world.  I hope the Irish Government will be positive and active in that debate in the future and ensure that our partners in the EC respond positively and constructively to what is happening. Then should similar disasters occur again there will be no need for appeals for money for aid worldwide because the resources will be there.  That is the lasting solution to these problems. Let us hope we never see anything of the scale of the tragedy that has occurred in the Soviet Union in the recent past.</P>

      <P>I will not need the five minutes.  I thank Deputies for the very warm welcome they have given to this Estimate and I would like to make some comments.  I would like to say to Deputy Flaherty that I do not agree that the savings have come from the bilateral aid programme.  The savings she sees in the Estimate are due to the favourable exchange rates.  The amount of money we had committed at the beginning of the year to various BAP projects has been spent.  If we had not made the £1,000 provision for disaster relief I would not have been able to come to the <Col N="2050" /> Dáil tonight to seek approval for this Supplementary Estimate.</P>

      <P>Already this year £800,000 has been spent from the lottery funds on disaster relief.  Those are the facts relating to the amount of money that has been spent on disaster relief this year.  So far as I am concerned I do not care where the money comes from so long as it comes and it is spent well.  I will take on board and seriously consider the suggestions made by Deputy Keating and I will communicate with him.</P>
      <P>I would like to assure the House that the fact that we had to come in here and seek sanction for the money has not meant that the relief could not be provided. Some of the medical supplies from here have already reached the Soviet Union and my understanding is that the final consignment, out of the £100,000, will go tonight.</P>
      <P>I would like to congratulate all who have been involved and particularly the Irish Red Cross who have co-ordinated the effort.  There was some criticism that we did not respond in time.  I think we went about it in the right way.  We asked the Soviet Union what they required and on that basis we have carried out with them a joint operation.  They have kept us informed through our embassy in Moscow and their embassy in Dublin as to what their requirements were.  That was the reason we delayed somewhat. We actually channelled to the Soviet Union the specific requirements and medicines they asked for.  Again, I thank the House for agreeing to this £99,000.</P>

      <P>Deputy Mary Flaherty has been given permission to raise on the Adjournment the question of accommodation in St. Aidan's School.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you for the opportunity of raising this issue.  Because of commitments the Minister has and because it is towards the end of the session I will try to be brief.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>St. Aidan's School in Whitehall is well known to a number of Deputies in this House.  Indeed, a number of the Minister of State's frontbench colleagues are past pupils of this school, for instance, the Minister for Labour is a former past pupil and one of their shining lights, and I have no doubt that he will have briefed the Minister of State on the present position in regard to that school.  This school was set up 20 years ago in temporary premises on Collins Avenue and serves a catchment area of Santry and Whitehall.  It is the only second level boys' school in the area and serves along with the nearby VEC college the catchment area of Santry and Whitehall.  The school authorities are still awaiting the erection of a permanent structure.  Negotiations are taking place with the Department.  While the school currently has 700 pupils it is estimated that because of population changes the number will fall to between 400 and 500.  Discussions on the erection of a school to cater for that number of pupils are taking place with the Department of Education.  Site surveys were carried out in December 1987 and the results of these surveys have been with the Department since then.  The only response from the Department to <Col N="2052" /> request made for further information from the school authorities, parents and public representatives has been that the matter is receiving attention.  There has been no progress since the carrying out of the site surveys.</P>
    <P>The school authorities need the sanction of the Minister so as to move ahead with the planning stages.  At this stage the Minister would not need to commit himself to making funds available but by giving his sanction he will allow them to get organised.  It is absolutely essential that they start to make progress because the present building is in a very bad state of repair.  An IIRS survey was carried out in 1981-82 and this indicated that there was severe wet rot throughout the building and that repairing and maintaining that building was a shameful use of public or private funds.  Because water was seeping into every classroom in the school the authorities had to replace the roof and this roof only has a life span of ten years. Between five and six years of that life span have now passed and it should be pointed out that that new roof was placed over woodwork which was rotting away.</P>
    <P>The constant expenditure of funds on this school cannot be justified.  Language classes are being held in hallways.  There is now an urgent need to act due to the state of the building and the folly of pouring more money into the school.  This school serves a catchment area stretching into Beaumont and over a number of constituencies.  Therefore, a number of Deputies will be familiar with the school but they have been very quiet in regard to it.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce and for Communications, Deputy Burke, was in the area during the week to open an art exhibition and I am sure the opportunity was taken to make him aware of the problems.  I am aware that Deputies from the Government party and Deputies from neighbouring constituencies have been involved and I believe that the school authorities have made their case in a very calm way but they are beginning to get upset and angry because conditions in the school have <Col N="2053" /> deteriorated.  Even if we were to begin phase one of the planning process it will be at least two to three years before the first brick is laid.  Therefore it is absolutely essential that progress be made as quickly as possible and I hope that the Minister of State will be able to give us a positive response to the case I have made here tonight.</P>

      <P>I am sure that you are concerned about the appalling condition of St. Aidan's School.  Unfortunately, this school does not stand alone in respect of the position in which it finds itself.  I had occasion during the summer to visit schools outside the Dublin area and came across some in as bad a condition as St. Aidan's.  Nevertheless it is important that Deputy Flaherty raise this issue and bring to the notice of the Minister of State that within the boundaries of Dublin city where it is assumed people have everything and that all kinds of mod cons are available there is an important second level school housed in prefabricated buildings which are literally falling apart.  As Deputy Flaherty said, the authorities in this school have been extremely patient and quiet in the way in which they have gone about making representations.  The Minister of State should not assume that just because they have been quiet and we have been patient <Col N="2054" /> the issue is not in any way urgent.  I appeal to him to take steps to have this problem rectified as quickly as possible.</P>

      <P>An extension to bring the pupil capacity of this school up to 575 pupils has been sanctioned by my Department.  Stage one, the site feasibility report, is presently under examination in the Department's building unit.  The remaining stages of planning are: stage two, outline sketch scheme; stage three, development sketch plan; stage 4, working drawings; stage five, bills of quantities; and, stage six, tender action and report.  The total new area to be provided is 2,861 meters and the estimated cost of the project is £1.9 million approximately.  However, the rate at which the planning of this project may proceed depends on the availability of capital resources and the other commitments and priorities of my Department.</P>
      <P>I take the points made by both Deputies that the present accommodation at this school is not satisfactory.  Unfortunately, it is only one of 300 projects at various stages of planning in the Department of Education and because of this a backlog has built up with many projects such as this being held up.  Because of budget constraints I cannot give my commitment as to what progress will be made but I will take into account the points which have been made by Deputies tonight and I will go back to the officials in my Department to ask them to take another look at this particular project.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me draw the Minister of State's attention to one disturbing fact brought to my attention by the authorities in the school.  The Minister of State referred to the building of an extension. It is not an extension that is required but rather a replacement school.  None of the buildings are permanent and all are in a similar condition.  We are not talking about the provision of additional buildings <Col N="2055" /> but rather a replacement school.  I would ask the Minister of State to bring this fact to the notice of the officials in his Department and to respond on that point.  It is inapproprriate to describe as an extension what is required and I extend an invitation to the Minister of <Col N="2056" /> State and his officials to visit the school in the near future to see the present state of the buildings.  We will all be happy to accompany the Minister of State to make sure that he sees the right spots.</P>

      <P>The Agenda for the Council of EC Transport Ministers on 8/9 December 1988 included several proposals of immediate interest to Ireland, particularly having regard to the Single Market 1992 objectives.  I would like to take this opportunity of making a brief report on the outcome of the Council generally.</P>
      <P>Financial assistance from the Community Budgets for 1988 and 1989 was approved for a number of transport infrastructure projects in member states, including the northern cross route section of the proposed Dublin ring road.  The total appropriations for transport infrastructure in the 1988 and 1989 Community budgets amount to 120 MECU or £93m.  The amounts of aid for the projects in the various member states will be decided by the Commission very shortly and a regulation giving effect to the agreement reached will be on the agenda of the Internal Market Council on 21 December for formal adoption.  The Council also formally adopted a Council Resolution on the extension of the system for observing the markets for the carriage of goods by rail, coach and inland waterways between Member States.</P>
      <P>Formal agreement was also recorded on a Fifth Council directive on summertime arrangements which fixes the dates of commencement and termination of Summertime for the three year period 1990-92.  The Directive takes account of of the position of Ireland and the UK who are given the option of aligning the end of their summertime periods (fixed for end October) with the dates laid down for the other ten member states (fixed for end September) during any of the years in question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Council meeting on 8/9 December reached agreement on the establishment of a mandate for the European Commission relating to the elimination of restrictions on Community road transit <Col N="1927" /> through Austria, Switzerland and Yugoslavia. These three countries are concerned about the volume of road freight transport through their territories and restrictions which they impose include taxes on visiting lorries, licence quotas, vehicle laden weight limits which are considerably lower than the Community limits, and bans on night driving.  The aim of the negotiations now about to commence is to establish with each of the three transit countries a global agreement based on the principle of reciprocity, bearing in mind the need for protection of the environment and road safety.  With 1992 on the horizon the elimination of the existing restrictions on free transit through the three countries in question would be of considerable benefit to Irish road hauliers.</P>
    <P>While not finally decided, considerable progress was made at the Council on Commission proposals relating to the criteria for access to the profession of road haulage operator, maximum laden weight limits for 2, 3 and 4 axle vehicles and the liberalisation of the international road passenger market.  Some further work is necessary on these proposals in the council's subordinate bodies and the incoming Spanish Presidency will be giving a high degree of priority to these and also to Commission proposals for opening up national road freight transport markets to non-residents.</P>

    <P>At the same time, the Chairman of CIE was requested to prepare public transport investment plans for the Dublin area involving bus based options or diesel services on existing lines.  The report from the chairman contains bus proposals which would impact on the Tallaght area. These are being examined in the relevant Government Departments.  I have been informed that Bus Átha Cliath recently introduced at peak periods five additional buses between the city and Tallaght and a new local-link service in the area.  In addition, that company plans to introduce an additional minibus to provide a better service on the existing local-link services in the area.</P>

      <P>I understand that British Airways offer a commission of 19 per cent to travel agents in Ireland on tickets from London to Australia which are sold in Ireland and that this is designed to compete with London-Australia tickets on other airlines which are available for sale in Ireland and which carry a similar level of commission.  I am satisfied that in this instance the level of commission being given is a direct result of competitive market forces and that the interests of the Irish travelling public are not being adversely affected.</P>

      <P>In accordance with the Garda Síochána (Admissions and Appointments) Regulations, 1988, it is the Civil Service Commissioners who are responsible for the conduct of competitions for the selection of Garda trainees.  As I have indicated in replies to previous parliamentary questions, my Department is not directly involved in the holding of competitions of this nature.</P>
      <P>It is the intention to make 1,000 appointments over the three years 1989, 1990 and 1991 from the recruitment competition which is at present in progress.  I am informed by the Civil Service Commissioners that the position with regard to the conduct of this competition is as follows.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1933" /> Applicants for the competition were informed that those placed highest in the written test would be called for competitive interview and that the number called for interview would be determined from time to time, having regard to the number required for training over the next three years.  The written test has now been completed and all candidates have been informed of the outcome.</P>
    <P>Because of the large number of candidates who reached the qualifying standard at the written test and as recruitment is to take place over a three-year period, interviews are being conducted on a phased basis during that period.  Those candidates who, on the basis of the written test, are expected to be called for interview have been informed of that fact and of the year in which they will be called.  However, it is not possible, at this stage, to indicate precisely the total number of candidates whom it will be necessary to interview, as this will depend on factors such as success rate of preceding candidates at the interview and subsequent medical examination.  It is for that reason that the commissioners have informed some candidates that they do not expect to be in a position to give them a clearer indication until 1991.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>In July 1987, I announced a major programme for the development of the pigmeat industry.  The programme involves the establishment of up to eight modern efficient slaughtering plants, strategically located throughout the country, which will be capable of catering for their own needs and those of adjacent processing facilities.  The plants, some of which are already in operation, will meet the highest EC and USDA standards and should enable the pigmeat sector to compete on comparable terms with those in the major producing countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Pig slaughtering and processing projects selected for development under the programme are eligible for grant assistance, from the State and FEOGA, of up to 75 per cent of the cost.  Already, State <Col N="1935" /> investment of about £12 million and a similar amount from FEOGA have been committed to the programme.  In return each plant is required to encourage increased pig output in its catchment area with a view to ensuring a minimum weekly throughput of 6,000 pigs.  Payment of grant assistance is dependent on the adoption of a pig development programme to ensure the provision of additional pig numbers.</P>
    <P>Already a number of the slaughtering and processing plants have introduced pig expansion programmes which provide a package of incentives for farmers to increase pig output.  The incentives include interest subsidies, guaranteed price arrangements, contract buying and improved information/advisory services. This should ensure that the benefits of the State and FEOGA resources now being channelled to the industry filter through to the primary pig producer thus encouraging an increase in numbers and providing the basis for more profitable producer returns in the future.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed unemployment assistance on 23 February 1988 and is currently in receipt of £115.60 per week in respect of himself, his wife and five dependent children.  This is the maximum amount of unemployment assistance payable under the legislation to a person in his circumstances.</P>
      <P>The upper age limit for the payment of child dependant allowances with social welfare payments is generally 18 years. As the son in question is over that age, a child dependant allowance cannot be paid in respect of him under either the unemployment assistance or supplementary welfare allowances schemes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the qualifying conditions for receipt of widow's contributory pension is that there must be, on either the late husband's or the widow's own insurance, a yearly average of not less than 39 contributions in either the last three or five contribution years prior to <Col N="1938" /> the husband's death, or his reaching pension age if earlier, or a yearly average of not less than 24 contributions over the period from entry into insurable employment up to the end of the contribution year prior to his death or reaching pension age.</P>
      <P>A contributory widow's pension was not awarded in this case because the foregoing condition was not met.  According to the records of the Department, the late husband had a total of 797 contributions during the period from 1954 (the year he entered insurable employment) to 1969, when contributions ceased because his earnings exceeded the insurable limit.  In 1971 he entered self-employment which was also non-insurable.  There were no contributions in the last three or five years before death.  The 797 earlier contributions give a yearly average of only 23 contributions over the 34 years from 1954 to 1987-88, the contribution year before his death.</P>
      <P>The widow is in receipt of a widow's non-contributory pension at the weekly rate of £17.70 in respect of herself and three qualified children.

      <P>The person concerned has claimed disability benefit from 21 November 1988.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He is not qualified for benefit as regulations provide that where a claimant has no contributions paid or credited for any two consecutive contribution years preceding his claim, he cannot qualify for payment of disability benefit, or the award of credited contributions in respect <Col N="1939" /> of periods of incapacity for work, until he has a further 26 weeks of insurable employment for which the appropriate contributions have been paid.</P>
    <P>According to the records of my Department, the person concerned had no contributions paid or credited in the years 1983-84, 1984-85 and 1985-86 and has not had 26 weeks of insurable employment since that time.</P>
    <P>It is understood from the Eastern Health Board, which is responsible for administering the scheme in his area, that the person concerned is receiving supplementary welfare allowance of £17.55 per week.  This represents the maximum weekly rate of £37.80 appropriate to his case less weekly means of £20.25 deriving from the value of board and lodging in his parent's home.  Prior to claiming supplementary welfare allowance the person concerned was in receipt of long term urban unemployment assistance, the maximum rate for which is £42.  He was being paid £21.75 per week which is the rate appropriate to a person whose means are assessed at £20.25.  The reduction in his weekly income is attributable to the difference in rates between the two schemes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>Exchange controls are not being abolished from January 1989.  The recent announcement indicated the Government's intention to remove, from 1 January 1989, all restrictions on purchases <Col N="1942" /> by Irish residents of medium and long term foreign securities.  While this is a major relaxation, Ireland will still have a distance to go before complete liberalisation of capital movements is achieved: controls will continue in a number of important areas, including a prohibition on the operation of current and deposit accounts abroad other than those approved for trading purposes.  Under EC legislation, Ireland has until the end of 1992 to remove these particular controls. The question of phasing out DIRT tax from January 1989 does not, therefore, arise.  The general taxation implications of the freeing of capital movements are at present under consideration by the EC Commission.</P>

      <Col N="1949" /> I will be announcing very shortly the names of organisations which will receive grants from the 1988 allocations.</P>
    <P>In addition to recommending the amount of grants, DION usually also specifies the purposes for which each grant is intended and the recipient body is so advised when the grant is being paid.</P>
    <P>DION reviews the position during their visits to the welfare centres in the following year in order to satisfy themselves that the grant has been properly applied in each case.  Most of the organisations mentioned above prepare annual reports which are submitted to my Department for examination, in consultation with DION, as necessary.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Health if the Blood Transfusion Service Board imports plasma and blood products from the United States and Third World countries; and if he will make a statement on whether any change has taken place in the importation of such products since the outbreak of the AIDS virus in this country.</P>

      <P>While the Blood Transfusion Service Board has always collected its blood and plasma supplies from donors in this country, it did import some blood derivatives from the United States of America and Europe.  However, due to the emergence of the AIDS virus the board stopped purchasing these derivatives abroad.</P>
      <P>All of the Blood Transfusion Service Board's products are therefore now derived from blood and plasma collected in this country.</P>
