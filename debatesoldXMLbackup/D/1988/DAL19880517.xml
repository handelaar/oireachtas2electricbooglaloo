    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach whether he discussed with the Northern Ireland Secretary the current difficulties relating to extradition at his meeting with him on Wednesday, 4 May 1988; if following their meeting these difficulties have now been resolved; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will make a statement on his recent meeting in Dublin with Mr. Tom King; the topics covered in the meeting; and the initiatives. if any, which are expected following the meeting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.</P>
      <P>It is not the practice to give details of subjects discussed at private meetings such as the one I recently had with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Mr. Tom King.  The meeting provided a useful opportunity for an exchange of views on current issues and concerns in Anglo-Irish relations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1438" /> The operation of extradition arrangements in accordance with the provisions of the Acts of the Oireachtas governing these matters has been discussed between the Attorney General and the British Attorney General over a period and these arrangements will be implemented in appropriate cases.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach indicate what arrangements have been agreed between the British and Irish Attorney General in regard to implementing the provision of the 1987 Extradition Act?  In particular, will he indicate what information our Attorney General will regard as appropriate within the meaning of the Act to form an opinion that the British authorities, when they seek to extradite someone to Britain, have a clear intention to prosecute and that that intention is based on the existence of sufficient evidence?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is exactly the position.  Our legislation stipulates that the Attorney General shall give a direction that a warrant is not to be endorsed unless, having considered such information as he deems appropriate, he is of the opinion that there is a clear intention to prosecute and that that intention is founded on the existence of sufficient evidence.  That is the position which will operate and each case will be decided by the Attorney General on the basis of the provisions of the Acts of the Oireachtas.</P>

      <P>In relation to Question No. 2, does the Taoiseach consider that the exchanges which took place between him and Mr. King have helped in any way towards the meeting with Unionist leaders which the Taoiseach indicated he is anxious to have?  Does the Taoiseach consider that the discussions he has had with Mr. King will have any effect on the Unionist parties who recently indicated that they are anxious to talk?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach indicate, in the context of the reply to my question, what the British authorities are expected to do to ensure that the Attorney General is of the view that there is sufficient evidence to warrant an extradition?  Will the British authorities detail all the evidence in their possession upon which a prosecution must be based?  Will guidelines be published so that the basis upon which the Attorney General makes his decision is known and the nature of the evidence which must be supplied to him?  Will the Taoiseach further indicate whether there is any agreement with the British authorities as to the length of time the Attorney General will take in considering any particular warrant referred to him?  Will there&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Have a monitoring committee been established to ensure the proper workings of the Extradition Act and to ensure that no further misunderstandings arise between the office of the Attorney General and the office of the British Attorney General?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No, there is no question of any time limits.  I can only repeat that it is a matter, under our legislation, for the Attorney General here to decide in each case what he requires.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Cases will vary greatly and there will be different requirements for different cases but it will be a matter for the Attorney General to decide on a case by case basis.  As the Deputy knows, the courts will be involved in extradition proceedings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Has it been agreed between the Attorney General's office <Col N="1440" /> in this country and the British Attorney General as to the normal way in which extradition warrants will be dealt with? Will it be on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis from case to case?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be on a case by case basis.  I do not think it would be possible to standardise it, as the Deputy knows well from his experience of criminal cases.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I can only repeat that it is not in order for me to say what was discussed at the meeting.  I am always prepared to meet anybody &mdash; well, nearly anybody &mdash; in the political area when such a meeting appears advantageous or helpful.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach the composition of the Government's subcommittee which is co-ordinating <Col N="1441" /> Ireland's approach to 1992 as referred to by him in Dáil Éireann on Thursday, 5 May 1988; in respect of the committee the frequency of its meetings; the Department which is providing the secretariat; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if the Government intend to launch an information campaign in respect of the implementation of the provisions and intentions of the Single European Act by 1992; the projected cost, content, timing and date of launch of the campaign; and the way in which the Government and their agencies will be preparing for 1992.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 and 4 together.</P>
      <P>My reply to a question in the House on 23 March indicated in general terms the measures which the Government are taking in relation to the completion of the internal market.  We will be launching a campaign in the near future to make the various economic sectors in Ireland aware of the challenges and opportunities associated with the 1992 deadline and to promote the taking of the necessary preparatory steps by these sectors.  The detailed arrangements for the campaign are currently being decided.</P>
      <P>I chair the Government committee which has been established to deal with the overall co-ordination of our efforts on the completion of the European Single Market and the effective use of the expanded European Structural Funds. The other members of the committee are the Ministers for Foreign Affairs, Finance, Industry and Commerce, Agriculture and Food, Labour, the Environment and Energy and our appropriate departmental secretaries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Taoiseach if it is the Government's intention to publish a White Paper indicating the effects on individual sectors of the positions to be taken before 1992, as was done at the time we joined the EC? Will the Taoiseach indicate if the <Col N="1442" /> Government can take the decisions within their remit before launching this campaign in order to create an atmosphere of certainty for business in regard to such matters as the time scale for the harmonisation of taxes, the removal of exchange controls and the detailed operations of the structural funds within Ireland?  Will the Government take decisions on those matters in order to give the necessary example to business in regard to timely preparation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be quite impossible for us to take decisions on a number of the matters mentioned by the Deputy.  We cannot take any decision in regard to harmonisation of taxes until we see how the discussions proceed.  With regard to the structural funds, the regulation which will set out the way in which the structural funds will be disbursed is still under consideration and discussion. All we can decide at this stage is our approach to these matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank the Taoiseach for his reply.  A number of questions arise from it and I will try to be as brief as possible.  I should like to ask the Taoiseach if the Government committee, composed of Ministers and chaired by himself, is simultaneously addressing itself not only to the problems of the completion of the internal market but also to the problems of integrated programmes and their preparation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, all aspects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Taoiseach if the committee composed of civil servants and engaged in finalising the brief for consultants preparing the integrated programme for Dublin, will be reporting directly to the Government committee?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, that will probably be the procedure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to put one further question to the Taoiseach bearing in mind that we will have more time to <Col N="1443" /> debate these matters on Thursday.  Will the elected public representatives of Dublin city and county &mdash; city councillors, county councillors or Oireachtas Members &mdash; be involved at any stage in that process and, if so, where and how?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I must confess to the Deputy that I have not addressed that aspect.  As the Deputy will know, officials of the local authorities are involved as a matter of course, but whether there will be another step in the process is something we will have to consider.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to call Deputy Bruton.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to put a final supplementary question to the Taoiseach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Quinn has put a multiple of supplementaries and I was allowed to put one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach not agree that having one assistant city and county manager representing approximately one third of the population of the State when there are more than 80 representatives for the same territory is hardly satisfactory?  Will the Taoiseach look at this with a view to coming back to the House with a proposition or proposal?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The function of the committee is to prepare integrated plans. It is more executive and operational rather than a representative matter.  In so far as any integrated plan for Dublin city, or any other local authority area, is concerned, at the end of the day it will have to be implemented to a large extent by that local authority and I certainly foresee that the local authority will have an important role to play in regard to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Taoiseach to indicate if the Government intend to publish a White Paper in regard to individual sectors concerning the effect <Col N="1444" /> of 1992.  Will the Taoiseach be indicating in that White Paper, or elsewhere, precisely what the Government's approach is in regard to tax harmonisation, the removal of exchange controls and how they would wish to see the structural funds administered in Ireland?  Will the Taoiseach indicate the likely date for the launch of the information campaign to which he referred?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>To answer the last point first, it will almost certainly be next month.  There are a few little aspects of this that have to be brought together.  I would not be averse to the idea of a White Paper.  It is something we can keep in mind but it is probably a bit early in the day yet to publish anything of that kind. Certainly, it would be very necessary, whether by means of a White Paper or otherwise, to keep everybody in the different sectors as fully informed as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach not agree that the representative bodies of all the major economic sectors are already well aware of what is involved here and are, indeed, working with their own membership on it?  Would the Taoiseach not find it useful to have working in conjunction with the committee to which he referred experts or representatives from those groups who could assist in co-ordination and in getting the Government's message, such as it may be, down to the grass roots of the economic sectors?  Since the matter has been brought up in the House, I should like to ask the Taoiseach if it is true that the brief that is being written for the consultants preparing the study for the integrated programme for Dublin makes no reference at all to transport?  If that is the case, why is it that it does not make any reference to it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No, the drafting of that brief is at too preliminary a stage to give the Deputy any hard information on it but I am fully aware of the fact that any integrated study for Dublin would, of <Col N="1445" /> course, have to award a very important priority to transport arrangements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Taoiseach if he would agree that the words he used in reply to the questions from Deputies Bruton and Quinn today are almost the same as those he used three months ago when replying to a similar question from me, including the statement that the committee would be set up soon?  It now transpires that the committee will not be set up until June.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>No, the Deputy was not listening.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has got it wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>This hardly demonstrates the urgency that I believe is required in relation to this.  Will the Taoiseach agree that the tone of the statements coming from the Government is to the effect that we must be ready for 1992, as if that were the commencing date?  I should like to remind the Taoiseach that 1992 is the completion date.  What we are concerned about is happening.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is embarking on a speech rather than putting a question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree that already there are 70 Directives in position?  Will the Taoiseach agree that the Government will have to show a great deal more urgency in this matter than they have shown to date?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I would not agree. The Deputy has, once again, demonstrated his capacity to get simple things wrong.  I said that the awareness meeting will be held in June.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is too early to say because there is nothing yet from which to seek an exemption.  By and large I think I can tell the Deputy that our policy would be against derogation.  My own view is that harmonisation is still a long way down the road.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that it has been agreed between the Government and the social partners in the Central Review Committee of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> that a progress report on job creation will be prepared for the half-year to end June 1988 as early as possible after the <Col N="1447" /> summer.  This progress report will cover the up-to-date position by economic sector and will include the position for State companies and the natural resources areas specified by the Deputy.

      <P>I would refer the Taoiseach to those parts of the programme which deal with the beef industry and with the marine.  In the beef industry 1,000 new jobs are to be created over five years, but we have been suffering job losses in this area during the past eight months.  Many meat factories are now operating a three-day week.  How can the Taoiseach equate this with his statement that jobs will be increased?  In relation to the Department of the Marine the programme states: &ldquo;The estimated potential of inland fisheries&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach mentioned tourism as a job creation area.  It is claimed that there is potential for 1,500 <Col N="1448" /> new jobs in community-based projects with local funding.  How can the Taoiseach equate that with what is happening in the tourism industry, particularly in regard to a matter which I am not allowed to mention?  He is talking about increasing the number of jobs in tourism, yet because of Government indecision in relation to a decision made some months ago we are now losing jobs and losing money in tourism.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department of Foreign Affairs learned at the end of March that the Irish citizen in question had been arrested earlier in the year in Tenerife in the Canary Islands.  They immediately initiated inquiries through our Honorary Consul in Tenerife and found that the person had been arrested on 24 January along with 16 British nationals following an incident in a bar.  The local judge had refused bail in the case and this refusal was confirmed by the local High Court on appeal.</P>
      <P>Neither our Honorary Consul nor our Embassy in Madrid had been notified of the arrest.  Our Honorary Consul has lodged a formal complaint with the local authorites about this and our Ambassador in Madrid has raised it with the Spanish Foreign Ministry.</P>
      <P>In the past ten days the prosecution in the case has reduced the gravity of the charge against the individual concerned and on Tuesday last, 10 May, he was released on bail.  The trial date is set for Friday, 27 May.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>This person was arrested more than four months ago and he has been released on bail as and from last week.  Events have somewhat overtaken the purpose of the question. Would the Taoiseach find out who is telling the truth, because there seems to be a conflict as to whether the man, having been arrested was charged or not?  The Spanish Embassy in Dublin, in a letter to the national newspapers indicated that he was charged.  My information is that he <Col N="1452" /> was never charged, that the accused did not know that he had been charged. Could the Taoiseach please find out if there was a formal charge made at any stage?  I do not wish to adjudicate on the rights and wrongs of the case, but I should like to think that normal standards of justice apply in this instance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to hear that, because that was my information and it contradicts what the Spanish Embassy in Dublin have been saying.  Further, does the Taoiseach feel that there is a case for having a permanent representative from the Irish Diplomatic Corps in places such as Teneriffe, or the Costa del Sol, or the Balearic Islands, in view of the huge number of Irish tourists and business people who visit these areas each year&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>In international affairs, all that we can do it try to behave in a civilised, sensible fashion as good citizens of the world community of nations and try to uphold rights on any occasion when we have an opportunity to do so. However, we cannot accept any sort of moral responsibility for what others may do.  I am not saying whether or not anybody has paid ransom.  It is a very complex situation and different countries have different priorities.  All we can do is our best for our own citizens.</P>

      <P>In view of the possible implications for all European citizens or the reports to which Deputy Shatter has referred in relation to the risk that they may now be put at as a result of the possibility that ransom was paid, is it the intention of the Irish Government to raise this matter in the context of EPC and to ensure that the maximum degree of co-operation which is built into that process will be obtained, so as to minimise the risk any European citizen might be under in visiting such places?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs if his attention has been drawn to the fact that Irish emigrants who had previously been tenants of local authority dwellings in Ireland have encountered considerable difficulties on emigrating to Great Britain because they are regarded by some housing authorities as having made themselves intentionally homeless; if he will investigate this matter within the context of the Anglo-Irish Agreement; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11 and 24 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The operation of housing policy in Great Britain is a matter for the local authorities.  The Embassy in London on <Col N="1459" /> the Tánaiste's instructions met with a representative of Camden Borough Council at the end of November to discuss allegations that the council are operating a housing policy discriminatory to Irish people.</P>
    <P>The council insisted that their policy towards Irish people in relation to emergency accommodation for the homeless is no different from that applied to people elsewhere in Great Britain.  The Tánaiste reported to the House on this meeting with Camden Council in his reply to Deputy Gregory on 8 December.</P>
    <P>Subsequently, the London Housing Aid Centre applied to the High Court for an order that the Camden housing policy was not fulfilling its legal obligation to homeless people.  The court decided that a <i>prima facie</i> case existed.  A full High Court hearing on the situation is pending. A similar situation exists in relation to Islington where a judicial review of that council's decision to repartriate an Irish family is also about to begin.</P>
    <P>The housing entitlements of Irish emigrants in Britain will become clearer after the courts have reached their decisions in these cases.</P>
    <P>I can assure the House that the Government will monitor the situation closely and maintain close contacts on this issue through the Embassy and the DÍON Committee with the Irish community in Britain.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach regard this matter as a subject proper for consideration within the Anglo-Irish Agreement and, if it is, could the Taoiseach indicate what kind of regular process or review would be envisaged so as to ensure that this problem if it surfaces in the future in other local authorities in Britain will be properly addressed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>On reflection the Deputy will agree that this is something that should be pursued through the normal diplomatic channels and machinery and, if necessary, through the courts.</P>

    <Col N="1460" />
    <Speaker pid="BrendanGriffin" hpid="Mr. Griffin Mr. Griffin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Griffin</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach indicate to the House what steps the Department of Foreign Affairs are taking to inform potential emigrants, especially young families, of the changed circumstances in England?  Possibly the Taoiseach has to await the result of the court case but in the meantime what steps are the Department taking to acquaint young families of the changed circumstances?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We have a continuing programme through the Department and various agencies including voluntary bodies, but my understanding is that the British Government have undertaken a fairly major campaign in Britain to inform everybody of the changed circumstances.  The Deputy might perhaps come back to this when we know the result of the court cases.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs the number of foreign military aircraft which has been permitted to land in this country in each year since 1980; their country of origin; and the reasons for landing in each case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The information requested by the Deputy about numbers of landings by foreign military aircraft and their countries of origin is in the form of a tabular statement which will appear in the Official Report of the House.  The total numbers of such landings ranged from 128 in 1981 to 311 in 1985.</P>
      <P>The considerable amount of work which would be involved in identifying the reason for each of over 1,700 landings in the period since 1980 would not be justified.  I can say, however, that landings are usually for operational reasons such as refuelling, maintenance or repairs or for rest and relaxation purposes.  For example, shopping at Shannon Airport. Foreign military aircraft are also allowed to land in connection with visits by important personalities, as part of their participation in humanitarian search and rescue operations or because they are diverted due to weather conditions.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs if the Government has condemned the murder of the Palestinian leader Abu Jihad, Khalil el-Wazir, <Col N="1462" /> in Tunisia on 16 April 1988; if he has made or plans to make any protest to the Israeli authorities regarding the killing; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <P>The Security Council in Resolution 611 adopted on 25 April expressed the condemnation of the international community at the act of aggression perpetrated against the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Tunisia in flagrant violation of the United Nations charter and the norms of international law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government fully share the position expressed in this resolution in <Col N="1463" /> relation to the events which took place in Tunisia on 16 April.  We deeply regret and deplore the loss of life which ensued, including in particular the assassination of Mr. Khalil el Wazir.  In our view such acts constitute a serious threat to peace and security and further impede the search for a just, comprehensive and lasting peace in the Middle East.</P>

      <P>Before the Taoiseach's statement today did the Government issue any similar kind of statement? Will the Taoiseach accept that as far as the Palestinian people are concerned this man was regarded in the same way as we would regard a Deputy Prime Minister and for that reason it is important that the Government on behalf of the Irish people should make it clear that they utterly condemn this kind of State terrorism?</P>

      <P>Irish territorial waters at present extend to three miles from our coast.  Foreign naval vessels in general are entitled under international law to <Col N="1464" /> transit the territorial waters of another state in exercise of a right of innocent passage.  Submarines must travel on the surface in such cases and fly their flags. Specific authorisation to exercise this right of innocent passage, or notification that it has been exercised is not required; and the passage of a submarine or other naval vessel through our territorial waters in this way could not be regarded as an intrusion or an infringement of Ireland's sovereignty.</P>

      <P>There were a constant stream of reports and interviews indicating the potential horrific consequences of an accident at sea involving a nuclear submarine.

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not in a position to say whether there have been any, properly called, intrusions by nuclear submarines in the sense of passage of nuclear submarines through our territorial waters under the surface and thus contrary to the principles of international law.  I have no reason to think that there have been any such intrusions.  I am afraid that to a large extent we will have to rely on other countries fulfilling their international obligations but I do share the Deputy's concern.  It is only one aspect of the nuclear menace which we all have to be aware of in our modern world.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Griffin</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs in view of the frequent abduction of Irish voluntary workers in the Third World, the steps he is taking to avert such occurrences; and if he will initiate at international level a concerted plan for a rescue operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already expressed to the Dáil my concern at the abduction of the two Concern volunteers in Ethiopia, Miss Fiona Quinn and Miss Mary Coen, and outlined the action taken by the Government to secure their early <Col N="1465" /> and safe release.  Theirs is the second such abduction in recent months. Earlier similar incidents have ended in the safe release of the volunteers and I am heartened at the report that Fiona Quinn and Mary Coen are safe and well.  I understand that they too will shortly be handed over in Khartoum.</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding this it is a matter of great concern to me that our citizens, who give selflessly of themselves in humanitarian causes, should be treated in this fashion.  Such abductions by whatever organisation and for whatever political cause must give rise to great distress for the individuals involved and for their families and friends here at home.  While our immediate aim must be to ensure the safe release of those now abducted I can assure the Deputy and the House that we shall consider all appropriate action, including action at the international level, that might avert such incidents in the future.</P>

As the Taoiseach is no doubt aware, there are approximately 638 directly employed and 1,200 indirectly employed on bilateral aid programmes funded by the Government.  If our relief workers are to carry out their duties effectively and efficiently they must be protected from harassment, abduction and kidnapping.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 16 and 25 together.</P>
      <P>I am very much aware of the need for a co-ordinated and structured approach to the problem of emigration which has re-emerged since the early eighties as one of our greatest social and economic problems.  The House will already be aware of the action that we have undertaken in the United States to achieve legislative reform and to bring together the various organisations working there in order to provide a network of advice services for our citizens.  In the UK funding for emigrant welfare services is provided through the DÍON Committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following my return from the United States I reviewed our administrative response to the problem here at home and decided to establish an interdepartmental committee comprising the Departments most immediately involved in emigration matters&mdash;Foreign Affairs, Finance, Labour, Health, Education and Social Welfare.  The purpose of the committee is to ensure that the issue is tackled in a comprehensive fashion and that the activities of all relevant Departments are <Col N="1467" /> co-ordinated.  Departments are already maintaining close liaison with voluntary bodies and the committee will also wish to draw on their expertise on emigration matters.</P>
    <P>In so far as the Deputy's suggestion for a Dáil task force is concerned I appreciate the spirit of his proposal and shall take it under consideration.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Because this problem concerns all of us, would the Taoiseach agree that we should all be involved in facing up to this problem, and whatever decisions are made now could be passed on to the next and following Governments?  Because it amounts to a great national disaster, we should face this problem together as a parliament rather than approaching it in a fragmented way as is the case at present, with four Government Departments dealing with the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As I mentioned in my initial reply, we hope to deal with that matter.  In dealing with this matter over recent months it became obvious to me that there was a need for a co-ordination of the official position here and that all Departments who have a role to play should come together and act in a co-ordinated way through an interdepartmental committee.  In so far as the major needs are concerned, they will have to be met through official channels who of course would work in close co-operation with the voluntary agencies. As I have said, I do not wish to appear to oppose the Deputy's suggestion about parliamentary involvement and I will be prepared to consider what form that might take.  I agree with the Deputy when he says that the more people who are <Col N="1468" /> interested in this problem the better, but I would also have to say that a fair amount of progress is being made.  The situation in the United States has greatly improved where many of our friends are being very helpful and, of course, the Deputy is aware of what is being done in the United Kingdom.  If he would like to suggest some specific action on the part of this House I will certainly consider it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask the Taoiseach two questions arising out of his initial reply and his extensive reply to the supplementary question from Deputy Deenihan.  Is the Taoiseach confident that any action the Government might take in respect of the problems being faced by Irish citizens who have emigrated would not be considered within this State as being a policy of positive promotion of emigration?  If the Taoiseach accepts that that would not be the case, in contrast with the view taken by Fianna Fáil when in Opposition, would he recognise that if we were to adopt a positive approach to the reality of migration that the committee to which he refers should have considerable regard to the legal possibilities for full migration within the completed Community in 1992 when Irish citizens will not be working illegally in bars and on unprotected building sites?  Do the committee propose to address themselves to that problem where there are institutional rights as distinct from fair weather friends in the United States Congress?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>While there may not be unanimous agreement that we must not do anything to encourage emigration, I think most sensible people would agree that we should not appear to be encouraging emigration by our young people and that we should all recognise emigration as an economic and social evil. On the other hand I do not think that we should let that principle prevent us from doing what we can to help those who have emigrated or who are going to emigrate in any event.  This is a complex matter and it is one which would have to be approached from a number of different <Col N="1469" /> angles.  For instance, in the United States we have to approach it from the point of view of legislation and the granting of visas.  We also have to approach it through the work of our consular services.  We also have to approach it through the efforts of the different Irish organisations.  Again, in some cases, we can call on the services and help of the cities &mdash; Boston in particular &mdash; and I might add that the Catholic charitable organisations of the Catholic Archdiocese of New York are very helpful. Therefore, as far as people who have emigrated are concerned, what we can and should do for them is fairly clear.  Of course, the Deputy is opening up a whole new area in bringing in the European Community.  He is quite right in saying &mdash; well, now, to a great extent but certainly by 1992 &mdash; that our people will have the right to establishment throughout the European Community and be able to move freely to job opportunities anywhere in the European Community.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Taoiseach use the Anglo-Irish interparliamentary tier to familiarise United Kingdom politicians with the plight of Irish emigrants in England?  I will also avail of this opportunity to remind the Taoiseach that the Bill recently passed by the American Senate has not yet been passed by the House of Congress and that it is expected that it will meet much resistance there. Will the Taoiseach agree that that Bill will do nothing for the huge number of Irish illegally in America, some 100,000 or so?  Furthermore, will he agree that while the Kennedy-Donnelly initiative will have implications in the future it will do very little to help the Irish at present illegally in America?</P>

      <P>The Deputy will see from the communiqué of the meeting of the conference on 25 March last that the conference agreed that the dreadful events of the weeks preceeding that meeting underlined the urgent need to give new impetus to its work on a programme of special measures to improve relations between the security forces and the community and to build confidence in the administration of justice.  The conference decided that officials of the two Governments should draw up a new programme of work on this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The communiqué of the meeting on 4 May stated that the conference reviewed work and issues bearing on ways of improving relations between the security <Col N="1475" /> forces and the community and of enhancing confidence in the administration of justice in Northern Ireland.  It is envisaged that the conference will return to this matter at an early meeting.</P>

      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree that, under the Anglo-Irish Agreement, both Governments are obligated to bring forward measures that would improve confidence in the administration of justice?  Will he also agree that over the past few years the Irish Government have put forward the proposal of three judge Diplock courts to achieve part of the aim of improving confidence in the administration of justice, that the British Government have, in that period, rejected the suggestion but have failed to come forward so far with any alternative suggestion?  Will the Taoiseach agree now that the proposal by the Irish Government for three judge Diplock courts should be again put on the table for serious discussion to achieve the objective of confidence in the administration of justice?</P>

    <Title>Forestry Bill, 1988: Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Energy (Mr. Smith) Michael Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Energy (Mr. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This Bill fulfils the promise made by Fianna Fáil to set up a new State sponsored company to operate forestry on a commercial basis.  It reflects the great importance which the Government attached to forestry in their <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i> That programme specified a firm action plan for forestry development which is being successfully implemented.</P>
      <P>The record national planting target of 11,000 hectares in 1987 has been achieved.  The target has been further increased to 13,000 hectares in 1988 and this will also be achieved.  In fact, I expect that total planting this year will reach 14,000 hectares, comprising 10,000 hectares of State planting and 4,000 hectares of private planting.</P>
      <P>The programme also set a target of increasing wood production in 1987 by 50,000 cubic metres to 1.25 million cubic metres.  In fact, the targeted increase was doubled and a total of 1.3 million cubic metres was produced.  This generated receipts of £19 million, an increase of 11 per cent over projections and 16 per cent greater than receipts in 1986.  This again is an all time record which I expect will be broken this year when timber sales are expected to exceed £20 million.  Sales will continue to increase dramatically in future years, given the fact that output from State forests is expected to reach 2 million cubic metres in 1993 and 3 million cubic metres by the year 2,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The major drive which I initiated to increase the level of EC funding for forestry has already had an impact.  In January last I announced that we had been granted a total of £8.1 million from the ERDF for road building in State forests. The grants are to finance about 55 per cent of the £15 million cost of constructing 358 km of new forest roads and <Col N="1557" /> the upgrading of 107 km in the three years 1986-1988.  This is the first time that the ERDF has injected substantial resources to mainstream forestry activities.</P>
    <P>I am particularly pleased that my efforts in this area have borne fruit so quickly.  Prior to this, Irish forestry had received only some £4 million in EC grants since we joined the Community in 1973.</P>
    <P>This achievement, together with my earlier announcement of European Investment Bank loans of £27.8 million, is a further indication of the Government's commitment to capitalise fully on potential EC funding for Irish forestry. It is clear that substantial injections of such funds will be necessary in the future.</P>
    <P>As part of our drive to increase European awareness of the case for Irish forestry, I have invited Commissioner Andriessen to Ireland in July and I am delighted to say that he has accepted the invitation.</P>
    <P>This year I have been able to launch three new initiatives on private forestry grants:</P>
    <P>The western package scheme, formerly only aimed at the poorer areas in the west, has been extended to all disadvantaged areas in the country.  EC funding has been increased from 50 per cent to 70 per cent.</P>
    <P>A new farm forestry scheme has been launched, aimed at full time farmers, which increases the scope and level of grants available.  The EC will reimburse the State 25 per cent of grant expenditure.</P>
    <P>A new compensatory allowance, (headage payment), scheme will allow farmers, who are in receipt of headage payments in respect of livestock, to continue to receive those payments if they afforest part or all of their land.  This scheme will be 50 per cent funded by the EC.</P>
    <P>The programme for economic recovery was also very much concerned to achieve an upturn in the level of employment in the forestry sector.</P>
    <P>The volumes of timber now coming on stream and the increased planting rates <Col N="1558" /> generated by recent initiatives have provided a springboard for new employment in forestry.  A great deal of this new employment is, of course, in the private sector and in the establishment of new contracting firms engaged in planting, harvesting and, indeed, all aspects of forestry.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that the potential for future employment is great and it is worth nothing that forestry in particular is one area which literally plants the seeds of employment for the next generation.  The record planting levels of today will provide many jobs over the next 40 years and beyond in forestry and in downstream industries.</P>
    <P>Obviously, a significant point of our programme is the Bill before the House today which will bring about the transformation of the Forest Service into a new commercial company.  This new enterprise is designed to meet the challenges of the future and to capitalise on the investment made by successive Governments since the establishment of the State.</P>
    <P>The history of Irish forestry over that period was marked by the necessity for State intervention, in the absence of any significant private sector investment, to counter the destruction of previous eras and to provide for self-sufficiency in an essential national asset, the raw material of so many industries.  Successive Governments throughout the period reaffirmed that goal and set national forestry targets.  Regrettably, it has not always been possible to maintain aspirations in this area and, in more recent years, support for forestry has been somewhat intermittent.  This recent period in its history has also been marked by successive revaluations of State forest policy and the organisational structure required for future forestry development.  In addition, three has been increased emphasis on the promotion of private forestry, which has developed substantially in the past three years, on the basis of extremely generous grants from public funds.</P>
    <P>So far as the structure of the Forest Service is concerned, I do not think it <Col N="1559" /> necessary to recite in detail the various arguments that have been adduced in recent years.  It is now universally accepted that the full potential of forestry is constrained by its location within a Government Department and that, in order to operate successfully in a commercial environment, it is necessary to free it from existing rigidities while at the same time imposing clear cut obligations on it to operate on a profitable basis. The Government consider that the best option is to establish a new State-sponsored body in the form of a company registered under the Companies Acts with commercial goals and carrying on its operations in the same way as a private sector company.  Members of the House will be aware that the Forestry Review Group which reported a few years ago recommended that the Forest Service should be transformed into a Commission somewhat on the lines of the Revenue Commissioners but I do not find convincing the arguments which lead to that conclusion.  Considering the objects and purposes which we now have in mind for this enterprise I have no doubt that the best format to adopt is that of a company under the Companies Acts.</P>
    <P>It has also been evident for some time that the internal structure of the Forest Service will require alteration to bring it more into line with the objectives of commercial operation.  It must be said that this is not a problem unique to Ireland and that many similar State forest organisations in other countries have gone, or are going through, the same process of change.  The decision on appropriate structures will be a matter for the new company and is likely to involve major organisational change.  I will certainly be concerned to ensure that the company operates to maximum efficiency and that its structures and operational practices are consistent with that aim.</P>
    <P>In this period of major change I want to pay a warm tribute to the staff for their efforts and achievements over the years which have led to the development of a forest estate which has expanded from <Col N="1560" /> practical extinction to its present size of nearly 350,000 hectares.  In silvicultural terms, Ireland has been shown to have a particular advantage over our European neighbours in that our forests yield, on average, a third more timber than British forests and more than twice that of other European forests.</P>
    <P>Our proximity to the large market in the United Kingdom, which imports more than 90 per cent of its timber requirements, is also a major advantage. The EC as a whole imports approximately 75 per cent of its requirements.  I think it can be said that the stage has now been set for a major impact on this market by Irish forestry in the years ahead.  The plentiful home produced timber resources will also provide the opportunity for downstream industries to capitalise on these near markets.</P>
    <P>As of now about 50 per cent of Irish forests are producing saleable timber.  In 1988 the Forest Service will market 1.5 million cubic metres of timber; by 1993, as I have already said, this will reach two million cubic metres and by the year 2000, three million cubic metres.  These figures reflect firstly the long-term nature of the State's investment in forestry, and secondly, the structure of the State's forest estate and in particular the fact that a large percentage of that estate is under 20 years old at present.  The investments of the forties, fifties and sixties are now beginning to come to fruition as, indeed, will the record current planting levels benefit generations to come.  It can truly be said that Irish state forestry has reached a take off point.</P>
    <P>I mentioned earlier that a major feature of Irish forestry in the past was the necessity for State initiatives to revitalise the forest industry.  The net result of these initiatives is the predominant position of the State in forest ownership relative to other countries in Europe.  I am pleased, however, to note that the promotions of the recent past in encouraging private planting have now begun to achieve success.  To achieve further momentum on this front we have exerted a great deal of pressure in Brussels to have additional resources provided.  The new schemes <Col N="1561" /> currently being introduced are aimed at encouraging those in marginal farming and in receipt of headage payments to convert their land to afforestation.  The response to these new programmes, along with the existing grant scheme and the western package scheme, will provide a strong impetus for private afforestation throughout the country.</P>
    <P>I have sought and received wholehearted support from a range of new forest companies, the farm organisations, co-operatives and ACOT in implementing a dynamic private forestry programme which will reach a record 4,000 hectares this year.  My technical staff who, because of their vast experience in forest establishment are especially geared to this new momentum, will continue to provide free expert advice to farmers, individuals, companies and others establishing and tending new plantations.  We may not see the final market results for a long time to come but if we are to reap in the future we must sow now.  The policies and strategies of the Government, as reflected in this Bill, are: to establish a commercial company to implement the State's afforestation programme; to allow the company, freed from existing Civil Service constraints, to exploit all available opportunities, to conduct its business efficiently and economically, as if it were a private sector company; to provide it with the staff and resources necessary to achieve these aims; and to monitor its performance critically each year, having regard to the various targets set for it.</P>
    <P>Ministerial responsibility in regard to the company will essentially be concerned with establishing policy and monitoring performance.  Enormous amounts of public funds have been invested by successive generations of Irish taxpayers. We will be looking to the new company to maximise the value of these investments and provide a growing financial return to the State as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>I now come to the Bill, which is divided into three parts.  The first part, comprising sections 1 to 8, is concerned with general provisions and I see no need to refer to them further at this stage.  The <Col N="1562" /> second part, comprising sections 9 to 38, deals with the establishment and administration of the company, and the third part, comprising sections 39 to 53, contains transitional provisions.</P>
    <P>Part II, which comprises sections 9 to 38, deals with the establishment and administration of the company.  Section 9 requires the Minister for Energy, whom hereafter I will refer to as the Minister, after consultation with the Minister for Finance, to register the company as a private company under the Companies Acts and to nominate a vesting day or start-up day.  Section 9 further provides for the possible re-registering at some future date, if necessary, of the company as a public limited company, subject to the consent of the two Ministers.</P>
    <P>Section 10 sets out the name of the new company &mdash; Coillte Teoranta or the Irish Forestry Board Ltd. &mdash; and provides for the authorised share capital of the company, at £1 billion.  This figure is an inclusive one representing the aggregate of the value of the assets to be transferred to the company together with further share issues which may be approved.</P>
    <P>Section 11 requires that the memorandum of association of the company must be consistent with the Bill when enacted, and be approved by the Minister and the Minister for Finance.  These documents are at present being drafted and it is my intention that their completion will not delay the registration of the company.</P>
    <P>Section 12 outlines the principal objects of the company to be included in its memorandum of association.  These are: to carry on the business of forestry and related activities on a commercial basis and in accordance with efficient silvicultural practices; to establish and carry on woodland industries; to participate with others in forestry and related activities consistent with its objects, designed to enhance the effective and profitable operation of the company, and to utilise and manage the resources available to it in a manner consistent with the above objects.</P>
    <P>Section 13 specifies the general duty of the company in relation to generation <Col N="1563" /> of revenues, conduct of its business and environmental and amenity matters.  The objective is that the company will pay its way as soon as possible.  Financial targets will be formulated, in consultation with the company and with the consent of the Minister for Finance, under section 38 of the Bill.  It is my intention that these targets will not be mere formulations of words and numbers.</P>
    <P>Section 14 provides that, in recognition of the fact that it holds a major national asset, the company must agree its annual programme of sales of land and timber with the Minister.  These provisions should not be looked at as providing a mechanism for interfering with the business of the company.  Their primary intention is to ensure that an adequate planting programme, commensurate with the endowment given to it by the State, is maintained by the company and that, furthermore, no tendency to flabby management is encouraged by allowing unacceptable asset disposals.</P>
    <P>Section 15 provides that the articles of association of the company must be consistent with the Bill when enacted and must be approved by the Minister and the Minister for Finance.  The articles must contain specified provisions about the number of directors, appointment and remuneration of directors, and the appointment of auditors.  The section also requires the company to set up negotiating machinery with staff, and to seek the agreement of the relevant Ministers for the acquisition or establishment of a subsidiary and for investments over an aggregrate of £250,000 in other undertakings.  Under section 16 no changes can be made in the memorandum or articles of association without the prior approval of the Ministers.</P>
    <P>Section 17 requires the company to issue shares to the Minister for Finance in consideration of land and other property being transferred to it under sections 39 and 40.</P>
    <P>Sections 18 to 23 contain provisions about shares in the company, and these are fairly commonplace.  Under section 18, one share must issue to the Minister, <Col N="1564" /> and under section 19 one share must issue to each of the subscribers to the memorandum of the company, the cost to be borne by the Exchequer.  Section 20 provides that the Minister for Finance may exercise the normal rights of a shareholder.</P>
    <P>Section 21 contains a provision allowing the Minister for Finance, after consultation with the Minister, to sell his shares in the company.  This is a feature of the legislation relating to other State companies.  Under this section the Minister for Finance may also transfer one of his shares to any person to ensure there is always the required legal minimum number of members of the company.</P>
    <P>Section 22 requires those persons who hold shares in the company &mdash; as subscribers to the Memorandum of Association under section 19 or to whom a share is transferred by the Minister for Finance under section 21(1) &mdash; to pay any dividends received to the Minister for Finance for the benefit of the Exchequer and to transfer the shares in accordance with his instructions.</P>
    <P>Section 23 provides that dividends or other money received by the Minister or the Minister for Finance in respect of their shares, or repayment of or interest on advances received by the Minister for Finance from the company, will be paid into the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>Sections 24 and 25 deal with borrowing by the company.  Under section 24, the approval of the Minister and the Minister for Finance is required for borrowing for capital purposes.  An overall limit of £80 million is proposed, which will cover the company and any subsidiaries it may have.  Section 25 empowers the Minister for Finance to guarantee borrowings up to an overall limit of £80 million for the company and any subsidiaries.</P>
    <P>Section 26 enables the Minister for Finance to provide an amount not exceeding £100 million for capital works either through share subscriptions, advance or a combination of both.</P>
    <P>Section 27 enables the Minister for Finance to provide an amount not exceeding £3 million to the company for working capital in return for shares.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1565" /> Section 28 contains a standard provision that moneys payable by the Minister for Finance under sections 25, 26 or 27 will be advanced from the Central Fund.</P>
    <P>Section 29 enables the Minister for Finance to make a total of £30 million available to the company for current expenditure, the moneys to be provided by the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Sections 30 and 31 deal with the furnishing by the company of audited accounts and annual reports, which the Minister must lay before the Oireachtas. Both sections also require the provision of any special accounts or information, for instance, on cost effectiveness, as the Minister may request.</P>
    <P>Section 32 provides for the disclosure by directors of certain interests.  Section 33 provides that unauthorised disclosure of confidential information by directors, staff or advisers of the company will be an offence.  Section 34 contains the usual prohibition on a Member of either House of the Oireachtas or of the Assembly of the European Communities being a director of the company, and further provides that directors or persons employed in the company will be seconded without pay on election.</P>
    <P>Section 35 provides for the appointment of the chief executive of the company: the first appointment will be by the Minister following a public competition but subsequent appointments will be made by the directors of the company.</P>
    <P>Section 36 requires the company to have regard to Government or nationally agreed guidelines or Government policy on the matter of conditions of employment, pay and allowances of its staff.</P>
    <P>Section 37 empowers the Minister to make bye-laws relating to access to or use of the company's land, contravention of which will be an offence.</P>
    <P>Section 38 provides that the Minister, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, may require the company to comply with directions in relation to Government policy on forestry or related activities, the use or maintenance of its property for a particular purpose, or the provision of services or facilities.  The <Col N="1566" /> intention is that such powers would be exercised in the public interest, for example, to require the company to maintain or provide amenity facilities. Provision is made for compensation to the company in appropriate circumstances.  The section also empowers the Minister to formulate financial targets for the company, including the payment of dividends, with the consent of the Minister for Finance.  Directions under this section will be issued by the Minister by way of order, if the company so requests.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill, comprising sections 39 to 53, includes a number of transitional provisions applicable to the company.</P>
    <P>Section 39 provides for the vesting in the company from vesting day of the forestry land and buildings vested in the Minister.  Section 40 provides for the similar vesting of other property.  All rights and liabilities of the Minister under any contracts or commitments made by him or by others on his behalf in relation to the functions being assigned to the company will be transferred to the company under section 41.  Examples would be contracts for the purchase of equipment or commitments to sell timber. Section 42 provides that the vesting in the company of property in accordance with the Bill will be exempt from stamp duty.</P>
    <P>Sections 43 and 44 provide for safeguards for the staff to be transferred to the company from the Forest Service in relation to pay, conditions of service and superannuation; these reflect standard practice on the transfer of functions from the Civil Service to a new State-sponsored body.  Section 44 also requires the company to prepare superannuation schemes for the grant of pensions, gratuities and other allowances for staff, again a standard item in the case of pension schemes of State-sponsored bodies.</P>
    <P>Section 45 empowers the Commissioners of Public Works to undertake work at the request of the company.  The commissioners have traditionally undertaken work for the Civil Service, but while working for the company will not be regarded as a State authority for the <Col N="1567" /> purpose of the Planning Acts.  Section 46 provides that rateable property vested in the company will be subject to rates from the next following financial year.</P>
    <P>Section 47 provides that, as from vesting day, claims in respect of loss or injury, settlement of agreements or enforcement of judgments relating to functions transferred to the company will lie against the company and not against the Minister, any other State authority or the State. It further provides that claims by the Minister, any other State authority or the State relating to transferred functions will be proper to the company.  Section 48 provides for the continuation in the name of the company, rather than the Minister, any other State authority or the State, of legal proceedings relating to transferred functions, from vesting day.  Section 49 provides that, in the case of judgments given against the company which a person is unable to enforce, any amount not recovered can be entered as a debt due against the Minister for Finance, who will be entitled to recover the amount from the company.</P>
    <P>Section 50 provides for the continuation in the company's name of notices, certificates etc., relating to transferred functions and still valid on vesting day.  Section 51 similarly provides for the continuation in the company's name of licences and permissions granted by the Minister in relation to land or property transferred to the company.</P>
    <P>Section 52 allows for the application to the company, in relation to buildings to be transferred to it, of the consultation procedure applicable under the Planning Acts.</P>
    <P>Section 53 contains a number of transitional financial provisions which will arise from the fact that it will not be possible to make a clean break on vesting day; there will, for example, be money owing to the Minister which is received in arrears by the company, and money received in advance by the Minister for goods or services to be provided by the company.</P>
    <P>That brings me to the end of the sections of the Bill, but there are also two <Col N="1568" /> schedules.  The First Schedule contains particulars of repeals of parts of certain enactments and the Second Schedule contains particulars of amendments of parts of the Forestry Act, 1946, mostly relating to penalties for offences relating to tree felling.</P>
    <P>Having summarised the contents of the Bill, I now wish to comment in some detail on the financial arrangements proposed for the company.  Forestry is, by its very nature, a long term investment. The normal pattern of wood production from conifer plantations is for thinnings to commence when the stand is about 20 years old.  Subsequent thinnings occur at about five year intervals until the plantation is clearfelled at 40 to 50 years and replanted.  The clearfell timber is, of course, the more valuable crop.</P>
    <P>As more and more of the State's forest estate reaches maturity, receipts from sales of timber are increasing: These are expected to exceed £20 million in 1988. However, the point has not yet been reached where receipts from timber sales and other miscellaneous activities will cover the cost of the Forest Service, at present £55.5 million.  The new company, therefore, will not reach a break-even position for some time to come.  It is important, therefore that, during the early years of its operation, they receive substantial State financing and that such financing be made available mainly through share subscriptions to avoid the company being lumbered with interest charges, which would have difficulty in servicing on loan financing.  Nevertheless, the Government expect the company to reach, in these circumstances, a cash break-even position on its operations within a reasonable number of years and to generate substantial profits after that.</P>
    <P>With this in mind, the Government have decided on the following financial arrangements.  It is proposed to transfer to the company the State's assets in exchange for shares of an equivalent nominal value.  The assets involved will be the land, whether planted or not, held by the Minister for forestry purposes and other property such as buildings, machinery, stock, etc.  The value of these assets <Col N="1569" /> will be agreed with the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>The company will be involved in significant capital investment in complying with annual State planting targets and in maintaining their existing estate.  It will be difficult for the company to arrange financing for such a programme and for this reason the Bill contains enabling power to make available from the Exchequer not more than £100 million for capital development, either in exchange for shares in the company, or by way of loans, or both.  The actual amount to be provided and the method of financing will be decided by the Government in the light of the development plans submitted by the company.</P>
    <P>The receipts which the company will generate from the sale of timber will contribute to a large part of their current expenditure requirements.  The company will be expected to further improve their position by more cost-effective operations, imaginative marketing and expansion of their profitable business.  This will take time, and the Government has provided enabling powers for the Minister for Finance to make available grants of up to a total of £30 million to the company for current expenditure during their first four years.  Again, the actual amounts provided in any year will be decided in the light of the company's development plans.  It is further proposed to make an amount not exceeding £3 million available for working capital, in return for its equal value in shares.</P>
    <P>To sum up, therefore, in setting up the company the Government are conscious that State forestry is not yet self-supporting, and are committed to providing a degree of financial assistance for some years.</P>
    <P>It is my belief that these financial provisions are not ungenerous, especially bearing in mind the fact that the assets are being transferred to the company without any obligation to repay any part of the expenditures which were incurred in their creation.  In availing of the powers sought in these provisions, it will therefore be my intention to adopt a vigorous attitude <Col N="1570" /> to any proposals submitted by the company.  While we do not want to cripple them with excessive debt burdens, we must also guard against an even worse situation in which the company are, in effect, relieved of the obligation to conduct their affairs on the basis of maximum private sector efficiency, because we are too easy going in the provision of further State funds.  As I have said previously, the taxpayer has already put enough into forestry and we now expect the new company to put their inherited house in order and pay dividends to the State on this investment.  I will conclude on this point by saying that, although there is provision for it in the Bill, I will critically examine any proposals for the guaranteeing of the company's loans.  If it is necessary, we will have to put up with it but I will be very anxious to avoid anything which might give the impression that the State has any responsibility for the financial outcome of the company's activities.  The company must stand on their own feet, conduct their business in accordance with the requirements of the market place, and generate profits for their shareholders who have put so much into it.</P>
    <P>The legislation we will be considering will change fundamentally the structure and future of forestry organisation.  I expect the company to build on the strengths they are inheriting and, with the more favourable environment and greater freedom they will have, to achieve a more rapid development of forestry than was practicable within the confines of the Civil Service, which were often required to carry on their activities otherwise than on the basis of sound business principles.  The company are being given a major national asset.  The Government expect them to make the optimum use of that asset and to maximise the returns on forestry.</P>
    <P>It is clear to me from my examination of forestry affairs, both at headquarters and in the field, that there is very considerable room for organisational reform, for the elimination of unwieldy and costly procedures, for the adoption of better practices in the forests, for the introduction of new arrangements which will <Col N="1571" /> reduce outgoings on purchases and increase income per unit of sales, and for the identification of the optimum utilisation of the land and other assets.  There is a need, in general, for the creation of an entirely new culture in relation to forestry which will have much less to do with outdated procedures and much more to do with running an efficient operation and giving the people of Ireland a better deal for their money.</P>
    <P>I am glad to note that the staff have given their support to these objectives and I look forward to their continuing commitment in this respect.  Bearing in mind that due to traditional constraints it was not possible to give sufficient attention to these things for a long time past, I believe that it should be possible to achieve very significant improvements in the near future.  I will, therefore, be throwing down the gaunlet to the chairman, the directors, the chief executive and the management team as a whole to deliver the goods in accordance with the charter I am asking the Oireachtas to provide for the company.  I will not accept that this is just another semi-State body.  I expect far more than that and if I do not get it I will give the board a very hard time.  There are useful provisions in this Bill in regard to performance requirements and achievement of targets and it is the intention that the powers given in these respects to the Ministers for Energy and Finance will, in association with the financial provisions of the Bill, be used in such a fashion as to assist in bringing about the radical changes which are necessary.</P>
    <P>I commend this Bill to the House but before concluding I would like to make clear that I will be glad to consider any proposals for its improvement which are put forward for consideration on Second Stage, or when we have the opportunity to look at the provisions in greater detail on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to take this opportunity to welcome the appearance of this Bill before the House.  Its purpose is to grant power to the Minister for Forestry <Col N="1572" /> to establish Coillte Teoranta.  As such, the Forestry Bill is the culmination of many years of work and representation by a sector which has been long held as a major source of economic salvation.  I join with the Minister in the tributes he paid to the staff of the Forestry Department for their years of work and dedication.</P>
      <P>I do not propose to catalogue the benefits of wise sensitive development of forestry.  The advantages which Ireland enjoys over Europe in terms of climate, soil type, technical expertise and available land are all well known.  Providing the optimum conditions for the much needed rapid expansion in this sector has been a painfully slow process.  In publishing this Bill the Minister has demonstrated his intention to redress the situation.  However, there are serious shortcomings in this Bill which must be addressed to facilitate speedy and positive development of forestry.  The Bill gives a general endorsement of the contents of the Forestry Review Group Report and many of the measures recommended by them are in the Forestry Bill, 1988.  The review group placed great emphasis on the need to regard the national forests as an asset to be managed commercially for the benefit of the State, which in effect means for the taxpayer, whose money is being invested in forestry by the State.  Such benefits should not exclude trading in existing plantations.</P>
      <P>The first major concern to anyone assessing the provisions of the Bill relates to the staffing of Coillte Teoranta.  One of the highlights of the review group report was the lack of commercial awareness and expertise at Department level. Here the new chief executive is expected to make good the Departmental deficit in this regard.  How will he do it?  The failure to implement the higher civil servants pay award plus the numerous inhibitions placed by the Gleeson report and the Devlin report will make it virtually impossible to attract and keep the kind of expertise and entrepreneurial spirit which can make a success of Coillte Teoranta.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The directors of the new body will be <Col N="1573" /> appointed directly by the Minister but there is no requirement that those nominated should have any expertise in forestry.  The Minister could have said that one director should be experienced in accountancy and one might be experienced in the sales area, for instance.  I wonder what criteria the Minister will use?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will hardly specify that the director should be from Nenagh or from somewhere in the Minister's constituency.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>Given that mistakes have been made before, the Minister should specify some guidelines in the Bill.  In the lifetime of the previous Government there was one incident when a director and a manager of a very substantial State company made forward contracts which eventually led to the dissolution of that company.  The appointment of directors is very important.  While I have great respect for the Minister's commitment to forestry, I question whether leaving this matter open will be of help to the future of Coillte Teoranta.  The Minister should have outlined some commercial and technical criteria before proceeding to fill these posts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill is also seriously deficient in that it fails to address the contentious issue of the valuation of assets.  Even independent experts have great difficulty in establishing with any degree of accuracy the value of existing stocks.  If the value attached is too low, Coillte Teoranta and its chief executive will show very good results but at the price of virtually wiping out any meaningful private sector participation in forestry.  If the estimate is too high, then an unacceptable burden is placed on the shoulders of this new body and its chief executive and both the chief executive and his staff will labour in vain to try to meet unrealistic and unachievable targets.  The prognosis <Col N="1574" /> for such a situation must then include a total collapse of Coillte Teoranta.  In the interests of establishing as secure a base as possible for State involvement in forestry, the Minister should include in this Bill a directive as to how acceptable valuation levels might be achieved.  The review group on forestry gave a list of how a valuation of a State forest might be tackled and they gave examples and illustrations.  The Minister and the Department might look at the prospect of including their proposals in directives.</P>
    <P>It is suggested by some groups that a valuation based on current UK levels would be more suitable because there is established in the British economy a market for standing timber and for the private sector.  Alternatively, the Minister could use an adjusting mechanism for a fixed period when revising the value of assets.  If the Minister puts in a basic value and a provision for an adjustable, flexible reserve, the value would reflect the real position if arrived at over a period of four or five years.  Whatever approach is taken, it is essential that some mechanism is introduced and that the Bill should allow for this.</P>
    <P>There are a variety of other serious omissions in this Bill.  There is no reference to inclusion of annual performance indicators.  The Minister in his speech said that annual performance indicators were in the Bill so perhaps in his reply he will indicate exactly where as I seem to have missed it.</P>
    <P>The Bill should have a provision which will allow Dáil Éireann to examine the performance of this body.  A significant amount of taxpayers' money is being invested in Coille Teoranta and there should be an automatic means of reviewing the work of the company.  Another omission from the Bill, which is very strange, is the absence of any specified planting target.  In terms of the chief executive's role, this is disastrous.  In administering the work of Coillte Teoranta the chief executive will be subject to all the vagaries and contingencies of Government budgetary strategy.  If it is more politic to accommodate spending cuts by starving Coillte Teoranta rather <Col N="1575" /> than education or social welfare, the chief executive will not have any statutory basis on which to argue his case and protect the interests of Coillte Teoranta and his staff.  The absence of a target for planting makes it impossible to have any genuine economic planning or forecasting.</P>
    <P>The Minister in recent speeches placed great emphasis on the involvement of private companies, co-ops and farmers in tree planting.  These people need to know exactly what this company is about and where it is going in terms of planting. People need to know if, for instance, they have a planting policy for X number of hectares per year or if they have a target set for a given year allowing 50 per cent of forests to be in private hands and 50 per cent to be in the hands of Coillte Teoranta.  As it stands it would not be possible to state with certainty what reserves were held by Coillte Teoranta and what stocks were coming onstream for sale at semi-mature and mature stage. In practical terms this may very well tie the hands of the chief executive who would be required to comply with the terms of sections 14 and 44 of the Bill, both of which are severely restrictive on the chief executive's autonomy to do the job as he or she sees fit.</P>
    <P>Let me now turn to deal with the question of financing.  In its present form the Bill seems to envisage 1992 as a target for Coillte Teoranta becoming economically viable and independent.  Given the discrepancies between the figures quoted in the Bill and those suggested by other groups in the forestry sector, it seems that Coillte Teoranta would have to make up the shortfall by way of sales from existing stock.  I do not object to this practice in principle but I have profound difficulties in understanding how if the chief executive is to depend on his method of financing the work of Coillte Teoranta, while denied the security of definite minimum planting targets, he or she would be in a secure position to plan accurately and effectively the expansion of any semi-State forestry programme.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1576" /> If there is any real intention to encourage growth in the forestry sector it is essential that Coillte Teoranta and its chief executive should be given under the terms of this Bill sufficient latitude to meet current capital liabilities.  This means that sufficient funding should be made available to carry out a planting programme on, say, 10,000 hectares.  I understood the Minister of State to say that he wanted 13,000 hectares&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">

    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of planting targets is central to establishing a productive relationship, and this is very important, between the embryonic private sector and the more developed public sector in forestry.  At the time of the Forestry Review Group report it became obvious that efforts would have to be made to lessen the gap between private and public planting and stocks generally.  Any methods for contributing to this goal are to be welcomed but I fail to see in any of the provisions of this Bill any attempt to face up to this requirement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me ask the Minister of State directly, why has no development policy been included in the Bill?  Could he also tell us whether he has any intention of producing a White Paper either now or in the future dealing with its long term objectives in terms of expanding and developing the forestry sector?  Surely this is the right time in which to produce such a White Paper which would help to allay people's fears and enable them to plan ahead.  The private investor will take very cold comfort from the passing of this Bill in its present form.  The Minister of State must be aware that the western package scheme will run out in 1991 and there seems to be no enthusiasm on the part of the Minister of State or his Department to explore other, perhaps more attractive, alternatives to this <Col N="1577" /> scheme.  He said in his speech that he has paid attention to the EC but I was not aware&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is not paying attention to what is going on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am, but I was not aware of the details of the new farm forestry scheme.  On the whole question of grants to private investors which would stimulate a rapid take-up of land for forestry projects, there has been no initiative to overcome the issue of conflict of interest where arbitration on grant eligibility is carried out by officials who are predisposed to protect the interests of the semi-State rather than private programmes.</P>
      <P>Recently I tabled a question to the Minister on the administration of grants which is a source of concern for those involved in the farming sector who want to know who is going to be responsible for their administration.  I believe the Minister has lost an opportunity in not specifying in this Bill who is going to be responsible for the administration of grants.  It would be very unfair if the officials of Coillte Teoranta were to administer the payment of grants.  Has the Minister of State or his Department considered using the farm development services and ACOT who in recent times have played a valuable role in the expansion of the forestry programme, particularly the private forestry programme, in the administration of grants?  As I have already stated in this House, I have great admiration for ACOT.  The Minister of State has said that the EC has neglected this area and forestry was not included as an agricultural item when the Treaty of Rome was signed.  As we are now talking of alternative uses of land, the time is opportune for the Minister to announce that an independent body such as Teagasc would be used in the administration of this grant scheme.  I ask the Minister of State at this stage to indicate what measures he thinks are appropriate to deal with this serious impediment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Bill was published many people expressed surprise that there was <Col N="1578" /> no reference to research and development in the list of duties to be undertaken by the company.  The Department have been using the wood technology unit of EOLAS for 26 years now.  What is to be the fate of this unit?  Surely Coillte Teoranta need this expertise particularly to establish standards which will eliminate the importation of Canadian and Scandinavian timber.  I understand that 55 per cent of all the timber now being used comes from those sources.  Indeed, the docks at present are full of Canadian timber.  EOLAS have carried out a survey on pine lodge and have published its results.  I ask the Minister to outline the future of the wood technology unit. Are they to be cut off without a shilling &mdash; £300,000 was provided in the Estimates last year &mdash; and suffer the same fate as An Foras Forbartha and other institutions which had served this country well for many years?  Is EOLAS to become yet another sacrificial lamb on the altar of the Minister for Finance's expediency?</P>
    <P>Precedents have been established by other Departments in the drive to eliminate duplication.  For example, the food study section and the ocean study section of EOLAS have been absorbed by Teagasc and the Department of the Marine respectively.  The precedent has been established in other areas.  I see no reason the Minister could not persuade the Minister for Finance to be a little more flexible in this instance.  I ask the Minister to indicate his intentions in regard to this matter so as to avoid duplication of services and the waste of resources.  What guidelines is he prepared to issue to the chief executive of Coillte Teoranta in this regard?</P>
    <P>Research and development are contentious in relation to the co-existence of public and private forestry.  For example, will the chief executive of Coillte Teoranta be empowered to make available to private investors, for a reasonable fee, the results of research and development studies on forestry carried out under the auspices of his organisation?</P>
    <P>Underlying many of the reservations felt on this side of the House with regard <Col N="1579" /> to the Bill is a deep suspicion that it will constitute yet another monument to the lip service this Government pay to the notion of marketing.  There has been ample evidence of the inadequacies of this Government in this area.  The hamfisted and lack-lustre approach adopted by the Minister and his Department last summer when they attempted to dispose of stocks of semi-mature timber is but one example.</P>
    <P>The Forestry Review Group report made crystal clear their concerns that insufficient attention has been paid to the business&mdash;and I stress that it is a business &mdash;of establishing a sound market in semi-mature timber sales.  With the publication of this Bill we come face to face with the fact that the Government have not learned any valuable lesson in this regard. It appears to me that the Minister is over-reliant on attracting local investment only in foresty.  The existence of a virtual cartel among institutional investors here makes it vital that steps be taken to render our forestry industry an attractive investment option for individuals and institutions in the United Kingdom and other countries.  That is the case particularly with the approach of the year 1992 because, with the completion of the single internal market, many of the existing barriers to investment will be eliminated.  Surely the Minister should be taking steps to promote conditions for a massive uptake in forestry investment with the inauguration of the single internal market?  There is no evidence of such awareness on the part of the Minister under the provisions of this Bill.  The least we might have expected was that the memorandum of association of Coillte Teoranta would have included a provision for the creation of a market-led forest industry.</P>
    <P>All Members of this House are in favour of a massive and rapid development of forestry.  However, even a casual reading of the Bill before us will demonstrate the heavy hand, even the cloven hoof, of the Civil Service in its provisions. For example, the provisions of section 14, in effect, constitute a set of handcuffs <Col N="1580" /> on the chief executive of Coillte Teoranta.  Who, in their right mind, would be prepared to undertake the stewardship of Coillte Teoranta under the terms proposed in the Bill as drafted?</P>
    <P>My party welcome the Bill.  Its introduction demonstrates that some amount of thought has been given to the matter of forestry at ministerial and/or departmental level.  However, there are many omissions and inadequacies.  My party will be introducing many amendments on Committee Stage to rectify those deficiencies.</P>
    <P>There are some references in the Bill I should like to query and have answered. For example, in section 12 there is reference to &ldquo;efficient silvicultural practices&rdquo;.  What exactly does that term mean, or what will it mean in practice? It may well mean different things to different people.  In section 38 the Minister is empowering the company to undertake work on his behalf.  If my reading of the provisions is correct, the Minister is more or less issuing the company a letter of comfort.  I might pose the question: why does the Minister not empower the company to contract?  It would appear to me that the Minister is asking his Department to incur somewhat greater liability than is required.  Would it not be better that the Department would contract this work?</P>
    <P>Provided the Bill incorporates suitable amendments its provisions should ensure that our forestry industry will develop for the betterment of the nation generally.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnSMcCoy" hpid="Mr. McCoy Mr. McCoy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCoy</NameTxt>
      <P>I commend the Minister on having heightened awareness of the relative importance of forestry to our economy and the inherent advantages and opportunities for us generally to develop that industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A few matters which have come to my notice in the short time I have been spokesman on forestry for my Party do not appear to have been addressed in the provisions of this Bill so I should like to avail of this opportunity of bringing them to the attention of the House.  On account of the generous grants now available many private individuals are being <Col N="1581" /> enticed to convert land in disadvantaged areas and marginal land into afforestation.  Frequently now there are many new companies being formed to avail of the market obtaining in the planting and development of forests.  Many of those companies have no track record or expertise, nor is it required that they should have such expertise.  In any integrated forestry enterprise the Government must examine the position obtaining with regard to the contracting of the planting and management of forests.</P>
    <P>It is also my belief that the Government should not have an unfair advantage by way of the provisions of this Bill over legitimate commercial concerns in that, to a certain extent, the State would have its bad debts underwritten.  It would appear that the State would be able to compete in the market place and be placed in a somewhat unfair advantageous position <i>vis-à-vis</i> others in the industry.  It would not be a desirable objective that the provisions of the Bill would create such a monopoly in this area, as happened in the case of transport with Aer Lingus and CIE, leading to huge losses to the detriment of all at the end of the day.</P>
    <P>I would contend that the provision to exempt transitions from the imposition of a 6 per cent stamp duty should apply to all transactions, thereby recognising the importance of the forestry crop.</P>
    <P>It has come to my notice recently &mdash; this has not been addressed by the provisions of the Bill either &mdash; that there is now a practice in State-owned forests of part-time workers being recruited on a piece-work basis and that no statutory deductions are made from their remunerations.  It is open to the Minister to deny it, but if this is so it is a retrograde step.</P>
    <P>I hope that the new Bill will also prevent the type of panic measures which consigned much of our future saw log to two companies in the pulp and fibre business in the past couple of years which, by any standards, was the steal of the century.  The purpose of the Bill is to divest the Government of direct responsibility and give it to a company obliged to <Col N="1582" /> exploit forestry on a commercial basis. On this basis we, in the Progressive Democrats, warmly welcome this Bill.</P>
    <P>However, we feel that it is flawed in a number of key areas.  If it is to achieve the legitimate targets the Minister has been very forthright in spelling out here today something will have to be done about this.  I will name the four areas where changes should be made if the Bill is to exploit the forestry industry and, at the end of the day, create a profitmaking enterprise.  The areas I refer to are as follows: the corporate objectives, the financing, the ministerial right of interference and the terms of transition.</P>
    <P>In regard to the corporate objectives the Minister states that he is setting up a commercial company with the intention of going public.  Why not comply with the PLC requirements now?  Where is the statement of affairs, and what are the opening balances?  If we are to be able to gauge the track record and the performance of such a company and have no opening balances on assets which are conservatively valued at £1,000 million and we hand them over to a company which it is the Government's intention to make public in the shortest possible time, the State's value on these forests must be realistic and it must be a bottomline statement for a new company coming in. Otherwise how can we gauge the development of this company, their ability to run their affairs at a profit and assess the commercial criteria the Minister has laid down for their operation?  More important, there is no clear corporate purpose and commercial mandate or objective in the Bill.  The Minister must make up his mind whether he wants a Government tool to be interfered with by political will from one Government to the next or an independent commercial entity under Government ownership.</P>
    <P>In regard to finance there is a proposal of an equity of £3 million for working capital, shares to the value of land and property.  I would say at this stage that there seems to be no value put on the land and property to which these shares are supposed to relate.  There is to be £100 million from the State in loans and <Col N="1583" /> shares, £30 million in grants over four years coming to £120 million, and borrowings of £80 million guaranteed by the Government.</P>
    <P>The Minister is now asking Dáil Éireann to expose the Exchequer to the extent of almost £400 million starting with an asset partially developed and valued at at least £1,000 million and maybe £1,500 million.  Surely there is an opportunity here for the public to get involved in funding this company in a share flotation.</P>
    <P>Let me now turn to the Minister's right of intervention as proposed in the Bill. The right to veto annual sales of land and timber gives this so-called private company virtually no room for commercial manoeuvre.  It is like a farmer having to seek permission to sell a bullock.  One either gives the company the teeth to compete commercially or fetters it in such a way that it cannot compete at all.  Where the Minister retains the right to issue directions, if it is Government policy and where the policy is a directive of his Department, he retains the right to recoup the losses.  Surely this is not in the interests of good commercial practice.</P>
    <P>Finally I come to one of the old chestnuts of all attempts by all Governments to privatise Government bodies and that is the terms of transition.  These terms are no different from previous terms in other Bills in other so-called Government privatisations.  The provision that the Office of Public Works should be involved in certain developmental works completely ties the management's hands in its choice of contractors so that it cannot stand on its own feet as the Minister would desire.  Also the new management are inheriting the management structures, the staff, the wage and salary structures and pension funding requirements.  If the Minister is throwing down the gauntlet it will be a very heavy one to pick up.  The new board and management will have their hands tied before they even start.  In the scenario in which we might want to compete internationally by 1992 it is no harm to draw the Minister's <Col N="1584" /> attention to a company who have twice the planting capability and programme of the forestry and wildlife division in this country and has a complete managerial and administrative staff of 35.  This is the scenario; this is the formidable task facing Coillte Teoranta.  This is the mountain that the new chief executive will have to climb with one hand tied behind his back.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats will be tabling amendments for Committee Stage.  Nevertheless the Bill, in its broad terms, is to be welcomed.  We would support the Minister in any effort to make forestry the viable and economic industry it can be here.</P>

      <P>I warmly welcome this Bill.  The only carp I have is that the Minister could have done it a little earlier, but that is only a minor point.</P>
      <P>It is something I considered necessary in this area when I was Minister for Forestry.  I would like to think I had some hand in bringing about the decision which is now before the House to be taken over the next few weeks.</P>
      <P>The setting up of a semi-State body to operate commercial services in the forestry area has been considered for some years now and some credit has to be given to the Minister's predecessors such as former Minister for Forestry, Mr. Paddy O'Toole, who set up the review body back in 1985 to look at the whole position of forestry as a commercial enterprise. This was presaged by the policy of the previous Coalition Government, <i>Building on Reality,</i> when it demanded that the forestry industry be looked at, its operation expanded and made more viable to achieve its potential.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It fell to the then Minister, Deputy O'Toole, to set up a review group.  This Bill emanated from that review group. The terms of reference at that time are interesting to look back on.  The terms of <Col N="1585" /> reference were to ensure that the country's afforestation programme, and in particular the substantial resources which it represented, was developed and exploited to the best natural advantage having due regard to the role and functions of the National Development Corporation where relevant, to examine the present structure of the organisation and operation of the Forest and Wildlife Service of the Department of Fisheries and Forestry, to consider what changes, if any, were necessary, to make specific recommendations on such changes and to submit a report to the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry by 1 June 1985. The review group did not reach that target.  It reported in November 1985. Soon after, when I became Minister for Forestry, this document was on my table; I was also Minister for Tourism and Fisheries and a good deal of developmental work was going on in that Department. I was very happy to be associated with the decisions which were taken.</P>
    <P>One of the problems which Fianna Fáil Ministers have is that they find it difficult to give credit to somebody else &mdash; who is not one of their own &mdash; when they produce something.  In the Minister's speech on the Forestry Bill the first line reads: &ldquo;This Bill fulfils the promise made by Fianna Fáil to set up a new State-sponsored body to operate...&rdquo; I think it would not have been any harm to give some credit to the man who presented this report in 1985.  When it was presented I had the choice of deciding whether it should be a semi-State company, a company within the existing Department &mdash; such as has been suggested in the conclusions and recommendations of the review group &mdash; or leave matters as they were and make no changes.  There were a number of people at that time who wanted to do various things, some of whom wanted a new forest commercial semi-State body.  Much influence rained down on me at that time as to the direction I should take.  I am glad that the Minister has now followed on the decision which we made that there should be a separate semi-State body totally independent of the Department with the <Col N="1586" /> usual, obvious safeguards that apply to any semi-State body.  I congratulate him on that.  I welcome what he has done and I am delighted to say that the Bill, as presented here today, is almost completely what I would have hoped it would be.  Therefore, I will have very few problems with it both now and on Committee Stage.  That is not to say I have no problem with it.  I will be making some suggestions particularly on Committee Stage, to the Minister.  I will be asking for some explanations &mdash; which only he could have at this stage &mdash; because I would like him to expand on one or two points in the Bill but that is best done on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>In section 17 of the Bill of the Minister seems to be giving shares in the company to the Minister for Finance and only taking a minimum amount himself.  I find that confusing.  That is the opposite to what happened in the Postal and Telecommunications Services Act, 1983. Since both Bills are practically the same in their entirety &mdash; the Minister has followed faithfully on what was in the Bill which set up An Post and Telecom Éireann &mdash; I find that there is a variance in that the Minister, in his Bill, seems to be taking a minimum interest, as he is giving all the shares to the Minister for Finance.  In the Postal and Telecommunications Services Act it was the opposite.  Perhaps, the Minister would explain why he has to go in that direction. I am not a great fan of the Department of Finance.  I do not like the dead hand of the Department of Finance.  I would be perfectly happy to see that they had a minimum interest in the company and if their interest was confined to one share that would be plenty for me if the statutory requirements were met.  I think the Minister will be willing to explain that to me.  I like the manner in which Departments can develop their policy and not be sat upon by the Department of Finance.  I am delighted that the Bill has been introduced and I am satisfied with how it is structured.  The Minister in his brief has covered many of the points I wished to make.</P>
    <P>There has been a significant shift in <Col N="1587" /> attitudes towards the forestry industry over recent years by all parties in this House.  Undoubtedly, this relates to the recognition that forestry and its contribution to the wellbeing of the environment cannot be taken for granted. There has been a new awareness within the European Community also that trees, like oil, are a very precious natural resource.  Ireland, with its rich damp soil provides a natural environment for tree planting and growing.  We are lucky in this respect because certain varieties of trees particularly spruce and pines, reach maturity within 30 to 40 years in Ireland while on the mainland of Europe, and particularly in the northern parts of Europe where the same type and variety of trees are planted, they do not mature as quickly.  Because of the long maturing time it takes in these countries we have a natural advantage.  As well as that we are a member of the European Community and the European Community is only 50 per cent sufficient in timber, so Ireland's advantage in tree growing puts us in a good position to take initiatives in the industry.  It also provides us with an opportunity to lead other member states in the timber export business. I think we have to recognise that fact and all parties are anxious to see that we exploit that to the maximum.  Because of the various surpluses in agriculture the European Community are anxious that countries producing a surplus should change to an area of deficit; in the agricultural area it would seem logical that they would encourage that transition from traditional agricultural products &mdash; milk, beef and cereals &mdash; to forestry.</P>
    <P>I think it would be unrealistic not to acknowledge that we have a long way to go before we can claim that we have a satisfactory position in the forestry area. This Bill is a major step in the right direction.  I believe the workload that has to be done cannot be under-estimated.  At present we have about a million acres of land under forestry and despite our ideal growing conditions this represents the smallest percentage of afforested land in <Col N="1588" /> Europe with the exception of Iceland. The vast amount of our forests &mdash; 85 per cent &mdash; are State planted, cultivated and State-owned and the remaining 15 per cent are privately owned.  Attempts to attract farmers and private landowners to invest in the forestry industry have not been successful as the long term pay-out has been unattractive to private investors.  Therefore, the State has for the most part pursued a consistent planting programme and has taken the financial risks involved in planting large forests.</P>
    <P>The Forest and Wildlife Service have done tremendous work during the past decades in ensuring that forest lands provide a valuable crop of trees and, at the same time, offer a welcome amenity for the public for day trips and camping, as I am well aware in my constituency of Wicklow.  The wildlife sector has been kept within the departmental area of operation.  I am glad to see the interest being taken not only by the Minister but by his leader, the Taoiseach, when he was in Wicklow recently in getting large sections of the forest estate in Wicklow to remain within the Wildlife Service.  It will be expanded into a fine park in the Glendalough area.</P>
    <P>If I may go off on a tangent, let me say that now the Minister is setting up this company he should recognise that Wicklow is the cradle of the forest industry.</P>

      <P>When it was set up in 1904 it was established in Wicklow and the Minister has seen how it has advanced in that area.  The largest afforested county in Ireland percentagewise is Wicklow.  Therefore we naturally lay claim to the company being established in that county with so many obvious locations there.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I have just mentioned one, Avondale, and if the Minister wants more I can give him many alternatives but let us fix on that as the most obvious one for him.  I am sure it will please at least one of his Deputies from Wicklow, if not both of them.  I suggest that seriously to the Minister.  His Government have been involved in a certain decentralisation of Government Departments and State operations and they always seem to go beyond the counties near to Dublin.  This is an obvious one and the Minister should be generous in not going to seek it perhaps for his area or anybody else's.  Wicklow commands the best argument for the company to be established there.</P>
      <P>The primary purpose of the Bill is to establish a commercial company to which all the State forests will be transferred. We must ensure that the company is best placed to see that the industry develops to its best potential.  The forestry industry is on the eve of realising financial gains for which the public have paid over the past 60 years.  Therefore its growth should be reflected in a vast increase in exports, a flow of investment back to the industry and employment and jobs within the forests themselves and the downstream industries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The NESC in a major study of forestry issued a report in 1979 which projected that there would be in the region of 20,000 jobs over 20 years or so from that date.  I do not think the Minister in presenting the Bill here today indicated whether these jobs will be realised or if his Department could put a figure on the potential number of jobs envisaged in the next five years.  The NESC report detailed what is envisaged to be the overall responsibility of a forestry authority. These functions were divided into three <Col N="1590" /> distinct areas: a forest product development board who would have responsibility for developing a dynamic processing industry, a tree farming development board with responsibility for assuring continuity of supply to the processing sector and, of course, the Forest and Wildlife Service which would have responsibility for the protection and provision of land related to wildlife reserves and amenities.  This plan for the forestry industry was reiterated in a more recent study and proposal for a plan in 1984 and 1987 by the same group.  The plan acknowledged that there was considerable merit in exploiting the potential of the nation's forest products along the lines outlined in the earlier report, and suggested that a new State-sponsored body might be set up for this purpose. The plan went further and suggested that Bord na Móna might assume responsibility for the responsibilities since they had the technological expertise which might be employed to develop the competitive harvesting techniques required in the upland areas as well as having the requisite marketing skills.  I am happy that the Minister did not accept that recommendation, which was made very strongly, because the one area that perhaps the new forestry company will be deficient in is the marketing side of the operation.  If it is necessary to get the expertise from some State company like Bord na Móna these skills can be got.  It must be accepted that compared to a body like Bord na Móna, the Department's assets are huge and the numbers employed with expertise in tree planting and husbandry are there.  So only in the area of marketing will the Minister have to see that the new semi-State body will be strengthened and will have to have that commercial edge to their activities.  All the rest is there; the expertise is there.  Let me do what the Minister did and pay tribute to the staff of the forestry section of the Department.  I was greatly impressed with their knowledge and ability.  The only problem they seemed to have was that they were curtailed because of the structure in which they found themselves <Col N="1591" /> as civil servants in a Department.  I am well aware that many people there have the necessary skills to become very active in a totally commercial sense.  Indeed when the opportunity came for some of them to take some release time from the Department many of them went into commercial activity in forestry and demonstrated that the expertise is there to do a good job in that area.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides a welcome opportunity for State involvement in the commercial end of the industry.  The significance of this may be seen from the lucrative position which exists within the EC.  The Community imports about £15 billion worth of timber products and the UK alone imports £4.5 billion worth.  In fact the UK imports over 80 per cent of its timber needs and this represents a very favourable market very close to us here. The exporting opportunities are challenging and State involvement will ensure a return to the Exchequer and in turn to the public.  In addition the home industry should benefit from the timber harvest. At the moment we import about £400 million worth of timber and timber products many of which can be substituted by home grown products.  It would take an experienced and innovative marketing agency to ensure that the substitution happens.  I realise there have been developments in the area in the last seven or eight years with our share of the home market rising to about 50 per cent but there is still considerable room for improvement, particularly within the construction industry.  The Minister, my predecessor and I were involved in seeing that that change was taking place and the Minister has been endeavouring to accelerate it with substitution particularly in the construction industry.</P>
    <P>I have dealt with the potential of the industry in some detail because it is important to spell out its value to the nation in terms of both potential revenue and jobs.  Once we establish its value we can go on to discuss how it should be developed and talk about the chief beneficiaries.  In this regard I would like to move on to a number of the sections <Col N="1592" /> which, as I have said, caused me some concern.  I should like the Minister to refer to them in his summing up.</P>
    <P>Deputy Carey mentioned section 14 and I am also concerned about it.  The Bill states that the company shall submit and agree with the Minister each year a programme for the sale of land and timber.  The reference to the sale of land brings us back to the issue of privatisation.  The forest lands belong to the State; they are a public resource and to invest a Minister with the power to sell State lands is to open the door to privatisation of State forests.  The reference to the sale of timber is perfectly legitimate but perhaps the Minister will explain why he included the clause on the sale of land?  Does he intend to sell the plot of land with the infelled trees?  This was a measure I resisted in my time in office.  I was perfectly happy to sell semi-mature timber but not to give away the land with it.  I hope the Minister will explain this.</P>
    <P>When I was in the Department there was a proposal that we should sell semi-mature trees but not the land on which they were growing.  The Fianna Fáil group in the Seanad put down a motion on 14 May 1986 calling on the Government to prepare and implement a plan for the maximum exploitation of our forestry resources and rejected any attempt by the Government to dispose of State forestry to private banking or financial institutions.  The Minister can read the debate but I should like to remind him that some of his colleagues are on the same wavelength as I am in this regard and would not like to see that section used for the privatisation of the forest resource.</P>
    <P>The section is particularly worrying because it appears to be a subtle attempt to undermine the whole ethos of the Bill which purports to take over the management of State forests.  If this section is passed without amendment, there could be a complete diminution of the State forests within five to ten years.  Over the past two years there has been considerable speculation about the sale of mature and near mature forests.  Interest has been expressed by banks and other <Col N="1593" /> financial agencies involved in pension funds.  These financial institutions are not interested in investing in marginal or unused land.  They set their sights on the State lands, especially on forests which have been carefully cultivated over the past 40 years.  These forests have a highly developed road network, a carefully managed wildlife habitat and have been professionally thinned, pruned and inspected.  They represent the most valuable forest land in the State and would be a lucrative investment for any financial institution.  They would be an almost totally risk-free investment because all the work has been done and it only remains for the trees to mature.  It would be a big rip-off, as far as the State is concerned, to sell the land on which the trees grow. It would not make sense in view of the long term development of the forestry industry and certainly could not be priced in terms of past State investment and future potential.</P>
    <P>Research into private forests has shown that investment of this nature is more sporadic, less planned and less inclined to environmental protection than State run forests.  If State lands are sold the overall picture would be bleak. It is important for the Minister to elaborate on this section and tell the House how he envisages a new State company progressing if land is sold.</P>
    <P>Section 15 of the Bill deals with the articles of association.  The Minister has not made any provision for worker directors on the board.  In view of the new Worker Participation (State Enterprises) Bill, 1987, which is currently before the House, perhaps the Minister will raise this matter with the Minister for Labour so that the new forestry company will be included in that Bill?  There is already provision for worker directors in Bord na Móna and the extension of the concept to the forestry end of the industry would seem a logical and progressive move.  A precedent has already been set with the inclusion of An Post and Bord Telecom Éireann in the Bill.  Perhaps the Minister will comment in this regard.</P>
    <P>In section 27, which deals with capital to the company, a figure of £3 million is <Col N="1594" /> mentioned which seems to be a minimal amount for a new company, particularly when the emphasis is on exporting and manufacturing.  I know that section 26 provides a sum of £100 million for capital works.  Sections 24 and 25 mention the sum of £80 million for borrowings.  The figure of £3 million for the ongoing operational costs of the company is a little small.  Indeed, sections 24 and 25 are at variance with section 26 in relation to borrowings and moneys for capital works.  I am reminded of the position in B &amp; I which is being looked at by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Commercial Semi-State Bodies.  The company were dragged down by the amount of borrowings they had to make over the years and the level of interest payments.</P>
    <P>I would not like to see us starting on the wrong road by undercapitalising Coillte Teoranta.  The main factor in the case of the B &amp; I was the very heavy level of borrowings over the years and not their commercial operation.  Many thousands of people have lost their jobs as a result of their policy.  I hope the Minister will look at that section and assure us that the new company will not be saddled with huge borrowings from commercial banks after a very short time in operation.</P>
    <P>On 16 June 1987, speaking to the Confederation of Irish Industry, the Minister for Energy said that the emphasis for the new company will be on performance and results.  He said they would be expected to achieve profitability at the earliest possible date.  In view of this ambitious target the Minister should consider greater funding for the new company, at least in the early days.  Will he consider doubling the amount of working capital to the company?</P>
    <P>I was pleased to see that the Minister in section 43 introduced provisions in regard to staff remuneration and conditions similar to those negotiated for staff of Telecom Éireann.  It is natural that I should be concerned about this matter. From my reading of that section it appears that the Minister has followed faithfully the lines of the terms and conditions contained in the Postal and <Col N="1595" /> Telecommunications Services Act, 1983 which set up Telecom Éireann.  As a result of that I do not expect many difficulties to arise with the new company.  My colleague, Deputy O'Sullivan, when the Telecom Éireann Bill was going through the House spent a lot of time negotiating with the unions in an effort to ensure that the historic rights which the staff enjoyed would follow them when they transferred to the new company.  I congratulate the Minister on adopting those provisions which will mean that Members will not have as much to worry about when dealing with the Bill.</P>
    <P>We are all aware that there are established and non-established civil servants and I hope the Minister, when replying, will reassure us that those grades will not suffer in the change.  Such an assurance would be welcomed by the staff faced with the prospect of a transfer to the new company.  Forestry is different from Bord Telecom or An Post and, for that reason, it is necessary to give the staff the assurance I have sought.  I should like to assure the Minister that Members of the Labour Party are happy with the contents of the Bill.  I have outlined some of the areas that are causing us concern.  I hope the Minister can allay our fears when he is replying to the debate.  I am concerned, like others, about the possibility of privatisation.  These lands must be held in trust for the public and we should ensure that the new company provide more jobs and revenue for the State.  I congratulate the Minister on introducing the Bill and look forward to a detailed debate on its provisions on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Minister on introducing the Bill.  Since he was appointed Minister of State, Deputy Smith has shown a deep commitment and understanding of forestry.  I should like to compliment him on his work.  Deputy Kavanagh made a good case for making Wicklow the main centre of operation of the new company.  As a Member who passes through the Garden County when going to and coming from this House I can say that he has a good case.  The <Col N="1596" /> Deputy, when he was Minister, did good work for his county.  Forestry was, and is, an underdeveloped resource.  It is important that it be developed to its full potential because it has tremendous job creation potential.  For many years forestry was neglected.  The Fianna Fáil Party, before the last general election, committed themselves, if returned to office, to create the appopriate structures to ensure effective commercial exploitation of our forests and spearhead a vigorous drive to increase afforestation.  A dynamic forestry policy will generate employment, will improve our balance of payments and redistribute incomes to the different regions.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State has not wasted any time in implementing our policies. <i>The Programme for National Recovery</i> outlined a number of key Government objectives for forestry.  In 1987 we set a record national planting target of 11,000 hectares and the target we have set for 1988 is 13,000 hectares.  That represents an unprecedented level of planting.  The Minister has ensured that there will be an increased level of funding from the EC for forestry development and we should compliment him on that.  He has shown that forestry is top of the list for development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no doubt that there is a great market for timber and timber products. Experts tell us that the demand will increase in the foreseeable future.  We have the soil and the climate to grow trees faster than any country in Europe. This is an ideal opportunity for us to embark on a drive to develop our forests. Forecasts are that world wood consumption will soar to 5,000 million cubic meters by the year 2,000 with a considerable increase in paper and board consumption.  Similar trends are forecast for Europe with an expected deficit in excess of 120 million cubic metres.  The European Community annually import approximately £15 billion worth of timber and wood products while the UK import £4.5 billion worth of timber and wood products annually.  That is an indication of the market that exists in Europe and the UK for timber and wood products <Col N="1597" /> and it is up to us to develop our industry to take advantage of it.</P>
    <P>In Ireland timber and wood products to the value of £400 million are imported annually and a lot of those imports could be replaced by home grown timber.  The Minister told us recently that the amount of home grown timber used on the home market has increased from 8 per cent to 50 per cent.  That is an indication that there is a move towards the use of the home grown product.  We must take advantage of the scope for our products on the British market.  Irish building contractors operating in London, where there is a boom in the industry, say they find it difficult to get supplies of timber in the London area.  That represents an opportunity for our timber merchants but to avail of it they must have the proper financial support.  The new company should be to the forefront in encouraging the planting of trees and in developing our export markets.</P>
    <P>The commercial approach is the correct one and there is a need for great initiative to exploit our forest resources and their future potential.  The new body will have the function of planning afforestation programmes to ensure continuity of supplies of timber.  It will also have the responsibility of dealing with the major challenge of guaranteeing a modern production industry with an adequate and accurately forecasted supply of timber.  The ongoing re-equipment and modernisation of the saw milling industry is also an area for which they will have responsibility.  Financial support is essential to upgrade facilities and enable this country to compete on the European and world stage.  As the State forest sector begins in the next decade to generate increased activity and financial returns its magnificent structure will need to be geared to deal with new developments and changing circumstances.  As output from the investment in forestry since the foundation of the State begins to come on stream it is essential to have a vigorous, commercially orientated body to exploit the available opportunities and plan for the future.  The whole timber industry is <Col N="1598" /> under scrutiny and the Minister is playing his part to ensure that we will develop so as to take advantage of the available markets.</P>
    <P>Some of those involved in the industry, particularly the smaller saw millers, say they are not getting a fair deal.  They contend that the larger companies are gaining all the benefits.  The smaller saw millers maintain that it is not in their interests to have a tender system.  They feel there should be an option system for all timber put on the market.  The smaller operators also maintain that the quota system is loaded against them.  In some cases they may be left without timber because larger companies such as Woodfab get the first choice and the smaller companies are not looked after.  I have nothing against the larger companies who are, of course, very important to our economy.</P>
    <P>The Minister should consider the question of IDA involvement in the saw milling industry.  Near my home is a small saw milling company which employs 15 or sometimes 20 people.  Any time they seek assistance from the IDA they are refused on one ground or another.  It was announced recently that extra jobs created would carry a £5,000 grant but when these small saw millers tried to avail of it they were unsuccessful.  There is too much red tape in the job creation area. If a saw milling company create extra jobs they deserve the help and assistance of the IDA.  Every job created is vital and I would ask the Minister to take a serious interest in making incentives available.</P>
    <P>Concern has been expressed that people cannot get jobs in forestry because the major companies use contractors to take the timber from the forest.  The contractor himself will probably have his PRSI documentation but 90 per cent of his employees will be working in the black economy and signing on for unemployment assistance.  There is probably a problem for the Minister for Social Welfare.  The two Ministers should co-operate to ensure that these employees have PRSI numbers.  Members on all sides of this House want to get away from the <Col N="1599" /> black economy and create long-term sustainable jobs.</P>
    <P>There seems to be a reluctance on the part of farmers to become involved in the forestry industry, on the basis that if they plant their lands they will not see any return for 20 or 25 years.  I commend the Minister on launching three new initiatives designed to encourage private afforestation, the western package scheme, a new farm forestry scheme and a new compensatory allowance for headage payments which will allow farmers in receipt of headage payments in respect of livestock to continue to receive those payments if they afforest part or all of their land.  The Minister has a major selling job in this area.  Thousands of acres are suitable for the growing of trees but the farmers are reluctant.  Every help and assistance should be made available to encourage them to plant.  In the long term it would be in the best interest of the country.  Large sums of money in pension funds and so on could also be used for the development of the forestry industry. The Minister is considering the whole question of the development of forestry by the private sector.</P>
    <P>The protection of woodlands is essential.  We had a case in Wicklow some time ago when very valuable timber was being cut down but because of the intervention of the then Minister and the Taoiseach action was taken to prevent it.  It is important that there should be increased vigilance and monitoring in line with environmental policies to ensure the protection of our woodlands, which are so valuable for tourism and for people coming out of the towns and cities for weekend breaks and holidays.  The development of these amenities improves the qualify of life for both urban and rural people, as well as attracting tourists. There is scope for the development of forests to facilitate recreational activities such as hiking, camping, orienteering, mountaineering, shooting and bird watching.  These and other amenities could be self-financing within the overall tourism framework.</P>
    <P>In general the Minister is doing a good <Col N="1600" /> job on which I compliment him.  I ask him to ensure that initially this new company will be given every support, financially and in every other way, so that it will operate properly and in a constructive fashion for the development of the forestry industry in the immediate future and for the years ahead.  There is tremendous potential for the creation of new job opportunities in planting and other downstream developments of this industry.  In this country where there is a serious scarcity of jobs, it is up to all of us, all the Departments and those operating in the forestry industry, to ensure that at the end of the day jobs are created for our people.  We have many well educated, highly talented people who could be used in the context of this new company to develop the industry in the way in which the Minister and all the political parties want it developed.  At present there are highly intelligent graduates leaving the country whom we should be able to encourage to become involved in this industry.  I compliment the Minister on setting up the new company and bringing in the new Bill.  I wish him continued success in this area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>The Workers' Party welcome the general thrust of this Bill.  We have always believed that the potential for forestry here has been seriously underdeveloped and that if it were to be properly exploited it would be necessary to move management of our State forests from direct Civil Service control into the semi-State area.  Most people would agree that the decision to move the postal and telecommunications areas out of direct Civil Service control and keep them under public ownership in the form of two semi-State companies, Telecom Éireann and An Post, has been generally successful and has led to improved services and standards in these areas.  We hope that the decision to establish a State company for forestry will prove similarly successful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The failure of successive Governments to exploit the natural advantage this country enjoys with regard to forestry development should be a matter of great <Col N="1601" /> shame.  At school we were taught during history lessons that one of the greatest crimes of English rule was the destruction of the great Irish forests for use in their industries.  However, we have now had more than 65 years of self-government and progress towards reaf-forestation has been totally inadequate. We have nobody to blame but our Governments.  Of European countries, Iceland only has a smaller proportion of land planted than Ireland.  We have just 5 per cent of land planted, compared with 65 per cent in Sweden, 30 per cent in Norway and Germany and 25 per cent in France.  Even Holland, where there is a great shortage of land, has a much higher area under forestry than we have.</P>
    <P>Various programmes have been announced by different Governments over the years, aimed at expanding our forestry.  Different targets have been set for planting rates, but these have rarely been achieved.  In 1948, the Government produced a White Paper that provided for the establishment of 10,000 hectares of new plantation per annum over a 40-year period.  The aim was to give us a total of productive State forests of 470,000 hectares by 1990, compared with 70,000 hectares in 1948.  As we approach 1990, the actual area under forestry is less than half the target set in 1948 and the target rate of 10,000 hectares of new plantation has never been met.  Although we came close to it in the years 1965, 1971 and 1972, in more recent years the planting rate has fallen again and in 1985 there were less than 5,000 hectares of new planting.  I ask the Minister if Bord na Móna will be allowed to develop their cutaway bogs and avail of the available grants.  I should like a reply on that matter.</P>
    <P>It must be said that whatever limited progress has been made has been due to State involvement.  State forestry has been built up from a very tiny base of 3,000 acres 50 years ago to a figure of about 800,000 acres now.  Clearly, if we had been relying on private investment we would have almost no forestry at all because about 80 per cent of our forestry is under public ownership.  Unlike most <Col N="1602" /> other European countries where there are substantial amounts of privately owned forestry, forestry here is just one further example of how private enterprise has failed to develop an important resource.  The iron law of Irish private enterprise economics applies to forestry as to all other areas of the economy &mdash; unless there are super profits to be made rapidly, the resource will be under-utilised or, worse, unused altogether.</P>
    <P>Over the past few years there have been a number of suggestions made that the State should consider selling off its forests once they begin to mature.  The Workers' Party would be absolutely opposed to this.  It makes no sense at all, on an economic basis or otherwise, to suggest selling off the forests now that they are coming to a maturity and the State stands poised to reap the benefits of 50 years of work and investment.  To do so would be the same as a farmer planting a grain crop, putting months of work into it and then selling it off just before the harvest.</P>
    <P>There is, of course, no reason private investors should not be involved in forestry development but, as with the State, from the very beginning there should be no shortcuts for private enterprise.  Grants of up to 85 per cent of the approved cost of planting are already available for private enterprise in western areas, subject to a maximum of £800 per hectare.  Despite this and the very generous tax concessions, private investors have shown little interest in the forestry area.</P>
    <P>Forestry as a resource is as important as mineral deposits or oil reserves.  It is far too important to leave to fly-by-night operators and &ldquo;quick buck&rdquo; merchants of Irish capitalism.  Private investors can, by all means, become involved.  Indeed, it is particularly suitable for institutional investments such as pension funds which require a safe, long-term investment, but the central role in forestry development must remain with the public sector.  The expansion of our forestry and the development of a large-scale wood product industry must constitute a centrally <Col N="1603" /> important plan in any programme for industrial development.</P>
    <P>Forests are an extremely valuable natural resource with the particular advantage of being renewable.  Wood production presents tremendous downstream processing potential.  One job in the forests is generally associated with four jobs off the plantations.  Wood as a basic raw material, besides its highly attractive features, has the advantage of being a very versatile material.  Wood can be used in a wide range of applications, in construction, furniture, paperboard, packaging, engineering, and a myriad of other possibilities such as toys, tools, household implements and so forth.</P>
    <P>The expansion of domestic wood production is particularly advantageous to the development of a large-scale wood processing sector by virtue of the fact that timber is a very expensive raw material to import and the nearest large-scale forest area to Ireland is as far away as Scandinavia.  Aside from the economic and social desirability of developing a big forest and wood product industry it is a fact that the soil and environmental conditions of this island are uniquely suitable for the growth of timber, particularly soft woods which account for 85 per cent of national timber imports.</P>
    <P>In some rural areas there has been opposition to expanded forestry development but this is based more on emotion than logic, as the fact is that in many areas because of soil conditions forestry is far more likely to provide jobs and a decent standard of living than farming.  If the public are to reap the full potential benefit from our forests it is essential that the new company be involved in all aspects of the industry.</P>
    <P>In the Nordic countries and the US where the timber industries are highly efficient and capital-intensive, the production and processing of timber is in the main controlled by one management.  In Ireland, the State owns and manages the forests, and private enterprise owns and manages or mismanages the wood processing industry.  It is not clear from the Bill whether it is envisaged that <Col N="1604" /> the new company would be involved in the wood processing industry, but unless it is, we will not be in a position to develop the industry to its full potential.  At present we have a relatively large number of sawmills but what we need is a small number of large capital-intensive sawmills with proper drying facilities.</P>
    <P>In 1987 we spent £30 million on imports of conifer wood that we could have produced ourselves.  Paper imports, a product which uses timber as a raw material, cost £298 million in 1987 which was an increase of £33 million over 1986.  The more timber we can produce and the more spin-off products we can make from this timber the better it will be for the economy and the people.  Trees are a valuable resource.  Not only can they provide wealth and jobs but they can also improve the environment generally and are an important recreational amenity which can be enjoyed by the public.  In this regard we welcome the provision in the Bill for increased penalties for the unlawful felling of trees.</P>
    <P>There are a number of other points in relation to the Bill which I would like the Minister to answer when replying. Section 12 sets out the objectives of the company and is notable for the absence of any reference to the right of the company to acquire land compulsorily for forestry.  Under existing legislation the Minister has the right to acquire land compulsorily for forestry and it is important that the company should have the same right.  The power to acquire land compulsorily, with adequate compensation, of course, is vital if we are to bring our planting level to an acceptable standard.</P>
    <P>It is most disappointing that provision has not been made in the Bill for the appointment of worker directors.  This seems to be a company which would be particularly suitable for worker directors. Will the Minister explain why this has not been done?</P>
    <P>We are also concerned about section 21 of the Bill which provides that the Minister for Finance may sell any or all of the shares of the company held by him, and may facilitate the privatisation of the <Col N="1605" /> company and its auxiliaries without any further reference to the Dáil.  I understand also that the union representing most of the workers in forestry are concerned about the provisions of section 43 which allows the transfer of staff by the Minister from the Department of Energy to the new company and provides for conditions of service, remuneration and tenure of office of the staff.  The union are concerned that only staff transferred from the Department to the company with effect from vesting day are covered by the guarantees.  They believe that staff could be transferred before or after vesting day and that they will not be covered by the guarantees of good conditions and services.  This section needs to be amended and we will table an amendment to it and to other sections on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. M. Kitt Mr. M. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill which I am glad to say establishes a commercial forestry company.  I congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy Smith, on the great work he has put into this Bill and on the many visits he made throughout the country speaking to people about their ideas for a forestry Bill.  I welcome what the Minister said about the measures he has taken in relation to forestry, through EC funding.  As a Deputy from the west I am aware of the efforts to get funds under the western package for the promotion of forestry.  The western package scheme aimed originally at the poorer areas of the west has been extended to all disadvantaged areas and EC funding has been increased from 50 per cent to 70 per cent.  This will have a major impact on the promotion of forestry.  The Minister also has been successful in getting grants totalling over £8 million for road building in State forests.  This is a great achievement having regard to problems of access to our forests.  These measures together with the farm forestry scheme aimed at full-time farmers and the measures regarding headage payments will allow farmers who may have been reluctant in the past, to plant trees.  This will help them to forest part of their lands in <Col N="1606" /> disadvantaged areas.  The headage payment scheme negotiated by the Minister will be 50 per cent funded by the EC.</P>
      <P>It is worth noting that a joint committee of this House which reported two years ago on forestry and forest-based industries made many useful suggestions for promoting forestry.  The Minister of State was a member of that committee chaired by Deputy Collins, now Minister for Justice.  The sub-committee was chaired by Deputy Joe Walsh, Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food.  That report pointed out clearly that there had been a disappointing response to the previous western package, and they recommended extending the scheme to the whole country.  This was their response to the problem.  It is worth noting now that under this Bill we are extending the scheme to all the disadvantaged areas.</P>
      <P>The committee in their report also dealt with job creation and pointed out, taking the period 1977 to 1980, that 41,000 jobs were lost in the timber and timber products sector and that the number in papermills had reduced from 1,300 in 1974 to 903 in 1980.  They also pointed out that in the wood processing area approximately 24,000 jobs had been lost between 1977 and 1980.  This was a source of concern to them and in their report they indicated the percentage of land under forestry in Ireland as compared with other countries and as compared with the EC average.  I understand that the percentage of land under forestry in Ireland was 6 per cent as compared with 9 per cent in Britain, 27 per cent in France and 29 per cent in Germany with the EC average at that time being 21 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are debating this issue at a time when quotas have been introduced on milk, beef and cereals and at a time when, as the Minister of State has stated, there is a problem with acid rain in Europe and when it is important that we develop our forestry industry.  Our climate is ideally suited to timber production.  We have a fast growing conifer in the sitka spruce and taking yield class as being cubic metres per hectare we have the highest <Col N="1607" /> yield class in Europe with a figure of 14 as compared with 11 in Britain and an EC average of 3.5.  I understand that County Leitrim has the highest yield class of any county in this country.  I was glad to hear the Minister mention that because of the importance of forestry to the west and north west region he is considering setting up a processing factory in that region.  It would be deplorable if such a factory was not provided in the area which has the highest yield class.</P>
    <P>Among the submissions received by the joint committee was one from the co-operative movement, the ICOS, who referred in their submission to the fragmentation of farms in the west.  In order to deal with this problem and to take advantage of the grants available under the western package they proposed the development of two pilot forestry cooperatives.  I put it to the Minister of State that such an approach might prove very successful especially in view of the grants which are now available and might result in the bringing together in one viable block small areas of land.  One of the difficulties facing smallholders is that they will have to wait a long time before they get a return on their investment and in this respect the Minister's proposal on providing headage payments is to be welcomed.  The ICOS in their submission referred to forward selling of timber but I think the Minister's proposal is most welcome.</P>
    <P>A submission was also received from the saw milling industry which referred to the way in which timber is sold to saw mills by the Forest and Wildlife Service. They also complained about the absence of accurate production forecasts from the Department which would have enabled them to plan ahead.  I hope the new body, Coillte Teoranta, will be able to address these problems which the industry has highlighted on many occasions in the past.</P>
    <P>I have already outlined the number of jobs which have been lost in this industry but I have every confidence that jobs will be created and that they will be created in the areas where the trees will be <Col N="1608" /> planted.  We have seen jobs lost in the past because of the large imports of certain products.  There have been large imports of timber and timber products and in reply to a question which was tabled to the Minister recently he quoted a figure of £206 million in imports of paper, paper board products and timber products in 1982.  In 1983 that figure had gone up to £217 million.  In a country which has a very good yield from its planting programme we should be in a position to supply our own needs and follow the example of other countries which have developed good forestry programmes in the past.  One such country is Finland where in 1980 19.90 million hectares were under productive forest which amounted to 71 per cent of the land area.  Yet, Finland has only a yield class of three cubic metres per hectare as compared with 16 for this country.</P>
    <P>The Minister has certainly taken on board the recommendations of the joint committee and has met all interest groups in an endeavour to make improvements on the position which has obtained up to now.  There has been much discussion in the media about the role of Bord na Móna in the development of our forestry sector. In 1987 Bord na Móna published a document entitled &ldquo;A Plan for Forestry&rdquo; which contained a proposal for a pulp and paper industry.  They also proposed the setting up of an industry in my own constituency at Derryfada, near Ballyforan.  I would welcome the setting up of an industry in that area because Bord na Móna have already undertaken some development there but regrettably that development has been suspended.  The Government have decided that Bord na Móna should concentrate on their core business which is turf production and I understand they will be leasing cut-away bogs which are suitable for forestry development to the forestry service.  I hope that, as our bogs become depleted, forestry will provide opportunities for job creation.</P>
    <P>Having said that, I would not envisage Bord na Móna being in a position to take over our forestry industry.  Bord na Móna <Col N="1609" /> have been involved in some experimentation on what is known as short rotation or biomass forestry which has not been successful.  Unfortunately, also, they dug up many small trees in bogs because, as they said at the time, they needed extra boglands for peat or turf production.  Having done so, it is now ironic that some people in Bord na Móna are anxious to become involved in the forestry industry.</P>
    <P>The findings of a report commissioned by Bord na Móna last year caused some concern.  I would not agree with many of the conclusions of that report.  For example, it was forecast that henceforth very little investment would take place in forestry.  I consider that forecast to be very pessimistic because there is now a great opportunity for people to become involved in forestry.  The writers of that report also concluded that Bord na Móna could save themselves from extinction by taking over our State forests but only with continued State funding.  In so saying they appeared to be thinking of their position only, not of the economy overall.</P>
    <P>Certainly Bord na Móna voiced harsh criticism of the decline in tree planting by successive Governments since the mid-seventies.  They appeared to me to be looking at biomass forestry in which they had had some involvement but without success.  Henceforth I hope they will concentrate on their main area of responsibility, that of turf production.</P>
    <P>If I may veer away somewhat from the provisions of this Bill, I might say that Bord na Móna appear to have ceased their involvement in turf and peat production in the west, appearing to withdraw economically from that area because of their financial problems.  I hope that practice will be reversed in the future because their general development in the west is crucial to that area. Of course we also need the development of forestry in the west, the land there being suitable for that purpose.  The figures I have given for the various counties, particularly Leitrim, will demonstrate how important is forestry to that region.</P>
    <P>I might refer to the problem of pollution about which much has been said <Col N="1610" /> of late and which constitutes such a problem in our capital city and major towns.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Jim Tunney">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Deputy also will demonstrate that it is a problem under this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. M. Kitt Mr. M. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I will endeavour to do so. A recent paper by Dr. Lunny on the future of timber for energy in Ireland stated clearly that there is an inherent environmental problem in that many imports, particularly coal, have a high sulphur content, emphasising that we have very little control over the content of such imports.  He suggested that timber, a non-polluting fuel, could be used by small industries and households.  I would suggest to the Minister of State present that this suggestion should be promoted among farmers owning land suitable for afforestation purposes because timber is a very good, non-polluting handy fuel. Coal could continue to be used by larger industries but, as we know, it is very costly for the smaller industries to instal the requisite apparatus to prevent the pollution that is occurring at present.  I merely make that point about the usage of timber as an alternative source of energy in small industries and homes.</P>
      <P>I am very pleased with the name of the new company &mdash; Coillte Teoranta &mdash; because there has been much contentious debate in this House recently about the names of companies or semi-State bodies.  In the capable hands of the Minister of State who has responsibility for forestry I am sure there will never be the danger of deireadh na gcoillte ar lár.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill.  I compliment the Minister on its introduction and on his initiative in the whole area of forestry.  He has portrayed himself as very positive in this respect and the industry overall will benefit from his stewardship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I have some reservations about its provisions.  For example, they fail to address the issue of the valuation of assets covered at some length by Deputy Carey.  There is also an absence of any specified planting targets.  Neither is <Col N="1611" /> there any reference to research and development in the functions of the new company.  I am sure that such research and development are inherent and that any new company would be expected to place much emphasis on that aspect. There is no mention of any downstream industry, for example, that of sawmilling or the development of the pulpwood industry in general.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister would clarify the position henceforth of the wildlife service; for example, will the new company be responsible for it?  I am sure these reservations will be discussed further on Committee Stage.  My party will be tabling a number of amendments to address such matters.</P>
    <P>I agree with the establishment of a dynamic State company to progressively develop our forestry industry on a strong commercial basis, advocated by the Forestry Review Group and a number of predecessors of the present Minister. That being said, this new company must accommodate the interests and requirements of the timber processing sector and forest owners, public or private.  To date the relationship between people involved in the timber processing industry and forest owners, public or private, was not the best and probably hindered the overall development of the industry.</P>
    <P>I contend that the new company must concern itself with the quality of our native timber &mdash; and perhaps the Minister will address this matter later &mdash; because we need more kiln-drying facilities in our sawmills.  I understand that at present only three to four of our sawmills have kiln-drying facilities which must detract from the quality of our timber especially when one bears in mind that we must compete with the Scandinavians. At present Canadian timber is being dumped on the Irish market because of the attractiveness of the exchange rates. I am sure the IDA can play an important role in this area.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;That Dáil Éireann requests the Committee of Procedure and Privileges to report to it within three months with</P>
      <P>(a) proposals, with necessary safeguards, for the televising of Dáil proceedings, and</P>
      <P>(b) proposals for a more general programme of reforms to Dáil procedure, covering limitations on the length of speeches, procedures for dealing with urgent matters and the relevancy and admissibility of Parliamentary Questions.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Dáil must be seen to be in touch with the reality of the late 20th century if it is to maintain a respected position in the way our national affairs are conducted. When the Constitution was framed it was envisaged that the public would have access to its proceedings.  People have the right to attend the Dáil when it is in session and the full proceedings of the Dáil are published and available to the public.  This is the way it should be and it operates well.  Of course, the newspapers present its proceedings fairly widely as well, so from the point of view of the written word it has fairly good coverage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In more recent times provision for radio broadcasting was allowed, and I might add that this happened only quite recently.  When one reflects that this is 1988 and that it was only in 1986 that it came into being, no one can accuse us of being over hasty in bringing the media into the Chamber.  I think all of us would admit that it has not changed the face of this House in any way.  It has improved <Col N="1613" /> the general tenure of it and people are more aware of what is happening within the Chamber.</P>
    <P>This motion is a logical extension of widening access to the proceedings of Parliament by means of televising the Dáil.  Television is the most powerful and popular means of mass communication of the late 20th century and it is one the Dáil should be able to avail of in its attempt to inform the public of the measures being debated and issues being discussed by it.  We should no longer have to rely on secondhand television reports of the Dáil proceedings.  Instead we should permit the public to see the Dáil as it is.  We in this institution have nothing to be ashamed of and no need to be defensive.  When some of the harshest of critics of the way the Dáil operates have seen it operating for some time their harshness tends to mellow because they understand how this House and Parliament generally operates.</P>
    <P>However, this is not to say that legitimate fears may not be aroused by this issue.  For example some people fear that television, because it is such a powerful communicator, may be used to denigrate the workings of the Dáil and its Deputies. Others feel that the role of the TD may be misunderstood if it is presented by TV in a vacuum.  Others feel that some Deputies may attempt to act differently merely because cameras are allowed inside the Dáil Chamber.  These fears cannot be dismissed lightly but nevertheless they can be catered for by the proper and controlled introduction of the televising of this House.  Issues on the extent and manner of coverage, the means of editing debates, Question Time, the scope to which the camera would focus on Deputies who are not speaking and other issues can and should be resolved before cameras are admitted into the Chamber.  These are issues which can be tackled when a decision has been taken in principle and when the Committee on Procedures and Privileges bring forward a report to the House for formal approval.</P>
    <P>I am aware that a major change such as televising the Dáil is not one which <Col N="1614" /> everyone is equally enthusiastic about, and for that reason any attempt to introduce television should be on the basis of sensitivity to the concerns of the Members after full discussion on the manner of the coverage.  Some Deputies might argue that there will be a move towards sensationalism and away from serious debate if TV cameras are allowed to cover the Dáil proceedings.  There is no doubt that even now some Deputies focus on the sensational to gain headlines rather than focusing on the less exciting substance of argument which has stood the test of time.  Undoubtedly such behaviour will continue, but the fact that some Deputies might abuse the televising of the Dáil is not a reason for not introducing it.  We are aware that that is going to happen; it is part of the cut and thrust of political life both inside and outside the House, but I have no doubt that those people can be seen through.  The vast majority of Deputies are not sensationalist in their approach.  They are hard working, dedicated and responsible and they rely on the quality of their contributions in this Chamber and their work on behalf of their constituents.  While a Deputy who sensationalises issues might attempt at first to get a lot of coverage, time will take care of that and we should not unduly worry or over-emphasise that situation.</P>
    <P>With regard to whether the role of Deputies would be misunderstood, if the cameras focus on empty benches during debates, I do not worry about that because that is the way the Chamber works.  On the Committee Stage of a Bill a Minister and perhaps one or two Deputies from this side or any other side who are involved are present and I think that system works well and effectively.  I do not see how it could work any better if all the benches were full.  The televising of the Dáil will educate the public on what Parliament is all about and we should have no fears about this.  I know from constituents of mine who have visited the Dáil when it is in session that they were initially surprised that there were not more Deputies in the Chamber, but the lasting memory is not of the sight <Col N="1615" /> but of the quality of the discussion and the various views and complex issues put forward by all sides of the House.  That is what stands out ultimately and that is what matters.</P>
    <P>I firmly believe that we should not seek to overcontrol the cameras in what they pick out.  We need Parliament to be shown as it is, as any member of the public can see it from the public gallery. Of course provisions have to be made for fair and not selective editing of material. When I use the word &ldquo;fair&rdquo; I mean fair to the working of the Dáil.  I do not hold with the argument that the cameras should be forced to show the Dáil as something it is not, and that is important.</P>
    <P>Radio coverage of the Dáil has been a success. Television could be an even more resounding success in that it will enable people to see what is going on rather than merely hearing voices which at times it may be difficult to identify.  All of us here subscribe to open government, meaning that it is open to the public. Television already plays a role in this regard through the debates between politicians in television studios, through interviews with interest groups, representatives and so on.  The time is now ripe for television to play a bigger role in making the process of national decision-making more open by televising the affairs of the Chamber.  Otherwise television studio debates and interviews will begin to usurp the role of Parliament as ordinary people feel that Parliament is both remote and irrelevant.  The public should have the opportunity of seeing politicians debate across the House with each other without a television interviewer.  In this way the role and functions of the Dáil Deputy will be enhanced.</P>
    <P>Some may say that the nature of the Dáil will be changed by television.  I agree that television will not leave the Dáil unchanged.  However, I believe it will change for the better.  More important, I believe the Dáil must change and evolve as society outside changes and evolves. We cannot expect the Dáil to operate in a 19th century manner as we approach the 21st century.  The Dáil is an institution <Col N="1616" /> which is well able to sustain changes in the way it operates.  We have seen this before when procedures of the House were changed.  We have seen changes in the way Question Time is conducted and in the way in which committees now operate to supplement the work of the Dáil Chamber.  There have been many other changes as well in the area of the Estimates.</P>
    <P>Reform must always be on-going.  We must never fear change because it can bring good.  One example of that is that we are having a debate here on Thursday with short speeches from selected Deputies.  If that sort of debate was televised it would heighten interest in our entry into the single European market in 1992.  That is the kind of thing television could do, particularly with that type of debate on very important issues such as the Cecchini report.  If this were done on television there would be tremendous interest in it.  That is what people would like to see.</P>
    <P>Hopefully, when we get around to this change the general public will have more interest and will see that this Chamber is much more relevant to them than they thought it was.  That is what we all want to see because we sense, from time to time, a cynicism out there about our institutions, particularly about parliament.  It is easy to knock us and cynics tend to knock us because they themselves are prepared to do nothing anyway.  I believe that the general public, by looking in, seeing what really happens, the hard work that goes on here, particularly on Committee Stage, will change their views and attitudes and the work that Dáil Deputies do will be highlighted.</P>
    <P>Televising parliamentary proceedings is not new.  Many parliaments have had television in their chambers for many years.  The European Parliament is televised and none of our MEPs seem to have been upset by this, nor would they say that people behave mildly differently in front of the cameras.  That may happen initially but it is not par for the course.</P>
    <P>In debating this issue we should be concerned about the impact television will have on the workings of this House. <Col N="1617" /> We should be careful to list the good points as well as the bad.  More important is the benefit television will bring by making the public more aware.  This is all the more necessary at a time when people are becoming cynical.  Television will be a vital tool in diluting this cynicism by making people aware.  We say there should be greater use of technology and encourage it in schools and in industry but when it comes to introducing technology in the House, for some strange reason, we are rather slow.  We want to keep our little cloister tightly held; we do not want to let too much light in because it might be bad.  That is not what we really want.  For that reason I ask this House to fully support this motion.</P>
    <P>I suppose when one reflects that this is 1988 and television has been in this country since 1960 one wonders why it has taken us so long to get to the stage of talking about this here tonight, but parliament by its nature is slow.  That is no bad thing because we are making laws for people and we should not make them with undue haste but reflect and think hard and then make them in the best interests of society.  What we are doing here this evening is being done in the best interests of society because we want to open this to everybody so that they can see that this House has a real relevance and debates real issues.  There are people in this House who are very concerned about what happens outside and who try to change the rules and change society to make it a better place.  Why should we be afraid to put that on view?  I suppose that as a people we sometimes fear change, I do not know why, but this is now a means to a greater awareness of this House.  What we particularly want is that our young people would take an interest in politics because they will be the ones who will come after us.  If more people take an active interest in politics, there will be a breath of fresh air through our political system.</P>
    <P>Our political system has become a little incestuous in the sense that one is in a political party which has long traditions, and which tends to feed off itself and its families.  That is how it works.  People <Col N="1618" /> have a great knowledge now, particularly a visual knowledge, of what is happening. What is being proposed should encourage people to say, &ldquo;I like what I see, I think I can make a career in politics, there is important work to be done and I believe I can dedicate myself to doing it.&rdquo;  There is a spin off there.  That can only be good for all political parties and indeed for all our institutions.  Basically, that is all I want to say about televising proceedings of the House.</P>
    <P>In our motion we are asking the Committee on Procedure and Privileges to report within three months but I would not object to extending that period to six months, given that we are now moving towards the summer recess because July and August, during which many people may be away, would be two-thirds of that time.  We must have a time limit though and we must bring this matter forward for final approval as quickly as possible. We must be seen to be serious and to act on it and I am prepared to accept additional time for the reasonably logical reasons given.</P>
    <P>In that motion we talk about questions but I think that is a matter we can deal with in the format of the committee.  We need not debate the general line of questions as Question Time would seem to have lost some of its relevance, we should look at it again to see how we can make it a more worthwhile exercise.  The whole question of the Order of Business should be examined to see if there could be some format for dealing with matters of urgency which arise.  I know we can seek to raise questions on the Adjournment or by means of a Private Notice Question but it might be helpful if we had a more structured arrangement, possibly late in the evening, where there would be a kind of grouser's corner as it were, when people could raise genuine gripes relating to their constituencies and Ministers would respond.  Such an arrangement for, say, the last half hour might engender a little aggro but that is often not a bad thing.</P>

      <P>Yes, but we have it too tightly structured.  There is a need for something like that to be arranged.  We should not debate national issues in the sense that I stand up and say something and somebody says something else as if we were competing against one another. What we need is a general talk on real issues, perhaps spending a day teasing them out.  I have no doubt that both sides of the House have wisdom and knowledge and if the whole House can benefit from that in a reasonable and ordered way, that can only be good.  My colleague, Deputy John Bruton, has pioneered Dáil reform and he is always anxious to bring about changes.  May we continue to have people like him who want to see change, not for the sake of change, but to improve the general structures of this House so that it will benefit the general community.</P>
      <P>In conclusion I ask the House to support this motion.  Our proposal is not earth shattering, it would not change the whole way of life, it would not change Parliament but, I believe, it would improve Parliament and would improve the attitude and vision which people have of Parliament.  They will see Parliament as it really is, as it works, with some of its lumps and bumps.  Like any human assembly it has that imperfection and we should not be afraid of it.  It would be appropriate if we got all-party agreement on this motion so that we could put the matter before the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, not in the sense of wanting to see how we can stop something but working together to get back into this House the reality of good clean legislation that will allay fears and will ensure that this House becomes more relevant.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to join with the previous speaker in welcoming this motion which I hope will not be opposed by any section of the House.  It is no easy task to reform the Dáil to such an extent <Col N="1620" /> as envisaged by the motion.  We are talking about updating the mechanics of the Dáil and bringing the deliberations of this Chamber into the homes of the people throughout the country.  That is why the motion is somewhat open-ended in so far as it is enabling the Committee on Procedure and Privileges to tease out the various pros and cons &mdash; and there are many &mdash; of televising the Dáil and moving towards a greater reform of Dáil procedures that we have at present.  I think everybody in the House is in agreement that it is very important that we in the Legislature move with technology and use the most modern and up to date technology available.  In this regard one must compliment the offices of the Government Departments, particularly the offices of Ministers of State who have become expert in the use of word processors.  Because of that we should have no inhibitions and there should be no bar in extending the modern technology to introduce television cameras into the Dáil Chamber.  The cost factor is a matter which the Committee on Procedure and Privileges will consider in great detail.  I do not envisage any physical barriers in terms of lighting, noise or large microphones, which would inhibit the speakers in the course of their deliberations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The public perception of politicians is not good but we can do a great deal to resolve that difficulty.  In many ways it can be resolved by public relations and there is no better PR exercise than to allow the people an opportunity of seeing how the debates are carried on.  We are distanced from the people, nobody can deny that.  One has only to take a random survey of those people who enter the public gallery.  In the main they are school tours, many interested women's groups from throughout the country who take an opportunity of seeing the proceedings at first hand, on occasion the political activist passing through on his way to or from a party headquarters who does not spend much time in the public gallery, or the deputation from a rural area who are here not to hear the proceedings in the House but trying to get some money from their favourite Minister of the day.  We <Col N="1621" /> have this problem with the public gallery; tonight there are one, two or three people there.  If TV cameras were portraying the Dáil proceedings people would see the type of activity the politician is engaged in throughout the day and if the quality of the debate is heard we could enhance our role in the community.</P>
    <P>The major criticism I have is the second-hand nature of the TV coverage. For example, today we have the TV news of the Dáil sitting exemplified as a cheap publicity gimmick of a suspension of a Member from the House which took up almost 30 minutes of Dáil time; I would go as far as to say it was timed deliberately for TV coverage and had the result it was designed to achieve.  The point was brought home to me when I was in the restaurant with a 16-year old schoolboy who said that Deputy could enjoy the rest of the week in a boat on Lough Corrib.  It is regrettable that this is the type of publicity coming from the House.  Were the TV cameras in the Chamber, were the debates shown for half an hour in the evening, we would not as a House have to resort to such cheap political gimmickry.  I have no doubt that the TV cameras would address such occurrences.</P>
    <P>The motion goes further than just allowing the TV cameras into these hallowed Chambers; it goes on to deal with Dáil reform in which we have made some strides over a number of years and perhaps we have not given ourselves sufficient kudos when it comes to the written reply to the PQ.  I would like to see the Adjournment debate given some sparkle.  Perhaps we could double the time for it and it would be not so much an individual Deputy raising the matter of his choice, but, four, five or six Deputies could have a common motion to put forward in the evening and discuss the matter for about an hour.  I would like to see an increase in Private Members' time, although I suppose one could not expect the Government to forego some of their time.  However, perhaps this sitting could be extended for an hour some time in the evening.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1622" /> I see a far greater role for the committees.  We have seven at the moment and there is need for perhaps 17.  I see the record of legislation in the past 12 to 13 months not being good and next year when the Official Report is published in bound volume 1987 will appear in rather thin volumes.  There are a number of reasons for that.  The Seanad has the unfortunate knack of being seen to hold up quite an amount of legislation.  Half a dozen important Bills are in the Seanad at the moment eagerly awaited by this House.  There is urgent need to reform the length of time in which a speaker can be on his feet.  I see no reason for anybody other than a Minister or principal Opposition spokesperson to speak for more than 30 minutes.  Other than that one is moving into the realms of repetition and <i>ad libbing</i> of a spoofing nature.  If somebody cannot say in 20 minutes what he or she is about then that person has a serious difficulty.  I would like the CPP to address these issues now while they have the opportunity when this motion goes before them.  I hope the motion will get due acknowledgment by all sides of the House.</P>
    <P>It is good that we have this opportunity of looking at ourselves and at the manner in which we engage in our day-to-day duties.  Cynicism is abroad as we must accept, but we can go a long way ourselves towards improving the public perception and if we can get across to the people we will be seen in a far better light than we are.  With the advent of TV cameras into the Dáil Chamber the public perception of politicians will be enhanced and will increase.  My colleague, Deputy John Bruton, has had some reforms carried through the Dáil in the early eighties and I hope these further reforms will be implemented.  I support the motion and I hope it gets similar support from all sides of the House.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the second line to delete &ldquo;within <Col N="1623" /> three months&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;within six months&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In welcoming this motion on behalf of the Government, I would like to say how pleased I am to have the opportunity, which this debate will afford, to hear the views of Members of all sides of the House on the introduction of televised broadcasting of Dáil proceedings.  This is a subject on which I am sure there will be wide-ranging and diverse opinion and as a member of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, I particularly look forward to hearing Deputies' views in advance of consideration of the matter by that committee.</P>
    <P>Following the recent decision by the House of Commons to proceed to televise its debates, we will shortly be the only member state of the European Community whose Parliament does not allow television cameras into its Chamber. While it is appropriate that we should look at this matter with some urgency, it is equally important that in advance of making any final decisions, we have a full and considered examination of all the issues involved so as to ensure that we adopt an approach that best suits our own particular needs.  It is with this in mind that the Government are moving an amendment, in my name, to change the time limit within which the Committee on Procedure and Privileges must report from three months to six months.</P>
    <P>I would now like to formally move this amendment.  In doing so, I would like to ask the Deputies to bear in mind that radio broadcasting of Parliament is a relatively recent development in this country: in fact, it was introduced only in November 1986.  While other parliaments have had many years experience of broadcasting their proceedings both on radio and television, it is still a somewhat new experience for our parliamentarians.  It is important, therefore, that we do not rush matters along too quickly and that the Committee on Procedure and Privileges <Col N="1624" /> have the opportunity to consider proposals in some depth before submitting them to the Dáil for approval.</P>
    <P>At this point, I would like to thank Deputy John Bruton for publishing his discussion document in advance of this debate.  That document recognises the implications which the proposals have not only for the rights and privileges of Members but for the proceedings of and conduct of business in the House itself. It is clearly evident from reading it that the issues involved are complex and that before televised broadcasting can be introduced, substantial revision of Standing Orders may be required.  This, I think, further strengthens the case that the Committee on Procedure and Privileges be given every opportunity to study the matter in a much more detailed manner.</P>
    <P>At this point, I would like to let the House have some of my own personal observations on the televising of the Dáil. Firstly, I have to say that I am not altogether sure that there is such a great demand, or indeed interest, on the part of the general public for the televised broadcasting of debates.  Naturally, this is a subject which arouses a great deal of interest in the House itself and in the media, but I can see no overwhelming evidence that it is perceived by the electorate as being a priority item.  I suspect RTE realise that even the very best debates might not attract the size of audiences which they themselves would like to attract.  I would, however, accept that a proportion of the population would like to see the televising of debates &mdash; particularly on important issues &mdash; and these people have the right to such a service.</P>
    <P>I am also somewhat concerned by the popular perception that the Dáil must radically adapt and adjust its procedures to suit the advent of television.  This seems strange to me.  After all, the institution of Parliament has been around considerably longer than the relatively new medium of television.  It seems strange, therefore, that we should have to change procedures which have served <Col N="1625" /> us well down the years in order to meet the demands of television.  I would be very concerned indeed by any development which would interfere with the dignity of the House and its proceedings.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that television is the most powerful medium of our time. However, it must be remembered that it was primarily conceived as a source of entertainment and while it has, over the years, made very many significant attempts to provide a public service &mdash; through educational, documentary and other such programmes &mdash; entertainment still remains its basic purpose.</P>
    <P>Television is, by its nature, a trivialising medium whose impact is based on the image rather than the substance of debate.  In an era when there is such intense competition among television companies to capture higher audiences &mdash; especially since the arrival of satellite television &mdash; it tends to look for sensational eyecatching events which will grab the immediate attention of its audience.  In such an atmosphere I fear that even the institution of Parliament would not be sacrosanct.  I recall two fairly recent incidents which bear this out.</P>
    <P>The first concerned the United States Senate Committee hearings on the Irangate affair.  I wonder how many members of the public remember the findings of that committee, or for that matter who its chairman was.  Yet, even people who have not the remotest interest in politics have heard of Colonel Oliver North. Having been called before the committee as a witness &mdash; albeit a central witness &mdash; through the power of television, he became an overnight celebrity.  It was the personalities who appeared before the committee and not the committee itself &mdash; or its work &mdash; which grabbed the public's attention.  The other example of television's tendency of search for the sensational concerns an event which happened much nearer home.  I am sure Deputies will remember that when President Hillery recently addressed the European Parliament, the lead story in <Col N="1626" /> the main evening news that night concerned the fact that he was heckled by a Northern MEP as he was trying to deliver his address.  The substance and content of the address itself was relegated to second place on this occasion, even by our own national station.</P>
    <P>It is this tendency by television to sensationalise events in Parliament which is one of the greatest concerns to me.  In a sense, you can understand the dilemma of the television companies, who themselves have their own demands to meet. Yet, I cannot help but feel that even if RTE were to devote a substantial amount of time to the broadcasting of our proceedings in a &ldquo;Today in the Dáil&rdquo; type programme, it would still be incidents such as the one to which I have just referred which would make the headlines on the 9 o'clock news.</P>
    <P>It could, or course, be argued that, in this particular instance, the MEP was to blame for the incident and that the television companies were not in any way responsible.  However, it was the very fact that cameras were in the Chamber and the MEP was of the knowledge that his outburst would attract immediate and extensive television coverage which prompted him to misbehave in the first instance.</P>
    <P>There is a general acceptance that &mdash; as in other parliaments &mdash; certain Members in this House might not be able to resist the temptation to misbehave spectacularly in the presence of television cameras, particularly when issues of high emotional content are being debated. While some Members might consider it beneficial to play to the gallery in the presence of television cameras, I sincerely hope and I am reasonably confident that the vast majority of Deputies will recognise that, as legislators, our primary responsibility is to the electorate and not to make good television.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton suggests in his document that the problem of misbehaviour might be overcome by making the penalties more severe &mdash; including for <Col N="1627" /> example the automatic loss of salary for more than the number of days for which the Deputy is barred from the service of the House.  While I realise that the Deputy was only quoting this as an example of what might be done, I nevertheless have some reservations as to whether this would, in fact, be an effective deterrent.  It is obviously a matter which the CPP will have to consider in some depth and in the light of Members' rights and privileges.</P>
    <P>Despite the reservations which I have just outlined, nevertheless I recognise that there are considerable benefits to be derived from television.  As Deputy Bruton pointed out in his discussion document, the televising of the Dáil is in line with the spirit of the Constitution which provides for public sittings of each House of the Oireachtas.  We already have radio broadcasting of our proceedings and I am sure that television will give those people who have been listening to the radio debates a more comprehensive picture of what is actually happening in the House.</P>
    <P>In his discussion document, Deputy Bruton also made a valid point about the disadvantage which we have at present in that the Taoiseach cannot be seen on television from the floor of the House stating the Irish viewpoint on matters of international controversy, while other Prime Ministers have this facility.  It would certainly present a more progressive image of this country if this could be done and I am sure would enhance our case in the eyes of an international audience.</P>
    <P>I also agree with Deputy Bruton that the televising of proceedings could be beneficial for archival and educational purposes.  However, I would not like to see educational films replacing the present system of school groups visiting the Oireachtas.  As Deputies are well aware, nearly every day a group from some school visits the Dáil where they <Col N="1628" /> can view at first hand not only the proceedings in the House itself but the workings of the Dáil as a whole.  They can see their local TD in his real working environment, in his office as well as in the Chamber and in his interaction with Ministers and other Deputies around the House.  This could not be achieved through the medium of television.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">

      <P>In larger countries, like the United States or Canada, I can understand the extensive use of television to bring Parliament to the people &mdash; particularly school children.  In countries of that size it is not always possible, or indeed practical, for individuals or school groups to visit Parliament.  However, this problem does not exist here where it is possible for practically anyone who wishes to visit Parliament to do so and view its proceedings at first hand.</P>
      <P>Of all the issues which will have to be addressed by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, I think that the question of privilege will perhaps be the most important.  This issue was the subject of much heated discussion in the recent House of Commons debate. Because the impact of television is immediate, there could be a much greater temptation on Members to abuse privilege, particularly in live broadcasts.  If this were to become a regular occurrence, I believe that sooner or later it could lead to pressure for the House to lose that privilege.  This would be a very major development indeed and could have very serious repercussions for our system of parliamentary democracy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another matter, which no doubt will be of great concern to some Deputies is the possible curtailment of speeches by tighter time limits, in order to improve television presentation.  I am not altogether certain that the proposal contained in Deputy Bruton's document <Col N="1629" /> would necessarily improve the quality of debate.  In fact, some of the best speeches I have heard in this House have exceeded the time limits which are proposed.  I realise, of course, that the Deputy only quoted these time limits as an example of what might be adopted.  However, I know Deputies already feel that they have insufficient time to raise matters which are of local conceren and the imposition of time limits would further retard their opportunities to raise these matters. The whole purpose of time limits is to assist in the orderly and efficient despatch of business.</P>
    <P>The existing practice of party Whips reaching agreement on time limits for certain debates has worked out quite successfully.  I believe it is important that flexibility in this particular area should be exercised by the agreement of the party Whips.  It would not only be a disservice to the Members of this House but to the country as a whole, if time limits were to be imposed simply to make the Dáil more presentable on television.  As Government Chief Whip, I would have no objection to the introduction of any measure which will improve the proceedings and conduct of business.  However, I would need to be assured that these measures are being introduced more for the purpose of improving the proceedings themselves and not merely to enhance television presentation.</P>
    <P>I was glad to see that in his document, Deputy Bruton devoted an entire section to the practicalities of television broadcasting, covering such items as the possible obtrusiveness of the cameras, their ability to pick out quickly the Deputy in possession, the lighting requirements and, naturally enough, the cost of such a service.  In addition to these, there are other practicalities which will need to be considered such as the amount of space RTE will require for their technical staff, studio facilities and such like.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gay Mitchell was quoted some time back as saying that he would like to see the establishment of an Oireachtas <Col N="1630" /> broadcasting station, which would be controlled from within the House.  This raises the question of whether RTE would be involved at all in the provision of this service and, no doubt, RTE who already provide radio broadcasts of both Dáil and Seanad proceedings, will have views on this.  Obviously, all these matters can be fully and carefully considered at CPP.</P>
    <P>A concern I know which is very real to many Deputies is that television might portray the Dáil in an unfair light, not because it is deserving of this, but because it may not be able to adapt to the needs of television.  There is also an awareness that some Deputies will perform very well on television while others who, although they may be splendid parliamentarians, may not come across quite so well.  These are very real and genuine concerns and I feel it is only proper that they be fully explored by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and that the views of all Members in the House be obtained before proposals are developed and brought before the Dáil.</P>
    <P>While all these questions are undoubtedly complex, I do not see them as presenting an insurmountable barrier to the introduction of television into the House. The Committee on Procedure and Privileges will, I am sure, consider the advantages and disadvantages and will balance them against each other in order to ensure that the best interests of all our Members are served.</P>
    <P>The second part of the motion, put down by Deputies Bruton and O'Brien, relates to proposals for a more general programme of reforms to Dáil procedures.  The proposal to limit the length of speeches, on which I have already given my views, is obviously a matter which will be fully discussed at CPP in the context of televising proceedings.</P>
    <P>With regard to the procedures for dealing with urgent matters, and the relevancy and admissibility of <Col N="1631" /> parliamentary questions, the Government are prepared to engage in discussions at CPP to see if ways of improving these procedures and making them more relevant can be found.</P>
    <P>At this point, I should mention that a package for reform of Dáil procedures was discussed at a recent meeting of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges. At that meeting, it was agreed that in future the Committee of Public Accounts should be constituted as a standing committee to which the appropriation accounts would automatically stand referred.  A motion to give effect to this is being prepared and it is hoped that it will come before the Dáil for approval before too long.  The Committee on Procedure and Privileges also has under active consideration proposals to change the procedures for the debating of Public Service Estimates.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would like to assure the House that the Government will participate fully in the consideration of all the matters at CPP; we will ensure that they are examined in depth and that the interests of all Members are taken into account.</P>
    <P>The change will be an historic one which will, undoubtedly, alter the public image of the Dáil.  It is vitally important that CPP consider all aspects of this.  They should study the proposal in a detailed and serious manner.  All Deputies will agree that we should aim to maintain the dignity of the House above all else.  I am sure that Deputies Bruton and O'Brien in putting forward this motion gave serious consideration to this aspect.  The work of the committee may take longer than we would wish and for that reason we must be flexible.  I accept that the committee should report back within six months but, if necessary, we should give them more time to consider this important matter. Their proposal should maintain the dignity of the House and portray the House in a way we would all wish to see.</P>

      <P>At the outset I should like to say that it is my intention to comply with the suggestion made by Deputy Bruton in his excellent report, that speeches by and large should be confined to 15 minutes.  In my view that is usually more than adequate for a Member to say what he or she has to say on this or any other matter.  I agree with his suggestion. The Progressive Democrats will be supporting this motion.  I should like to compliment Deputies Bruton and O'Brien on preparing this report and circulating it to Members.  They have set out clearly the arguments for and against televising the proceedings of the House.  To some extent discussing the televising of the proceedings is like putting the cart before the horse because in the context of televising our proceedings we must consider the procedures of the House.  In response to Deputy Flanagan, I must say that it is not so much what Deputy Molloy did today as the archaic procedures under which we operate that has brought the House into disrepute.  I will deal with that matter later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the televising of the Dáil will bring onstream procedural changes and so on, it will be a good thing but I would have preferred if we had brought about such changes now because they are long overdue.  If we were starting from scratch, having obtained our independence in the last couple of weeks, I do not think we would have adopted the parliamentary structure under which we operate.  We have taken on board, almost verbatim, the parliamentary structure that operates in the United Kingdom.  I do not think it is the ideal system for this country.  We are a smaller nation and our needs are different.  To some extent we are suffering from legislative congestion because we have too many representatives.  I do not think it is necessary for us to have two Houses but I will not deal with that tonight.  It did not do New Zealand, Sweden and Denmark any harm to get rid of their second Chamber. <Col N="1633" /> They recognised that the second Chamber was unnecessary, and it is unnecessary in Ireland.</P>

      <P>In that regard the former Taoiseach, Seán Lemass, once said that it was a place for people on the way up and people on the way out.  I do not know if I was on the way up or on the way out. It is the case that people move from that House to this House and <i>vice versa.</i> I do not believe we need two Chambers.  It causes unnecessary delays and complicates our parliamentary system.  It can cause great difficulties, particularly in the context of bringing in legislation. Because of the fact that the second Chamber is elected by politicians we get the same type of people in the Seanad as in this House, with the exception of those elected as independents.  The vocational interest which was supposed to be the reason for the second Chamber does not exist to the extent it should or to the extent desired by the framers of the Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We do not conduct our affairs in this House in the most effective or most efficent way.  Many of the real debates in the country on matters relating to health, education, social issues and even Northern Ireland take place outside this House.  This is to some extent because we are a little afraid of opening up debate.  To a large degree debates in this House centre on legislative proposals put forward by the Government of the day. Because the Government is composed of Members of this House elected by the House, the Government govern the affairs of the House and our parliamentary structure suffers as a result. Even if we wished, we could never have a five-day week parliament because of the enormous pressures it would put on <Col N="1634" /> the activities of Government.  It would not be possible as matters stand.</P>
    <P>Given the limitations imposed upon us by the Constitution, we can do much to improve our own affairs.  Improving our procedures cannot be done in isolation. We must update the whole system of local government.  The enormous pressures on Deputies result from their combined roles as legislators and local politicians. We must have a different system of local government with more power to people at local level and a more clearly defined separation of functions.  I am a member of a local authority and it is virtually impossible to combine the roles of Deputy, spokesperson, representative of a busy constituency and local authority member.</P>
    <P>We must review the facilities available to Members.  I thoroughly agree with everything Deputy Bruton has said on this topic.  The kind of research that Members need in order to prepare themselves adequately for debate and for drawing up amendments to Bills is not available to Opposition Deputies except on a voluntary basis by their friends and associates or other people who give freely of their time to help.  It is very difficult for Deputies who do not have a legal training to draft amendments.  There is something to be said for making the Law Reform Commission more available to this House.  We could work closely together to the betterment of legislation and hence to the betterment of the people.</P>

Sometimes bodies which are separate from the parliamentary institutions take on board whatever they believe should be looked at and do not have the same sense of priorities.  The ESRI could provide a valuable research unit in the economic and social area.  There can be no doubt <Col N="1635" /> that Opposition Deputies require additional research facilities if they are to do the work demanded of them now and in the future, particularly after 1992.</P>
      <P>The arguments on the difficulties of bringing television into this House have been well outlined.  Undoubtedly there would be practical difficulties but it would be wrong to allow the negative aspects to dominate the discussion.  If it is decided that it is a good idea, as I believe it is, to have the main House of Parliament accessible and as visible as possible to as many as possible, it will be good for the country, good for parliamentary democracy and good for this House.  If we decide to work towards this objective, I do not believe the practical difficulties need stand in our way.  Improvements in equipment have made it less cumbersome and it would not take up as much room as would have been the case some years ago.</P>
      <P>Reference has been made to empty seats and how one would control the showing of this on television.  Perhaps we should proceed by thinking in terms of how to fill the empty seats rather than protecting them.  Possibly that is a little too idealistic.</P>
      <P>It is wrong that Committee Stage debates take place on the floor of the House.  These discussions should be conducted as far as possible in a non-partisan way.  The technical difficulties involved in Committee Stage debates could be dealt with more appropriately by a small committee of ten or 20 Members.  It would be to the benefit of the House and of the legislation if we had more time to tease it out.  It might also eliminate some of the difficulties that can arise in legislation. At present the Bill initiated by Deputy Shatter is being dealt with by a special committee which is working well.  If we had more committees discussing the finer details of legislation it would lead to a better and more progressive legislative programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Speaking as a former party Whip, we <Col N="1636" /> seem to have a certain paranoia about the Whip system which we adopted from the British, although they have to some extent moved away from it.  There are philosophical differences between the parties in this House.  That is why people belong to one group rather than another. That is why Deputy Howlin belongs to the Labour Party and I am in a different kind of party.  Within parties people can have difficulties with the official party line, particularly in relation to moral questions.  It is a pity we still have such a rigid system.  If a Deputy does not vote with his party the consequence is that he or she is out of that party, with all the difficulties that brings.  We must develop a sense of maturity and accept that if a person has a conscientious difference of opinion on a moral question or on any other question, he or she should have the right to vote according to conscience and should not have to suffer the consequences of being outside the Party.</P>
    <P>Our Whip system is governed by the need of the Government to have a majority in the House and the consequences which follow when the Government are beaten.  There is a notion that if the Government are beaten there is something terribly wrong.  I do not agree. If legislation voted through by a majority of the Dáil, regardless of the wishes of the Government, were taken on board as the view of the Dáil that would be progress.  That is how most people would like to see business being conducted.  In that way we will get a healthier parliamentary system.  That we are forced to negotiate everything to make sure that the Government are not beaten puts pressures on a minority Government and is wrong.  It clogs up our system and leads to many difficulties.  We do not need to continue under that regime in this day rand age.</P>
    <P>With regard to Friday sittings, Deputy Bruton, when Leader of the House, referred to it as being a good idea to meet on Fridays to discuss Private Members' Bills but that votes should take place <Col N="1637" /> during, for example, the following week. That is a very good suggestion that we need to re-examine.  Many Deputies are coming forward with good ideas, wanting to bring forward Bills but because of the rigid system under which the House operates, if one brings forward a Bill nobody in that party can bring forward a Bill, or their Bill is never discussed.  I find it very infuriating that debates take place on radio programmes, through the newspapers and on television on major issues but we never have an opportunity to discuss such matters on the floor of this House.  It is a great pity and the country suffers as a result.  It was that kind of incident which led to the difficulties today for Deputy Molloy.  It is crazy that this morning on a radio programme two people could discuss rod licences and that this could have been discussed yesterday or every other day, up and down this country and yet the main House of Parliament cannot have a discussion or response to the situation that has developed.  If we continue to apply such rigid rules to ourselves, is it any wonder that people are cynical and tell us that we are not being responsive, are not copping on to the developing situation and are becoming irrelevant? It is we who are making ourselves irrelevant by allowing almost everybody else to discuss important matters and failing to discuss them ourselves.  I am getting very near the limit that I imposed on myself at the beginning of my contribution.</P>

      <P>I shall not exceed the 15 minutes to which I committed myself.  If we are to open up our proceedings to television we will have to take on board all the consequences of that.  It is not television that will make this House irrelevant, or make people cynical about Deputies, it is Deputies themselves.  We, as a group of all parties, must respond to the demands and pressures that will come <Col N="1638" /> from televising the procedures of the House, update our procedures, change our ways, have real and meaningful debates and more committees of the House to discuss issues such as health and education.  If the people have problems and see us failing to respond to those problems, not even discussing them, they will become cynical and will say that our parliamentary institutes are becoming irrelevant.  We will then give a weapon to those who want to destroy parliamentary democracy as we know it.</P>
      <P>The Progressive Democrats support this motion.  I look forward to the debate that it will open up with regard to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges. As the Minister of State has already said, that committee have engaged themselves in discussing many of these procedures. Most of the debate has been initiated by Deputy Bruton.  I congratulate him on his efforts, particularly to change Question Time.  Question Time may have changed but we still receive letters telling us that questions are disallowed because they are argumentative, or anticipated a debate, or whatever.  Many questions are still ruled out of order for what I would regard as farcical, ridiculous reasons.</P>
      <P>We have control over our own affairs here.  It is lucky that we do.  Members complain about not having the necessary facilities.  We have neither proper offices nor proper research facilities.  If one cannot get in the Library of this Parliament a copy of a report which is to be discussed in this House that is our fault. It is because of the way in which we run our affairs.  We should change that.  This discussion will lead to many procedural changes.  It will make us think about our own affairs and that is a good thing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>There were some interesting views on Government in the last contribution.  I share the view that it would be a tragedy if anybody in this House voted against the Government at this time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The sponsors of this proposal are <Col N="1639" /> aiming at making a major change which will affect the workings of the House. It is incumbent on the sponsors of that motion that they produce fresh and persuasive arguments in favour of change.  I have great sympathy with the motion and congratulate those who put the document together.  This is a worthwhile debate, as the Minister of State has said.  We will shortly be the only parliament of the member states of the EC that does not televise its proceedings.  The decision, effectively, is being made by history.</P>
    <P>Basically, six arguments have been adduced in the document in favour of change.  The first, and to my mind the most persuasive, argument produced is the concept that televising the Dáil is in line with the spirit of the Constitution. This is an argument which cannot be dismissed.  Article 15.8.1º of the Constitution provides that the operating and sitting of the Houses of the Oireachtas should be in public and what better way to make them available to all members of the public, or at least to those who are sufficiently masochistic to look in on our proceedings, than to have them televised?</P>
    <P>The second argument adduced is that television is the main means of conveying politicial information and that therefore the Dáil should have access to it.  The inverse of that argument is that television, as the main medium, should have access to the Dáil.  The print media have a long tradition of access to the proceedings of this House and its predecessors.  Radio in more recent times has gained access.  There was some novelty in the idea of radio coming into the Dáil not too many years ago but the sky did not fall, there was not a major upheaval in the homes of the land.  I suspect that the same would be the case, after the initial stir, if and when television becomes part of the operations of this House.</P>
    <P>I am not sure that I have a great deal of sympathy with the argument put forward <Col N="1640" /> that in some way television would enhance the procedures of the Dáil or its reputation in a democratic sense.  I very seldom find compelling the argument that we should do something because others have done it before.  The fourth argument put forward in the document is the view that videos and films would provide an interesting and important historical record.  One of the novel facts is that proceedings in this House at this time on this issue are not being recorded in the visual sense.  That is interesting because, if nothing else, it would illustrate the paucity of interest of some Deputies in this issue if the cameras were here.  I find it odd, when one is lecturing on parliamentary procedures and wants to illustrate some fact of parliamentary life that at present one must depend on videos and film clips from other institutions.  I accept that that is a valid argument in favour of change.</P>
    <P>The suggestion is also made that televising the Dáil would heighten public awareness of the debates here and that this would allow a more balanced assessment of the work of Deputies to be made by the general public.  I am one of those people who believe that a more balanced assessment of Deputies work urgently needs to be made by the general public.</P>
    <P>I wonder if allowing television in here will produce a more balanced view of what the Dáil Deputy is about.  We all spend the bulk of our time out of this Chamber involved in servicing our constituents' needs.  I do not disagree with that.  I take issue with the common view that we service the constituents' needs to an excessive extent.  However, I accept the argument that there is something wrong with the balance in the way we spend our time.  I do not accept the view that putting television in here would change that, or would change the imperative that means we spend much of our time on one pursuit and not enough on the legislative process.  That is a wider issue.  Certainly, televised debates of the Dáil would highlight those parts of the <Col N="1641" /> debates which could do with highlighting. I suspect that would be a danger in that there would be a temptation for those who would edit the debates to focus on specific high points.</P>
    <P>The authors of the document suggest that the introduction of television should improve the quality of debates.  If that were to be the case I would welcome it.  I accept the argument made in the document that there is need for shorter debates and that there is need for us to utilise the time of the House in a better way.  The thesis that the introduction of television would have this beneficial effect needs to be supported.  If this were to be the effect it would be a potent argument in favour of televising the Dáil.</P>
    <P>The authors of the document also set out to deal with the arguments against the case.  The most serious argument is that it would lead to a trivialisation of the Dáil.  One of the great things about the Dáil at the moment is that absent benches sometimes mean that those who could come in here and be involved in trivialisation are elsewhere doing something they consider to be more important so there is a degree of self-editing there. There would be a temptation to trivialise the proceedings of this House.  Some years ago I visited the Canadian Parliament and there was a discussion about the impact of television.  There was undoubtedly a degree of playing to the gallery and some individuals were hogging the camera.  Some procedure would need to be adopted to discourage that type of activity.</P>
    <P>Another argument against televising the Dáil is that the empty seats would be misunderstood or misrepresented.  The empty seats in this House, just as the empty seats in other parliamentary assemblies, are a fact of life.  It would be no harm if, from time to time, they were explained to the public and also the small proportion of time that can be spent by Members of this House on their parliamentary duties, on their legislative <Col N="1642" /> responsibilities.  If that enhanced understanding of the weight of business that presses on a Deputy, it would be a beneficial rather than a negative effect.</P>
    <P>It is also argued that it may restrict full freedom of expression.  That is an argument about which we need not worry.  There are very few shrinking violets here.  Not too many Deputies are easily perturbed by the media and far from it restricting full freedom of expression the existence of cameras would encourage Deputies to express themselves perhaps more freely and probably at greater length.</P>
    <P>The most serious potential disadvantage would be the temptation to abuse the privilege of the Dáil.  This can happen at the moment and when privilege is abused the abuse can be reported. In arguing that there could be an abuse of the Dáil we are simply arguing that there would be an additional media through which the Dáil privilege could be abused.  It is an issue that will need the attention of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges because from time to time there will be a temptation for people in the full glare of television cameras to name others who are not present and who cannot defend themsleves.</P>
    <P>The document circulated also deals with the concept of presenting the Dáil at its best.  It is an important thing for us to consider not just in the context of televising the Dáil.  In the general context of how the Dáil operates it is important for us to consider how we can enhance and improve the operations of the Dáil. In this regard I acknowledge the work of Deputy Bruton.  There is no doubt that speeches are unduly long and that we could limit the time available.  There is no doubt that we need the other improvements Deputy Harney mentioned.</P>
    <P>The argument that we need better research facilities for Members of the House is one that cannot be answered. The facilities for research here are minimal in the extreme and are a disgrace. Anyone who takes any legislative issues <Col N="1643" /> seriously must look for private briefing and for assistance outside.  That is not good enough.  One of the things that may happen from allowing television into this House is that it would put pressure on the powers that be to provide that basic requirement.  In that regard it is astonishing when one reads articles on the role of the TD that it is suggested that the provision of secretarial assistance to the TD is a waste of public funds.  In fact, the non-provision of research facilities is a criminal waste of the capacity of Members of this House.</P>
    <P>Deputy Harney mentioned more businesslike hours.  I would cetainly like to see more businesslike hours operated in this House.  The present arrangements are archaic and the lengthy recesses leave us open to the charge that we do not take the business of the House seriously.  The fact that we may be absent from television may help to highlight that and to force change.  More flexible work practices were mentioned as well as the stifling effect of the rules and procedures of this House.  They are archaic.  We inherited them from Britain at a time when they were designed for a Parliament that served an empire when the empire was already at an end and that Parliament was already in transition. Yet, we never made that transition.  We need more flexible arrangements.  We need to respond immediately, without being found out of order, to the issues and the pressures of the day.</P>
    <P>A point was made about more committees.  the work of the committees in the House is praised by people interested in parliamentary reform.  Every paper produced on parliamentary reform makes arguments for the committee system.  The argument is continuously trotted out that we could do our work in a more businesslike way if we had more committees.  The argument is made that there would be less controversy and that this would be less like a gladiatorial arena <Col N="1644" /> if we had more committees.  I am committed to the concept of expanding the committee system but I wonder if televising the House would assist in the activities of the committees?  One of the complaints that Members who serve on committees have is that their work gains minimal public acceptance and support. The committees are not well covered by the media at present.  Because of pressure on reporters' time the work of committees is not recognised although Members give many valuable hours to their work on committees.  Unless the committees were to be televised that problem would be exacerbated by introducing television into this Chamber.  This is a problem that will have to be addressed.</P>
    <P>The paper which has been produced and circulated is very welcome.  One of the welcome aspects is that it deals with the practicalities of television broadcasting of the Dáil, and as the potential intrusiveness of television personnel on the floor but we need not worry or concern ourselves unduly in that regard.  The argument has been made that lighting could be obtrusive but I think that problem could be overcome.  The points which have been made about the practicalities have been accepted.  Let me conclude by referring to something that was said by a Canadian parliamentarian.  He said that shedding the light of public scrutiny into the dark recesses of parliamentary life and public life is always welcome.  I welcome this proposal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter was brought to my attention through a report which appeared in tonight's edition of the <i>Evening Herald</i> which quoted the Minister for the Environment, apparently speaking on a programme entitled &ldquo;Muintir Mhaigh Eo&rdquo; in his native Castlebar, as saying that a major boost for Knock Airport would be provided shortly and that the Government are expected to allow direct trans-Atlantic charter flights to land at Knock Airport.  It is expected that these flights which are to begin in July will carry thousands of Catholic pilgrims directly into the Mayo airport, by-passing Shannon Airport in the process.</P>
      <P>I have no difficulty with pilgrims being flown directly into Knock Airport from the other side of the Atlantic but I am concerned at the serious effects this could have for Shannon Airport and I would like the Minister to clarify a number of points for me.  It has been part of the transport policy of successive Governments to ensure that Shannon Airport, which was established out of necessity originally, be seen in a favourable light. Since its establishment Shannon Airport has been the first stop for trans-Atlantic flights.  Whatever goodwill the Government may have towards Knock Airport and whatever about the future of that airport we all have to be conscious in whatever decisions we make of the consequences those decisions may have for Shannon Airport.  If the Government go ahead with this decision they will be creating a very dangerous precedent.  It is understandable that they would wish to assist an airport in the west and good luck to that airport but if the Government have decided to take this course of action I believe that they have not taken into account the effects it would have on Shannon Airport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1646" /> The reality is that Shannon Airport has and will continue to be the linchpin of development in the mid-west region and indeed far beyond, in fact, in a region stretching from County Galway, if not County Mayo, to south Kerry and west Cork.  The importance of Shannon Airport does not relate only to the Shannon free zone but also to tourism.  From the figures available it appears that 80 per cent of American tourists disembark at Shannon Airport and it is important that this would continue to be the case.  Down through the years we have established a different regime in regard to incoming flights, in other words, normally people would fly to a capital of a country and then having spent some days in the capital city would branch out to see the rest of the country but in our case tourists coming across the Atlantic disembark at Shannon Airport and spend some time touring the west and the south west before coming on to Dublin at a later stage.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be a retrograde step if the Government were to downgrade Shannon Airport.  We cannot make one decision in isolation because as I see it there is no possible way for the Government to promote Knock Airport by allowing trans-Atlantic flights to land at Knock Airport without spelling the death knell for Shannon Airport.  It will not suffice to say that this is exclusive to Knock Airport.  I am well aware of the pressure which was put on the Government in recent years by the major carriers who wanted to by-pass Shannon Airport. They made a strong case for flying direct into Dublin from the United States but this Government and previous Governments realised that they have obligations towards Shannon Airport and withstood the pressure which was brought to bear on them by the American carriers.  They have defended their right to stipulate <Col N="1647" /> Shannon Airport as the first port of call for trans-Atlantic flights.  I do not believe that the Government will be able to hold that card if they make any exceptions to that rule because once they open the doors and allow trans-Atlantic flights to land at Knock Airport it will only be a matter of time before the American carriers apply maximum pressure to be allowed fly direct into Dublin Airport.  I do not think that would be in the best interests of either Dublin or the west.</P>
      <P>This matter has consequences for jobs both in the Shannon industrial zone and in tourism.  There is an obligation on the Government to, first, spell out whether, as the Minister for the Environment seems to believe, a decision has been made.  It was somewhat surprising that the Minister for the Environment, rather than the Minister for Tourism and Transport, made the announcement.  I would like the Minister to tell us whether such a decision has been made and, if so, on what basis it was made.  Is the Minister going to tell us that allowing trans-Atlantic flights to land at Knock Airport will not have any adverse effects on the Shannon region?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Retaining the status of Shannon Airport is not going to cause any major inconvenience.  When this matter was discussed some years ago it was felt that Shannon Airport should not be downgraded.  That was the collective wisdom of the Government at that time.  I would like to know whether that view has changed or whether the Minister for Tourism and Transport has any reasons for changing that view.  If Cardinal O'Connor of New York, who is associated with this decision in some way as the link man for bringing in these pilgrims, wants to visit Knock Airport there is little inherent inconvenience.  If anything, I contend it would enhance the trip if trans-Atlantic planes were to land at Shannon on their way to Knock Airport.  I am convinced, and time will bear this out, that a break from the precedent &mdash; not <Col N="1648" /> only established but for which we fought many battles to preserve because of the enormous pressure being brought to bear on the Government, the national carrier, and the authorities in charge of transport here by companies endeavouring to get direct flights into Dublin &mdash; would be enormously damaging and detrimental. There is also what is described as a hint in the Minister's Muintir Mhuigheo statement that European flights will be given similar rights.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Deputy to the House.  There is an obligation on the Minister to spell that out as well.  I will pose the direct question: have the Government decided to allow direct flights from Europe into Knock Airport? I wish Knock Airport well but we cannot separate what we are proposing for one airport without examining the consequences, in this case adverse ones, for another.</P>
      <P>In one way I regret that all of the available funds have been invested in Knock Airport while developments should have been taking place at others, namely, at Farranfore, County Kerry, at Galway, Sligo, Castlebar and Waterford.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish Knock Shrine well, too, but the baseline on this is whether the Government have decided to allow these flights directly into Knock Airport. If that decision has been taken then I believe it should have been done by way of this House because it is of major importance to the transport policy of this country.  It is not good enough for the Minister for the Environment to speak on a radio programme, to take a decision changing fundamentally what has been long-held transport policy, the values of transport policy here, indeed a decision <Col N="1649" /> which will have far-reaching consequences particularly for the immediate area of Shannon where the jobs of thousands of people are dependent on the trans-Atlantic service into Shannon Airport.</P>
      <P>I should like to know what is the attitude of the Ministers for the Environment and for Tourism and Transport and that of the Taoiseach to those jobs in the Shannon region.  If the performance of Government and conduct of Government policy in relation to this region over the past 15 months are anything to go by one cannot be too optimistic.  Sadly, it would appear that the Government have taken a very conscious decision not alone to downgrade Limerick itself but obviously Shannon as well. It would appear that the Government are determined &mdash; because of some political problem they encounter in that area &mdash; not to give any uplift or boost to the Limerick or Shannon area.</P>

      <P>This matter of the overflying of Shannon Airport always has been of great concern to the management of Aer Rianta, the Shannon Free Airport Development Company and the people of Counties Clare and Limerick.  It is not so long since it represented the greatest campaign of all of the people of the west, stretching from Donegal to Kerry.  There has been much political mileage made of the status of Shannon from time to time and much mud-slinging.  However, I do recognise the important contribution of the Fianna Fáil Party to Shannon in maintaining a certain amount of investment in that area over a lengthy period, apparently contrary to the wishes of people in Dublin.  I acknowledge that contribution.</P>
      <P>Since this matter has arisen I regret very much that the Minister for the Environment announced, on illegal radio, a Government decision about the overflying of Shannon Airport.  Certainly it bodes ill for the Shannon region that announcements of that nature can be made in such a manner.  Within the past month I tabled a question for written reply to the Minister for Tourism and Transport asking what were his proposals about the overflying of Shannon Airport and he informed me that there were and would be no such proposals.  I took his solemn promise to mean just that, that present Government policy meant there would not be any overflying of Shannon Airport.</P>
      <P>I await an assurance from the Minister this evening that there will be no overflying on the part of trans-Atlantic aircraft of Shannon Airport in the future.  It would appear that the Minister for the Environment lost his reason when making that announcement.</P>

      <P>If the report contained in the <i>Irish Press</i> of this morning is untrue, I presume it would have been denied by the Government or the Minister for Tourism and Transport.  I have no option, for the purposes of this debate, but to assume that it is true.  If it is true I must say I am rather horrified at what is proposed, or what it has been suggested has been decided.  It is suggested that the flying into Knock Airport by transatlantic flights would be confined to charters. However, it should be remember that the difference now between chartered and scheduled flights is negligible because all affinity or other restrictions or regulations are gone.  One does not have to have pilgrims or people who fall within an affinity group, nowdays anybody can be put on a charter flight.  Really there is not very much difference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If this change has been made, then it has been made after 43 years of continuous policy by successive Governments.  Certainly there has been no justification advanced for effecting such a change.  It would be an amazing about-turn if this were to happen.  We have had a long series of assurances given in this House.  Deputy Carey mentioned one of those assurances.  I remember in particular the debate on the Aer Rianta order, on the Air Navigation Bill and Transport Bill in this House in December last, when I asked the Minister of State at the Department of Tourism and Transport, Deputy Lyons, for an assurance that there would be no change of practice <Col N="1652" /> in relation to the position of Shannon Airport.  He gave me that solemn assurance after due consideration, consultation and so on.  He told me there would be no change in the status of Shannon Airport as being the airport to accommodate North Atlantic flights arriving into and leaving this country.</P>
    <P>Aer Rianta have not been consulted about this matter.  The first they heard about it was when they read about it in this morning's papers.  As one might expect, they were horrified.  They see this as extremely damaging to the whole Shannon region and their endeavours there.  It will have very serious repercussions in terms of tourism, industry and employment generally.  The position of Shannon always has been extremely sensitive; we are all well aware of the fact. Successive Governments for 43 years have been well aware of that fact.  That is why they have always tread extremely warily.  If this is true, I would view it as an extremely serious matter with very serious repercussions.  I hope it is not true.  I hope the Minister for Tourism and Transport, who is present this evening, will deny the statement made and assure us that the existing position will continue.</P>

      <P>Tá áthas orm faill a bheith agam cás Aerphort Idirnáisiúnta Uí Óráin a phlé sa Teach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should, first, like to assure the House that the Government remain fully committed to their long-standing policy that Shannon remains Ireland's trans-Atlantic gateway.  The benefits which the airport and its surrounding customs free zone have brought to the mid-West region and to Ireland in the years since their inception have been incalculable and the Government have actively encouraged the development and expansion of activities there.  Most notably there has been a major expansion of SFADCo's role in that they have been given responsibility for the promotion and development &mdash; and I think Deputy O'Malley went part <Col N="1653" /> of this road when he was Minister &mdash; of all aspects of industry and tourism in the mid-West region, together with west and south-west Offaly.  On the tourism side, this opens up major new opportunities for Shannon to achieve a substantial increase in the number of tourists visiting the region.  Shannon Airport is, of course, the hub around which major economic and social developments have taken place in the mid-West region in the past 40 years and the Government remain committed to maintaining its status.  Indeed many other parts of the country view with longing the status of Shannon, SFADCo and the mid-West region.</P>
    <P>Policy on the Shannon stop issue has been reaffirmed by successive Governments in bilateral air service agreements which Ireland has concluded with other States over the last 40 years plus.  For scheduled services between Ireland and North America, Shannon is the only permitted gateway.  Flights to and from there must stop at Shannon on the westbound and eastbound journeys.  Access by North American scheduled carriers to points in Ireland beyond Shannon is severely restricted &mdash; only one US carrier is allowed to serve one point beyond Shannon, i.e. Dublin, with a compulsory stop at Shannon in both directions.  All carriers to and from North America &mdash; Aer Lingus, Northwest Orient, Pan Am and Delta &mdash; observe this obligation.  While no US carrier at present serves Dublin &mdash; as the House knows Northwest Orient ceased to do so this year &mdash; Delta Airlines will inaugurate, shortly, an extension of their present Atlanta-Shannon service on to Dublin.  I look forward to this service expanding the number of visitors to Ireland from the southern United States. In fact, statistics about the people they carry indicate we have a new non-ethnic source of visitor in the area that is served by Delta.</P>
    <P>In the case of charter traffic from the US or Canada to Ireland, one stop at Shannon must be made in either direction, and as the House knows that is <Col N="1654" /> the established practice.  In the case of charters where only one leg is routed through Ireland, the stop must still be made.  In this context, I should say that as part of the Government's strategy to develop inward air charter traffic, I announced late last year a relaxation of the rules governing charters from the USA and Canada.  The mingling of Irish and US-Canadian originating traffic on the same flight is now permitted, provided that no more than 30 per cent of capacity is allocated to Irish origin traffic. In addition, the advance purchase requirement has been reduced from 21 days to 14 days in the case of US traffic and eliminated altogether in the case of Canadian traffic.</P>
    <P>In regard to trans-Atlantic air services to and from Horan International Airport, interest has been expressed from a number of sources in operating charter flights from North America to the airport, in the context of pilgrimages to the Marian Shrine.  The Government have been anxious to extend the maximum possible support to such initiatives in the overall context of developing Horan International Airport and its surrounding region.  There is obviously a very special link between Connacht Airport and the Marian Shrine at Knock.  It was with this in mind that the Government decided that the circumstances warranted consideration of direct charter flights to Knock carrying pilgrimage traffic which would not otherwise come to Ireland. The Government regard the development and encouragement of this type of traffic as being highly desirable.</P>
    <P>The Minister for the Environment, Deputy Padraig Flynn, quite correctly stated that we would be allowing direct pilgrimage flights into the Mayo airport, Horan International.  As I have already outlined, in accordance with the charter rules, of course, the flight will return via Shannon.  Accordingly applications for such trans-Atlantic charters should be made to my Department where they will be considered on a case by case basis.  I <Col N="1655" /> should add that there are quite liberal rules in operation regarding charter applications to serve Horan International Airport from the Continent and Britain.  I think Deputy Spring did not brief himself fully on that because, of course, that obtained in 1987 also.  Indeed there is already a range of scheduled services from Birmingham, Luton and Manchester by Ryanair.  Next month the company also plan a new service from London-Gatwick.  Of course, there are also scheduled flights to, for example, Carrickfinn and needless to say these flights have not been landing at Shannon and going back up to Carrickfinn.</P>
    <P>I think I have clarified the issue quite clearly for the House.  I want to state that far from any damage to Shannon being contemplated by the Government, we are fully committed to its development in all the ways I have mentioned.</P>

      <P>Deputies will be aware that in March the US Senate passed a Bill proposed by Senators Ted Kennedy and Alan Simpson to reform US immigration law.  The Bill would introduce a new independent category for immigrant visas, 55,000 of which would be allocated annually on a points basis.  A similar measure has been introduced in the House of Representatives by Congressmen Brian Donnelly and Charles Schumer.  I am hopeful that if this approach is adopted our citizens will be in a position to obtain a significant proportion of the new visas in future years.</P>
      <P>In so far as the Deputy's suggestion is concerned I would not think it appropriate for the Government here to initiate or sponsor a letter writing campaign of the kind proposed, However, if Irish people or Irish-Americans wish to indicate their support for the proposal in this way I would welcome it.  I myself have given strong support to the need for legislative reform in public, and in private discussions with US legislators.  Our diplomatic missions in the US are following closely the progress of the measures and are taking all appropriate action in support of the reforms and I know from my recent contacts with them that Irish-American organisations and other groups working with our emigrants are lobbying actively for the Bills and I appreciate their efforts.  I can assure the Deputy and the House that the Government is committed to improving the situation of our young people in the United States and will take all appropriate action to achieve this end.</P>

    <P>Notes:</P>
    <P>1.  &mdash;While the figure given for the cost of the increase/decrease in the married allowance is based on an increase/decrease of £100, as proposed, it should be noted that any increase/decrease in the single allowance should be combined with double that increase/decrease in the allowance for married persons assessed to tax on the aggregate basis.</P>
    <P>2.  &mdash;In the costing of the proposed increase/decrease of the age allowance it is assumed that any increase/decrease in that allowance for single and widowed persons takes into account double that increase/decrease in the allowance for married persons assessed to tax on the aggregate basis.</P>
    <P>3.  &mdash;The average marginal rate used in column (3) is not the same in respect of each allowance.  It varies depending on the average marginal rate of the claimants involved.</P>

      <P>The Department has not issued any circular in this area in the detail mentioned by the Deputy.  The guidelines on the operation of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme suggest, however, that tables, chairs, curtains, floor-covering, beds, mattresses, sheets, blankets, pillows and household appliances such as cookers may be regarded as essential household items.</P>
      <P>Payments under this heading are discretionary and health boards decide each case on its merits having regard to all the relevant facts.</P>

The appeals officer upheld the disallowance of benefit to 19 November 1987.</P>

      <P>The person concerned was in receipt of disability benefit from 24 May 1977 up to 26 March 1988.  Payment was suspended following a report from an investigating officer of the Department that the person concerned had been <Col N="1502" /> observed working and did not appear to be complying with the rules of behaviour for a person on disability benefit.  One of these rules is that a claimant must not do any work unless it is work which he is allowed do under the Department's regulations.</P>
      <P>The claim to disability benefit of the person concerned was therefore suspended from 27 March 1988 on these grounds pending further investigations into his entitlement to this benefit.

      <P>However, the husband of the person concerned was on unemployment assistance for the duration of his wife's disability benefit claim which lasted to 16 January 1988.

However means up to £6 per week are disregarded in determining the amount of pension to be paid.</P>

The licence would issue when the company has become irrevocably committed to construct and launch the satellite network.  The original commitment to issue a licence expired at the end of 1987. Having considered the case made by the company I granted an extension of time to the end of 1988 to allow the company to continue its marketing efforts.  This project is a very high risk venture and no public sector financial exposure is involved.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Livestock headage payment schemes have been operated by the Department of Agriculture and Food for a number of years.  The forestry scheme recently <Col N="1508" /> approved by the EC provides for the payment of forestry compensatory allowances for a period of 15 years in substitution for livestock headage previously paid.  Forestry compensatory allowances are, therefore, only available to farmers who already qualify under the Department of Agriculture and Food livestock headage schemes.  Accordingly, the question of off-farm income is a matter for the Department of Agriculture and Food.</P>
    <P>The maximum payment possible under the 1987 headage schemes is £3,762 (a combination of the cattle and sheep headage limits) and this is currently under review.  However, compensatory allowances for forestry must substitute for livestock headage payments received in the year preceding afforestation.  Cattle and sheep headage payments will, therefore, be taken into account in calculating the maximum forestry allowances payable.</P>

Direct discussions have not taken place with the Nigerian Government or the NNPC.  The discussions which have taken place have been with Industrial Consultants International Ltd. (ICIL) which was appointed by NNPC to negotiate on its behalf and with Citicorp. <Col N="1510" /> Both of these companies have long experience of trading in Nigeria.</P>
    <P>It would clearly not be in the national interest to disclose the extent of the interest in these facilities by other parties and I do not propose to do so.  At the specific written request of the Nigerian oil Minister I agreed to put a temporary reserve on the facilities pending the completion of certain studies by NNPC but the period covered by this reserve has now expired.</P>
    <P>A definitive project proposal on behalf of NNPC was received by me on 2 May 1988 and it is my intention that a decision will be reached in the near future.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 90, 92 and 94 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Aquaculture projects are not permitted in lakes where there are major <Col N="1511" /> wild fisheries (i.e. trout and salmon) which I regard as a valuable natural resource to be fully developed in their own right.  No permits have been issued for full scale fish farming projects.</P>
    <P>Applications to my Department to establish projects in lakes are considered by the Department's engineers from the point of view of quantity of water available, rainfall and catchment area whilst the Fisheries Research Centre determines the extent of water quality monitoring which is necessary.</P>
    <P>I have recently undertaken a critical examination of the concept of smolt rearing in lakes generally.  The requirements for smolts of the aquaculture industry should &mdash; to the greatest extent possible &mdash;be met in the future from land based facilities using pumped or gravity fed water.  As I recently indicated to the House, there are eight applications with my Department at present for smolt rearing projects.  I intend to treat these as confidential for the time being as I do not consider that it would be appropriate at the moment to disclose commercial or other details of these applications; each application on hands will be examined personally by me in line with the policy I have outlined above.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Daly)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to advise the House that I have not authorised any projects to go ahead.  By way of background, I would <Col N="1512" /> point out that on 21 May 1986 the former Department of Tourism, Fisheries and Forestry gave outline approval to Emerald Fisheries Ltd. to carry out an experimental salmon smolt rearing project in the lake commencing with 100,000 smolts and subject to conditions that:</P>
      <P>(1)  prior to start up a hydrographic survey to include depth and volume profiles be carried out and that baseline chemical and biological data be provided to the Department to describe the existing trophic status of the lake.</P>
      <P>(2)  water quality and nutrient analyses be carried out on a monthly basis at a number of stations on the lake and outflowing river, such stations be agreed between Department officials and Emerald Fisheries Ltd.</P>
      <P>This Project did not proceed, however, as the local authority &mdash; An Bord Pleanála refused planning permission on scenic amenity grounds.</P>
      <P>The project has now been redrawn by the promoters &mdash; now trading as Marine Fisheries Ltd &mdash; in order to meet scenic amenity objections by use of much less obtrusive cages and has been resubmitted for approval to my Department and to Galway Council.  The County Council approved the project but that approval is now the subject of an appeal to An Bord Pleanála.  I intend to await the outcome of the planning procedure before considering the matter further.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Minister for the Marine (Mr. Daly) Brendan Daly">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Daly)</NameTxt>
      <P>On 5 December 1986 an order was made under section 54 of the Fisheries Act, <Col N="1513" /> 1980, designating part of Clew Bay as an area within which it shall be lawful to engage in aquaculture subject to licence. the area designated covers all that part of Clew Bay and adjoining waters which is bordered by the high water mark and which is enclosed by a line drawn from the most northerly point of the high water mark at Old Head, barony of Murrisk, to the most easterly point of the high water mark at Gubbaun Point in the townland of Dooghbeg, barony of Burrishoole, County Mayo.</P>
      <P>Before acquaculture licences are issued, my Department consults the local authority, IDA and Department of the Environment about our licensing proposals for a particular area.  Eleven licensing proposals have already been drawn up for Clew Bay and these are now being referred to the agencies mentioned above.</P>
      <P>These are: Mr. John Murray, Salmon farming; Island Sea Farms, Salmon farming; Blackshell Farm Ltd., Mussel farming; Mr. Shay Fennelly, Mussel farming; Mr. Hugh O'Donnell, Oyster farming; Mr. Padraig Gannon, Oyster and Clam cultivation; Mr. Ian Hicks, Oyster farming; Mr. Charles O'Malley, Mussel farming; Sea Queen Salmon Ltd., Salmon farming; Crusa Teo, Salmon farming; Rosmoney Shellfish Ltd., Mussel, Oyster and Clam cultivation.  In addition to these 11 there are at present seven further applications which are under consideration within my Department.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that proper co-ordination exists between my Department and the other agencies involved in aquaculture licensing and I have already informed the House about recent initiatives which I have taken in this area for example in replies to questions on 26 April 1988 and in the course of my contribution to the budget debate on 10 February 1988.</P>

      <P>Inquiries made from the health boards indicate that the average time taken to process applications for disabled person's maintenance allowance is approximately eight to ten weeks.  Payment, if approved, is retrospective to the date of application. If there is financial hardship involved in any individual case, health boards would normally pay supplementary welfare allowance to the applicant during the time taken to process the application.</P>

      <P>It is not possible to answer the Deputy's question fully as separate waiting lists for hip replacement surgery categorised by medical card holders or non-medical card holders, are not maintained in health board areas.  The waiting period for hip replacement surgery in most health boards is about two years.  This waiting period is not new and has been a feature of the health services in this country and elsewhere for some years.  Because of my concern about the waiting period my Department is carrying out a review, at my request, of waiting lists for orthopaedic surgery to establish among other <Col N="1536" /> things, the actual waiting period in each health board area.</P>

      <P>It is a matter for each national school board of management to arrange to have adequate insurance cover.  It is understood that on average insurance costs amount to some £8-£9 per pupil.  Approximately 95 per cent of national schools avail of a standard schools' policy on offer from one particular company.  There are no plans, at present, for setting up a joint insurance policy for schools within my Department.</P>
      <P>In so far as voluntary secondary schools are concerned, the position is that these schools are privately owned and managed and accordingly the question of insurance is a matter for the managerial authorities of the individual schools.</P>
      <P>In the case of vocational schools insurance is a matter for each vocational education committee.  The total cost to the 38 VECs in 1986 was of the order of £1.5 million.</P>

    <P>Having regard to the various management structures for the different categories of schools, the question of establishing a joint insurance policy would not be a practicable proposition.

    <P>With regard to community and comprehensive schools, the State provides a general indemnity to the authorities of these schools in lieu of their taking out insurance cover against liabilities which may arise.  Accordingly, the question of insurance cover in these schools does not arise.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>On 23 February 1988 the Minister of State for Youth Affairs launched two working groups in the youth sector, one on the public image of youth works in <Col N="1546" /> Ireland and the other on the development of a common basic training programme for youth leaders.  The working group on improving the public image of youth in Ireland was given the following mandate: to heighten and improve the image of youth work in the media and to initiate and monitor a series of activities to this end in co-operation with the Youth Affairs Section of the Department of Education.  The working group is made up of the public relations officers of voluntary youth organisations and is chaired by the General Secretary of the National Youth Federation.  One of the initiatives agreed on by the working group was the setting up of a youth services stand at the Spring Show and the launching of a series of radio advertisements to publicise the stand.   This was an independent initiative by the working group.  The Minister of State was then invited by the working group to participate in the initiative involving the production of a video, a magazine and the advertisements.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State featured in a total of 40 RTE radio advertisements, each of 15 seconds duration, during the recent RDS Spring Show at a total cost of £4,286.25.</P>
