    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="An Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>An Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Tairgim:</P>
      <P>Go gcomhaontóidh Dáil Éireann leis an Taoiseach d'ainmniú an Teachta Micheál Mac Gabhann, Aire Stáit ag an Roinn Fuinnimh, chun a cheaptha ag an Uachtarán mar Chomhalta den Rialtas.</P>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann approve the nomination by the Taoiseach of Deputy Michael Smith, Minister of State at the Department of Energy, for appointment by the President to be a Member of the Government.</P>
      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, before going on to deal with this motion, I wish to inform the Dáil that the Minister for Finance, Deputy Ray MacSharry, has tendered his resignation as a member of the Government, with effect from 10 a.m. today upon his forthcoming appointment as a member of the Commission of the European Communities.  The President, on my advice, has accepted Deputy MacSharry's resignation.</P>
      <P>I would expect that Members of this House would wish to join with me in wishing every success to Ray MacSharry in his new office, for which his past experience so well qualifies him.  It is my confident expectation that both Ireland and Europe will gain from the energy, dedication and ability of our new Commissioner.</P>
      <P>I should like also to pay tribute to Ireland's present member of the Commission, Mr. Peter Sutherland, S.C., for the outstanding contribution he has made over the past four years to the development of the Community and the enhancement of Ireland's reputation in Europe. On behalf of the Government, and on my own behalf, I wish him and his wife and family every success and happiness in the future.</P>
      <P>Consequent on Mr. MacSharry's resignation, I intend subject to the present motion being approved,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1785" /> (1)  to assign the Department of Finance to Deputy Albert Reynolds,</P>
    <P>(2)  to terminate the assignment of Deputy Reynolds to the Department of Industry and Commerce and to assign that Department to Deputy Ray Burke, and</P>
    <P>(3)  to terminate the assignment to Deputy Burke of the Department of Energy and to assign that Department to Deputy Michael Smith, Minister of State at the Department of Energy.</P>
    <P>Under these proposals, Deputy Burke will retain responsibility for the Department of Communications.  He will, therefore, continue to oversee the work of An Post and Bord Telecom and, more particularly, of the new Independent Radio and Television Commission in its initial and developmental stages.  He will also be in a position to co-ordinate the communications functions generally with industry and commerce, of which communications and its technologies are now so vital an element.</P>
    <P>During the next three years as the Single Market takes shape there will be certainly in this country a large concentration on the improvement and development of the economic and social infrastructure.</P>
    <P>I believe that it will be essential that we use the resources available to us either from domestic or European sources to the greatest possible economic advantage. Planning and co-ordination will, therefore, have to be of the highest order. Accordingly, I am allocating to the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Padraig Flynn, an overall responsibility for this area.</P>
    <P>He will be expected to take an overview of the overall situation, ensure the comprehensive nature of our approach and identify and eliminate any duplication of facilities or the omission of basic requirements in particular areas.  It will be Deputy Flynn's responsiblity to see that the changes take place, without administrative delays, as rapidly as is <Col N="1786" /> economically feasible and that developments in the different sectors are consistent with each other.</P>
    <P>The changes which I am making in the Government following the resignation of the Minister for Finance on his appointment as Ireland's EC Commissioner are of a limited nature.</P>
    <P>There are excellent reasons why this should be so.  The present Government since taking office have performed effectively and achieved results because they have acted as a united, co-ordinated administration.  We have achieved a great deal because there has been clarity of purpose on broadly agreed objectives in a prevailing supportive atmosphere.  It is my firm intention to continue in that spirit and to maintain a clear line of Government policy toward which all our efforts will be co-ordinated and directed.  We must also seek to sustain the greatest degree of understanding and support among the general public for that line of policy.  The problems facing the country in regard to the public finances and the level of unemployment continue to be of such magnitude and such central important that they must be confronted with persistence and a single-minded determination.</P>
    <P>The achievement of national recovery has been the overriding economic and political goal of this Government since taking office.  The crisis in the public finances, falling growth and rising unemployment demanded immediate action. A major step toward recovery was the preparation and adoption of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> which set out in detail the objectives for the public finances and the development of the economy for the period to the end of 1990.  The programme continues to provide the framework for the major degree of economic and social progress achieved to date.  This year the actual outturn in the public finances will be exceptionally favourable, mainly because of the tax amnesty.</P>
    <P>The overall improvement in the general economic and fiscal climate has been remarkable; lower interest rates, greatly reduced inflation and a major reduction <Col N="1787" /> in Government borrowing have brought an entirely new atmosphere to the market place.  In the different sectors of the economy there are indications of a new vitality, a willingness to look at new projects and new investment.  The general public are conscious of this overall improvement in the economic outlook; they can see the dramatic improvement coming through in our relations with the outside world, with reduced borrowing, and a major trading and balance of payments surplus.  We must not, however, allow these many favourable developments to obscure the deep difficulties in our basic position that still remain.  We still carry a national debt of £25 billion which costs about £2 billion of taxpayers' money every year to service.  To reduce that national debt relative to our national output and the burden it represents to our taxpayers every year, must be an essential priority.  Any responsible Irish Government must continue unremittingly to follow through with our financial objectives and to bring the level of debt into reasonable relationship with what we produce and can afford to pay. Achievement of this objective requires continued and unrelenting discipline on Government spending and borrowing. While we are moving in the right direction it cannot be too clearly emphasised that the effort and the discipline must be maintained without relaxation or deviation.</P>
    <P>I am glad to have this opportunity of assuring the House that this Fianna Fáil administration is right on course and up-to-date with their work for national recovery.  Right around the world there is increasingly favourable comment about the progress which the Irish economy is making &mdash; low inflation, low interest rates, increased investment.  It is appreciated that the Irish Government are making steady and consistent progress towards the economic goals which they have set themselves.</P>
    <P>Nineteen-eighty-eight will record many significant achievements in the different areas and provide a good base from which future progress can be made. <Col N="1788" /> We must continue within the stringent budgetary constraints imposed upon us to seek to identify the possibilities for progress and development.  Work is well advanced on the 1989 budget and this work must be co-ordinated and dovetailed with the opportunities which will be available under the Delors package for the completion of the Single European Market.  I believe that if this work is done properly we will have a unique opportunity to bring about a major and lasting improvement in the basic structure of the Irish economy.</P>
    <P>Next year's budget, therefore, will be of great significance and far-reaching importance.  It will have to be related directly to our internal economic and financial realities continuing the corrective process in the public finances while at the same time being geared in a way that will enable us to take full advantage of the new resources available from Europe.</P>
    <P>The provision for private investment in projects of public interest and the provision for intervention rates of up to 75 per cent make many desirable new projects feasible.  This will make it possible to increase the level of public investment without adversely affecting the public finances.  The mechanism for deploying these increased structural funds will be the development plan now being formulated in consultation with the social partners which will set out programmes and priorities at national level for EC assistance and the framework for the sub-national programmes.  The public and private sectors will be required to work in partnership to ensure that we obtain maximum advantage from the enlarged funds.</P>
    <P>The <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> negotiated with the social partners will continue to be the overriding framework of economic policy.  The European Plan drawn up under the Delors package will be a valuable enhancement of the development aspects of the programme in supplementing investment, training and rural development, which are designed to increase employment, and <Col N="1789" /> steadily improve the economic infrastructure over the medium term.  The Joint Declaration by President Delors and myself made it clear that the Government here and the Commission have now agreed to work together in a structured partnership to develop the inherent potential of the Irish economy.  For this purpose, we have established a framework of co-operation and consultation between the Government's EC Committee of Ministers and Secretaries over which I preside and a Task Force on the Commission side headed by President Delors.  The intention is that the President and I will meet regularly to set strategic objectives and review developments. The Development Plan to be submitted to the Commission supplementing the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> will give us the opportunity to create over the next four years a unique infrastructural transformation, which will also provide increased employment.  This will gear us to achieve fully the vigorous expansion of our trade in the greatly increased European market.  A vigorous nationwide campaign has been successful in spreading awareness of 1992.</P>
    <P>The Government's whole <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> is based on the principle of building a broad social consensus, to which the different sectors make a firm commitment.  We already have a consensus for at least another two years, which is working successfully.  Our programme is comprehensive and broadly based, covering not just the public finances, but containing a specific commitment to create employment, improve social equity and relieve personal taxation.  We thus have a firm framework for further sustained progress in economic and social development, which commands widespread confidence.</P>
    <P>Of fundamental significance is that employment is at last increasing again, by 6,000 between April 1987 and April 1988.  The private services sector is growing particularly strongly while manufacturing employment has stabilised.  In the manufacturing sector, we are on course to achieve 20,000 new jobs for the year, and there are many exciting new <Col N="1790" /> projects in the pipeline.  Informed commentators are also predicting that the construction industry is set for a strong revival.</P>
    <P>Our monitoring of the employment objectives of the <i>Programmes for National Recovery</i> shows significant new job creation in a variety of sectors.  Our specific development policies, supported by our broader economic management strategy, are yielding positive employment results.  The Central Review Committee of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> will be publishing in a few days a sectoral and geographical breakdown of these jobs and some indications of trends in 1989 and 1990.</P>
    <P>The economy is now growing strongly. Last year GNP increased by 5 per cent and the increase this year could be a further 2 per cent, despite severe reductions in Government spending. Independent economic commentators such as the ESRI are now forecasting that the Irish economy will grow by as much as 3 per cent in 1989.  This will be the third successive year in which growth has occurred in the Irish economy and gives grounds for conviction that the Irish economy is back on a sustained growth path after a long period of stagnation.</P>
    <P>The foundations for recovery have been successfully laid.  We are now moving into a phase, in which the emphasis will be on economic growth, and a partnership for growth, partnership with the European Community and with the social partners.</P>
    <P>There is a much better atmosphere abroad among the general public; a more positive feeling about the country and its prospects.  1987 and 1988 have been years, when our performance has been exceptional in many respects.  1989 offers further opportunities in many different sectors and with a major sustained effort we can go a long way in putting permanently behind us the difficulties that have made life so difficult and depressing for so many during the eighties.</P>
    <P>We have done as much more in a short space of time as could have been <Col N="1791" /> expected of any Government.  The benefits of clear policy objectives and a consistent determined approach to our problems is now clearly perceived.  The reorganisation of the Government I have announced today is to accommodate necessary changes while ensuring that the successful thrust of Government economic and financial policy continues uninterrupted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to begin by congratulating Deputy Michael Smith on his appointment to the Cabinet.  Whatever we may feel about the way in which members of any given Government discharge their responsibilities, the fact remains that appointment to be a member of the Government is a signal honour and also carries a big responsibility. Even from Opposition, one must wish anybody who is appointed to that position well and I hope that feeling is also shared in the constituency of Deputy Michael Smith.  I hope, Sir, that it is not an ominous portent that the Minister for Agriculture and Food is about as far away as he could possibly be from Deputy Smith at this stage.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach has announced some other changes and I would also like to congratulate the Minister for Industry and Commerce on his translation into Finance.  Again, that is a position which carries a particular responsibility and one which requires energy and application.  I wish the Minister well in his new position. I would have to remark without detracting in any way from my good wishes to Deputy Reynolds that the record of Ministers for Finance in Fianna Fáil Governments in the recent past has not been very impressive.  They have not tended to last very long.  In fact if we go back over a period of years I think I would be right in saying that I hold the record for being the longest serving Minister for Finance since 1977&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and I have the strong <Col N="1792" /> feeling that that record is not at all in danger at this stage.</P>
      <P>There is one curious development in the Government's rearrangement which the Taoiseach has announced which perhaps we can go into in more detail at a later stage and that is this very curious combination or juxtaposition of the Minister for Finance and functions to be carried out by the Minister for the Environment in relation to the co-ordination of our action on the Structural Funds.  It is not very clear to me why this is being done.  This side of the House has commented on the unsatisfactory nature of the arrangements but we have a situation where in fact regional planning and the preparation of integrated regional programmes for this country will be carried out by the Commission of the European Communities and the Department of Finance.  On top of that there are cosmetic structures for the apparent involvement of county managers and purely cosmetic structures for consultation with various people which will have no effect and now, suddenly introduced into that whole structure, the Minister for the Environment will carry out what seems to be a co-ordinating role. That makes me even more worried than I have been up to now about the lack of involvement, concern and input into the development of these programmes&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>If there is a time limit, Sir, I will not be tempted into a discourse in the House on Deputy Connolly's theory <Col N="1793" /> of Government as expressed in County Laois, although it is very interesting &mdash; scratch my back and I will scratch yours. I am very much afraid that this new structure which the Taoiseach has put in place is not going to improve in any way the main thrust of what we need to do in building integrated regional programmes which will have the commitment and involvement of the people both in the private and public sectors who have to make it happen; that is the essential part. The structures in place are not going to achieve that and this putting of the Minister for the Environment on the shoulders of the Minister for Finance is not going to help in any way.  I am bound to say that it is going to make life somewhat uncomfortable for the Minister for Finance, even more uncomfortable than it might be otherwise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason we have had all these changes is that the Taoiseach and the Government decided to appoint Deputy MacSharry to be a member of the European Commission.  As I said on the day that announcement was made, I wish Deputy MacSharry well and it is fair to say that there are many of us in this House who appreciate the nature of the challenge that faces a person taking up membership of the Commission.  It is indeed a very exciting prospect and I wish Deputy MacSharry well.  I have to say however that I believe the Government's decision in this matter was a thoroughly bad one, an unstatesmanlike decision, one that shows a lack of courage in doing what is required in the national interest. My view and the view of my party is shared by a great many people outside of this House and a great many people elsewhere.  There is absolutely no doubt that the President of the Commission wanted to keep as many of the key persons as possible of the present Commission in his new team.  Peter Sutherland is clearly one of those.  He has served the Community with great distinction during the past four years.  He has had a major influence in the running of competition policy.  Competition policy in the Commission has now <Col N="1794" /> become a very creative force for the development of key sectors of industry. I will list them: we look at steel; the motor industry; the aerospace industry; telecommunications and developments in computer and information technology. In all of those areas competition policy has been used by Peter Sutherland as a creative mechanism to assist and favour growth.  I have seen the same thing in banking and insurance.  In air transport he has broken up a cartel which many cynics believed could never be broken up.  That has been to the benefit of all member states, and particularly to peripheral member states like ourselves.  In social affairs he has pushed forward both the boundaries and the content of Community action in a way which had not been seen before in that portfolio.  In running the Commission's relationships with the European Parliament he has been widely acclaimed by members of that Parliament as being a very creative force in the development of the relationship between the Parliament, Commission and Council.</P>
    <P>He has played a major role in all those areas and it is a role which I am bound to say the Taoiseach did not see.  If one looks on the records of the House and reads what the Taoiseach said on the appointment of Peter Sutherland on 10 October last, one will find a carping, mean and narrow approach to that appointment.  The statements made by the Taoiseach that day are in very stark contrast to a letter which he wrote to Peter Sutherland, which I gather has since been circulated.</P>
    <P>I think I can do nothing better than to quote two paragraphs from that letter. The letter states:</P>
    <P>As I said to you when we met recently, the Government are fully conscious of the outstanding work you did as Commissioner in the term now ending.  You brought great credit to Ireland and there is widespread recognition of your achievements as Commissioner. The Government and I would like to congratulate you and thank you for those achievements.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1795" /> I am personally very grateful to you because of your willingness on so many occasions to give valuable advice to me and the Government about developments in the Community while maintaining your strict objectivity and independence as a member of the Commission.  For my part, I was always most anxious to consult with you and keep you informed about Government thinking on Community affairs and I appreciate your ready response on all such occasions.</P>
    <P>Those are very generous remarks on the part of the Taoiseach and they are extremely well deserved.  They could, indeed, have been foreshadowed or prefigured on 10 October 1984 and they were not.  Although I believe that the decision taken by the Government in relation to the next Commission is a thoroughly bad one I am not going to abuse Deputy MacSharry or call any of his motives into question, because that is not the issue; the issue simply is that the Government have not had the vision or the wit to make what was clearly the best decision in this case.  That is why we are here today discussing these various developments.</P>
    <P>I see nothing in the reorganised makeup of the Government to indicate that we are going to see any new approaches, any new thinking or any new creativity.  So far as I can see, the Government are going to continue to be utterly negative in their approach to any reform, as we have seen in this House during the past couple of days.  There must be many people on the Government benches who feel utterly ashamed of the approach the Minister for Justice has taken to very straightforwarded and long needed social reform.  I see no indication of any willingness on the Government's part to recognise that they are wrong to use public expenditure as if it were personal favours.  We have seen example after example of it from the Minister for the Environment to other members of the Cabinet in relation to national lottery funds and now from the Minister for Agriculture and Food.  There seems to be <Col N="1796" /> no readiness or openness on their part to recognise that that kind of activity brings the whole process of Government into disrepute.</P>
    <P>I do not see anything in the changes which have been made, including the appointment of the Minister for the Environment as a co-ordinator of the coordinators, to indicate that the Government are taking any real muscular approach to building and putting together integrated regional programmes to serve our people.  In the Taoiseach's speech I heard, for the first time in 18 months, the beginnings of a recognition in public of the value of increased participation rates from the European structual funds.  That should have been built into our planning from the very beginning but what have we seen?  At the beginning of this week we heard the Minister for Foreign Affairs say that he has managed to increase the participation rate in one area only of the structural funds and hopes that something can be achieved in relation to the Regional Fund and the Social Fund, when, in fact, what we needed was a commitment and an agreement in the Council of Ministers, not just at the beginning of this week but months ago, to have participation rates by the structural funds increased across the board for all structural developments in this country.</P>
    <P>There is no indication whatever in the changes which have been made that the Government are going to take any active approach to making political progress in Northern Ireland.  I do not see anything in Deputy Smith's record, in Deputy Reynold's record or in the record of the Minister for the Environment that would indicate that this shifting around of portfolios is going to bring any new thinking into the Government on that issue.  There is no doubt that the Government need new thinking on that and not the kind of statement we had recently, after the last meeting of the conference, from the Minister for Foreign Affairs who said there does not seem to be much prospect of movement in relation to devolution. The lesson he seems to have drawn from that is that he should stand passively and <Col N="1797" /> wait for somebody else to move rather than take the initiative himself.</P>
    <P>I see no evidence that the Government are going to have a different approach to the many areas of mismanagement of public policy by them in the health sector, the education sector and in communications where we have seen an apparent lack of understanding by the Government of the fact that if one applies simply straightforward concerns to managing public funds one can get better results, give a better service to people and allay the fears a great many people have that even though we are spending an awful lot of their money it does not seem to be providing the services.  That is something which must change.  I hope the Government will reflect on that over Christmas and that we will see a different approach from them in the new year.</P>
    <P>Today the Taoiseach again claimed credit for developments in the economy. I want to make it clear to him that that cuts absolutely no ice with me.  The Taoiseach is claiming credit for the results of what we did, and which he opposed, for four and a half years.  I have to say, as I have said during the past couple of weeks, that had the Taoiseach and his colleagues, during the period between 1982 and 1987, acted as if they even half believed the kind of things they are saying now the Irish economy would be much further forward on the path of progress.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to join in congratulating Deputy Smith on his appointment.  In addition, I would like to avail of the opportunity that we were not given last week to congratulate Deputy MacSharry on his appointment to the Commission of the European Communities. He is a man of some considerable ability and he will be well able to meet the challenges of the difficult job he now undertakes.  Like many others in this country.  I regret very much that the announcement of his appointment was delayed for so long.  Appointment to the Commission is one thing, but what is perhaps more important &mdash; and we have seen this from Commissioner Sutherland's time there &mdash; is the portfolio which a particular commissioner gets.  We have had contrasting experiences among our commissioners.  We have seen Commissioner Sutherland in a particularly important post which he has fulfilled to, I think, the satisfaction of everybody in the Community, not just in this country. We have seen other commissioners from this country hold posts that were of no significance and, unfortunately, as a result their influence, either personally or on behalf of this country, was extremely limited at the time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The late timing of Deputy MacSharry's appointment is underlined by the fact that some weeks ago a by-election was held in Scotland to fill the place in the British House of Commons which was vacated by one of the people appointed four to five months ago to the Commission in Brussels.  I am aware that the sharing out of portfolios in the Commission does not take place officially until <Col N="1799" /> 16 December next, but it is unrealistic to think that people have not made up their minds about many important matters well before that date.  I hope for his own sake and for that of the country that Deputy MacSharry is not at too great a disadvantage as a result of the abnormal lateness of his appointment.</P>
    <P>I have seen reference to the fact that it would be regarded as very satisfactory, I think both by himself and perhaps by many people here, if he were to get the portfolio of Agriculture with the Commission. Certainly, on the face of it, that would seem to be of great importance but it is a fact of life that agriculture is now beginning to play a diminishing role within the affairs of the Community and that one of a number of other areas of activity might, in fact, in the short and medium term be much more important. These are areas such as that held by Commissioner Sutherland, or the commissionership for the completion of the Internal Market, or the new commissionership for the co-ordination of the Structural Funds, which will obviously be of major significance in time to come. Nonetheless, wherever he ends up, I wish Deputy MacSharry well and I am sure that he will acquit himself well.  It would be remiss in wishing him well not to comment, as others have, on the tremendous success of the present incumbent.  Mr. Peter Sutherland.  His ability and the manner in which he carried out his duties has been a matter of pride to many of us here.  He has, as I have said, won the admiration of people throughout the entire Community.  It is a pity that circumstances are such that he has not been re-appointed.  If he had been, there is no question but that both the European Community and this country would have been well served.  However, circumstances are such that he has not been.</P>
    <P>In the speech that the Taoiseach made, most significant are the references to the Minister for the Environment and what he will be doing.  Frankly, it is very hard to analyse what lies behind it in the few minutes that have been at my disposal <Col N="1800" /> since the Taoiseach made his announcement. It seems very curious that functions that clearly have been seen always as part of the functions of the Department of Finance are now being removed.  It is made doubly curious by the very unsatisfactory nature of the regional arrangements within this country that were announced by the former Minister for Finance some months ago.  What is now happening seems to be at odds with what he announced and this whole matter needs a great deal more clarification.  I do not know where the Minister for Finance will stand <i>vis-à-vis</i> these functions.  They are important central functions.</P>
    <P>The opportunity should be taken also to spell out exactly where the regions will stand in their relationship to the Department of Finance and in their relationship to the Commission and to the institutions generally in Brussels.  It has been a legitimate cause for complaint that the dealings of regions in this country and of particular localities with Brussels, always have had to take place via the Department of Finance.  Is the same centralising function now simply going to be taken over by the Department of the Environment? Will the direct relationship which other regions in the Community enjoy with Brussels still be prevented so far as this country is concerned and the various regions within it?  These are matters that need to be clarified.</P>
    <P>I would have thought, Sir, that if the circumstances of Deputy MacSharry's appointment to the Commission required a reshuffle of the Government, the reshuffle might not have been kept to a minimum.  While I do not want to make any remarks that might be regarded as offensive to any individuals, I have to say that it is widely perceived throughout the country that the situation in the Army at the moment is particularly unsatisfactory. If it is, as unquestionably it is, that the very loyalty of the Army is beginning to be queried, unfortunately, because of the circumstance in which they find themselves, there can be only one area in which responsibility can be laid for that.  I would have thought that an <Col N="1801" /> opportunity might have been taken perhaps to correct that situation.  Our Defence Forces have served this country with extraordinary loyalty since the foundation of the State.  It is their wish that it would always be that way.  I would hate to see any form of change in that, or that they might be forced into having to do things that certainly it would not be their wish to do.</P>
    <P>In his speech the Taoiseach availed of the opportunity to deal in a relatively brief and fairly general way with the situation as he saw it in the country today. There were two things that struck me immediately about his speech, even though it is only eight pages or so in length.  That is, that there are two matters that must be all pervading, or seen as such, in this country today and neither of them was mentioned.  One is the fact that between 40,000 and 50,000 gross of our people are leaving this country every year, that that is continuing and the figures seem to increase.  That has enormous relevance to the whole economic situation of the country and enormous relevance to the financial and budgetary situation of the Government.  It is not referred to at all.</P>
    <P>The other matter which must be of all pervading importance, I would have thought, is Northern Ireland, which is not mentioned at all.  Just 12 hours ago from this moment, an elderly man and his little grand-daughter were murdered by the IRA in a village in Northern Ireland when they had just brought a neighbour home from a game of bingo or some other social activity of that kind.  Perhaps, this is not regarded as an enormous outrage. It is one of those things that we almost seem to accept will happen from time to time.  We do not get particularly concerned or agitated about it.  I think that every one of these things is a most appalling tragedy.  We have an incredible lack of activity and concern at the real level where it counts, for the Northern Ireland problem.  The Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister have not met on this topic for over three years other than for very brief ten or 15 minute meetings at the margins of European Council meetings. <Col N="1802" /> The whole political drive and thrust which was so evident in 1985 in regard to both Anglo-Irish relations and Northern Ireland seems to have largely disappeared. The goodwill, which I think is there on both sides, to make progress is not now being utilised.  The undoubted flexibility that has been seen within the Unionist community in Northern Ireland in recent months is not being availed of and the opportunities it gives rise to are not being taken.  As a result the Unionists seem to be driven back to the &ldquo;no surrender&rdquo; attitude which has been so redolent of them for so very long.</P>
    <P>This year there have been tremendous opportunities for progress, which unfortunately have not been availed of.  The very fruits of that lack of progress are the sort of thing that happened in the village of Benburb, County Tyrone last night. Unhappily, but inevitably this is apparently going to continue in one form or other in the months and years to come if this matter is not taken seriously and progress made.</P>
    <P>With regard to the economic situation, I think the most interesting commentary I have seen with regard to the preliminary Book of Estimates which was published in mid-October, appears in an article written by Mr. Joe Durkan, an economist with Coopers &amp; Lybrand in the current issue of <i>Finance</i> magazine.  He analyses the Estimates that were published and he comes to very different conclusions indeed from the conclusions that the former Minister for Finance sought in common with the Government generally to give to those Estimates when they were announced in October.  I cannot go through all the various comments and arguments he makes but it is enough to refer to the conclusion that he draws as a result of that examination:</P>
    <P>The conclusion must be that, when the dust has settled, gross current supply service expenditure in 1989 will be higher than in 1988, though the net figure could be about the same.</P>
    <P>Later in the article Mr. Durkan goes on to say:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1803" /> ... looking at the current expenditure side one cannot but feel that some momentum has been lost.  1987 was the year of the big cuts, the benefit of which was felt in 1988 as well.  The next stage in this programme, the examination and elimination of some programme, has not yet happened. The danger for government is that there could be a loss of momentum but this could be a loss of momemtum for the next on expenditure.  The target range for the EBR of 5-7 per cent of GNP is simply an intermediate target. An EBR of 5 per cent of GNP is still too big.</P>
    <P>I think Sir, that that article deserves study by all of us and in particular, it should be taken on board by the Government.  It should be taken on board by those who very glibly accept the figures that tend to be given in handouts that were published at the time of the publication of the Estimates in October.</P>
    <P>I do not have any further time at my disposal to develop this, but it will have to be clearly looked at in the context of the forthcoming budget in January. When the reality is analysed and accepted, we may well have to look at the January budget in a somewhat different light than we might otherwise have done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I intend to be brief.  First, let me take the opportunity of welcoming the Taoiseach to the House.  I am very glad to see him and wish him well.  From the punter's point of view, it has been difficult to follow his health, given the statements that have been coming from his Press Secretary.  However, perhaps his presence here this morning will be a relief to his Press Secretary, who has been having difficulties and has been confusing all and sundry at home and abroad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the opportunity of making some brief remarks on the Taoiseach's decisions today, but perhaps this could have been done last week.  The speed of the announcement of Deputy MacSharry's appointment last week was certainly in stark contrast to the delay in <Col N="1804" /> arriving at that decision.  I wish Deputy Smith well in his appointment.  I congratulate him.  This is a recognition of his political ability.  One would be inclined to suggest that in order to become a Minister in this Government you have to have a Minister in the constitutency already &mdash; now that we have four doubles, singles are hard to find.</P>
    <P>Deputy Smith is a political survivor. Perhaps there is a little irony in the fact that he becomes a Minister when a Deputy departs to become Commissioner, given that he lost his seat when a Commissioner returned.  But, in fairness to the man's stature he came back to the Seanad &mdash; I say this with total respect &mdash; and his standing as a fellow politician is higher than that of most other people in the House.  I know Deputy Michael Smith will be a very good Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy, you had your bit to say about Coalitions last week which was not exactly what your Leader was saying.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the appointment of Commissioner was made last week, I offered my congratulations to Deputy MacSharry, both on a personal basis and because I believe it is in our national interest that a person who has been chosen as Commissioner should go to Europe with the full support of this House.  There is a great deal at stake.  The next member of the Commission from Ireland will have a great deal of responsibility when he goes to Brussels.  While Deputy MacSharry will take an oath obliging him to put the interests of Europe first, we expect him to realise that the continued development of this country is entirely compatible with the interests of Europe.  To put this another <Col N="1805" /> way, 1992 will be a failure if its consequence is to marginalise a small economy on the periphery of Europe.  The European ideal will not be served by the establishment of richer and poorer nations within Europe.  For that reason Deputy MacSharry &mdash; as our next Commissioner &mdash; has a very heavy burden and he deserves the support of everyone in this House and in the country as he sets out to undertake this task.</P>
    <P>I do not take the view that the Government, or any government, are obliged to re-appoint the incumbent, no matter how good the job is perceived to have been done by the outgoing Commissioner.  In the final analysis it is a matter for Government and the Taoiseach of the day, and that has been done.  Complaints were registered over the past few months about the delay in making the appointment, I do not think that any service was done to the country or to Deputy MacSharry by the delay in making the announcement.  We will probably have to wait for the Taoiseach to write his book before he explains in detail the reasons for that delay.  There are certainly no explanations forthcoming now.</P>
    <P>I have difficulty in understanding why Deputy MacSharry wants to go to Europe.  We have a minority Government who depend in the main on the support of the main Opposition party to conduct their business in this House and, as I would perceive it, the departure of the Minister for Finance leaves that Government in certain state of disarray. I know that the Taoiseach did not want Deputy MacSharry to go to Europe.  That is common knowledge in political circles, but Deputy MacSharry for his own reasons wants to leave Irish politics and go to Europe.  Given the minority situation of the Government, it is a hard decision to understand.  Deputy MacSharry may explain his reasons in due course.</P>
    <P>Other consequential appointments are being made today.  I certainly wish Deputy Reynolds well in his new portfolio as Minister for Finance but I question the approach he will take to that Department.  Despite what the Taoiseach <Col N="1806" /> has been saying, the Government are facing difficult problems.  Deputy Reynolds as Minister for Industry and Commerce for almost two years presided over 250,000 unemployed.  As late as last Monday in Cork he made a lot of capital out of announcements about jobs being created, but it emerged the following day that the jobs being created were to replace jobs which had been suppressed by the same company about four months earlier.  Apparently 100 people had been laid off at the commencement of the winter and they are to be taken back next Easter.  The Minister was in Cork at a major Fianna Fáil luncheon and succeeded in obtaining great media coverage about new jobs being created.  Regrettably as Minister for Industry and Commerce his only contribution to the plight of the unemployed has been to tell them that confidence in the economy will sooner or later trickle down to them. They are still waiting and they have observed that as Minister for Industry and Commerce he has not offered a single new concrete proposal for the unemployed.</P>
    <P>Deputy Reynolds is now taking on a new portfolio and I should like to feel that he will take on the Department of Finance with his obvious energy.  I trust he will stamp his own personality on that Department.  Perhaps he will get the Department of Finance to take their claws out of every other Department of State.</P>
    <P>As with all announcements in public life, there is good news and bad news. The good news concerns Deputy Michael Smith and the bad news concerns Deputy Padraig Flynn.  Deputy Flynn is being given a role in co-ordinating the integrated programmes for Europe.  A few months ago he was flying high, the right hand man to the Taoiseach and confidante extraordinaire, but then there were a few stumbling blocks in what is a very tricky Department, as the Taoiseach reminded me in 1983.  The Minister for the Environment will not meet the general council of county councils, despite the fact that it is totally dominated by Fianna Fáil councillors.  He has got into <Col N="1807" /> certain difficulties in relation to a problem which has been highlighted over the last few years &mdash; smog.  We have heard lots of platitudes about this problem and he is now having meetings to try to solve it.  He has promised enormous reform in local government and delivered nothing, other than a fine article in a business magazine about plans for new taxation in local government.  These plans obviously went aground very quickly, even before the article got into the magazine.</P>
    <P>I suppose Deputy Flynn as Minister for the Environment will be remembered most for something he has not done and seems unlikely to do, despite his promise to the House to bring in legislation.  I wish that in the interests of integrity in politics he would make an announcement that there will not be legislation for a change in electoral boundaries.  Deputy Flynn's integrity in this House would be done some good, if not a great deal, if he were to say that the idea of the boundary changes was ill-conceived, that the terms of reference to the commission are going nowhere and that the change is not going to happen.  Since he could not be appointed to a more senior portfolio the Taoiseach has decided to give him a sop. I should like to be present when the Taoiseach has his next conversation with the Minister of State in charge of European integration.  Where does she fit into all this?  Deputy Flynn, who is running one of the larger Departments, in spite of its enormous cutbacks in the past few years, is to be given a role co-ordinating our plans for 1992.  Meetings on this topic are being held throughout the country. Seminars are being held involving county managers at a higher level and the chairmen of county councils at a lower level. There is no need for a Minister to co-ordinate plans for 1992.  The Department of Finance have made all the decisions to date and they will continue to make decisions, irrespective of the political wishes of local representatives or Members of this House.  That is the situation and if the Taoiseach is consenting to it he is doing a grave disservice to public life.  The sop to Minister Flynn <Col N="1808" /> does nothing to dissuade us about what is or is not happening in relation to 1992.</P>
    <P>The Government are facing enormous problems and will continue to do so.  The shifting around this morning will do little to assuage the fears of the public.  It is perhaps unfortunate that Deputy Smith's appointment has to be associated with some of these problems.  I wish Deputy Burke well in his new portfolio.  I do not find much that I can agree with regarding his decisions on off-shore oil and the dismantling of public service broadcasting, of which he is still in control.  I should like the Minister to outline at the earliest opportunity his plans for the development of Irish industry.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party will oppose the motion before the House.  We do so with absolutely no disrespect to Deputy Smith but we are opposed to what has happened in relation to this appointment.  It should have been made many months ago.  The Taoiseach is normally reputed to be a man capable of making decisions without delay or difficulty, but in this instance he has done himself no service.  He has delayed and prevaricated.  I am not personalising it by saying that the decision was delayed far beyond any personal reasons affecting the Taoiseach.  It is regrettable that we have had to wait almost until December to make our announcement concerning the appointment to the Commission.  We are opposing the motion because of our belief that what is needed by the Government is a change of policy.  No change of policy is indicated this morning but merely a reorganisation of the personalities running what I would consider to be bankrupt policies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>On a personal level I wish both Deputy Smith and Deputy MacSharry well in their new positions, but I cannot give either of them my political approval or support in this House or otherwise.  I cannot join in the chorus of praise which has been lavished on them by the media and by most Members of this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy MacSharry has been singled out for particular praise by the media and <Col N="1809" /> especially by the editorial writers.  He has been described as one of the best Ministers for Finance in the history of the State, and as the man who put the country back on its feet.  I fundamentally disagree with that statement.  Whatever about putting the country back on its feet, the policies pursued by him as Minister put about 52,000 people on the emigrants' boat since he took office.  Do we measure the effectiveness and efficiency of a Minister for Finance by the number of people he drives out of the country during his term of office?</P>
    <P>Since his appointment as Minister for Finance, Deputy MacSharry has enthusiastically played the role of the Taoiseach's financial hatchetman, who has cut and chopped in every area, singling out for particular attention those essential services on which the poor, the sick, the elderly and the handicapped are most dependent.  Deputy MacSharry has never at any time displayed any trace of concern for the appalling degree of suffering inflicted on working class families by his Government's monetarist policies.</P>
    <P>Deputy MacSharry has been a willing participant in one of the most despicable confidence tricks ever played on the Irish electorate.  Surely never before in the history of the State has there been a Government which, in such a short space of time, performed such a series of dizzying U-turns on almost every policy position they held while in opposition. The Fianna Fáil Party, including Deputy MacSharry, went before the people in February 1987 promising to reverse the policies of cutbacks which had been initiated by the previous Coalition Government.  The electorate was cruelly betrayed and as soon as Fianna Fáil got their hands on the reins of power the mask of concern came off and the cutbacks were increased to an unprecedented extent, with appalling results for the poorest and weakest sections of society.</P>
    <P>The whole thrust of economic policy of the Government, of which the Taoiseach and Deputy MacSharry were joint architects, has been that the poor must bear <Col N="1810" /> the cost of balancing the books.  Wholesale cutbacks have been introduced which have seriously damaged our health, education and social welfare systems, all areas of vital importance and interest to those surviving on low incomes, whether on social welfare or in low paid jobs.  The owners of capital have, as usual, been allowed to escape virtually scot-free.</P>
    <P>I wish to remind the House of the figures I read into the record some weeks ago when I pointed out that Smurfit's profits had soared by 156 per cent to £154 million; the profits of AIB rose by 23 per cent to £125 million; the profits of CRH went up by 27 per cent to £46 million; profits for the half year at GPA rose by 59 per cent to $72 million and will be over $100 million for the year; the profits for Clondalkin for the half year rose by 38 per cent and Power Corporation's profits rose by 100 per cent.  Most industrial companies' earnings per share will rise by almost 50 per cent this year with inflation at only 2 per cent.</P>
    <P>Will the Government agree to increase the income of the low paid and those on social welfare by the size of increases which private companies have earned as a result of the policies of the Government? I will give other examples of the effects of the cutbacks in education and health.  A five-year old boy is going deaf because he needs an operation and cannot get it in Temple Street because there is a two and a half year waiting list. That child does not have to go deaf but he will if he does not have an operation soon.  Despite all the talk about 1992 and the need to ensure that our children are prepared for the great big world of an integrated market, the Minister for Education refuses to provide adequate teaching of French in the girls' comprehensive school in Ballymun.  That area certainly needs attention in regard to education.</P>
    <P>I hope that whatever position Deputy MacSharry secures in the EC Commission, he will demonstrate a degree of care and consideration for the working class of the wider European community which he and his Government failed to demonstrate in relation to the Irish working class.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1811" /> I do not expect the appointment of Deputy Reynolds to the position of Minister for Finance to have any impact on the direction of Government financial and economic policy.  Cabinet reshuffles and especially the appointment of a new Minister for Finance can often produce bouts of nervousness on the stock exchange.  I cannot see the appointment of Deputy Reynolds provoking any panic among these speculators.  I have no doubt that they will be delighted at the appointment of a person they will view as &ldquo;one of their own,&rdquo; somebody who will look after the interests of big business as his first priority; somebody who will make sure that nothing is done to impede the taking of even greater profits; somebody who will keep the workers in their place. In all the exclusive clubs in Dublin the champagne bottles will, no doubt, be cracked open tonight as the so called entrepreneurs celebrate the appointment of Deputy Reynolds.</P>
    <P>Their enthusiasm is unlikely to be shared in Ballymun or Ballyfermot or in other areas where unemployment verges on 50 per cent.  I have followed Deputy Reynolds' political career with interest over the years.  I have never made any secret of what class interest I seek to promote and protect in this House, and in fairness to him, neither has Deputy Reynolds.  Together with the other Workers' Party Deputies I have sought to promote the interests of the working class.  Deputy Reynolds has always carried the flag for the interests of business and private profit.  I have never heard him say anything which suggested that he might have any degree of social conscience, or that he was concerned at the plight of working class families, struggling to make ends meet under appalling difficulties.  His appointment does not augur well for the class I represent.</P>
    <P>We have consistently opposed this Government from the time of their election in March of last year.  We will be voting against the new ministerial appointments.  The appointment of new Ministers is an important matter and <Col N="1812" /> should be viewed as a question of confidence in the Government.  We have no confidence in this Government and will, accordingly, vote against the motion. Those parties who fail to oppose the new appointments will be clearly indicating their approval of the overall thrust of Government policy and, no doubt, those in the electorate who vote for them will draw their own conclusions.  Deputy Dukes boasted three weeks ago that he would be Taoiseach within a year.  This vote gives him the opportunity to demonstrate whether he really has that ambition, or whether that statement was just another example of empty Ard-Fheis rhetoric.</P>
    <P>It is ironic that so much damage should have been done to the fabric of Irish society by what is after all a minority Government.  It is, however, a minority Government with a difference.  It has been correctly described as the minority Government with the largest majority in Europe.  None of what Fianna Fáil have done during the past 18 months would have been possible had it not been for the enthusiastic support of Fine Gael and the sulky, begrudging support of the Progressive Democrats.  It is significant that in the only electoral contest to have been held since Fianna Fáil were returned to power, the Leixlip Town Commission elections, both Fine Gael and the Progressive Democrats were decimated.  The patience of the electorate with the policy of senseless cutbacks is growing thin. Those who help this Government to devastate essential social services cannot expect to escape the wrath of the electorate at the polls in the next general election.</P>
    <P>Before I conclude I should like to make a brief reference to the appalling murder yesterday in Northern Ireland of an old man and his grand-daughter by the Provisional IRA.  No doubt there will be expressions of regret from those who perpetrated those murders but it should go clearly from this House that such expressions of regret are not acceptable. The only announcement we want to hear from these people is that they will not kill any more people in Northern Ireland.  It is <Col N="1813" /> particularly unfortunate that statements such as those made by a spokesman for the SDLP should refer to the failure of the Provisional IRA to avoid killing innocent people.  Implicit in that kind of statement is a recognition that the Provos in some way have a right to kill people whom they or others may regard as not being innocent.  I do not regard any of the people whom the Provisional IRA have killed as being culpable in any way whatsoever.</P>

There is a responsibility on this House and specifically on this Government that political movement take place in Northern Ireland.  One of the primary ways of bringing this about, which has been acknowledged by virtually everybody in Northern Ireland other than the Provisionals and by virtually everybody in the Opposition parties in this House, is by encouraging devolution.  Initiatives should be taken to ensure that a devolved Government is established in Northern Ireland.  It is incumbent on this Government to break or, to insist in so far as they can to break, the democratic logjam that exists in Northern Ireland.  I will conclude my contribution by appealing to the Taoiseach who is here today to drop this line that in some way Northern Ireland is a failed political entity.  That plays clearly into the hands of those who want to drag Northern Ireland and the rest of this country into a civil war.  He should assist in whatever way he can the establishment of a democratic devolved Government in Northern Ireland.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> First, I would like to express my personal good wishes to the Taoiseach.  We are glad to see him back in the House, obviously well on the way to recovery.  I congratulate Deputy Ray MacSharry on his appointment to the European Commission. Deputy MacSharry was an effective Minister for Finance who did his job in the national interest over the last two years. I certainly wish him well in his new appointment to Europe.</P>
      <P>However, the Taoiseach's decision was a bad one.  Sometimes the effects of decisions are magnified but seldom has a single Government decision succeeded in weakening two major institutions, as this one has done.  The Government have been weakened by the departure of Deputy MacSharry and the European Commission will be weakened by the departure of Commissioner Sutherland. It was an unfortunate decision and one which requires further explanation by the main participants.  Maybe we will get that explanation some time in the future.</P>
      <P>I congratulate Deputy Michael Smith, one of the more popular Deputies in this House who has always not only served his constituents well but performed in a most honourable way.  I hope he is very successful in Cabinet.  He certainly has all our good wishes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some of the arrangements made by the Taoiseach in the course of this announcement are quite curious.  Deputy Reynolds is being assigned to the Department of Finance but one of the major functions of the Department of Finance is being taken over in a <i>de facto</i> way, if not <i>de jure</i>, by Deputy Pádraig Flynn, Minister for the Environment.  It seems that for the first time since the foundation of the State a new division is now being created and Deputy Reynolds, rather than being appointed as Minister for Finance, is effectively being made Minister for the budget, the current budget rather than the capital budget or the area of economic, social and infrastructural planning <Col N="1815" /> which was the traditional role of Ministers for Finance in this country.  That is a serious error.  The Department of Finance are central to the economic development of the country.  It is less than a vote of confidence in Deputy Reynolds to be spancelled in this fashion. The allocation of many of the functions proper of the Department of Finance to Deputy Flynn seems to be a mistake.  It is certainly quite disturbing to people on this side of the House.</P>
    <P>This Government in recent months have behaved as many Fianna Fáil Governments have done in the past.  They seem to treat public funds as a matter for the disbursement of personal patronage. I am talking in particular about the lottery. There is no doubt that certain Ministers did not behave well in the allocation of lottery funds, particularly to their own constituencies.  The amount of money available under the Delors package will make the lottery fund look very small indeed.  I would be extremely concerned that Deputy Flynn's experience in the disbursement of lottery funds will be applied to the disbursement of European Commission funds under our integrated programmes.  That would not be for the good of the country or the economic well being of our people.</P>
    <P>There is a conventional wisdom, which is spurious, that almost any infrastructural project is good.  While the bridge is being built or the road is being laid employment is created but when the contractors move out those employed are laid off.  The real test of infrastructural projects is what long lasting contribution they make to the economic development of a region.  This is a function which is appropriate to the Department of Finance. To allocate it to another Minister in a fashion which is clearly attempting to put a bridge over every stream in County Mayo, to pick infrastructural projects on the basis of the marginality of political constituencies&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i>&mdash;&mdash;is <Col N="1816" /> not a way to ensure the kind of integration that is necessary.</P>
      <P>I am also concerned about another aspect of this decision.  The Taoiseach, in a recent statement from his home in Kinsealy and also in the text of today's statement, nominated the budget as the occasion on which the developments under the Delors package will be announced.  I understand that those who are asked to draw up programmes for the individual regions are instructed to have them ready by March.  It seems we will have a wish list on budget night of capital projects announced by the new Minister for Finance which will involve matching funds of 25 per cent on the one hand from the capital budget and on the other hand a whole list of nominated projects which the Minister for Finance will indicate are appropriate for private fund matching. Effectively we will have another long list of dream projects, whether they have any basis will remain to be seen.  I doubt the ability of the Administration, in the time available to them, to organise the infrastructural projects in an integrated way which will lead to economic development.</P>
      <P>I wish Deputy Reynolds well.  He is taking on a difficult task.  There is little enough in his record in the Department of Industry and Commerce to suggest that he will be particularly successful in the Department of Finance.  Deputy Reynolds seems to be very strong on public relations and propaganda and short enough on achievements within the Department.  Other Deputies have referred already to announcements on industry leading to the creation of jobs which we find do not exist when the announcements are examined closely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another area in Deputy Reynolds' PR exercise which I find most objectionable and that is the constant expression of the theory that economic development began in this country in 1986 and that all the improvements in the economic statistics have occurred only since this Government came to power.  I had a look at this document with which the Taoiseach would be familiar, <i>The <Col N="1817" /> Way Forward,</i> an economic plan for 1983 to 1987.  It was published in 1982 and was the basis for an election which did not turn out very well for the Taoiseach.  I quote from page 13:</P>
    <P>2.  The current budget deficit, if it were not corrected by increased taxation or by reduced expenditure, could rise to almost £3 billion or 13 per cent of GNP by 1987.  With a capital budget requiring Exchequer borrowing of 9 per cent of GNP, the total Exchequer borrowing requirement, by 1987, could become £5 billion or 22 per cent of GNP.</P>
    <P>That was on the basis of policies that were being pursued by the last Government over which the Taoiseach presided. Borrowing could have reached 22 per cent of GNP.  When we left office on the basis of the last budget introduced by Deputy John Bruton, borrowing was 10 per cent of GNP.</P>
    <P>In fairness, one should acknowledge, certainly while we are continuing to support the main thrust of Government economic policy, that corrective life did not begin in 1986, I tell Deputy Reynolds, but despite his best efforts to stop us right through that Administration, we achieved considerable success in many targets, including control of the public debt.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Deputy Reynolds and Deputy Brennan in his Department frequently remind us of the <Col N="1818" /> export boom but when I left the Department of Industry and Commerce our trade was well in surplus and the balance of payments deficit was down to 1 per cent.  The turn around in trade has been occurring since about 1983, certainly was strong in 1984 and very strong in 1985.  It is proceeding and I hope it continues. The stabilisation of employment in manufacturing industry has been occurring since 1985, and all independent sources will vouch for that.  Therefore, I hope that when Deputy Reynolds moves to the Department of Finance this morning he will have slightly more regard for the facts than he has had as Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>
      <P>I see no good reason why Deputy Burke should take with him the portfolio of Communications into the Department of Industry and Commerce.  The Department of Industry and Commerce are becoming a ragbag Department.  From one week to the next officials within the Department of Industry and Commerce do not know what their responsibilities will be, might be, or were.  There is only one good reason for Deputy Burke taking that portfolio in with him.  It is to keep political control over the allocation of licences for local radio.

It is a great honour and distinction and is undoubtedly the highlight of his political career to date.

He is a man of proven ability and I have no doubt that he will exercise his duties in an efficient and competent manner.

      <P>Let me congratulate Deputy MacSharry on his appointment as Commissioner.  I have served in the House since 1969.  We came in together on the same day and throughout that period I have known him to be a person of outstanding ability and exceptional integrity.  Despite the considerable difficulty which he faced with courage on one occasion, he has come through as a person of real competence and ability. His going from this House to the Commission is a great loss to public life in the Republic and in Dáil Éireann, but we are assured and I have no doubt that his contribution in the Commission will be equally exceptional.  I hope that in his period in the Commission he will endeavour in particular to change some of the attitudes of our neighbouring major trading partner which will be reflected in the Commission.  In the four years of his office, for example, he might succeed in convincing the UK Government and the UK representative that the UK joining the EMS would be of enormous joint benefit to this country and the UK and to the further development of the EC. That would be one of his tasks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Equally I hope he will succeed in maintaining the impetus to double the Regional and Social Funds over the agreed period.  Already there is very considerable slippage within Europe on that target and, although the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs has attempted to play down the huge effort now being made to diminish and dilute the commitment that was there, I think we can ask the Commissioner before he formally takes up appointment and assumes his collegial independence to have particular regard of the need to maintain the impetus to double the funds and ensure a continuing and growing allocation for social and economic infrastructure in this country.  I have no doubt <Col N="1821" /> whatever that such is the antipathy of the UK Prime Minister at the moment to this proposal of enlarging the Regional and Social Funds of the Community that there will be great difficulty in the next 12 months and in the years ahead in maintaining that impetus.  I hope that Deputy MacSharry with his wide experience in that area will serve the national interest well, despite his inevitable broader responsibility at Commission level.  He is a great loss and I can understand and appreciate the Taoiseach's great reluctance to have him go.  However, that is the way things worked out and we should leave it at that.</P>
    <P>I congratulate Deputy Michael Smith on his appointment to the Government. It is the universal view in Dáil Éireann that our parliamentary colleague has real ability and quiet, effective confidence, and I am glad that the Taoiseach has recognised that by bringing him to the Cabinet.  I have no doubt that he will make a distinctive contribution to the work of the Cabinet.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances of the change of the commissionership and the inevitable reshuffle, the Taoiseach may not have a more measured opportunity to reorganise the general work of Government. I would urge him to do so because, as a former Minister of State, I would say that there is nothing more frustrating than being a Minister of State.  Ministers of State tend to be surplus altar boys or women at Government level; their function is invariably diffused and ill-defined, with no responsibilities; frequently they do not even have access to their own Minister's papers, and it is right that on occasions they should not have.  They tend to finish up in a political vacuum which can produce enormous frustration. I can appreciate that those Ministers of State who thought they would have been promoted today will languish for the remainder of the lifetime of this Government in that vacuum.  Although I thoroughly enjoyed my period as Minister of State, short as it was, I can see a great need to reorganise the work of Ministers of State.  I hope that the Taoiseach will, over the Christmas recess, <Col N="1822" /> have an opportunity of addressing his mind to this.</P>
    <P>There is a particular need to reorganise Government itself, with 1992 creeping up on us.  There is a need to have one Minister in charge of this &mdash; not the Minister for the Environment, not necessarily the Minister for Finance, nor the Minister for Social Welfare who has a relationship with the Social Fund, or the Minister for Health who has a relationship with the Social Fund, or the Minister for Education who had a relationship with the Social Fund before the moneys were taken from her.  There is a great need to have one Minister responsible for the general developments towards 1992. Other countries are doing this; other capitals are doing this.  They are singling out one individual to do the general co-ordination work.  With profound respect to the Minister for the Environment, I do not think that his Department is in a position to give that contribution.  For example, what in the name of God do the Department of the Environment know about allocations into the health area from the Social Fund?  They know precisely nothing.  What do they know in terms of allocations of social welfare? They know precisely nothing.  It is equally so in regard to allocations which would go from the Social Fund into the education area or into the Department of Labour.  If the Department of Labour had been given the responsibility in terms of the Social Fund and other aspects it would have made a better contribution. The decision was made, but over the Christmas period the Taoiseach should, if the country is going to benefit from the doubling of the Social Fund and from the European Regional Fund, consider the possibility of appointing a Minister to deal exclusively with that area.  I would not hesitate to rationalise and reorganise Government Departments again in view of the growing responsibilities and problems we face going into 1992.  That is the suggestion I make to the Taoiseach.  It is something he might have an opportunity of developing.</P>
    <P>It is arguable that the Minister for the Environment should be given special <Col N="1823" /> responsibility there.  It is unlikely that we are going to spend a great deal of money on telecommunications or on the development of capital programmes in the education area or in the health area, but there is a dire need to spend money on road development, particularly in the west.  I would have no hesitation in giving the Minister for the Environment responsibility there.  But I would not give him responsibility for the Social Fund, for co-ordination and integration of the programme because that is a function of the Department of Finance and of the Government.</P>
    <P>I make those observations to the Taoiseach. It is not the function of the Taoiseach to appease competing interests of individual Ministers.  It is his job to direct, to allocate and to insist on his decision in relation to the structure of Government being carried out.  It is in that context that I question seriously the decision to allocate An Post and Telecom Éireann to Industry and Commerce.  There was an argument for that in the days of capital moneys for Telecom Éireann but they now effectively develop their own investment programmes and are doing quite a good job in that regard.  However, there are severe difficulties in An Post, particularly on the industrial relations side, and a degree of insensitivity that has manifested itself at senior level which I hope will be resolved.  I do not see it being resolved by allocating the Minister for Industry and Commerce that particular responsibility.  I would hope that over the Christmas period and into the new year the Taoiseach will have a further opportunity to develop in that framework.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister for Industry and Commerce well in his appointment.  I have no doubt that he will arise above the temptation to regard economic development and industrial development as commencing at Swords and ending at Balbriggan.  I am sure he will rise above that and make an exceptional contribution to economic and industrial development.</P>
    <P>I wish the new Minister for Finance well in his future role.  I have observed <Col N="1824" /> him in the House in recent years.  He has been a singularly underemployed individual. At long last he has been able to look at Fóir Teoranta.  I could never understand the logic of the Department of Finance being responsible for Fóir Teoranta.  The Minister for Finance has enough to do without worrying about the daily crises in Fóir Teoranta.  It should always have been the responsibility of Industry and Commerce.  Now the Minister for Finance might even do a good turn by sending it back to where it should be rather than having the Department of Finance driving itself into a weekly frenzy with factories closing down and endeavouring to find ways of allocating money to keep industries ticking over.  The multiple responsibilities of the Minister for Finance just do not give him the opportunity to deal with that area.  I wish the Minister for Finance well in his new responsibilities. He is still saddled with a national debt of £25 billion.  He will still have to find £2 billion in the next budget to service that debt.  That is our legacy to him. It is not an enviable legacy no matter how buoyed we are by the tax amnesty.</P>
    <P>We in the Labour Party will call a vote in this regard, not because of the personalities concerned, but because we do have and will continue to have severe policy differences about how to cope with that £25 billion national debt.  We will challenge this to a division because we have, and will continue to have, severe differences on how to cope with a national debt of £25 billion which will hang around the necks of this and future generations.  We will be putting forward differing views as to how our economy should be managed.  That is for another debate but it is important to state that there are serious differences between the Labour Party and the other parties in the House.</P>
    <P>I am delighted that the Taoiseach is back is a major way among us and is present to introduce this motion.  I can appreciate that he has had severe pressure on him before bringing it to the House but I urge him to have a real look at Government.  It is arguable that we should have a Minister for Revenue to <Col N="1825" /> handle the entire question of revenue. Members should note how wrong our figures were last year, about £800 million out on the components.  That is some going for any Government.  I accept that that could have happened in the time of the Coalition; we made mistakes in our time.</P>

It is too much for any Minister for Finance whether it is the Taoiseach, Deputy MacSharry, or Deputy Reynolds who is in charge of that Department.  It is too much to ask a Minister for Finance in control that show in an effective way.  The Taoiseach should re-organise the Government for the nineties. If he succeeds in doing so he will have made the greatest contribution of his term of office.  The Taoiseach has had several opportunities to have a go at such fundamental re-organisation and it is within his competence to undertake such an exercise.</P>

      <P>As time is limited I do not wish to repeat what has been said by other speakers.  I should like to associate myself with the words of congratulations to Deputy Michael Smith who has received well deserved promotion.  I wish him well in his new post.  I should like to congratulate Deputy Ray Burke on his clear promotion to the Department of Industry and Commerce and Communications, a very big Department, and Deputy Reynolds who has been promoted to the very important and central post at the Department of Finance. However, the re-arrangements announced by the Taoiseach are a major disappointment.  I thought he would have appointed a Minister for Employment today.  I felt the Taoiseach would seize the opportunity to restructure the Government's arrangements for dealing <Col N="1826" /> with unemployment which are, to say the least, very mish-mash.</P>
      <P>The Departments of Labour, Industry and Commerce and Social Welfare play a role in relation to employment.  We should have learned from what has happened in the UK, where a Department of Employment has been established and a Secretary of State for Employment appointed with responsibility for all things to do with employment from training courses to paying unemployment benefit. Since the introduction of that arrangement unemployment has fallen in 24 months out of 25.  The one month when unemployment did not fall was an exception.  I am disappointed that the Taoiseach did not restructure the Government in such a way that a Minister would be made responsible for leading the attack on unemployment.  We need seven major reforms if we are to do anything about the OECD description of Ireland as the country whose tax and social welfare regime is most biased against labour.  It is no surprise that Ireland has the highest rate of unemployment in the OECD.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to refer to something in which I take great pride, the performance of the State sector.  Any fair commentator will agree that a great deal was done to reform the State sector between 1982 and 1987.  The profitability performance of those companies during that period was excellent.  In 1982 those companies, with the exception of Aer Rianta which made a profit of £100,000 in that year, were losing money and last year most of them returned a profit.  Unfortunately, and the Taoiseach may not be aware of this, the Government have fallen back into their old habits in relation to the State sector. There has been a renewal of ministerial interference in the day-to-day affairs of State companies which was stopped between 1982 and 1987.  It was one of the reasons why the State sector got into trouble.  Up to then, boards were able to say that they were doing what the Minister told them.  I accept that the line between where the Minister's policy responsibility ends and where the day-to-day running of the company starts can be <Col N="1827" /> blurred, but improvements in the State sector are at risk unless there is a clear Government policy on how to deal with it.</P>
    <P>The Department of Communications are responsible for three major State companies, Telecom Éireann, An Post and RTE.  There are serious problems in Telecom Éireann and An Post, particularly in An Post, although from the point of view of profit they are doing rather well.  However, the targets set for them are not being achieved, particularly by An Post.  People in Dublin have to allow four to five days for a letter to be delivered. I accept that there is a chance that a letter will be delivered within one day but too many letters are taking from four to five days to be delivered.  This has been getting worse in the last year.  Telecom Éireann was supposed to be at the stage of what is called &ldquo;on demand&rdquo;.  That phrase was defined to me as Telecom Éireann being able to provide telephones within six weeks of application.  They have told the Minister that telephones are &ldquo;on demand&rdquo; but the description has been changed to six weeks from the time an applicant is invited to sign the contract. However, the application may have preceded the contract by many months. Business in Dublin is being hampered by the appalling lapses that persist in Telecom Éireann.</P>
    <P>I do not think we should be complacent about the performance of the State sector or satisfied that the improvements achieved will be maintained.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce and Communications should have a central role to play in the overall performance of the <Col N="1828" /> State sector.  That sector can play a vital part in the resuscitation of our economy. I am not part of that fashionable trend which say that we should privatise willy-nilly, although a sound business approach would not exclude the prudent disposal of assets when it is profitable and right to do so.  There is a need to have a Minister with overall responsibility for policy and approach in the State sector if it is to play the role if it can play in turning around our economy.</P>
    <P>My major criticism relates to the jobs front because this is where we as a society have failed most.  I do not believe, as some people in this House seem to believe &mdash; and they are not all on the one side of the House &mdash; that there is not much we can do about it.  There is a lot we can do about it.  We cannot go into it now because the debate is nearly over.  I would ask the Taoiseach to consider again &mdash; obviously he will not do it in this change of Government &mdash; whether there should be a Minister with overall responsibility for employment and to merge the sections of the different Departments that have various responsibilities into one Department for a true onslaught on this central problem which is cause of our emigration.  It is also a source and cause of the poverty which now tramples this land.</P>

      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to amend and consolidate the law on planning compensation. The Bill also amends certain provisions of the sanitary services code so as to regulate connection of premises to public sewers and water supplies in a manner more consistent with the modern planning process.  The Bill is a complex one, and I would like to assure the House that I will welcome all constructive suggestions on Committee Stage for its improvement.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I say that in all sincerity. Formalised physical planning legislation <Col N="1831" /> in Ireland dates back to the Town and Regional Planning Act, 1934.  The Long Title of that Act cited the need to make provision for the orderly and progressive development of cities, towns and other areas, and to preserve and improve amenities.  The half century which has elapsed since 1934 has seen some of the most rapid changes experienced in history. In national terms, it has encompassed the evolution of the modern Irish State, the growing urbanisation of our population and an enormous increase in the capacity of our building industry.</P>
      <P>For all that, the objectives of physical planning as expressed in the 1934 Act remain surprisingly valid and unchanged. The success of the physical planning system in Ireland has been, by and large, to confine major development to the areas for which it was planned and for which public infrastructure has been provided.</P>

      <P>It is thanks to planning control that we have not had to surrender major road reservations or duplicate sanitary services schemes.  This kind of orderliness in physical planning is now perhaps largely taken for granted in the western world, but it depends in all cases on the extensive operation of planning controls.  Abundant evidence of disorder arising from the lack of planning controls is to be found in many major urban areas of the Third World.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The major purpose of the Bill is to amend the law on planning compensation so as to give greater weight to the common interest in the determination of planning issues and greater protection to planning authorities in face of compensation claims.  Even prior to the 1937 <Col N="1832" /> Constitution, compensation was in principle allowed under the Town and Regional Planning Act, 1934, where the value of a property was reduced by a restriction, control, curtailment or limitation imposed by a planning scheme.  The Planning Act, 1963, continued this basic principle, subject, of course, to many exceptions, but related compensation to restrictions imposed by individual planning decisions rather than to provisions in planning schemes.</P>
      <P>Statistics on planning compensation claims have been systematically compiled only since 1982.  In the period to 1987 these indicate that nationally an average of some 25 claims were made each year, with payment being made on average in two cases per year.  There is a striking contrast between the aggregate amount of compensation claims over the past six years, which amounts to some £79 million, and actual payments of compensation by planning authorities, which amount only to some £90,000.</P>
      <P>This bare presentation of statistics might appear to suggest that planning compensation poses relatively minor problems for planning authorities.  The reality, however, is different.  A well publicised compensation award of some £2 million &mdash; still under legal appeal &mdash; was made against Dublin County Council in July 1988 and has focused the compensation issue very sharply.  There is also the widespread perception that the threat of incurring heavy compensation liabilities may be inhibiting the proper exercise of planning judgment in certain cases.  The Bill has been prepared against this background. Deputies will understand, however, that it cannot interfere retrospectively with compensation proceedings bona fide in progress under existing legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There seems little controversy about the basic objectives which we all now want to achieve in this area: we all want to encourage as much development as the environment can reasonably accommodate; we all want planning authorities to have reasonably strong powers to prevent undesirable development and the vast majority of us accept that there may <Col N="1833" /> be circumstances in which a landowner will need to be compensated by the planning authority because of the degree of restraint being placed on his property rights.  It seems that these three principles are common ground between most of the major political parties and the public.</P>
    <P>I will go further and suggest that there is now also a considerable consensus on the need to strengthen the community bias, if I may call it that, in the area of planning compensation.  In other words, there is seen to be scope for extending the range of non-compensatable circumstances and providing mechanisms for avoiding compensation in the form of alternative development consents.</P>
    <P>To address the Bill as it is drafted, I have already referred to the fact that it will consolidate all of the law on planning compensation into one text.  I regard this as a matter of some importance.  The format of the 1963 Act provisions on planning compensation was quite obscure, associated as it was with provisions about the detail of development plans and with issues of compulsory purchase of land.  There is no doubt that, at least partly due to these difficulties, a considerable number of compensation cases have arisen out of failure properly to understand and apply the law.  In that sense, the much clearer presentation of the law which this Bill achieves should benefit all concerned with administering it and working with it.</P>
    <P>The major new provisions of the Bill are as follows: under section 13 and the Third Schedule, paragraph 1, development may be refused without liability to compensation not just where water supplies or sewerage facilities are actually deficient, but also where their capacity is required for prospective other development; under section 13 and the Third Schedule, paragraph 3, development may also be refused without liability to compensation if it is premature by reference to any order of priority for development indicated in a development plan; under section 13 and the Third Schedule, paragraph 6, refusal of planning permission which would cause serious air pollution, water pollution or <Col N="1834" /> pollution connected with the disposal of waste, will be non-compensatable; under section 13 and the Third Schedule, paragraph 9, compensation will be excluded where planning permission is refused because development would materially contravene an objective of a development plan which was in operation at the time the developer acquired his interest in the land.  This provision will apply to land acquisitions, otherwise than by inheritance or family settlement, arising after the date of publication of this Bill, that is, 20 October 1988; under section 13 and the Fourth Schedule, paragraphs 15 and 16, conditions may be attached to a planning permission, without compensation, in relation to the preservation of buildings of artistic, architectural or historical interest, or of features of such interest which form part of the interior of structures; and under section 21, tree preservation orders may embody conditions, without compensation, requiring a proportion of woodlands to be preserved or the felling of trees to be phased.</P>
    <P>The Bill also contains an important procedural innovation in section 14, designed to replace the &ldquo;undertakings&rdquo; procedure of section 57 of the 1963 Act which has been found unsatisfactory by the courts.  This new procedure will allow a planning authority to rebut a compensation claim by a notice stating that in their opinion alternative development ought to attract planning permission. This notice can only be defeated if planning permission is subsequently refused or conditioned in a manner inconsistent with the permissive statement.</P>
    <P>Finally, the Bill will implement a number of provisions arising from the report of the Joint Committee on Building Land.  The rules determining the amount of compensation have been revised by section 12 of the First Schedule and will now stand independently of the compensation rules applying to compulsory purchase orders.</P>
    <P>The question of connection to public sewers and water supplies was also addressed by the joint committee. Sections 25 and 26 of the Bill deal with this issue.  Under section 25, connection <Col N="1835" /> to public sewers will no longer obtain as a right of the person connecting but will be subject to the consent of the sanitary authority concerned.  Under section 26, the right of a supply of water for domestic purposes will no longer obtain in the case of unauthorised development.</P>
    <P>The measures proposed by this Bill have already attracted considerable comment. Most of this has been directed at the provision whereby persons acquiring land after 20 October 1988 will have no claim for compensation if they are subsequently refused planning permission because development would materially contravene an objective of the development plan which related to the land at the time of its acquisition.</P>
    <P>As a matter of balance, I would like to point out that this is only one of a series of innovations made by the Bill, all of which I have just tried to summarise.  Such has been the preoccupation with this particular &ldquo;zoning&rdquo; issue that I have heard people publicly claim that the Bill as a whole will apply only to new interests in lands.  This is nonsense.  With the exception of the one prospective provision on zoning, the Bill's provisions will apply equally to all landowners and developers, regardless of when they bought the land.</P>
    <P>As I have said, the Bill provides that from 20 October, 1988, where a person acquires an interest in land and that land has a certain planning objective attached to it, that person will have no claim for compensation if he is refused permission to develop because it would contravene that planning objective.  In other words, the principle the Bill is applying is <i>caveat emptor</i>.  If a person knows in advance the zoning under which he is buying the piece of land, he must be satisfied to abide by that zoning.  But if non-development zoning is imposed after he acquires the land, this alone should not prevent him from seeking compensation in certain circumstances.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the arguments for refusing entitlement to compensation in all cases where development might conflict <Col N="1836" /> with zoning.  However, after careful consideration of all the implications, I cannot now recommend this course to the House.  The public interest would not be served by the conferring of excessive powers on public authorities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>This, I have to conclude, is what would be involved in making all zoning decisions non-compensatable.  If zoning by the planning authority were the beginning and end of all landowners' rights, some very unjust consequences would be possible.  For instance, it would be open to a major urban authority, without constraints, to zone for non-developmental purposes, for example, amenity or open space, a parcel of land which a person might have spent millions of pounds in bona fide assembling.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Zoning can change and it is not subject to any appeal process.  Does the House seriously want to entrust these kinds of powers, without check, to planning authorities?</P>
      <P>It would in my view be wrong to allow the possibility that important planning decisions of this kind could become totally divorced from the financial costs and benefits involved.  It is well accepted that physical planning should be carried out in full awareness of the costs which it may be imposing.  It is clear that writing a blank cheque for zoning decisions would offend this important principle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is worth remembering also that the very expression &ldquo;zoning&rdquo; is something of an inaccuracy in relation to the modern system of planning established by the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963.  The word &ldquo;zoning&rdquo; appears nowhere in the 1963 or subsequent Planning Acts.  Formal zoning was the hallmark of the earlier Planning Acts of 1934 and 1939, which envisaged the making of planning <Col N="1837" /> schemes which would have had full statutory force.</P>
    <P>As is well known, these formal zoning decisions proved inhibiting to planning authorities and there was very little uptake of the provisions of these earlier Planning Acts.  The single greatest change of policy effected by the 1963 Act was to replace rigid planning schemes with a more flexible system of development objectives.  This change has always been supported by professional planners and others closely involved in the system and it must follow that a reversion to formal zoning would be seen by those planning interests as retrograde.  Under the modern planning system, restrictions relevant to planning compensation are imposed at planning decision stage rather than in the context of formal zoning exercises. If we were to push back to development plan stage all decisions relevant to compensation, we must accept that greatly increased pressure would be placed on the development plan process. I am not satisfied that this would, in general, be a good thing for the planning system and I have therefore resisted it in the present Bill.</P>
    <P>Finally on this question, let me emphasise that ample grounds will remain for refusing or conditioning planning applications from existing landowners without liability to compensation.  In the first place, all landowners will be subject to the wider provisions of this Bill as regards non-compensatable circumstances. It will be possible from now on, as I have already explained, to refuse permission, without compensation, on the basis of future, and not just present, demands on water and sewerage services; also if development is premature by reference to an order of priority established by the planning authority, or if it would cause serious pollution.  Conditions may now be attached to planning permissions, without liability to compensation, requiring preservation of features of artistic, historical or architectural interest.  Secondly, refusal of a particular application for planning permission, on the basis, say, of agricultural zoning, will not necessarily give the landowner a clear run <Col N="1838" /> at compensation.  If any other planning permission is available for the land of a residential, commercial or industrial character, or even if the planning authority declare in principle that it should be possible to develop the land in one of these ways, compensation is excluded.</P>
    <P>So the only issue here is where the planning authority want to sterilise land altogether.  In general, there should be a presumption in favour of some acceptable kind of development.  But if a planning authority want to sterilise private land in the community interest, there may be occasions where it will be just and necessary to pay compensation for this.  On the other hand, if someone knows of the sterilisation of land before he buys it, that person should have no case for compensation against the planning authority.</P>
    <P>Given that a comprehensive explanatory and financial memorandum has been circulated, I propose to deal briefly and selectively with the detail of the Bill.  Part I makes a number of standard provisions regarding interpretation and commencement. Section 4 repeals all of Part VI of the Planning Act, 1963, which is being replaced by the provisions of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Part II of the Bill sets out common provisions, mainly procedural, for different kinds of compensation claims.  In general, claims for compensation must be made within six months of the relevant planning decision, and there is provision for regulations regarding the detail of claims.  Double compensation, that is under this Bill and any other enactments in respect of the same land, is prohibited, and section 11 provides subject to minor exceptions, for the full claw-back of compensation by a planning authority in any case where development is carried out on land on which compensation has been paid within the subsequent 14 years. Planning authorities are required by section 10 to enter a statement in the planning register of all cases where compensation exceeding £100 has been payable.</P>
    <P>The most substantive provision of Part <Col N="1839" /> II is section 6.  This continues the arrangement whereby, in default of agreement, the amount of planning compensation must be determined by arbitration under the Acquisition of Land (Assessment of Compensation) Act, 1919.  However, a new set of rules, contained in the First Schedule, will guide the assessment of compensation.  Many of the former rules are retained but, as I have already said, new rules have been added to clarify the market value principle and to discount any benefit to land from public subsidies.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill deals with planning compensation in the context of decisions under Part IV of the 1963 Act.  In layman's language, this means decisions on applications for permission to develop land or to retain structures, or what is normally referred to as planning permission. Revocation of planning permission is also comprehended.</P>
    <P>Section 12 continues the basic principle of planning compensation whereby a person is entitled to be paid compensation by a planning authority if the value of his interest in land is reduced by a refusal or a conditioning of planning permission.  This entitlement is, however, heavily qualified by sections 13 and 14.</P>
    <P>Section 13 is the key section of the Bill. Through the Second, Third and Fourth Schedules of the Bill respectively, section 13 lays down classes of development which, in themselves, will not attract compensation, reasons for the refusal of planning permission which exclude compensation, and conditions which may be imposed on planning permission, without compensation.  All non-compensatable circumstances from the 1963 Act are preserved. Further important non-compensatable circumstances are added, and these I have already described in some detail.</P>
    <P>Section 14 is intended to replace the so-called &ldquo;undertakings&rdquo; provisions of section 57 of the 1963 Act, which have been found unsatisfactory by the courts, with a different procedure.  Up to now, a planning authority could avoid liability for compensation by undertaking to grant permission for certain other development <Col N="1840" /> on the relevant land.  A difficulty about this procedure was that it involved a quasi-contractual commitment by the executive of the planning authority to grant a particular planning permission. This was difficult to reconcile with the position of third parties, of An Bord Pleanála and of the elected members of the planning authority &mdash; in the case of a material contravention of the development plan &mdash; within the planning process.</P>
    <P>The new procedure provided by section 14 makes it possible for a planning authority to avoid liability for compensation by serving a notice on the claimant stating that, in their opinion, the land in question is capable of other development for which planning permission ought to be granted.  This will be more of a statement of principle than a contractual undertaking, and any planning application within the ambit of the notice will be dealt with through the normal procedures.  As long as a notice under section 14 remains in force, planning compensation will not be payable. In practice, the only circumstance which would annul a notice would be the refusal or conditioning of planning permission in a manner inconsistent with the notice.  If this happens, the original compensation claim will be revived.  Otherwise the notice will stand and compensation will be precluded.</P>
    <P>Section 15 gives an exceptional power to the Minister for the Environment, in limited circumstances, to order the payment of compensation where this would otherwise be excluded by the strict application of the compensation provisions of sections 13 and 14.  This power of waiver, which parallels section 58 of the 1963 Act, is desirable so that the constitutionality of the Bill will not necessarily be threatened by hard cases arising in the operation of its normal provisions.</P>
    <P>Part IV of the Bill deals with compensation in relation to a range of possible decisions by planning authorities which in practice arise much less frequently than decisions on planning permissions. The matters involved include discontinuance of an authorised use of <Col N="1841" /> land, removal or alteration of a hedge, compulsory creation of a right of way, and damage arising from cabling or pipeline work.  The Bill merely re-enacts existing law on all of these matters.</P>
    <P>However, section 21 considerably extends the provisions of section 45 (2) of the 1963 Act so as to give greater protection from compensation to planning authorities in the context of tree preservation orders.  The difficulties of the Coolattin case and others have underlined the weakness of existing legislative provisions for the protection of woodlands. While I do not believe that planning legislation is competent to handle all of the issues involved &mdash; its perspective is necessarily that of amenity rather than of specialised botany or silviculture, I think that improved planning provisions can make a contribution to this general issue.</P>
    <P>Section 21 contains two new provisions: first, that felling consents from now on, without compensation, attach conditions requiring the preservation of up to 20 per cent of trees in woodlands, where considerations of special amenity value or interest obtain; and, secondly, in the same circumstances, that felling consents may, without compensation, require the felling of trees in woodlands to be phased over a period of up to 20 years.  These new provisions should allow planning authorities to mitigate the most harmful visual and amenity effects of the clear felling of woodlands while also allowing the owner to reap reasonable reward from his crop.  They should make it possible both to conserve and restore woodlands without the serious loss of amenity which was an issue in the Coolattin case.</P>
    <P>Part V of the Bill is designed to modify certain long-standing rights of connection of premises to public sewers and water supplies which are established in sanitary services legislation so as to make these more consistent with the overall control of development by planning authorities envisaged by the planning system.</P>
    <P>Under section 23 of the Public Health Act, 1878, owners and occupiers of land are entitled to connect their drains to <Col N="1842" /> existing sewers within the district of a sanitary authority subject to complying with any regulation which the authority have made concerning the mode of connection, but regardless of the capacity of the sewer to cope with additional connections. Section 24 of the 1878 Act enables owners and occupiers of premises outside the sanitary district to connect drains or sewers to the sewerage system of the sanitary authority &mdash; on terms to be agreed by the parties or settled by arbitration.  Accordingly, it is not at present possible for a sanitary authority to refuse a connection to a premises after it has been built inside or outside the sanitary district, regardless of the position under planning law.</P>
    <P>A similar right of connection to water supplies exists under section 53 of the Waterworks Clauses Act, 1847.  These rights, as they stand, could undermine the other provisions of this Bill allowing planning authorities, without compensation, to refuse development on grounds of deficiency in water or sewerage services.  Accordingly, section 25 provides that, in future, premises shall require the consent of the sanitary authority, through planning permission or a special form of approval, for connection to a public sewer.  Section 26 provides that the right to a supply of water for domestic purposes shall only extend to dwelling houses which are authorised under planning law.  Section 24 of the Public Health Act, 1878, is being repealed under section 4.  This particular right is inappropriate from a planning control viewpoint and, in future, if connections to a sewer are required from outside the sanitary district they should be arranged by agreement.</P>
    <P>The Bill is a coherent and comprehensive response to the problems of planning compensation.  It should ease certain undesirable constraints on planning authorities while maintaining an equitable balance between control and development interests.  I emphasise again that I will give full consideration to all reasonable proposals to improve the Bill on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill.  I am glad that finally we have a measure before the House which can deal with some of the many problems in the planning area.  It would be churlish not to recognise that there are some good things about the Bill which introduces some long overdue reforms.  However, it must also be said that there are a number of major flaws in the Bill.  Whereas the legislation will clearly resolve some problems in the planning process, it is a matter of some considerable regret that some of the major difficulties we currently have are not addressed by the Bill.  Other difficulties, particularly in the area of compensation payments arising from zoning decisions are dealt with in a way that can &mdash; at its most charitable &mdash; be described as flawed.</P>
      <P>As we all know in the context of development plans the present position is that local authorities are often forced, under the fear of major compensation claims, to grant planning permissions that contravene development plans.  Existing compensation provisions put into our Planning Acts which were designed to provide protection for the individual have been used and abused by unscrupulous speculators who seek to get planning permissions which are unjustified, or to force local authorities to pay out large sums by way of compensation for which there can be no justification.  The Planning Acts have been abused by a small group of speculators for their own unjustified gains.  That type of approach has on occasions brought our whole planning process into disrepute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister says this Bill is designed to tackle some of these problems and I intend in the course of my speech to address in some detail the difficulties which the Bill does not confront.  I welcome the Minister's statement that he is listening and willing to take on board proposals for changing and improving the Bill.  I would hope the Minister's concept of how one goes about changing and improving a measure is not based on a <Col N="1844" /> similar thought process to that of the Minister for Justice, whose belief in changing and improving measures has been exercising the attention of the House on a different Bill and whose primary contribution has been to create more problems than he would resolve.  I welcome the openness of this Minister's approach and take it at face value.  I hope he will see the points I am now making as designed to make a constructive input to this Bill in order to ensure that we get the best possible measure to tackle the problems which need to be resolved.</P>
    <P>Some of the changes in the Bill are welcome.  A Bill which brings together all aspects of our planning law relevant to the making of compensation claims in the planning process is overdue.  The disparate and confusing provisions contained in legislation which started in 1963, with certain amendments over the years, have only helped to confuse the actual position.  I welcome the fact that we at least have a Bill which seems to draw the varied and on occasions somewhat contradictory strands of planning law under the one roof.</P>
    <P>The Bill addresses the issue of the preservation of trees and woodlands, in the context of which the inadequacies of our planning law were so clearly highlighted by the Coolattin controversy.  I regret that it has taken this Government so long to deal with that issue.  Other parties in this House at the time when the Coolattin problem arose sought to agree an all-party approach to the introduction of emergency legislation to deal with the issue.  Belated though it is, we welcome the fact that this major lacuna in the planning laws is being addressed.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the Bill addresses the problems highlighted in the Nora Short case, namely the right of access to public waters or sewerage supplies, in so far as it confers a discretion on local authorities and an entitlement to reserve capacity in circumstances that will not result in compensation claims of an unjustifiable nature.  I will return later in my speech to that reform.  The manner in which that issue is dealt with in the Bill <Col N="1845" /> gives rise to a number of questions which I intend to ask.</P>
    <P>Local authorities around the country have been trying to extricate themselves from compensation claims.  Dublin County Council are the local authority who have been subjected to more compensation claims than any other, although most of them have been got out of by giving undertakings.  This procedure, a twilight zone of the Planning Acts, was devised by the local authorities to try to provide a compromise position whereby they would grant limited planning permission to developers, who often made speculative claims in return for the local authorities not having to meet the expense of paying compensation.  This whole procedure was totally undermined in the Grange Developments case and is now given a different approach by the serving of notices under the Act.  There will be a statutory basis which will allow local authorities to serve notices to allow limited developments in circumstances where currently they would in effect be stuck with compensation claims.  The provision is welcome, but whether it should be there is another question.  Once zoning decisions have been made one must ask whether it should be possible for these claims to come forward, especially pre-20 October 1988 cases.  This is a question I will address later.</P>
    <P>Sections 13 and 14 confer on a local authority discretion to serve a notice to allow a limited development which the authority would regard as acceptable. There is a particularly curious flaw.  First, it is saying there is a way of preventing unreasonable compensation to be claimed in the context of the balancing act between the private individual or building contractor and the local authority. Then there is a way out in section 15.  The Minister states that section 15 reflects provisions in the existing Planning Act.  It reflects provisions that may have been necessary under existing planning laws in the absence of the type of notice procedure which is provided in sections 13 and 14.</P>
    <P>Let us put section 15 at its most simplistic. A planning application is made <Col N="1846" /> and the local authority, for proper reasons under the Planning Acts, do not grant permission.  A compensation claim is made.  The local authorities serve a notice using section 14 to set out alternative developments for which planning permission could be granted.  Application is made for those planning permissions and they are granted, but they are allowing the speculator &mdash; as opposed to the bona fide developer &mdash; to carry out a development which would be a good deal less profitable than the original development applied for.  The speculator gets in touch with the Minister for the Environment and says he has been treated unjustly, that he wants to get a major sum of money by way of compensation. I do not believe, especially in the context of the notice procedure in sections 13 and 14, that the Minister for the Environment, in a situation where planning permission has come through from the local authority or An Bord Pleanála, should be placed in that position.</P>
    <P>An Bord Pleanála was put in place to take the Minister out of the planning process.  I do not believe it is necessary to have the Minister conferred with a discretion to make compensation payments. That will put Ministers under unnecessary pressure and will lead on occasions to unjustifiable charges being made against Ministers.  I can imagine the reaction if a Minister for the Environment made a determination under section 15 that it was reasonable that a particular developer should get a sum of compensation of £500,000.  We will assume that is a bona fide decision.  How many people outside this House might allege that the Minister was paying compensation to his political friends?  The Minister might not even know the individual or company making the compensation claim.  He may have no acquaintance with any of them.  He may have made a purely objective decision having examined what he believed to be the background to the case.  I do not believe that a Minister should be exposed to that sort of charge.</P>
    <P>That provision remaining within this legislation in the context of sections 13 <Col N="1847" /> and 14 could become a Trojan horse in years to come for all sorts of false allegations being made about the behaviour of Ministers for the Environment.  If it is necessary to have a residual provision, such as section 15 and if it is necessary to confer a discretion on someone to examine whether in exceptional circumstances it would be justified to pay a sum by way of compensation, would it not be more sensible for the courts to make that decision?  That should be seriously considered, the Minister should not make the order declaring he is satisfied that it would not be just and reasonable in the particular circumstances that the payment of compensation should be prevented. If we need section 15 &mdash; I have doubts in that regard &mdash; the courts should make the decision and they would need more substantive guidelines than those contained in this section even though subsection (2) tries to lay down certain guidelines.</P>
    <P>There is a variety of different aspects of the Bill which give rise to questions and concern.  Many of these aspects arise by virtue of the provisions contained in the Third Schedule, particularly paragraph 9, although questions need to be raised about other paragraphs as well.  I will deal with paragraph 9 first about which there is a justified fear.  I hope the Minister will accept that I agree there is a number of good points in the Bill but I am not dwelling on them because we have no difficulty in accepting them and there is no controversy about them.  However, paragraph 9 in the Third Schedule is a major problem and the Minister, in anticipation of views which will be expressed in this House, has already tried to address some of the problems in his speech.  I am not satisfied with the Minister's assurances.</P>
    <P>The difficulty with paragraph 9 in the Third Schedule is that instead of protecting local authorities and the community against unjustified claims for compensation, it could be regarded as the speculators' charter in a Bill designed to ensure that unjustified claims for compensation are not made by speculators.  I <Col N="1848" /> am again taking at face value that the Minister is anxious to ensure that that is the case.  In his speech, he very carefully teased out what he saw as the difficulties and I have no doubt he was advised that paragraph 9 may be necessary for constitutional reasons.</P>
    <P>Since the 1963 Act when we became conscious of the difficulties in the area of compensation claims that are unjustified as opposed to those that should be available, successive Ministers for the Environment have appeared to get legal advice that they cannot tackle this issue for constitutional reasons.  I am sceptical of that advice.  It has been made very clear in a recent judicial <i>obiter dictum</i> by Mr. Justice McCarthy in a case heard in the Supreme Court &mdash; and repeated by him at one of the summer conferences &mdash; that compensation cannot be justified in circumstances where it is clearly unreasonable in the context of the common good and the community.</P>
    <P>On occasions we lose sight of the fact that Article 43 of the Constitution talks about the right to private property but makes that subject to the public and common good.  To date our courts have not been asked to tease out what is meant by the public and common good when you link Article 43 with Article 40.3 of the Constitution.  I welcome the fact that Dublin County Council are now raising that issue in the courts in the Grange Developments case.  I remember as a councillor at a meeting of Dublin County Council urging that if the Supreme Court judgment went against Dublin County Council on the issue that has already been determined in the Grange Developments case, they should raise the constitutional issue.  It may be that raising that issue will clarify our minds in this area.  However, there is a major problem which will not go away because of paragraph 9 of the Third Schedule.</P>
    <P>The problem has two parts.  It relates to the circumstances in which compensation can be claimed and the second problem &mdash; which I will address later &mdash; is the method of calculating the amount of compensation that should be paid where it is justifiable.  Paragraph 9 says in effect that <Col N="1849" /> compensation can be refused if the proposed development contravenes materially any development objective of the development plan which was a development objective of that plan, or of a previous development plan, at the time, being a time subsequent to 20 October 1988, when the applicant acquired his interest otherwise than by inheritance of family settlement in the land.  I assume that paragraph is designed to deal with the kind of problem highlighted by the XJS case in the context of lands in Killiney. It was designed to deal with a situation where a piece of land is zoned amenity and a development company buy it knowing it so zoned and puts in a planning application which is turned down purely on the basis of zoning.  Then the compensation claim is made because of the fact that under our current planning laws the perspective is that someone who owns land and who is turned down for planning permission in these circumstances should be compensated for the potential maximum value of that land in the context of the maximum possible development.</P>
    <P>In simplistic terms paragraph 9 deals with the XJS case in the sense of that being a company purchasing land, knowing what the zoning is and making a compensation claim.  The reality is that paragraph 9 will be a speculators' charter. It is so circumscribed as not to solve the problem.  Why?  Let us assume that a company see a plot of land, zoned amenity, which is owned by an individual who has very little financial back-up and who would like to make a financial killing on his land.  The individual would like to sell it to a development company.  The company in question may come to the individual on 1 January 1989 and say that if they buy the land from the individual, look for planning permission &mdash; which they know they will not get &mdash; they will not be able to claim compensation because the land was purchased after 20 October 1988.  They tell the individual that they will sign a conditional contract to purchase which will be based on an agreement that, if the individual gets planning permission, the company will <Col N="1850" /> then acquire the land for a particular price.</P>
    <P>In return for that condition, the company will finance the individual's planning application and if it is not successful they will fund the applicant through the arbitration process to get compensation. In return for their getting 10 or 20 per cent of the compensation, they will then, rather than buy the land, get the remaining 80 per cent of the compensation.  The cut-off point becomes irrelevant.  It means that anyone who is in the speculative business and wants to purchase land can do so.  He is not a genuine builder or developer whose only interest in life is to purchase a decent piece of land, put in a sensible planning application and get on with the job of building a good housing estate or some other development.  We are dealing with a person who is looking for plots of land on which he can make a speculative windfall killing.  Even the speculator who purchases land after 20 October from plain Joe Bloggs can enter into legal arrangements which allow him to go through the same planning process as happens in the context of other claims.</P>
    <P>Let us assume that the planning application is made by Joe Bloggs who owned the land pre-October 1988 but who has a quiet agreement between himself and the speculators.  He does not have to publish the agreement or to let anyone know that the agreement has been reached.  When he puts in his application the planning authorities serve him with a notice allowing him, under section 14, to carry out a certain limited development.  That development is not in any way as remunerative as the pretended development for which the original planning application was submitted. He then goes to the Minister, under section 15, and looks for compensation. This is where the problem arises.</P>
    <P>There have been many difficulties in the past, on a constitutional basis, in trying to tackle this problem.  I do not want to create a situation where this Bill is portrayed as being so bad that it never sees the light of day because there is a need for reform in this area.  Paragraph <Col N="1851" /> 9 does not prevent claims being made by a speculator who wishes to abuse the planning process, in the context of the speculator showing an interest in that land after 20 October 1988.  The second problem arises in that in some circumstances you do not need to have a secret contract with an option to purchase, such as I have just described.  A company in the business of agriculture may have acquired land, zoned for agriculture, five or ten years ago and that company are very happily getting on with their job.  They may consider selling the land but the people who own the company are not interested in getting into the speculative business.  All they want to do is sell their agricultural land and get the true value for that land.  Somebody who is interested in the land will tell them they are interested in buying it.  In order to delimit the impact of stamp duties the purchaser will not take a transfer of the land from the agricultural company to his company but rather he will buy the shares in the company.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Behind the scenes, the identity of the people who control the company changes but the land remains vested in the ownership of a legal persona, a company who owned it prior to 20 October 1988.  The new directors and owners of the company are not interested in agriculture at all.  They are speculators who will make a killing on the land.  They will put in a planning application for permission for a major development that will contravene the development plan.  The local authority may give reasons for compensation not being paid but we all know of similar cases which were brought before An Bord Pleanála who then granted the compensation claim.  There was one notorious example of that in the context of a particular planning application and it is still a mystery as to why no non-compensatable reasons applied to the planning refusal.  The only objection by An Bord Pleanála to the granting of such a planning permission is that of <Col N="1852" /> zoning.  The directors who acquire the company after 20 October can then make a claim for compensation.</P>
      <P>Paragraph 9 does not protect the community, the development plan or the democratic decision made by a local authority. It protects nobody.  There are other problems with this paragraph.  With any degree of limited legal advice in the area of planning, the speculators who have up to now sought to abuse the planning processes to make unwarranted claims for compensation or to force local authorities to contravene their own development plans so as not to have to pay compensation will be able to use those two possible approaches, and indeed some others, to extricate themselves from the type of control that paragraph 9 is designed to impose on the making of compensation claims.</P>
      <P>That paragraph is ambiguous in other ways.  In some instances, I would accept that it may be justifiable that where someone inherits land and if there was a right to claim compensation previously, that should remain.  There are obvious cases where that may arise, for instance in the context of the death of a spouse and the other spouse inheriting land or by virtue of the death of a son or a daughter.  In such cases bona fide compensation claims should be made.  There has to be a balance between the rights of the community and those of the individual.  There are a number of justified circumstances in which we must preserve the right to make that claim.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is not the case in the context of all inheritance.  I am concerned about the way the wording is drafted in that paragraph.  The brackets around the words &ldquo;otherwise than by inheritance or family settlement&rdquo; could take every inheritance and every family settlement out of the limitations that that paragraph seeks to impose on the making of compensation claims.  The concept of family settlement is not even defined within the Bill.  Lawyers can say there are different meanings as to the term &ldquo;family settlement&rdquo;. Is it a legal term of art that is so defined that it could not go beyond something that is not envisaged here? <Col N="1853" /> If I own a piece of land, a speculator may offer me a price that is well above the market value of the land in the context of its zoning but is clearly below what he may be able to claim by way of compensation if he seeks to put in a planning application for the optimum developmental use of that land.  How will the speculator get around the provision regarding family settlement?  He draws up a document of family settlement.  He is not paying a price for the land but setting a sum of money with the family of the person who owns the land and they are then giving him the land.  Is this a family settlement?  A family settlement in the legal sense is normally supposed to mean a settlement within the family and not an outsider settling something with a family, but there is no reason why it could not mean that.  There is a need, in the context of what the Minister may have in mind under the concept of family settlement, to clearly define within this Bill what family settlement means and to restrain it in a way that that type of approach cannot be used.</P>
    <P>That paragraph also uses other terminology. It states that the development would contravene materially any development objective of the development plan.  What is the definition in this context of &ldquo;development objective&rdquo;? What is meant by &ldquo;contravening materially&rdquo;? These things need to be spelled out.</P>
    <P>I do not want to delay the House by going through the intricacies of the Planning Acts and the problems of working out the meaning of that terminology and what it could be in the context of other sections in the Bill.  We will tease that out on Committee Stage, but there is a problem which needs to be addressed. There is a major problem with paragraph 9 which I believe is designed to resolve the problem, but that paragraph is fatally flawed and, instead of protecting the community against unjustified claims for compensation, if it remains unchanged it will be regarded as a speculator's charter. I am not saying that lightly but out of a concern that we get it right on Committee <Col N="1854" /> Stage and that we do not enact this legislation in the form it is in in the context of that paragraph.</P>
    <P>What about other provisions in the Bill?  In the context of the Third Schedule one welcomes some things.  Nevertheless, there is a degree of ambiguity about them and a degree of concern that it is only appropriate to raise.  In the Third Schedule which lists the reasons for refusal of permission which exclude compensation paragraph 6 states: &ldquo;The proposed development would cause serious air pollution, water pollution or pollution connected with the disposal of waste.&rdquo;  It does not refer to noise pollution.  I do not know why.  It does not refer to problems major industrial development could create in the context of vibrations in adjoining buildings.  That is another form of pollution.  I assume paragraph 6 is designed to deal on a statutory framework with the environmental impact assessment reports, to formulate by way of Statute, as opposed to a ministerial direction by way of a letter or something that local authorities should take account of, circulated back in June or July last, a non-compensatable basis for refusing a planning permission if the environment impact assessment report is not adequate and does not remove all worries.  It would be relevant in the context of developments that do not require impact assessment reports as well.</P>
    <P>We are all concerned to ensure, primarily in industry and in particular chemical and pharmaceutical industry, that major pollutions, be they air or water pollutions, are not the consequences of the granting of planning permission.  We want to ensure we have no more Merck, Sharpe and Dohmes having the impact on lives of people living adjacent to them that the courts have established that company had on the lives of the Hanrahan family.  The local authorities who are going to have to make decisions as to whether a proposed development will cause serious pollution, who are going to have to examine environmental impact assessment reports to determine whether <Col N="1855" /> there are sufficient assurances and safeguards in place to guarantee that pollution will not be caused, lack the expertise to adjudicate upon and assess the environmental impact assessment reports.</P>
    <P>Local authorities do not have the personnel with expertise in this area.  That was so vividly seen in what happened to the Hanrahan family in the Merck, Sharpe and Dohme case.  It was a tragedy that should not have happened.  Nobody within this State was able to assess fully what impact that factory was having on the lives of that family, on their farm animals, their cows, the water system and even on the trees growing on their land. They had to get that expertise from outside the country and have it called in a series of litigation that could have bankrupted the family, and they are proved to be correct.  I am concerned that we do not have another Irish solution to an Irish problem, that we do not put in place legislation that gives the impression we are tackling a problem but in reality we are simply providing legislation that cannot be policed and has not the necessary back-up to ensure that the criteria people wish to put in place are abided by.  Local authorities do not have those facilities.</P>
    <P>I want to know, in the Minister's response to this Bill, what personnel and expert advice will be available to local authorities to assess the bona fides, accuracy and efficiency of what is stated in the context of works to be done by any industrial, chemical or pharmaceutical plant under the environmental impact assessment report to guarantee that a development or industry will not cause serious pollution.  We have a major problem here and I am concerned that not only will we not resolve it domestically but we will end up in breach of EC regulations and directives in this area.</P>
    <P>I am glad paragraph 6 is there.  It does not go far enough; it does not deal with the types of pollution I mentioned.  The problem is the capacity of local authorities to assess the possibilities of pollution and the impact of particular types <Col N="1856" /> of industrial development on the local communities to which they are adjacent. It is a major problem that we need to deal with.</P>
    <P>What other problems arise in the context of this Bill?  The Minister referred to, and I welcomed in my opening remarks, the provisions in the Bill dealing with the right of access to the public sewer under the relevant 1878 legislation, the Public Health (Ireland) Act, 1878.  We saw in the Nora Short case that the right of access was one that in circumstances where a local authority wished to preserve a capacity for future projected development, if access was refused compensation should be claimed.  The provisions in this Bill are designed to prevent the Nora Short type of situation arising again, but the problem is that the provisions in this Bill in this area give rise to certain questions that need to be raised. In dealing with it in his speech the Minister said that under section 13 and the Third Schedule, paragraph 1, development may be refused without liability to compensation not just where water supplies or sewerage facilities are actually deficient but where their capacity is required for prospective other development.  The non-compensatable reasons are listed in the Third Schedule.</P>
    <P>I want to hypothesise a problem here. This does not totally resolve the difficulty. There is a link between the access to a sewage facility and zoning. Let us maintain that link for a minute. Let us assume that we have in north County Dublin a piece of land that is currently zoned amenity or zoned agriculture, a major sewerage development is to be undertaken by a local authority and that local authority are inveigled into providing a greater development than they may have originally intended.  That local authority are asked, and comply with the request, to lay a pipe from the original development sewerage facility across the lands of someone whose lands are zoned as agriculture or zoned as amenity to facilitate in providing sewerage facilities to a number of cottages for <Col N="1857" /> which there are already sewerage facilities albeit on a local sewerage plant.  The argument is given that it is reasonable that that pipeline be laid so as to provide a full sewerage system without the necessity for a local plant being in place.</P>
    <P>That pipeline is laid and those lands are zoned for agriculture.  In five years time an application is made to get a planning permission for those lands.  The local authority have a look at what the position is and find that those lands are zoned for agriculture, and the local authority believe that they should be kept as agricultural land.  The problem is that they have laid this pipe across the land.  It is serving a number of cottages but the capacity of the pipe goes beyond the cottages that are served.  There is an additional capacity but it has not been designated by the local authority as being required for any other prospective development.  A planning application is then made and is turned down on the basis of zoning.  It cannot be turned down on the basis of the absence of a sewerage capacity or on the basis that the sewerage capacity is being reserved for any other development.  The sewerage capacity is there and the application is turned down on the basis of zoning.  Since the person who made the planning application owned the land before 20 October 1988 that person can make a planning application which, if it is not granted, can result in a claim for compensation.</P>
    <P>I want the Minister to clarify how local authorities are going to work out exactly whether their sewerage capacity is required for other prospective developments? Every time the local authority lay a sewerage pipe, must they publish somewhere what the capacity of that pipe is so that no confusion can arise?  Have they to specifically say that this is a pipe which has capacity for a certain number of houses, and will that be final?  Will there be litigation over whether there is additional capacity in the pipe or not?  If a local authority say there is no additional capacity, will the landowner have access to the sewerage pipe for his own independent assessment to be carried out as <Col N="1858" /> to whether there is or is not additional capacity?</P>
    <P>By and large the provisions here are welcome, but there are some ambiguities about them that need to be clarified.  It is particularly important that they are clarified and that no confusion can arise as to the exact impact this provision will have on the sort of situation I have just described.</P>
    <P>The problems I have addressed so far relate primarily to the question of when compensation can or cannot be claimed. We have another problem which is the problem of how compensation is calculated, what principles the arbitrator should apply in determining the amount of compensation payable.  The First Schedule to the Bill contains paragraphs 2 and 3 which are designed to, to some extent, amend the rules in the area of compensation.  Paragraphs 2 and 3 do not go far enough because there are many cases where compensation claims can be justified and the loss to be compensated should be the actual value of the land that that person holds, not the potential maximum value based on some notional maximum development that could take place on that land.  There is no justification for that.  When we are talking about loss we should be talking about real loss, actual loss and not notional loss. The changes that are made under the rules set out in the First Schedule do not adequately deal with that aspect of things.  In practice it means that if this Bill becomes law, there will be situations in which sums are paid by way of compensation that in reality are not truly compensation but windfall speculative gains that cannot be justified.</P>
    <P>I fully support the right of any individual to be properly compensated who is adversely affected in the context of genuine land ownership by particular planning decisions made in the interests of the community but I will not defend a situation where instead of getting proper compensation somebody gets a speculative windfall profit out of the public purse, paid for by the taxpayers.  I do not believe that is right.  I will go into this in great detail on Committee Stage.  I am <Col N="1859" /> concerned that the First Schedule does not properly, fully and adequately deal with that particular problem and that is something that needs to be clarified.  It is something that An Taisce, the Irish Planning Institute and a variety of other bodies need to look at.  Indeed the Building Land Committee of which I was a member addressed it in some considerable detail.</P>
    <P>There are other areas of the planning Acts that this Bill does not address but which should be addressed.  I pointed to a number of flaws in areas that the Bill does address.  It is disappointing that there are other areas that this Bill could have dealt with but which have been ignored.</P>
    <P>We have a major problem that primarily affects urban areas.  It is a problem that I am all too aware of as someone who has been a member of Dublin County Council since 1979 and it is a major problem, particularly in the Tallaght area.  It is a problem of the developer who is given a planning permission to build a major housing estate, who builds the estate, makes an awful lot of money but does not carry out the conditions that are attached to the planning permission.  He does not provide the open spaces or the amenity areas that are a condition of the permission.  The local authority have to take the developer to court and it may take years to process that court case.  The developer may wind up his company and the local authority may discover, at the end of the day, that there is no one they can actually litigate against to ensure that the necessary amenities are provided in the estate, that the estate is landscaped, that open space areas are properly grassed, that roads and pavements are properly completed, all the things that are necessary to ensure that a housing estate is a reasonable area in which people can live.  While the local authority are litigating to try to enforce their planning conditions the same developer, either under the name of the same company or under the guise of another company, can look for planning permission to build another vast estate somewhere <Col N="1860" /> within that local authority's area, and the local authority cannot refuse a planning permission on the basis that that developer is already in breach of planning conditions imposed on him in the context of a development that should have, long since, been completed.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kitt, sitting opposite me, is more than familiar with the problem I am describing.  He and I have, on occasions, joined forces at local authority level to try to ensure within our own constituency that this problem is faced up to by local authorities going to court against developers. Often even going to court is of no use.  A local authority have, on occasions, had to grant a planning permission to a developer while litigating against the same developer in court.  There should be a provision in our planning Acts which confers a discretion on local authorities to refuse to grant a planning permission to a developer who has had a reasonable time to complete a development and who is in breach of planning conditions.  That should be an express non-compensatable reason for An Bord Pleanála and the local authorities to refuse a planning permission.</P>
    <P>If there is a developer who has carried out a development in, say, County Dublin that has not been properly completed and who applies for permission in County Kildare, County Kildare local authority should be able to look at whether the estate in County Dublin has been properly completed and whether there are serious breaches of the planning Acts, take that into account and refuse to grant a planning permission.  That can be a refusal to consider the planning application until such time as the outstanding works are completed.  I am not saying that for all time that developer should not be allowed to develop but it would put pressure on the recalcitrant developers who have milked the system and who have abused the good will of tens of thousands of people living in our urban areas by taking full money from them for their houses under the promise of providing open spaces, landscaping, proper pavements and proper roads but reneged on such a promise.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1861" /> Such a provision would put pressure on those developers to complete estates because they would know that no further planning permissions would be forthcoming until estates were properly completed. It would take the pressure off local authorities to spend large sums of money in litigation against developers in an effort to force them to complete those estates.  It would be a cost-saving provision, a way of ensuring that the bona fide and decent developer was treated fairly.  We have plenty of such developers and we should not turn this into an attack on them.  There are plenty of good people and companies building excellent houses even in the context of the difficulties the Government have created for the construction industry.  They are only interested in doing a good job of work, getting paid for it and moving on to another development.</P>
    <P>However, such developers are blackened by the behaviour of the few cowboy developers we have.  Unfortunately, some of the cowboys have been some of the big developers.  Such a provision is long overdue in our planning laws.  It would not cost the State anything to have it in but it would provide protection for the community, reduce the expense of local authorities and provide a very good stick for local authorities to use to ensure that cowboy developers do not use the planning Acts to abuse the development process and take full money from people for the houses they purchase without providing the facilities.</P>
    <P>The price of a house, whether it is £30,000 or £80,000, is not only for the bricks and mortar.  It has implicit in it a promise that within the estate there will be proper roads, lighting, landscaping and a decent sense of housing amenity. The Minister could introduce such an amendment to the Bill and it would be welcomed with open arms by all sides of the House.</P>
    <P>I should like to highlight another problem which has not been addressed, one that is evident to any person who has been a member of a local authority.  I am referring to the methodology of our development plan process.  It may have <Col N="1862" /> been attractive when the 1963 Act was enacted, taking into account the preceding legislation we had, to get each local authority to engage in a development plan review every five years, although often the period is longer. However, there is a great anomaly in the way local authorities carry out the development plan process.  For example, Dublin County Council review their development plan in isolation; Dublin Corporation review their development plan in isolation and Dún Laoghaire Corporation review their development plan in isolation.  It makes no sense to have three different local authorities in the Dublin region reviewing such plans without communication between the elected members.  The development plan process is one of the few processes left to elected members of local authorities and it makes no sense that the members of those authorities should review their plans in a vacuum.  They do not consult with each other.  It is almost as if when Dublin County Council are reviewing their plan that the corporation area does not exist. The plan may involve zonings of areas within 100 yards of the corporation area but the only contact there is is when the plan overlaps.  The same applies to Cork and other cities.  The problem is not confined to Dublin.  We are a more built up country than we were in the sixties and we have the anomaly of development plans being reviewed in a vacuum by each local authority.</P>
    <P>The fact that that process has become inadequate is evidenced by the need to establish on a non-statutory basis regional development organisations.  We should try to lay down plans on a regional basis by the establishment of a national roads authority.  The time has come to consider development plans on a regional basis and not based purely on each local authority's area.  We should have a regional development plan system which would have an input from elected local authority members and would approach the five year review process on a regional basis and not purely confined, as local authorities must operate at the moment. We are creating quangos like the roads <Col N="1863" /> authority and other organisations and we should be heading into a regional structure in some of those areas.  The local authority system is inadequate as far as the development plan process is concerned. It is inadequate in the context of the reviews of development plans, of having separate plans for the cities and counties of Cork or Dublin.  It no longer makes any sense, if it ever made sense. It certainly does not make sense as we head into the nineties.  It is time there was new thinking in regard to this.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on gaining new responsibilities in regard to the Structural Fund, and the regional development projects in the seven regions.  He should think in the context of development plans and realise that in the new era into which we have arrived there should be new thinking in regard to planning.  That new thinking should protect the community and ensure that the development plan process has a real meaning and impact in the context of general planning decisions.</P>
    <P>A great deal more could be said about the Bill and I could say a lot more about other anomalies in our planning laws.  I hope the Minister regards some of my comments as a constructive approach to try to improve the Bill.  I hope he sees fit to introduce some of the new thinking I have suggested in areas that have not been addressed in the Bill.  I would like the Bill to become the vehicle for producing worthwhile reform.  I hope we will see radical changes to paragraph 9 of the Third Schedule so that that will not become the speculators' charter it could be regarded as.</P>
    <P>The Bill is not perfect by any means. The Fine Gael Party, when the Progressive Democrats produced a Bill which only addressed some of the issues referred to in the Minister's Bill, supported that measure on the basis that it provided a vehicle for bringing about the reforms necessary.  We are taking a similar view of the Bill before us.  We do not like certain aspects of it and we are worried about some of the provisions, such as paragraph 9.  They give rise to <Col N="1864" /> considerable alarm but we see the Bill as a vehicle to provide badly needed reforms.  It is our intention to table a number of amendments to improve it. We intend to try to introduce some of the measures I have referred to, unless the Minister indicates that he will table amendments along the lines I suggested. I appreciate that the Minister may need some further time to consider the prospect of changing the draft development plan process and we may not be able to change it radically in the context of the Bill.  That may need to be done in a more overall reform of our local authority system.  Nevertheless, it should be considered in the context of the Bill.  For that reason we are reserving our decision on whether we consider it appropriate to table detailed amendments on that aspect of planning.</P>
    <P>I do not see any reason why the Minister cannot deal with the problem of housing estates and cowboy developers, or with the problems of paragraph 9.  I see no reason why he cannot extend the pollution provisions in this Bill and give us the necessary assurances that the local authorities will have the expertise to ensure that we have no more Merck Sharpe and Dohmes.  There should be included within our planning laws, if we are going to make the environmental impact assessment report a meaningful operation, provisions which will render local authorities liable for damages in the event of the local authorities granting planning permissions for the provision of an industrial development, pharmaceutical plant or chemical plant which subsequently pollutes and damages and causes injury.  It should be clear that there is a liability there.  In the context of this Bill there will now be an implicit liability that the courts may interpret as applying.</P>
    <P>We need to ensure that the local authorities realise that environmental impact assessment reports are serious things.  I have been hearing stories as to how some local authorities are dealing with them. Some local authorities are getting these reports &mdash; and there are not too many of them around yet &mdash; and are following the Minister's July letter in this way.  A <Col N="1865" /> planning application is made and the local authority say: &ldquo;We need an environmental impact assessment report&rdquo;.  The company who have made the planning application submit a draft of the environmental impact assessment report to the local authority.  The local authority look at it and point out to the developer the bit in the draft about which it has worries and suggests they may take that part out and phrase it differently so that the worries do not arise.  Then the chemical or pharmaceutical plant, or whatever, submit a sanitised version of the environmental impact assessment report which allows the local authority to accept it.</P>
    <P>I am concerned, because I am getting some feedback, that in some local authority areas that is happening.  If it is happening it is happening because local authorities do not have the expertise to assess the validity of the environmental impact assessment reports that are submitted to them.  They do not have the expertise to determine what the possibilities of pollution are.  All they want to do is to get a neat statement that does not give rise to them having a reason to have a fear.  The Minister would want to be very careful about policing the way in which local authorities are dealing with the whole issue of pollution and the environmental impact assessment.</P>
    <P>In the context of the city and county of Dublin, the Minister would want to be very sure as to what developments we have that might add to the air pollution and the smog that we already have within this city.  At this stage he does not need to be told that.  We have been saying it on this side of the House for some weeks past.  The Minister has finally noticed the smog and he is doing something about it albeit what he is doing is still not adequate but we will come back to that on another day.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I am glad this Bill is here.  It provides a vehicle for change. More needs to be done, but Committee Stage will give us the opportunity to do the additional work that needs to be done.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>My party will be opposing this Bill because we believe it is fatally flawed.  I expect that other parties in the House who feel similarly about the measures in this Bill will do likewise.  I thought the whole thrust of this measure was designed primarily to deal with one particular issue, that of compensation extorted from the taxpayer on the basis of a spurious claim for alleged losses arising from a rejection by a planning authority or a local authority for planning permission. That is seen broadly in the public mind as a scandal.  It is a scandal and it should be stopped.</P>
      <P>The reason this Bill should be rejected is that not one existing speculator with an interest in land today will be adversely affected by its provisions in the context of their right to claim compensation for such a rejection.  It is no more complex than that and no amount of peripheral waffling about other issues in the Bill can extradict that essential weakness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thought the Minister was less than gracious in referring &mdash; even obliquely &mdash; to the fact that the measure here today arises out of an attempt by my party last May to introduce a measure which, despite what Deputy Shatter has said, dealt with different issues, not a smaller number of issues, including the issue on which Deputy Shatter spent some time, that of unfinished estates.  I am confident that this Bill would not be here today were it not for the Bill which we then introduced.  I say it without wishing to make any major point but at least, in courtesy, we would expect some acknowledgment in that respect.  In dealing with the Bill the Minister was gracious in admitting that we put in a lot of work at the time and he felt that the Bill had much to recommend it.  I know it can be tedious and difficult for the public and non-interested parties to take a great deal of interest in the proposal before us, but the essential issue is that anyone with an interest in property or land right now &mdash; and that interest is not just ownership &mdash; was able to ride roughshod over the rights of the community by seeking this form of compensation.  Those people have the same rights under this Bill as they had up <Col N="1867" /> to now.  It is as simple as that.  Unquestionably as has been pointed out that particular right will continue to be exercised and every conceivable device will be used to ensure that that right is established and utilised regularly.</P>
    <P>The purpose for which the Bill was ostensibly designed and the whole reason for the Bill introduced by the Progressive Democrats last May, which was to stop that abuse, is not dealt with in the Bill. That can only arise, either from an act of gross irresponsibility or, and I am loath to accept or believe this, an attempted deception of the House and the public, into believing that something is being done when nothing is being done.  The cases that have caused public scandal will continue for decades because this Bill does not address the fundamental issues involved.</P>
    <P>What did the Minister actually promise to do when he dealt with the Progressive Democrats measure last May?  He promised to introduce a comprehensive measure dealing with compensation and related issues.  In the context of his words at the time no one had any doubt but that what he was saying was that the measure he would introduce would deal with changing fundamentally the abuse which facilitates the spurious compensation claims about which the public are rightly outraged and in respect of which every Member, and every party in this House, feel strongly that there should be action. But action has not followed.  It is worth noting what the Minister said at the time and I quote from column 212, volume 380, of the Official Report of 3 May 1988:</P>
    <P>... I expect to be in a position before long to circulate comprehensive legislative proposals on compensation to the House.</P>
    <P>In column 214 he stated that the proposed measure:</P>
    <P>... will remove the liability for compensation in any case where the refusal of permission is on the grounds that the proposed development would conflict <Col N="1868" /> with the objective of the development plan.</P>
    <P>In the same column he continued as follows:</P>
    <P>I have a comprehensive framework in hands which will deal with the problem of compensation and related issues.</P>
    <P>I can see from the murmur of conversation in the House that this issue raises about as much interest here as it probably does in most of the public.  I do not blame them for it because it is a difficult and tedious issue.  The abuse is not dealt with in this Bill.  I submit therefore, that that fundamental weakness is not one amenable to amendment and the House should rightly reject this Bill.  We will be proposing its rejection and will be asking for a vote when that time comes. We will be expecting those who have been critical on all sides of the House to support that vote when it is called.</P>
    <P>What does the Bill actually do?  My reading of it and the reading of the Minister's speech this morning is that it deals with a number of peripheral issues which should have been dealt with years ago, but which at least, are being dealt with now.  For example, they remove the right of someone to compensation if they are going to pollute the atmosphere &mdash; big deal.  Is that an advance?  That is something that should have been done a long time ago.  I do not thank anybody for introducing such a measure.  It proposes a number of similar fringe innovations, all of which in themselves are welcome but which, quite candidly, do not get to the heart of the issue before us.  I propose to deal with that in greater detail after Question Time.</P>

      <P>It is estimated that there are about 70 illegal stations operating at present at various locations in the country, although the number can vary from month to month.  The Broadcasting and Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1988, which comes into force on 31 December will strengthen my Department's powers to deal effectively with illegal broadcasting.

      <P>Back in April the Minister advised the House that there were about 70 illegal stations operating and it would appear therefore that there has been no reduction in the number.  The commission is now in place and applications for licences for the new stations are being received but there does not seem to be any indication from the illegal operators that they are going to close down or get out of the area altogether.  Can the Minister indicate whether he has any plans to actively approach these institutions?</P>

      <P>The new legislation comes into force on 31 December and I can assure the House that it is my intention that the full rigours of the law will be used in putting these people off the air as and from 31 December.  I take this opportunity to say that there has been a campaign mounted by some of these illegal operators that they be allowed remain on the air pending the new stations coming on stream.  The legislation as passed by this House specified the date of 31 December or before, but not after, and I intend to ensure that as and from 31 December illegal operators will be put off the air.  We will be involved in an advertising campaign between now and <Col N="1874" /> then to bring to their notice, to their advertisers and to all concerned, the full penalties outlined in the legislation as passed.  We will be contacting the particular operators to advise them of the penalties which will be in place and I can assure the House that the full rigours of the law will be used in putting these illegal operators off the air.  They have been operating illegally for ten years and the Government are not prepared to allow the law be brought into disrepute.</P>

It was specifically designed for the commission to consider the illegal operators and the intention was that they would get absolutely no bonus points for having been illegal operators.  I assume that the commission, under Supreme Court Judge, Mr. Justice Henchy, will severely penalise any applicant for a licence who will flout the law after 31 December.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be familiar with the legislation which was passed by this House.  He was involved in a very constructive way in the debate which took place on it and he will recall that the date specified is 31 December, or before, by order of the Minister.  There is no facility within the legislation to extend the time beyond 31 December, and I have no desire to extend it past 31 December.  If there is a gap between the illegal stations going off the air and the legal stations coming on, I hope the gap will be as short as possible.  I believe it would be improper and wrong for pirate stations to be able to go off the air on a Sunday night and come back on the air on a Monday morning as legal operators. <Col N="1876" /> That should not happen, will not happen and cannot happen.</P>

      <P>The purpose of the International Telecommunication Union are: (a) to maintain and extend international co-operation between all members of the union for the improvement and rational use of telecommunications of all kinds, as well as to promote and to offer technical assistance to developing countries in the field of telecommunications; (b) to promote the development of technical facilities and their most efficient operation with a view to improving the efficiency of telecommunications services, increasing their usefulness and making them, so far as possible, generally available to the public; and (c) to harmonise the action of nations in the attainment of those ends.</P>
      <P>The last Plenipotentiary Conference of the International Telecommunication Union was held in Nairobi, Kenya, from 28 September to 6 November 1982 and I propose to circulate a copy of the agenda for that conference in the Official Report. Apart from the election of officers and discussions on financial and organisational matters, the principal work of the conference was to revise and update the International Telecommunication Convention which is the basic instrument of the union, and which was previously revised in 1973.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a member of the union, Ireland attended the conference to influence the future direction and plans of the union and voted in support of those positions <Col N="1877" /> which reflected the orderly administration and development of telecommunications services.  The next Plenipotentiary Conference of the International Telecommunication Union will be held in Nice, France, from 23 May to 29 June 1989 and that conference will determine the future work of the union.</P>
    <P>Following is the agenda:</P>
    <P Just="Center">Agenda for The International Telecommunication Convention Nairobi, 1982.</P>
    <P>The Plenipotentiary Conference shall:</P>
    <P>(a)  determine the general policies for fulfilling the purposes of the union prescribed in Article 4 of this Convention;</P>
    <P>(b) consider the report by the Administrative Council on the activities of all the organs of the union since the previous Plenipotentiary Conference;</P>

    <P>(d)  fix the basic salaries, the salary scales and the system of allowances and pensions for all the officials of the union; and, if necessary, provide any general directives dealing with the staffing of the union;</P>
    <P>(e) examine the accounts of the union and, finally approve them, if appropriate;</P>
    <P>(f) elect the members of the union which are to serve on the Administrative Council;</P>

      <P>As I indicated in reply to a question on this subject on 1 June 1988, An Post monitor the standard of their mail delivery service by means of internal checking procedures and independent surveys.  An Post are committed to publishing the results of independent surveys commissioned by them and are concerned that these results should be totally representative of the performance of the postal service.  To this end they have decided that surveys will be carried out at quarterly intervals and in consultation with the research agency involved have restructured the nature and extent of the survey.

      <P>I accept that, a Cheann Comhairle, but I want to interpret the quotation which is ascribed to the Minister.  On that occasion the Minister indicated that he was dissatisfied with coverage on RTÉ Radio 1 so far as the performance of the Government was concerned and he indicated that he could not wait for the independent services to come on stream, thereby implying that they would put the Minister's view in a <Col N="1880" /> more favourable context.

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure that members of every political party in this House are all of the same view, that we do not get as much good and favourable coverage of our points of view as we would like. The view I expressed in this House and at the first meeting of the Independent Radio and Television Commission was that it is in the public interest that there should be a diversity of views and that extra sources of news and current affairs should come in as soon as possible.  With regard to attacking or in any way criticising the well-known objectivity of the newsroom or current affairs section of RTÉ, that was the furthest thing from my mind.  The other part of my comments referred to the amount of talk on Radio 1 at present.  As a listener, I can say that I find from 7.30 a.m. to 9.15 a.m. there is news and then until 11 o'clock more talk and then until 12.45 p.m. more talk&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The Deputy could really ask his questions if I had gone in complaining about it, criticising and doing something about it.  When I make a statement publicly, he cannot really complain.

      <P>There are no universally accepted studies done which would enable Irish costs of a basket covering a range of business telephone services to be meaningfully compared as the Deputy suggests. Indeed, there is no single methodology currently available which would be suitable for use in all EC countries, though I understand that efforts are currently being made in international fora to develop a common methodology.</P>

      <P>The Deputy continues to trot out this chestnut regularly in this House.  He knows that it is just not fact. Take, for example, charges.  One particular interest in Ireland, as distinct from most of the rest of Europe, other than Greece and Luxembourg, is that there is no such thing as timed local calls.  Local calls in all other EC countries are timed and where they are timed the cost of the call increases sharply as its duration <Col N="1884" /> increases.  This is the difficulty that all international fora are having in coming up with a common methodology.  It has been attempted at European Community level and at OECD level.  Using the criteria as best we can &mdash; and I answered the question for the Deputy on the last occasion in the House in relation to charges &mdash; we have a very favourable rating as far as prices are concerned now, in view of the decreases in cost that have been brought about by the efficiencies in Telecom Éireann, which I was glad to be able to announce recently.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Energy (Mr. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13, 29 and 40 together.</P>
      <P>These shares, which were acquired at no cost, were in fact registered in the name of the Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>The shares were sold at their quoted market value, with a view to realising funds which would help to put the nation's finances in order.  To date, their disposal has raised revenues of some £2.7 million.</P>
      <P>The sale of these shares does not reflect a change of policy but rather a decision by the Government to dispose of certain surplus assets.  Similar disposals are taking place in relation to other State assets, including property, the retention of which in public ownership does not serve a strategic purpose.  The Government decisions to dispose of these assets were taken in the context of the 1988 budgetary position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think that a useful purpose would be served in endeavouring to provide meaningful financial data in relation to assets of the kind encompassed by the <Col N="1888" /> Government decision, whether held in my name or in the name of the Minister for Finance.  The Deputies may be assured, however, that no assets will be sold otherwise than for their full value.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not the case that these shares were sold for 50 per cent less than the value reached during the course of 1988 and that there was widespread criticism about the manner in which they were sold which effectively cost the taxpayer £1.2 million?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of using hindsight to decide when is the best time to sell can be never ending and unproductive. For instance, if we were to go back a few years earlier, to 1983-84, and if the then Government had decided to sell these assets, they would have realised figures considerably higher than those which were eventually realised.  The decision was taken in the context of the budget and it was put into effect as soon as possible.  We are happy that the best possible deal was made at that time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>

      <P>First, I congratulate the Minister on becoming a member of Government.  Arising from his reply, may I ask if there is now a change in Government policy on State participation in the future?  Further, may I ask if the terms of mining leases are now going to be confirmed at the time the exploration licence is granted?  At present exploration licences are taken out without knowledge of any of the details that will apply whan a mining lease is finally granted by Government.</P>

      <Col N="1891" /> The people involved in private planting are uneasy about the role of Coillte Teoranta officers in the future.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will recall the debate we had on Second Stage of the Forestry Bill, 1988, where we went into some detail on these matters.  I decided that the best interests of the private planters would be served by retaining this area in the Department of Forestry so that the Department will have control.  If problems of the kind the Deputy fears were to arise, clearly the Minister of the day could take appropriate action.  To be honest, I do not see any great problems or fears in that regard on the ground. Because of the way the legislation has been designed and is operating, we have the composition that gives the greatest possible safeguards, and the fears which the Deputy has expressed are being catered for in a better way than would be the position had private planting been managed entirely by the new organisation.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a practical problem. For instance, if the Deputy were to suggest that Coillte Teoranta were not to be involved in these inspections, that would mean that the old forestry service after 1 January would have to employ inspectors throughout Ireland to cater for the developments in the private planting programme.  That would be a very expensive way of dealing with the problem. The Department will remain the arbiter but the actual inspection work will be carried out by the foresters who have access to local information and knowledge. Having made the recommendation, they do not make the <Col N="1892" /> decision.  It will be made on the basis of technical advice to the Forest Service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 16 and 30 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The latest estimate of recoverable reserves for the Kinsale Head gas field, calculated by my Department on the basis of 1987 data, is 1.47 trillion cubic feet.  The 1988 figure has not yet been calculated.  In 1986 and 1985 the recoverable reserves were estimated at 1.45 trillion cubic feet and 1.44 trillion cubic feet respectively.  These calculations <Col N="1893" /> reflect a slight year-on-year increase in the estimate of recoverable reserves in the field with the 1987 figure being greater than the 1985 estimate by some 2 per cent, although some scope for margin of error must be borne in mind.</P>
    <P>At current offtake levels of 60 billion cubic feet per annum the field has a life expectancy of some 15 years.  The agreement with Marathon, which was announced on 22 July 1988, provides, <i>inter alia,</i> for increased levels of offtake. The formal contract giving effect to this agreement was signed by me on 22 November 1988.</P>
    <P>On the basis of data analysis and discussions with exploration companies having interests in the Irish offshore, my Department are aware of a number of potentially gas-bearing structures which remain to be explored.  Only by drilling will this potential be adequately assessed. I am confident that the drilling programme which we have arranged with Marathon, together with the exploration activities of other companies, will substantially achieve that object.</P>

      <P>We are in the same league as in the case of the previous question.  It has never been the practice to disclose to the House detailed confidential matters of a commercial nature.  The first agreement was reached with Marathon when the Deputy's party were in power and the same practice was observed.  We have to ensure that we protect the interests of Bord Gáis in all this.

      <P>My supplementary question to the Minister was based on more or less the same point made by Deputy Bruton.  I was a member of Cork County Council who were very much involved when the planning of the Kinsale gas field was being undertaken by Marathon.  It was always stated that such information would be made available. Would the Minister agree that it is not in the interests of the people of this State that Marathon have an involvement in the Kinsale gas field?  There is a question as to whether Marathon have been doing better than they should have been doing. The gas is only a little distance off the coast of Kinsale and it is only right and proper that we should know what price is being paid to Marathon.</P>

In that event or in the event that there are no such guarantees, is the Minister making other arrangements or seeking a link-up to a European grid for the continued supply of natural gas to consumers here?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 17 and 41 together.</P>
      <P>The report of the Working Group on Interconnection which I received in June 1988 concluded, based on detailed assessment of future supply and demand that a decision on gas imports is not required until 1991 or 1992 and recommended that the matter be reviewed in detail in three years' time.  I have accepted this recommendation. Monitoring of the existing systems capability to meet demand is ongoing and I am keeping a close eye on this.  The agreement which I have just signed with Marathon has its own special relevance in this regard.</P>
      <P>I have not sanctioned preparation of plans for an electricity interconnector with the United Kingdom and I have not had any recent discussions with the British authorities regarding interconnection with either the UK mainland or Northern Ireland.  The working group concluded that the link with the UK appears to be economically viable and merits consideration of proceeding with pre-contract phase discussions and studies sometime next year.  It felt that the most attractive available option would be a 600 megawatt high voltage DC cable to the UK.  It also concluded that there is a strong economic case for restoration of the link to Northern Ireland but there are other difficulties involved in this regard. Continuous attacks and threats by subversives have frustrated efforts to repair the line since it first went out of action in 1975.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Why did the Minister take the decision to explore next year the possibility of an interconnector with the UK when it is quite clear that they do not have the cheapest source of electricity available for export in Europe?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The study commissioned by the Minister in 1987 and which reported this year bears out the fact that the most economic consideration is the interconnector to the UK.  Some people have asked why we will not have an interconnector to France but all the indications are that energy would be considerably dearer from that source.  On balance, the report seemed to come down very heavily in favour of the UK interconnector. However, it is too early to indicate the final decision and there is no necessity to take a final decision because it will be a considerable time before these additional energy resources will be required.  We will have ample time to examine it in a very detailed and comprehensive way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Before this possibility of further exploration goes ahead, will the Minister have discussions with the French authorities who, I understand, have electricity available for export and would be likely to offer it at a very favourable price?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not rule out the possibility of discussions of that kind but the indications from the French sources are not as favourable in regard to price as the Deputy seems to believe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOMalley" hpid="Mr. P. O'Malley Mr. P. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has accepted that it would be economically beneficial to restore the electricity interconnector with the North.  Has he any plans to look at that matter again and try to get the interconnector link re-established? The reason this has not been done up to now seems to be because of security difficulties.  Will the Minister consider raising this matter at the Anglo-Irish Conference to see if the security aspect could be sorted out?  In relation to the UK interconnector, given that there is a <Col N="1898" /> very long lead-in time in relation to the provision of any such interconnector, will he further agree that now is the time to negotiate and to do advance planning instead of leaving it until we require it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope that my answer to Deputy Bruton's question did not indicate that we were not doing anything about this matter.  It is a question of having sufficient time to examine the different aspects of this whole proposal so that a final decision can be based on all the solid information available.  There is no question of deferring it and waiting until the last minute.  I accept that there is a long lead-in time &mdash; perhaps five or six years &mdash; and in the interests of ensuring a successful outcome we must continue to examine the matter and bring it to finality as soon as possible.  It is a shame that it has not been possible, for security reasons, to put into effect on a permanent basis an asset which has so much to offer in terms of supplying electricity to Northern Ireland.  I will do anything I can to bring this matter forward.  We must bear in mind that the initial effort was frustrated by subversive action but we can never accept that position as final.  We cannot afford to allow that to develop but, at the same time, any action taken to restore the interconnector with Northern Ireland will have to take a number of factors into account.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>The IRA are pretty skilled in public relations, they can always think up a good excuse, no matter how horrible the atrocity they commit.  Has the Minister any idea of why the IRA have constantly blown up the electricity interconnector between this State and Northern Ireland?  It is against the interests of the ordinary man in the street and as the IRA are as good at pretending they represent the ordinary person, they and their political representatives, Sinn Féin, should be asked to explain why they have constantly disrupted this connection. The Minister said he will do everything in his power to see that matters return to normality.  Will he contact their official political organ, Sinn Féin, to <Col N="1899" /> see if they can give a guarantee that any future connection will not be disrupted?</P>

      <P>I do not have any helpful remarks in connection with Deputy Deasy's question.  It is extremely difficult to find any sound reasoning for the actions of the IRA in relation to this and so many other matters.  There are no answers to the slaughter of innocent people or to the dislocation of a service of that kind which is aimed at helping the community.

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have the reply to which the Minister referred.  I am sure the Minister would accept that transport of radioactive materials in and out of ports in Ireland facilitates reprocessing plants in the UK such as Sellafield. Is the agreement which he has now <Col N="1901" /> come to with shipping authorities a voluntary one and, if so, is he happy that it will be adequate to ensure that there is no transportation of radioactive materials into Irish waters and Irish ports?  Has he any intention of making a statutory ban which would prevent these transportations?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The arrangement is a voluntary one.  I am assured that it will work very satisfactorily.  We intend to monitor this situation because we view with great seriousness any continuance of radioactive material coming into our ports, whether in transit to elsewhere or otherwise. It seems it is not necessary at present to consider the question of statutory requirements but I will monitor the situation as closely as possible.  All the indications are that the present arrangement is working well and will work very satisfactorily in the future.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy well knows, statutory instruments are available in many areas in which they are not capable of being implemented 100 per cent.  It is not always just a question of having statutory instruments to ensure that you can succeed. Perhaps if the present arrangement can work it is the best way to proceed for the time being.  It certainly is working at present and all the reports available to me are very satisfactory in that regard.</P>

      <P>It was discovered in the recent past that these shipments were being carried out on a regular basis. Given that the Minister views this matter with such seriousness, what difficulties are preventing him from introducing a legally binding ban on the transport of these materials, irrespective of whether he feels there may be difficulties in ensuring that it works?  If there was a statutory ban on these transportations it would put the matter in a much better perspective than at present.  The Minister is apparently relying on voluntary&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Col N="1937" />
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Just before Question Time I was making the point that it seems to me in all the circumstances that the essence of this Bill was to achieve a particular objective and that the Bill simply does not do that.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the measure, which we first introduced in May and which was responded to ultimately with this proposal in the name of the Minister for the Environment was at its heart to stop the abuse, the spurious claiming of substantial amounts of compensation based on the rejection by local authorities of planning applications.  All other matters in this Bill are, in a sense, extraneous or at least peripheral to it.  If the Bill does not deal with that issue it fails.  It is not a Bill that can easily be amended because the amendment would almost be a new Bill.  It would require a very lengthy reasoned amendment which may have to come if it ever reaches Committee Stage and if the House does not take a different view on Second Stage.  I am quite willing to accept this Minister's good intent in the matter.  The essence of it is that the Bill is a lamentable failure.  It is not that it misses the mark slightly; it simply fails absolutely to stop this loophole.  It is not a question of grey; it is a question of black and white as far as we are concerned.  We will, therefore, be opposing the Bill.</P>
      <P>I regret that very much because in the debate in the Dáil on 3 May 1988 the Minister was fairly fulsome in his expectation that the measure which he would ultimately introduce would deal with the issues about which all of us are concerned. It does not do that.  There is no denying or overlooking that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was interested also to hear the Fine Gael spokesman earlier today making the point that parts of the Bill were fatally flawed.  If the measure is fatally flawed, it cannot be amended and should therefore be opposed.  I am assuming that the logic of what the Fine Gael spokesman said will involve that party opposing this measure.  I want to publicly appeal to Fine Gael to take a strong line on this issue and to oppose the Bill on Second Stage and, if it goes beyond that, one or two elements of Committee Stage.  In so <Col N="1938" /> doing I would also appeal to the Minister to have another look at this Bill.  The Opposition parties would be quite willing, if asked, to meet with him to try to work out some arrangement which I believe the Minister would be desirous of achieving which would achieve the result that all of us want.</P>
    <P>What do we want?  We do not want people to be prevented from making reasonable profits on their activities in any legitimate or legal area of activity. What we want is to stop an abuse which involves people being able to make very substantial claims, some £64 million in four years, for example, based on the purely notional advantage or gain which they might have had if they had got a planning permission.  It is about as logical as me applying to the IDA for a grant for a factory and suing the IDA because I did not get the grant and getting my compensation from the State, the taxpayer, based on the alleged and projected income I would have got from the factory if I had got the grant.  It is about as logical as that.</P>

      <P>It is about as logical as that.  The Minister had his chance and I listened to him with reasonable courtesy this morning so perhaps he would do me the honour of listening to me.  We had this thrashed out in May.  The Minister gave his word that he would introduce a Bill that dealt comprehensively with the issues and to date he has yet to honour his word because it is not in this Bill. As my colleague in Fine Gael said this morning, the reality is that this Bill does not interfere with the existing right of any one who has an interest in land to seek compensation as has been done over the years.  Is that correct or not?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>It might be in this case because this Bill is pregnant with nonsense. As far as I am concerned, what the Minister said in May is not being honoured.  Every one of those people who had a slight trepidation at the measure we submitted to this House in May, who felt maybe this loophole was being closed off, rubbed their hands in glee on publication of this Bill because, as anyone can see, this capacity for ongoing speculation, this charter for corruption which does exist in the existing legislation, is continuing to be sustained by this Bill which misses the central mark of what we are trying to achieve and which dealt with a number of peripheral issues which are hailed as advances.</P>
      <P>For example, the Minister talks about compensation not now being available where water supplies or sewerage facilities are actually deficient.  I suggest that should never have been entertained any way.  Development should not have been tolerated under any circumstances in cases like that because it leads to obvious problems.  The Minister also said that compensation would not be allowed if it is premature by reference to any order of priority for development indicated in a development plan, and rightly so.  That is quite correct but what has it got to do with the issue?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The same applies to the question of sources of serious air pollution, water pollution or pollution connected with the disposal of waste.  A person will not now be compensated if their development <Col N="1940" /> would have led to serious pollution.  Am I supposed to welcome that as a major advance?  That is the way it should always have been.  I appreciate the fact that it took the Minister to do that but that is not what the Bill is about at its heart.  It is about the abuse which has been pointed to by various groups, such as the Irish Planning Institute, An Taisce and Members of this House, an abuse which lets certain people who have no interest in the common good ride a coach and four through present planning law and exact a major advantage from that provision.</P>
    <P>In the four year period tens of millions of pounds worth of claims were submitted to the courts and the awards were paid by the taxpayer.  That abuse continues and the only effect the Bill will have on it is if those people having an interest in land now register a change in that ownership sometime in the future. However, even in that case there are exemptions if it happens to concern an inheritance or is on the basis of a family settlement.  In other words, the descendants of those who at present have that marginal advantage over others in society and are fortunate enough to have such property will continue, for some incredible reason that I cannot see in the context of natural justice, to have that advantage, an advantage which is unjustified.</P>
    <P>It should be remembered that we are not talking about somebody who is developing land or creating some type of infrastructural development but a person who is arguing the case that he or she would have benefited if they had got permission for a particular development.  I do not accept that as a principle.  I have maintained that the common good dictates, as it does throughout the whole of the legislative process, that people do not have unfettered, open-ended and absolute rights regardless of whether they have ownership of or an interest in land or property.  That is at the heart of this because the obligations of property are not stressed or referred to in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I submit it is not a question of other elements although I would have preferred to have seen other issues treated in our <Col N="1941" /> Bill last May dealt with in the Minister's Bill.  However, if the essential issue, that of compensation, was dealt with properly and clearly in the Bill I would be relatively happy about it but it is not.  Paragraph 9 of the Third Schedule and section 13 are the essential elements in this respect.  From that point of view they are wholly unsatisfactory and should be seen for what they are and vigorously opposed.  They are either a complete dereliction of responsibility or connivance with what is going on.  It is one or the other.  To be frank, I do not believe the Minister would be involved in such connivance and I can only say that I regret that he seems thus far, unless he is willing to change his mind, to have failed to do what I believe was his duty in this matter, to protect the public interest.  I am saddened by that because it seems from what he said in May that he was on his way to doing that.</P>
    <P>The Minister said on 3 May, as reported at column 214 of the Official Report that he had a comprehensive framework in hands which would deal with the problem of compensation and related issues.  That was said in the context of a debate on a Bill which purported to stop the abuse about which we are concerned.  It was reasonable for us to postulate that the Bill before us would deal with that.  It is not acceptable that the right to open-ended abuse and to compensation as we have known it is untouched in respect of all existing interests in or ownership of land.  That is what the Bill facilitates and that is unacceptable.  I am sure that is the view of most reasonable thinking people.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to what I call an independent view of the issues involved in planning law and compensation, that of the Irish Planning Institute.  They have been very concerned about this over a long period and produced a number of submissions to the Minister's Department and a reaction to the Bill.  I do not believe that their view is politically coloured in any way and I do not think any Members would suggest that.  They are a group of expert people who have a feel for this area and their voice is worthy <Col N="1942" /> of being listened to.  Their initial comment on the Bill was:</P>
    <P>There are two main problems with the compensation system in so far as it relates to planning under the present legislation.  They concern a land-owner's eligibility for compensation and the amounts of compensation claimed.</P>
    <P>The Institute considers that the Bill in so far as it addresses these two problems, has two major weaknesses: (1) It fails because of the provisions of paragraph 9 in the Third Schedule to reduce to any significant degree the eligibility of landowners to claim compensation.</P>
    <P>Later that report states:</P>
    <P>(2)  It fails to provide for the reduction of the enormous amounts of compensation which are the subject of claims under the Planning Acts.</P>
    <P>In relation to amount the report continues:</P>
    <P>... we proposed in our report that compensation should be related to the actual loss suffered by the landowner as a consequence of the decision giving rise to the claim.</P>
    <P>That view was developed at some length. In essence, what has been said by Opposition spokespersons was stated clearly by an independent body of people with a particular insight and expertise in this area.  They made a submission to the Minister outlining their broad policy in this respect in October.  They made the point that the existing facility for abuse should be stoped but, unfortunately, the Minister seems to have ignored that submission.</P>
    <P>The Institute put forward a number of suggestions that should be included in the Bill and one or two of them are worth repeating.  That body produced a constructive document which should be taken on board.  Their report, at paragraph 5, states:</P>
    <P>It is considered that the existing <Col N="1943" /> reliefs open to a developer who is refused permission on the basis of being in conflict with the development plan should continue.  These would be the purchase notice; material contravention of the plan or a variation of the plan.</P>
    <P>It would also be the case that compensation would still be payable where an applicant is prevented from achieving a development which conforms to the specific provisions of the plan or where the land is reserved for a particular purpose.</P>
    <P>That is reasonable.  The report adds:</P>
    <P>We also consider it expedient at this point in time in the light of the above recommendation and recent case law and developments in planning that a number of other amendments should be made to the Planning Acts and the Public Health (Ireland) Act, 1878. These would provide for <i>inter alia:</i> (i) zoning to be mandatory in rural areas; (ii) the refusal of permission on the basis of the non-availability of public sanitary facilities to be non-compensatable; (iii) compensation claims to be limited to decisions on appeal; (iv) in the event of development being permitted at any time in the future on a site where compensation has been paid, the compensation to be repaid to the planning authority; (v) undertakings to be statutorily defined and clear procedures to be set out for granting them which would allow for public participation; (vi) permission to be refused under the 1878 Health Act to permit a connection to a sewer where its capacity is intended to serve land designated for development elsewhere.</P>
    <P>A number of those are reflected in the marginal areas in the Minister's Bill. Paragraph 7 of the report dealt with a central point which is not in the Minister's Bill.  It states:</P>
    <P>With regard to the measure of compensation, we consider in equity that <Col N="1944" /> neither the landowner nor the community should be worse off after a planning decision than before it.  The landowner should therefore be compensated for his actual loss as a consequence of a planning decision, that is the difference in the market value of the land before and after the decision.</P>
    <P>That body explained in detail in the submission, and elsewhere, the present nonsensical notion that leads to fantastic sums being claimed and the basis on which they are made.  They referred to the notion of projected loss arising from the alleged refusal.</P>
    <P>The Irish Planning Institute are a body who, so far as I am aware, are independent in their activities. They have said that the thrust of what should be done in this area is broadly on the lines of the Bill my party put before this House last May in relation to compensation.  I would not claim any more than that.  This is reiterated in their comments on the Minister's Bill which came to hand this week.  When the Minister comes to reply I would like him to comment specifically on their submission and on the points they raised lest some of us on this side of the House be accused of opposing for the sake of opposition which, I am sure in the context of this Dáil, can hardly be said but might be said.  The institute go on to make the point, which is valid, that even among the exemptions and exceptions which are allowed there is a virtual <i>carte blanche</i> in terms of the ongoing right to compensation.  They stated in their submission that:</P>
    <P>Having regard to the nature of the land ownership on the major urban fringes where compensation claims generally occur, the Bill will have no effect on land in either family ownership or held as part of development companies' long term land banks.  In these cases, ownership will remain unchanged, or the family owner will apply for permission before closing any future sale thereby gaining for the applicant the benefits of paragraph 9.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1945" /> I do not want to reiterate some of what Deputy Shatter said this morning but I concur with him in that respect.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister seriously believe that two people engaging in a land transaction in ten years' time will not sit down together and have their discussions result in an arrangement whereby the existing owner will apply for planning permission prior to the sale being completed? What about the companies who own land, who in ten or 20 years' time, can have a complete change of their board but who would still be the owners and would still be able to ride a coach-and-four through the planning law?  It is not just a question of ownership, what the Bill refers to is a person who has an interest in land.  When the Minister is replying perhaps he would define that matter.  To me an interest in land could also mean any marginal interest, be it a tenancy or a small equity stake in a company owning land which obviously opens the door to abuse even wider.</P>
    <P>I want to make this point in passing &mdash; it is not a major point &mdash; but the Minister might comment on it.  I was surprised at the manner in which this Bill was published. I noticed that the Minister convened a meeting&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I am not making a big song and dance about this but I am saying that the net result of what happened was that there appeared in the media the next morning, after the press release, a version of what would be in the Bill but which was completely inaccurate. It was only on radio that morning that the Minister for the first time admitted that the Bill would only have effect to changes of ownership as and from 20 October.

The main worry some of us have is that the public perception might be that the central issue of compensation would have been dealt with satisfactorily if this Bill was passed. That will not be the case so, unfortunately, we have to oppose it.  The basic flaw in the Bill can be remedied if the Minister is willing to reconsider this measure.  I do not know when it is to be on the agenda again.  Presumably it will come up in the next few weeks.  I appeal to the Minister to address the problem of the open-ended nature of compensation claims still allowable under the Bill for anyone having an interest in land at this time.</P>

The thrust of what should have been attempted should have been such as to ensure that as and from whatever date the Minister so selected, all future applications for planning would not have been entitled to claim compensation if the grounds on which they claimed compensation could be deemed to be in conflict with the common good.  The <Col N="1948" /> Minister's answer to that query in his contribution this morning was that it might imply that public authorities would have open-ended power, that a local authority might change the goal post a little or might have a new draft development plan or that there might be some person who had put in a lot of money to developing a parcel of land under a certain assumption to find subsequently that the draft development plan had been to rezone the area.  I think the example is extreme.  I am not aware &mdash; to quote the Minister's case this morning &mdash; of any case where someone had put in millions of pounds of investment and found the goal posts moved, as it were.</P>
      <P>The Minister asked if we believed the public interest would be served by the conferring of excessive powers on local authorities.  Later he asked if the House seriously wanted to entrust these powers, without check, to planning authorities. The answer would probably be &ldquo;no&rdquo;.  The answer to the issue I am raising is not necessarily to give the power away, without check, to local authorities, it is to introduce reform of local government to ensure that that kind of thing would not happen, in other words to deal with the mechanism by which local authorities make decisions and not simply to continue to accept that there is a huge problem and that nothing can be done about it because local authorities might abuse their power.</P>
      <P>Perhaps I should declare a vested interest: as one who spent more years on a local authority than I care to remember I genuinely believe they do not abuse their powers.  One of the problems they have at present is that if somebody designing a local authority house wants to get a change or a modification of the size of a bathroom they have to go to the Minister's desk.  I do not understand how the Minister believes that local authorities are without check or control and that they are running free.  They are strapped down and have to refer everything to the Minister's Department at present.  Some of us would like to see them having more autonomy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The answer to the question of the <Col N="1949" /> Minister's fear or lack of trust in local authorities &mdash; the vast majority of which are under the power of his own party but that might not necessarily be the case for all time &mdash; is to deal with the local authority structures and not to allow the potential for abuse to continue.  In his contribution this morning he said:</P>
    <P>If zoning by the planning authority were the beginning and end of all landowners' rights, then some very unjust consequences would be possible.  For instance, it would be open to a major urban authority, without constraints, to zone for non-development purposes, e.g. amenity or open space, a parcel of land which a person might have spent millions of pounds in bona fide assembling.  Zoning can change and it is not subject to any appeal process.</P>
    <P>Either by the introduction of an appeal structure or the introduction of local authority structural, changes that could be dealt with.  The abuse we are speaking about could also be dealt with.  They are not mutually exclusive and one should not be used as an excuse for doing nothing in the other area.  To quote the Minister it will be a long day before &ldquo;excessive powers&rdquo; will be held by local authorities. So far as I can see, everything has to go to the Minister's desk for approval.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that the Bill contains an important procedural innovation in section 14 which is designed to replace the undertakings procedure of section 57 of the 1963 Act.  He stated and I quote:</P>
    <P>This new procedure will allow a planning authority to rebut a compensation claim by a notice stating that in their opinion alternative development ought to attract planning permission.  This notice can only be defeated if planning permission is subsequently refused or conditioned in a manner inconsistent with the permissive statement.</P>
    <P>I have a small worry about this.  There is a strong degree of circumstantial evidence to suggest that local authorities have facilitated or have given planning permission because of a fear that if they <Col N="1950" /> did not they would otherwise be liable to pay out large compensation claims.  I can recall arguing in trying to assist a certain development that the local authority's function has been to consider planning applications and to say yes or no and that they rarely got involved, certainly not on a statutory basis, in giving detailed advice to the applicant as to what development should take place and as to what might be tolerable.  Perhaps they should but what I am suggesting is that the procedure which the Minister is proposing will allow a planning authority to turn down a compensation claim by issuing a notice stating that in their opinion alternative development ought to attract planning permission.  I presume that that means that they cannot give them (a) but if they apply for (b) they may get it.</P>
    <P>Again, I am troubled by this because that may dilute the rigorous enforcement of draft development plans and may very well dilute the commitment of local authorities to oppose unacceptable development and it would allow them a larger degree of permutations in responding to applications than they now have.  Where the response may have been outright rejection they will now be able to say that they do not want a certain development but the developer may get it if he presents something that is in the middle.  Therefore, we might end up with a compromise arrangement which might not be in the best interests of everybody.  The Minister used the words &ldquo;in a manner inconsistent with the permissive statement&rdquo; and I would like him to indicate what he means by that.  Does it refer to a specific response from the local authority to an application or does it refer to some other form of statement on the part of the local authority?  I would like to get more detail on that.  The Minister went on to say, and I quote:</P>
    <P>The measures proposed by this Bill have already attracted considerable comment.  Most of this has been directed at the provision whereby persons acquiring land after 20 October <Col N="1951" /> 1988 will have no claim for compensation if they are subsequently refused planning permission because development would materially contravene an objective of the development plan which related to the land at the time of its acquisition.</P>
    <P>He went on to refer to the preoccupation with the zoning issue and said that he has heard people publicly claim that the Bill as a whole will apply only to new interests in land and said that this was nonsense. He also said that with the exception of the one prospective provision on zoning the Bill's provisions would apply equally to all land owners and developers.  That is the provision we are concerned about and that is the provision at the heart of the Bill.  That is why people have said rightly that the Bill would only apply to new interests in land and the Minister knows this as well as I do.  It is a little unjust to imply that people are wide off the mark in this when in fact they are accurate.</P>
    <P>To be fair to the Minister, as far as I can judge, he did not raise constitutional hares.  One of the traditional reasons for not doing anything in this area is the suggestion that one cannot interfere with the right to own property as there would be a constitutional case.  I would like to suggest that the courts have been very helpful to us in this respect and that there is a fair body of evidence to indicate that the open-ended right to property without any reference to the common good or the obligations of ownership should not be used as a basis for open-ended claims to compensation.</P>
    <P>The Irish Planning Institute dealt with this matter very well in their initial report to the Minister in October of this year. In it they dealt with the constitutional argument.  More interestingly there were references to this matter in cases in the Supreme Court by judges and in one case, involving XJS Investments Limited, for example, the Supreme Court drew attention to the existence of these compensation provisions in the 1963 Act and <Col N="1952" /> queried whether they were constitutional, not because they infringed on the right of the individual to own property but because these provisions seemed so generous that the court wondered whether &ldquo;legislation which appears to authorise such a use of public funds is constitutionally proper&rdquo;.  Whatever doubts may have existed in the past, this and other decisions clearly paved the way for a radical revision of the compensation provisions contained in the 1963 Act. This is a clear statement by the Supreme Court that it has the greatest doubts about whether the legislation which appears to authorise such use of public funds is constitutionally proper.  In other words, the issue is whether these payouts are acceptable.  In the eyes of the Supreme Court that is the constitutional issue at stake.  Therefore the Minister would be pushing an open door if he were to pursue and deal in line with widespread public concern and interest and widespread political concern and interest, with the issue of compensation.</P>
    <P>There have been suggestions over a period of time that there were constitutional problems but the judgments in a number of cases have nailed this issue down once and for all.  I would like the Minister to comment specifically on that point and to state whether he accepts that the evidence available to us, including the judgments in a number of Supreme Court cases such as, Pine Valley Developments Limited <i>v</i>. the Minister for the Environment and XJS Investments Limited <i>v</i>. the Corporation of Dún Laoghaire, indicate clearly to him that the idea which gained ground in this country that if you owned a bit of property that you could do what you liked with it regardless of who is hurt or what it costs anybody else, is wrong and that a query has been raised as to the constitutionality of paying out compensation?</P>
    <P>That is the alleged principal reason for inaction in this area.  I have never accepted that that is the reason, as I have always found that there was a problem in regard to political will.  I would have to say that I believe that such a problem <Col N="1953" /> exists here also and that there are too many people with vested interests in having the position remain as it is.  There are people, unfortunately, who would put pressure, if they had the choice, on many people on all sides of this House to leave things as they are.</P>

      <P>I am not saying that they have; all I am saying is that there are such people and the reality is that there are queues for compensation-planning applications in a number of local authorities around the country, including the Dublin area, who are very pleased to see the incredible loophole which is being afforded them in this Bill.  I know this to be true as I have spoken to some of the planning officers involved.  They are worried about being pressurised&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not suggesting that the Minister has been subject to influence; all I am saying is that there are those who would be willing to use pressure without any question or doubt, because what we are talking about here are very substantial sums of money for people engaged in activities which are only about money, and if the Minister shuts off that loophole he will undoubtedly fall in popularity with the small group.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not saying that the Minister does or implying that.  I am simply making the point that there is a strong lobby involved in the background and they do not need to come to the fore at this point because this Bill does not <Col N="1954" /> touch them.  In essence, as far as I can judge, the Minister would have the courts of the land on his side in saying that there is no constitutional reason for inactivity. Therefore, I do not understand &mdash; and the Minister should explain to the House what the reason is &mdash; why he has not dealt with that open-ended potential for abuse, because that is the central issue.</P>
      <P>Obviously other speakers want to get in this evening, so I will not go on very long.  One could talk at great length on each section of the Bill but we will have another chance to do that on Committee Stage.  Deputy Quinn and Deputy Farrelly have been here for most of the day and it would be wrong of me to hog the remaining time this evening but there are one or two points I wish to make.  If the Minister does not deal with the issue of the Third Schedule we will not have dialogue on this; if will be cut and dry and we will oppose the Bill.  I am very sorry about that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and I have done my job in this respect.  All I am saying to the Minister is that if he had introduced a measure which had gone three quarters of the way, we would not oppose it. Unfortunately, the Bill does not go any of the way and, therefore, we are not going to spend out time scratching our heads writing amendments which will not get anywhere in this respect.  We are not going to do that.  If the Minister wants to talk about this issue privately or otherwise, I would be happy to sit down with him or anyone else to see if we could come up with a formula of words, provided that the purpose of such a formula would be to stop once and for all compensation claims based on the spurious notion of projected loss arising out of a planning application being turned down. That is the issue in this Bill and if the Minister wants to take that on board he can be my guest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know some other speakers want to get in this evening, so I will finish my contribution.  I wanted to refer to a few other points but I can leave them for another day.  This morning Deputy Shatter said the Bill was in part, at least, &ldquo;fatally flawed&rdquo;.  I think he is right.  I could use less pleasant words but I will not do so because we are not in the business of doing that this evening.  The Bill is an abject failure.  I am sorry about that and I appeal to the Minister to do <Col N="1956" /> something about the Bill before it comes back into the House.  I believe there is a growing volume of opposition both inside and outside the House to what this Bill purports to do.  The initial indication was that it did something but it is becoming more and more apparent that it does not and if it does not do something then I am afraid we have no option but to oppose the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is hard to contain the excitement in the House this afternoon with such a full gallery of interested press people, who are paid to be here, and others who have thronged the public gallery to find out how we are going to manage urbanisation between now and the end of this century.  Perhaps it is a reflection by way of popular TAM rating or public opinion that the galleries have voluntarily voided themselves and dispute the central sentence in the first paragraph of the Minister's speech where he said: &ldquo;The purpose of this Bill is to amend and consolidate the law on planning compensation&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>As the Minister knows, I strive to be generous when it comes to parliamentary colleagues and seek to find common ground and consensus where possible. There are some positive provisions in this Bill.  From a legal clerk's point of view the Minister has succeeded in combining in one piece of draft legislation all of the relevant elements which relate to the law in this area, and to that extent, it is consolidation law which will be very useful if it goes through.</P>
      <P>I have to say at the outset that the Labour Party will be opposing this legislation. We will be opposing it primarily for two reasons.  Notwithstanding the fact that there are some good elements in the Bill, it is a bit like saying there was good meat in a meal which was badly cooked. We are not disputing the quality of the meat but the chef certainly gets no marks for the recipe, the quality of service or the way in which it has been put together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>It provides a meal where there was no meal on offer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1957" />
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not true; there was a very good meal on offer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I will give the Minister the history of what was on offer.  I know that the Leas-Cheann Comhairle &mdash; if I may anticipate you, Sir &mdash; who is most tolerant in these matters will afford me the opportunity to do this because at all times I will be relevant and to the point in relation to this most serious matter.</P>
      <P>The Minister saw fit in his opening remarks to give a cursory review of the history of urbanisation in our society and the applicability and appropriateness of our planning legislation to enable our society to accommodate urbanisation.  I want to say &mdash; and perhaps this is not the day to be criticising the Minister because he has other things on his mind &mdash; that I do not believe this Bill amends the legislation on planning compensation.  It alters it in a number of ways &mdash; and I am not playing with words &mdash; and it introduces some useful bits of consolidation. With regard to the protection of areas of woodland, there are merits in the Bill and with regard to the automatic right of a person to connect to a public sewer running through his land the alterations imposed in this Bill are positive. However, I regret to say that this House could have been afforded a more effective and efficient way of dealing with those positive measures if the Minister had, for example, sought to recommend amendments to the Progressive Democrats' Bill in relation to compensation.  The Minister chose not to do this although it is advice he is now offering to the Opposition. Having regard to the way in which the Minister's colleague, the Minister for Justice, has treated such a process in this House, we have to take that with a fair degree of salt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Private Members' Bill on the Coolattin Woods which the Labour Party brought in some months ago would have dealt more comprehensively and more adequately with areas of woodland, and likewise that matter could have been dealt with in this Bill.  The Fianna Fáil Government and all Governments &mdash; and I was a member of one of them &mdash; have <Col N="1958" /> always seen fit in the political culture of this House to refuse to concede to any Opposition party any real credit in relation to a Private Members' Bill, and hoist by the Minister's own cultural, political petard, we now have to confront him with the culture of this side of the House, that is, opposition, because no other quarter is given.</P>
    <P>In his opening remarks the Minister went back to the history of planning legislation in Ireland and referred to the 1934 Act.  In fact, and I am not being pedantic about it, one could cite the sanitary Acts of the last part of the last century as effectively being the basis upon which planning legislation was enacted and put together in this country.  I do not know whether it is a reflection of the abolition of An Foras Forbartha or whether the new planning research unit have not been properly integrated into the Customs House unit of the Department of the Environment &mdash; I know they are still in St. Martin's House and they will always be welcome in my constituency &mdash; but if the sum capabilities of the revamped, revised, enlarged and enlightened staff capacity of the Department of the Environment, with this new research facility, are to give, in less than half a dozen paragraphs, a cursory history of planning in this country then the Minister has been badly served by his arbitrary decision to execute An Foras Forbartha.  I would offer an alternative history.</P>
    <P>When this State got independence in the early twenties approximately 20 per cent to 25 per cent of the population &mdash; depending on one's definition of what constituted a town or an urban area &mdash; lived in urban areas and the rest in rural areas.  By the end of this century, give or take a few percentage points &mdash; and nobody can be 100 per cent accurate &mdash; that ratio of urban to rural or rural to urban will probably be reversed.  In one century and within not more than three generations a once-off, historic, never again to be repeated shift in the occupation of the island of Ireland, from a space planning point of view has to be effected and will be effected.  The pattern <Col N="1959" /> of settlement that had effectively predominated in varying degrees from Norman times, and certainly from the 16th century onwards, of rural to urban which was comparatively static, and the urban charters of the various towns from the beginning of the Middle Ages was in overall time frame terms, to be telescoped into a very short period of change with enormous dislocation problems and problems of accommodation and acclimatisation.</P>
    <P>It is my contention &mdash; and I think the Leas-Cheann Comhairle will recall since my election to this House in 1977 and since I was a member with him of Dublin City Council in 1974 &mdash; that this generation of Irish people, the entire generation that live in the Republic of Ireland, had a unique opportunity to ensure that the benefits of that once-off unique historic shift from rural to urban would be done in a manner that would give not lip service but real justice and truth to the concept of social justice in relation to how best this could be done so as to ensure that the community were not ripped off in the process of this historic settlement shift.  It has been one of the great scandals and failures of the body politic of our society since the early sixties that we have been politically &mdash; and I emphasise politically &mdash; unable to deal with this problem.</P>
    <P>I have to say &mdash; and these are considered words &mdash; that the Minister's attempt to provide a cosmetic cover of resolution and a legislative proposal that gives the impression that he is dealing with this problem is so weak, so inadequate and so nearly duplicitous that I have outrightly to condemn it.  I have twice introduced in this House two Private Members' Bills to try to control the price of urban building land, of which this compensation matter is a first cousin.  On that occasion the Minister's party &mdash; and I remember the Minister was Minister on one occasion and backbench Member on another &mdash; voted against that Bill.  He has said: &ldquo;The net issue is grasping the nettle of community bias&rdquo;.  I welcome that phrase in his speech.  There perhaps has <Col N="1960" /> been some shift in the thinking of the Fianna Fáil Party in this respect, some recognition at the present time.</P>
    <P>I want to go back to when the issue was at its worst, because the Minister raised this point himself.  In rather scathing terms he referred to how successful our planning legislation had been in marked contrast to &ldquo;some third world countries&rdquo;.  I would put it to the Minister, and indeed to the Department of the Environment and to the body politic of this country of which I am a member, that we have handled with less success our rather insignificant rate of urbanisation than some third world countries have managed to do.  There are cities in the third world, one of which I recently visited that went from a population of 400,000 in 1940 to 8.5 million today and the basic planning structure works.  The outrageous abuse, in contrast, of the use of section 4 on the west coast of Ireland, in the Counties of Mayo and Galway, make some of third world countries, which are denigrated in the Minister's speech, look like angels of planning propriety in terms of how well they have accommodated the demand for growth. The intellectual insult implicit in the Minister's throwaway remark is extraordinary. That is the first point I want to make.</P>
    <P>Let me now look at the history of our various attempts to deal with the problem of compensation, planning gain, community bias and private land speculation in our society since the sixties.  It started with the appointment of the late Justice Kenny by a predecessor of Deputy Flynn and now a party colleague of Deputy Keating, Deputy Robert Molloy, to chair a committee to review the question of land and land compensation.  That report was put on the desk of the incoming Minister, then Deputy Tully, in the Custom House in March of 1973.  This history is perhaps known to this House but it needs to be restated, certainly having regard to the revisionist history that has been purported in the Minister's speech to be a summary of recent planning in this country.</P>
    <P>That report contained a majority <Col N="1961" /> report and, in the immortal words of Brendan Behan, the committee had a split and there was a minority report. The minority report was signed, among others, by the legal adviser to the Department of Local Government, as it then was.  It argued, in essence, that the proposals to curtail the price of non-building land, or agricultural land coming into the building sector for the first time, to agricultural value plus 25 per cent was probably unconstitutional.  Because there was a consequent slump &mdash; I am quoting now from memory the opinion given to me by my former colleague, Deputy Tully &mdash; following the oil crisis of October 1973 in the building area and some builders were selling back to Dublin County Council and Dublin Corporation land at a price less than that at which they had bought it, there was no great urgency to introduce the legislation because the heat had gone out of the market.  In addition to that, he said &mdash; and I paraphrase &mdash; there was a dispute because the advice that was got from the legal adviser in the Department of Local Government, as it then was, concurred with by the Attorney General's Office, was to the effect that any attempt to introduce legislation of this kind would be deemed to be unconstitutional and under the relevant Article of our Constitution, the Government of the day cannot knowingly promote legislation which is officially advised to be unconstitutional.  This has been so often repeated that perhaps we could put it to music or by way of a refrain in this House. That was the position throughout the mid-seventies.</P>
    <P>When the Labour Party introduced their Private Members' Building Control Bill in 1979-80, various Government speakers were aligned.  I think the then Deputy Barrett was the Minister for the Environment of the day.  No matter how much they concurred with the sentiments of our proposal, which was essentially to adopt the main principles of the majority Kenny Report with some additions, but in essence that was the road down which we had proposed to travel, we had this repeated refrain from Fianna Fáil speakers of the day that while they had no <Col N="1962" /> argument in principle with the proposals and recommendations, it was sadly, tragically and inevitably unconstitutional and, therefore, reluctantly they had to vote against it.</P>
    <P>There was not exactly a gallop to support the Bill coming from the Fine Gael Party either, it should be said, because there were some reservations there in relation to the sanctity of the absolute ownership of land and the right of any private landowner to exploit without reservation, or hesitation, or any other impediment, to screw the maximum amount possible from the value of that land.  They were not prepared to contemplate the argument that people should be paid the value of what they had rather than the potential value of what they thought they might get if the land was so developed.</P>
    <P>That Private Members' Bill was defeated in 1979-80.  It was reintroduced in 1982 and a compromise arose at the end of Private Members' Business on Second Stage whereby the building control land committee was established and the man who has today been appointed Minister with responsibility for Industry, Commerce and Communications was the person then charged with the responsibility.  I negotiated the compromise with him in relation to that committee.  That committee started their work and some of the recommendations are, it is alleged in the Minister's speech, embodied in or incorporated into this legislation.</P>
    <P>I was a member of that committee for a short number of months, because by November 1982 there had been another election and I was then in the Department of the Environment.  We were waiting for the recommendations of the Building Land Committee to be brought forward.  I have no doubt but that there is a conservative consensus in this House and that we will see its effects on Second Stage when Fine Gael will not oppose the Second Reading of this Bill.</P>
    <P>People regard land as akin to winning the lottery.  If you inherit land, let nobody interfere with your rights to exploit it to its absolute maximum.  If you cannot get <Col N="1963" /> planning permission, you should be entitled to maximum compensation, no matter how illogical, irrational or exploitative of the rest of the community that assertion is.  I suspect it is the peasant in us.  I come from peasant stock myself and am proud of it, I do not feel any need to make allowances or apologies to anybody for it, but I recognise it in all of us.  I recognise it in myself, in my own people and in the people who have elected us to this House, but equally I recognise that it is that naked hunger for land ownership and its untrammelled exploitation which has improverished the process of urbanisation which uniquely this generation of Irish people have had to undergo in the past 40 to 50 years.  As I have said, we are the only generation, of all generations who will ever live, who have had the historic task of urbanising our society.  A once-off shift from rural to urban life over the space of 50 years has occurred in our time.  We have done this in a way that undoubtedly has impoverished large sections of our society.  If this Bill goes through, that impoverishment will remain.</P>
    <P>The Building Land Control Committee refused to grasp the nettle of dealing with the question of existing use value.  I want to take time to put on record again the difference between hope value and existing use value.  On Committee Stage I will go into the most recent exposition of the same argument as that put forward by the Irish Planning Institute.  In essence, what is being upheld by this Bill and by previous contributions from the Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael sides is the right in respect uniquely of land ownership and of nothing else in our society that you get in return for the transfer of ownership of land which might be in an area capable of urban development or redevelopment, not its existing use value but what it might be worth if it happened to be sold to a local authority.  It is extraordinary that people who espouse the virtues of the market and believe that the State should in no way interfere with the transactions of an economy uphold this contradiction and distortion of things that they would <Col N="1964" /> otherwise hold to be true and self-evident. It is a bit like saying to somebody: I am selling you a motor car, a 29-year-old battered Volkswagen, the existing value of which is in the region of £300 to £400, but when you look at it it is not really a 29-year-old battered Volkswagen but a pristine new Volkswagen Passat the real or hope value of which is approximately £18,000 to £20,000.</P>
    <P>A coal yard owned by Dohertys, which was a coal yard for generations and is within visible distance of the Minister's Office in the Custom House, was sold as an office block to Dublin Corporation under a Compulsory Purchase Order sanctioned by one of the Minister's predecessors. There was no office block on the site and there never was an office block on it.  However, it was potentially capable of having an office block built on it because the area was zoned for general business purposes but the market which your party espouse and Fine Gael embrace had in their wisdom decided that coalyards do not make good offices and, therefore, never put an office block on the site.  The going rate for coalyards with their sophisticated infrastructure of yards and walls and drains was in the region of £4,000 to £5,000 an acre.  Because the local authority &mdash; of which the Leas-Cheann Comhairle and I were members at the time &mdash; sought to acquire the site compulsorily and because the 1919 Valuation and Compensation Act which the Minister is purporting to amend was applied by the arbitrator the local authority did not buy a coalyard but the site of an office block that the market would never build in that location.  Back in the early seventies the local authority on behalf of the taxpayer paid something of the order of £100,000 per acre for that property.  It is that historic rip-off, that internal reverse wealth tax that has been going on since the accelerated process of urbanisation took off in the early fifties and mid-sixties.  The Minister is attempting to address that political scandal which, frankly, the Labour Party had failed to do because we do not command a majority in this House.  While we do not command a voting majority we will <Col N="1965" /> not allow the Minister or his colleagues in Fine Gael to pretend or purport that he is dealing with the problem, because he is not.  There is no suggestion that the Minister is interfering with the 1919 Valuation Act or attempting to replace existing use value with potential or hope value or that he is even going to go back historically, irrespective of the nature of ownership.  The Minister has not yet clarified the position and on Committee Stage he will have to clarify the doubts and ambiguity that surround the commencement date and its effectiveness in relation to ownership.</P>
    <P>Leaving that point aside, the core point that is central to the argument of planning development with scarce capital resources and which has beset this generation since the early sixties is not being addressed.  It was identified by the Kenny report and the minority report said it would be unconstitutional to address it. It was identified by the two Labour Party Private Member planning Bills that were rejected democratically by the majority in this House.  It was discussed <i>ad nauseam</i> by the Building Land Control Committee and the Deputy whose resignation as Minister for Finance was announced today and the Deputy who succeeds him were both members of that committee who suggested there should be no interference with the market mechanism and that a massive investment in infrastructural services was necessary.  I am paraphrasing from memory but the Minister will concede that my memory in these matters is not that defective &mdash; their argument was to flood the market with serviced available land so as to equalise the price and reduce the effective price of land.  By making so much serviced land available, real market competition could then prevail.</P>
    <P>That view is marvellous when you happen to be in Opposition, as both those gentlemen were at the time, but the Minister has responsibility for saying no to hundreds of schemes for extra roads, water and sewerage systems because he simply does not have the capital resources available to flood the market with capital investment to give an equal playing field <Col N="1966" /> to every little bit of a half acre in the country so that you could have equal competition in market theory, applying to the acquisition of land.  It is manifest nonsense to suggest that we should invest equally in land right across the country, certainly in the large urban areas where growth is anticipated, so as to reduce the scarcity factor that prevails between land which is adjacent to a public road or a sewer built by the taxpayer as against land which is not so fortuitously located. That is nonsense in the context of the unique historic opportunity which this generation has in trying to make a transition from a rural settlement pattern to an urban-dominated settlement pattern.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister for the Environment every success in his new appointment and in dealing with the gremlins in the Department of Finance.  The very fact that the Minister has been given this additional task is a recognition by the Government of the need to co-ordinate and provide for proper planning.  The proposition that market theory and free competition could apply to land economics by simply servicing every half acre in the country with a decent sewerage system, telephone system and road system is manifest economic nonsense.  Consequently the only way we can deal with this problem is by introducing some kind of State regulatory system which will control the arbitrary price of land and bring it into conformity with the rule applying in the rest of the market &mdash; you pay for what you get, which is its existing use value.</P>
    <P>This argument, which I am summarising in deference to the House, has been expounded over many hours in the past by various speakers.  I have been one of the main contributors to it.  Nobody has ever said to me that they disagree with what I am saying.  They always say that even though they might agree, what I am proposing is unconstitutional and, therefore, they cannot endorse it or vote for it.  The record will show that.  There is a reference to constitutionality in the Minister's speech.  The very eminent and intelligent legal adviser in the Custom <Col N="1967" /> House, who is widely respected by everybody and is very much his own man, has consistently held the view that these proposals would be unconsitutional.  That is his professional view.  There is a way of testing that.</P>
    <P>I know there are restrictions upon the Government of the day in that they cannot knowingly promote legislation which they believe to be unconstitutional. In this instance there is a genuine intellectual and legalistic doubt.  As junior Minister in the Department of the Environment I was charged with responsibility for introducing legislation to give voting rights on a reciprocal basis to UK citizens resident in the Republic of Ireland.  Our legal advice was that there might be a constitutional difficulty.  In response to questions from the then Opposition we said that this argument had been made known to us.  We agreed that there was a question as to whether the procedure was correct but pointed out that there was also a process by which the question could be definitively resolved.  In that case the President, having consulted with the Council of State, decided to refer that legislation to the Supreme Court within 60 days.  The Supreme Court gave their view that it was not constitutional.  Subsequently in conjunction with the elections for the European Parliament in 1985 we had a referendum which enabled the State to introduce legislation giving UK citizens the right to vote in Dáil elections. I am glad to say there are about 750 of them in my constitutency and they were reminded of that facility.</P>
    <P>The point I am making is that although there may be a view that a particular measure could be unconstitutional, it has not always stopped the Government of the day, including Fianna Fáil Governments, from introducing legislation about which there was a doubt because at the end of the day the Supreme Court is the final arbiter.  They have never been formally asked to adjudicate on the fundamental challenge between existing use value and potential value or, to use a phrase in the Minister's speech, the community bias. The Supreme Court have never been <Col N="1968" /> asked to strike the balance between community bias and legitimate private property ownership rights.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in referring to protecting the rights of landowners, enunciated three principles which he stated were common ground between most of the major political parties and the Irish public.  I do not know of any political party, major or minor, who want to challenge the rights of private property. There is a suggestion in the speech that the major political parties might be agreed, but the inference is that the minor political parties are not.  There is a balance between community bias and the right to private property.  The final arbiter as to where that balance lies is the Supreme Court but they have not been definitively asked to adjudicate so as to establish beyond all doubt where that line lies.</P>
    <P>In August 1986 a detailed discussion on the Constitution took place at the Patrick McGill summer school.  RTE produced a programme specifically on the Constitution to mark its 50th anniversary and they also produced a news item on the summer school.  They carried interviews with two respected members of the Supreme Court, Mr. Justice McCarthy and Mr. Justice Walsh, people whose jurisprudence, legal independence and general experience of the socio-political process would not be disputed by anybody.  These are men who would not be seen as having any great political axe to grind.  In public discussion in Glenties and on the television programmes, as well as in private discussion in that marvellous hotel in Glenties, which anticipated the liberalisation of the licensing laws, they said that if the right Bill was sent to the Supreme Court they might get a chance to give a definitive ruling, but that such an opportunity had never been put before the Supreme Court.  Clear signals were given to me &mdash; and they are on the public records of the airwaves of RTE &mdash; that the Supreme Court recognises that there is in our Constitution an obligation to recognise, in the formal phrase used in the Constitution, &ldquo;the exigencies <Col N="1969" /> of the common good&rdquo; or in the phrase put forward there today by the Minister &ldquo;the community bias&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I am summarising something that was more elaborate and complex but the reason I make the point is that the Minister has chosen to bring forward legislation which is self-spancelled in respect of the question of compensation.  That self-spancelling is an imposition which does not warrant being imposed because the Supreme Court clearly indicated that they are open to making a definitive interpretation.</P>

      <P>Deputy John Bruton gave me notice of his intention to raise on the Adjournment the subject matter of Question No. 30 which appeared on the Order Paper on 23 November 1988.  The matter is in order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this question is to find how a particular approach to industrial development has worked out in practice.  The approach involves selective help being given by the IDA and CTT to a certain number of individual companies which is not available, in the same fashion, to the rest of industry and I should like to know how it has worked out in practice.  Have jobs been provided in the firms selected for this special help?  Have more jobs been created as a result?  This is known as the company development approach and was initiated in the <i>White Paper on Industrial Policy</i> published on 12 July 1984.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The approach was described then as one where particularly promising firms would be identified and would commit themselves to working on a more intensive basis with the appropriate State agencies than would otherwise be the case.  They would receive extra help and time from the State agencies.  It was clearly laid down in the White Paper that this would not, however, be allowed to <Col N="1970" /> become a system in which certain selected firms would be able to draw repeatedly on State aid.  It was also made clear that it would be the responsibility of the firms themselves to develop any proposals for new products and to ensure that there was not unfair selectivity in regard to firms who were well placed with the IDA compared to others.  It was required in the White Paper that a list of the companies so selected would be submitted to the Department of Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism &mdash; now the Department of Industry and Commerce &mdash; on a six monthly basis with a statement of the reasons for those companies being selected.</P>
    <P>That approach was initiated by the IDA following the publication of the White Paper and it was adopted by the incoming Government in 1987 in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>.  Without the detail which was in the original White Paper, the Government said that there would be a market-oriented and technological development of the indigenous sector with, as a priority, the expansion and growth of selected Irish companies firmly rooted in the economy.  The IDA referred to this in their annual report for 1986 as a programme which, in conjunction with these companies, would act as a catalyst to stimulate company mergers to identify and implement new, strategic development initiatives.</P>
    <P>The whole idea is that certain companies are getting selective help.  Deputies of my party wanted to find out at Question Time yesterday whether this new approach has worked and if new jobs have been created in the firms in question.  Two questions were put down, one in the name of Deputy Griffin and the other in the name of Deputy Flanagan. Deputy Griffin asked the number employed in these selected firms &mdash; there are 200 &mdash; at present and the number employed at the time the programme commenced.  A similar question was put by Deputy Flanagan who asked the number of jobs which had been created since the inception of the programme under the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> in the firms selected for special <Col N="1971" /> treatment and the number of jobs lost in the same firms.  While the Minister gave quite an informative answer in some respects, he told us that 200 companies in all had been selected, that the IDA and State agencies were working on an intensive basis with about 40 of these at any given time, he failed to give any answer to Questions Nos. 21 and 30 which asked for specific details about the number of jobs that had been created and lost since the firms were selected.</P>
    <P>It is important for the House to assess whether industrial policy is working and this company development approach was urged very forcibly by the IDA who regarded it as a particularly important industrial policy initiative.  It was included by me in the then Government's White Paper because the IDA believed it would deliver the goods but I am very suspicious of the fact that although the Minister answered all the other questions he did not give any details about the number of jobs created in these firms.  I can understand why he would not wish to identify the names of the firms, for confidential and commercial reasons, but I cannot understand why he does not know how many jobs have been created or lost in the firms in question, particularly in view of the fact that it was provided in the <i>White Paper on Industrial Policy</i> that a list of these firms would be submitted to the Department of Industry and Commerce. The Minister knows which firms are involved and the IDA should certainly know, if they are working intensively with the firms, whether they are creating or destroying jobs.</P>
    <P>Deputy Reynolds, the then Minister for Industry and Commerce, answered all the questions yesterday about the selective programme for specially chosen firms but did not give any information about how many jobs had been created or lost in those firms.  It indicated that this programme may not have been such a great success and that the IDA are perhaps using the Minister to gloss over the relative failure of the programme to create jobs.  That may not be the case and <Col N="1972" /> I would be very happy to discover from the Minister of State that he has information about the number of jobs in these firms before they were selected and the present number of jobs.</P>
    <P>I sincerely hope the Minister will not say he does not have the information or that it is not the practice of the Department to look for that type of information. The question was put down, accepted as being in order and it should be answered. The IDA adopted this programme in order to create jobs.  If the Minister cannot get information from the IDA on whether the programme is creating jobs, it is a very dubious programme.  The IDA are not noted for their modesty in the matter of giving information about job creation.  If the information is in line with their policy stance at a given time they are more than happy to make announcements about job creation.  What I find rather odd is that in regard to the company development approach the Minister gave no information even though he had four day's notice of the two questions from Deputy Brendan Griffin and Deputy Charles Flanagan.</P>
    <P>I hope this debate will allow the Minister, in addition to giving information on the number of jobs created and lost in the 200 selected firms, to give an indication as to whether in practice, in the light of those figures, the approach is working.  If the Minister tells us that virtually no net jobs have been created in the firms in question it would be only right that he and his Department should question whether the company development approach is working at all and whether the IDA should not revert to a more arms length approach of simply dealing with all applications on their merits without getting involved in any selective arrangements with individual firms.  I hope the Minister of State, Deputy Brennan, will have the information that the Minister, Deputy Reynolds, did not have yesterday. I will conclude by thanking you, a Cheann Comhairle, for giving me the opportunity of raising this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Mr. S. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Company Development Programme was originally developed by the Industrial Development Authority in association with McKinsey &amp; Co., acting as consultants to the IDA, in response to the clearly identified need to encourage indigenous firms to develop commercially viable, long-term strategic business plans.  As Deputy Bruton knows, the essence of the company development approach is for staff from IDA and other agencies, using their sectoral and business knowledge, to stimulate, in a non-directive way, development initiatives by the company.  The programme is not directly concerned with job creation, rather with assessing a company's strengths and weaknesses, its competitive position in the market and the means whereby that position can be strengthened.  That is the initial focus of the programme.</P>
      <P>Initiatives which have been introduced by companies participating in the programme include: changes in management structure; bringing in new management expertise, especially in the areas of marketing and product development; changes in marketing strategy; improved production systems and broadening the product range.  While the programme by its very nature is concerned with a firm's long-term development, it has been found that companies which participated in the programme in the initial stages have performed consistently better than mainstream indigenous industry in terms of maintaining employment, sales growth and profitability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The programme commenced in 1985 and by end 1987,200 companies of which three-quarters are Irish owned, had undertaken formal company development programmes.  Up to 40 companies normally participate in the programme at any one time.  Currently, because the programme is now being operated on a more selective basis, 30 companies are participating.  The Deputy will appreciate that this number is not static as at any one time because some companies commence and some finish the programme.  To quote <Col N="1974" /> figures on the numbers employed in these 30 firms under the programme is not therefore particularly meaningful.</P>
    <P>With the publication of the Government's <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> which highlighted the weaknesses of the indigenous manufacturing sector and the need to take more active measures to promote its development, the scope and content of the programme was substantially refined with effect from the beginning of 1988.  It was found on examination that while companies participating in the programme had benefited from the opportunity provided to examine their company's operations, many of the companies chosen did not have a clear development potential.  It was also found that too much attention had been given to the development of company plans and not enough to the implementation of these plans and that has been changed.</P>
    <P>A completely new Irish industry directorate was set up to bring a more creative and specialist approach to the challenge of securing more investment, exports and jobs from mainstream Irish industry. Within the directorate a separate division was established to focus exclusively on the company development programme. The establishment of a separate company development division with specialist staff, resources and expertise will ensure that all of the development programmes are carried out to the highest professional standard.  I would point out that this programme in its initial format was originally introduced by Deputy Bruton.</P>
    <P>The incentive package has been restructured to provide support for the agreed strategic development needs of companies.  The key changes introduced this year are: less support for fixed asset investment; a switch in grants from operation training to management development; greater emphasis on new product development/acquisition and in conjunction with CTT, greater support for strategic market-led initiatives by companies.</P>
    <P>As I have already indicated, the initial phase of the programme was found to <Col N="1975" /> have given rise to some very worthwhile initiatives but there was a lack of selectivity in the companies chosen to participate. With effect from this year the programme has been completely revamped, a new division has been established and new incentives have been introduced. It is too early at this stage to say how effective the revised programme will be in maintaining and creating jobs in indigenous firms.</P>
    <P>I would expect, however, that with the greater selectivity that is now being operated and the vastly improved business environment, created by the Government's fiscal and economic policies, a much more positive outturn can be expected from the programme.  Next year the Minister for Industry and Commerce will be carrying out a detailed review of industrial performance as required under the Industrial Development Act, 1986, during the course of which he will examine the outcome of the company development programme to-date.  The results of this review will be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>I would like to take the opportunity to comment on the press statement issued yesterday by Deputy John Bruton in relation to industrial job creation.  No reference is made in Deputy Bruton's statement to the results of the labour force survey for mid-April 1988 which show a stabilisation in manufacturing employment with an increase of 10,000 jobs in services over the previous year. The labour force survey, by its nature, is more likely to pick up the impact of employment increases in small manufacturing firms which have been performing particularly well this year as evidenced by recent reports and surveys <Col N="1976" /> from the State industrial development agencies and the Small Firms Association.</P>
    <P>Sample surveys conducted by the State industrial development agencies show that close to 15,000 jobs were created in industry and international services in the first nine months of 1988, a figure which is running ahead of performance for the comparable period in recent years.  The offsetting industrial job losses for the same period are not yet available but the major improvement in the economic climate should make existing jobs more secure.</P>
    <P>I would also wish to point out that the reference in the report of the Central Bank used by Deputy Bruton was rather selective.  The Central Bank's report, in fact, pointed to the improving performance in manufacturing employment anticipated for 1988 as a whole and forecast a modest increase in employment in manufacturing in 1989 as a result of the expected improvement in economic activity.  Although this would be the first such increase since 1980, it was disappointing that Deputy Bruton overlooked this fact.</P>

      <P>At present, plans are in hand to make natural gas available to the horticultural sector in north County Dublin.  This will be achieved via a spurline to the area from the north-eastern pipeline.  To date, Bord Gáis Éireann have concluded gas supply contracts with 20 growers in the area covering a heated glasshouse area of 51.6 acres.</P>
      <P>The estimated cost of this project is about £1.5 million.  I expect that the board will shortly give their final approval and that natural gas will be available to growers in north County Dublin in time for the 1989-90 growing season.</P>
      <P>As regards the promotion of the use of natural gas in the horticultural industry nationally, I must say that realistically such a development is unlikely to occur outside of areas which are adjacent to the natural gas grid.  However, BGE are always prepared to consider supplying particular locations where it is economically feasible to do so.</P>

      <P>The proportion of private planting to public <Col N="1914" /> planting has increased substantially in recent years.  In 1988 the level of private planting will, I believe, reach 5,000 hectares. This is equivalent to 50 per cent of public planting.  I expect the level of private planting to increase further in future years, both in terms of the area planted and as a proportion of the overall national planting programme embracing the public and private sectors.</P>
      <P>Given the relatively small area of land under forest in Ireland, as compared with our European Community partners, it is evident that a major national planting programme, both public and private, will be required over the coming years.

Apartment block leaks have dropped steadily to one per 19 buildings surveyed, almost twice as good as the criterion of one per ten buildings laid down by the Task Force on Multi-Storey Buildings.</P>
      <P>Surveys of public buildings, bridges and network valves have also been carried out.  The frequency of these surveys is in excess of the requirements of any of the safety reports.</P>
      <P>Gas lost from the Dublin Gas network is now less than 5 million therms per year, that is about 6 per cent of gas issued, and still improving.  This means that the task force requirement of reducing lost gas to 2,000 therms per kilometre of main per year has already been comfortably achieved.</P>
      <P>The number of publicly reported escapes in Dublin has continued to decline steadily, and now averages less than 400 per week, about half the early 1987 level.  The current level of PREs is equivalent to eight PREs per kilometre of main per year, which is the task force target.  During 1987, 70 per cent of all network leaks were Class 1.  The corresponding figure in 1988 has dropped to 40 per cent.  Class 2 leaks now account for about 40 per cent of network leaks and Class 3 leaks now account for about 18 per cent.  This leak classification profile has shown steady improvement over the past year, and is now in line with international norms.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The present position is that the rates of EC recoupment for each <Col N="1920" /> scheme are fixed under the individual EC Regulations.  As long as the rates remain at those levels, therefore, it is possible to obtain additional amounts by way of recoupment only if additional Exchequer expenditure is undertaken in the first instance.</P>
      <P>However, the various FEOGA guidance measures will now fall to be reviewed in the light of the decisions being taken on the future levels and operation of the Structural Funds.  It is expected that the EC Commission will be bringing forward proposals for revision of these measures over the coming months and that these will include proposals for adjustment of rates of recoupment to take account of the decisions of the European Council in February last. Until decisions are reached on the revision of the individual measures it is not possible to quantify the additional amounts that may be recoupable under particular schemes.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The standardisation of the fuel schemes involved the setting up of a single national scheme with uniform criteria in place of the separate national and urban schemes which previously existed and the extension of fuel allowances for the first time in 1987 to 30,000 recipients of long-term unemployment assistance.</P>
      <P>Payments to the 68,000 beneficiaries under the urban schemes were invariably made on a weekly basis along with their basic social welfare payment.  Payments to the long-term unemployed in the 1987-88 heating season were also made weekly.  Payments from the health boards under the previous national scheme were, for administrative reasons, generally made by cheque in two instalments over the course of the heating season.</P>
      <P>There were no complaints about the payment of fuel allowances on a weekly basis where this applied under the previous arrangements.  It is not acepted that the change to weekly payment for those persons who transfer from the previous national scheme represents any disadvantage. On the contrary, the new system ensures that qualified persons will in future receive their fuel allowance promptly at the start of the heating season and regularly each week during the season along with their basic payment, thus enabling them to gear their expenditure to this pattern of payments.</P>

      <P>The rate support grant replaces in part the income from rates formerly applicable to domestic dwellings and agricultural land.  This income varies from local authority to local authority, because of differences in valuation levels and in the rate poundages applied by councils over the years.  These variations together with variations arising from other changes in local finances in recent years, including the abolition of certain levies and the termination of liability for certain local loans fund repayments, are reflected in differences in the rate support grant allocations for individual local authorities.</P>

      <P>The Poisons Regulations 1982-86 provide stringent controls in relation to paraquat. The sale of this substance is restricted to pharmacies and outlets licensed by health boards.  It may be sold only for use in agriculture, horticulture or forestry and may be sold only to a person who is known by the seller or who is certified in a manner provided for in the regulations as being a person entitled to purchase such preparation.  A record must be kept of each sale and such record must include the name and address of the purchaser and the purpose for which it is required.  Paraquat must also be sold in its original sealed container.  It must have the word &ldquo;poison&rdquo; legibly written on the label and also the following warning:</P>
      <P>Keep out of the reach of children.</P>

      <P>I would refer the Deputy to my reply to Question No. 96 on 10 November in relation to a needle exchange programme. As I stated in that reply one-to-one contact with drug abusers through Outreach programmes is fundamental in order to advise and educate such persons about intravenous drug abuse, AIDS and risk behaviour.  Other measures such as methadone maintenance, needle exchange, and condom distribution may be effective only if a properly structured counselling programme is in place.  The <Col N="1929" /> Department of Health is keeping all of these issues under review in the light of the implementation of the Eastern Health Board's Outreach Programme and the outcome of experience abroad. These were also the views expressed by the Deputy Chief Medical Officer in the media report referred to.  The results of needle exchange programmes conducted abroad are, to date, inconclusive in relation to their capacity to reduce the spread of AIDS among drug abusers.  It is relevant to note also that the EC strategy has developed in this area emphasising the key role of counselling intravenous drug abusers in relation to their life style and at risk behaviour.</P>

I am not at present in a position to authorise any further increase in the committee's allocation of teaching staff.</P>
    <P>The organisation of the committee's educational programme and the deployment of its teaching resources are matters to be determined by the committee itself within the parameters of the authorised allocation.</P>

      <P>The Planning Officer for Kildare County Council had indicated recently that the location of the first stage of the permanent building for Confey Community College was contrary to the guidelines of the council.  This matter has now been resolved by County Kildare VEC to the satisfaction of the Planning Officer.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Education in view of the fact that certain American universities provide a notetaker and an interpreter for deaf students and that a given American university attended by a person (details <Col N="1936" /> supplied) in Dublin 16 provides full facilities for the deaf and given that there are no such university facilities in Ireland, if she will make a reasonable grant available to the person in question and other people in this category.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Education the reason for the delay in sanctioning the extension of two classrooms at Knockraha national school, County Cork; when sanction will be given; when it will reach tender stage; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason for the delay in sanctioning the extension to Knockraha national school, County Cork, is set out in the reply which I gave the Deputy to his question of 31 May 1988.  The position has not significantly changed since then in relation to my Department's 1988 capital allocation for the national schools building programme, and accordingly I am not in a position to give a timetable for sanctioning the extension or seeking tenders for the project.  In so far as it may be possible to help the school authorities to provide essential suitable classroom accommodation, their application for grant-aid is being considered in connection with my Department's 1989 capital allocation for the national schools building programme, in conjunction with other applications of a similar nature.</P>
