      <P>asked the Taoiseach if any damage has been done to the music collection in the National Museum in the last number of years; if he has satisfied himself regarding the present condition of the instruments; the plans he has for the continued preservation of these instruments; and the provision he has made for the control of the atmosphere of this music room.</P>

      <P>In the course of works to create the Music Room in 1983, some damage was done to a keyboard instrument &mdash; a crack in the lid was increased slightly.  During the course of the present renovations, the Music Room has had to be closed but I am satisfied that the collection is in safe condition.  It will be on display again next year when the room is re-opened.  The necessary atmosphere control is being provided.</P>

      <P>Tá ceist na saoráidí calaíochta ar na hoileáin i gceist faoi chaibidil ag mo Roinnse le tamall anuas.</P>
      <P>Faoi mar is eol don Teachta, ceadaíodh deontas £575,000 níos luaithe i mbliana chun piara nua agus tonnchosc a thógáil ag an gCaladh Mór, Inis Meáin.  Tá athrú tagtha ar an scéal ó shin, ar ndóigh, toisc costas measta na hoibre a bhí beartaithe a bheith méadaithe go mór agus, mar thoradh ar sin, tá riachtanais chalaíochta an oileáin á mheas ath-uair ag na hoileánaigh féin.  Tuigim go raibh cruinniú poiblí ar an oileán an tseachtain seo caite chun an cheist seo a phlé agus déanfar an togra uile a athmheas i gcomhairle le hOifig na nOibreacha Poiblí ach iarratas ar a riachtanais a fháil ó na hoileánaigh.</P>
      <P>Tá togra faoi bhráid mo Roinne-se le tamall anuas i ndáil le síneadh a chur leis an bpiara ar Inis Oírr, ach ag féachaint don chostas ollmhór a bheadh i gceist, níl ar ár gcumas dul ar aghaidh leis an togra, faoi láthair ar aon nós.  Coimeádfar an cheist faoi mheas, ar ndóigh, agus má bhíonn dóchas ann ar ball go mbeidh leor-soláthar airgid ar fáil do mo Roinnse chun tabhairt faoi obair ag an áit seo, déanfar an cheist iomlán a mheas ath-uair i gcomhairle le hOifig na nOibreacha Poiblí, a fheidhmíonn mar chomhairleoirí do mo Roinnse i gcásanna dá leithéid agus a ullmhaíonn na pleananna cuí, etc.</P>

      <P>I gcás Inis Meáin bhí £575,000 ceadaithe agus ansin rinne Bord na nOibreacha Poiblí athmheas ar na meastacháin agus shocraigh siad go mbeadh £300,000 eile ag teastáil leis an obair go léir a dhéanamh ar an gCaladh Mór.  Ansin d'ardaigh agóid san oileán féin: ní raibh muintir an oileáin sásta dul ar aghaidh leis an gCaladh Mór, agus bhí cruinniú cúpla oíche ó shin ar an oileán agus tá siad ag chur in aghaidh na hoibre sin ar fad.  Teastaíonn uathu go dtógfaí an ché sa taobh thoir den oileán.  Sin an áit a bhfuil an deacracht i láthair na huaire.  Níl a fhios ag muintir an oileáin céard a theastaíonn uathu.  Dá bhrí sin ní bheidh sé ar chumas Roinn na Gaeltachta dul chun cinn le haon obair ansin go mbeidh a fhios go díreach céard a theastaíonn ó mhuintir an oileáin iad féin.  I gcás Inis Oírr, mar atá ráite agam, tá costas an-mhór i gceist agus ní bheidh ar chumas mo Roinnse tús a chur le hobair ar bith ansin ag an bpointe seo.</P>

Ach is é an deacracht atá ag Roinn na Gaeltachta go bhfuil sé sin ag brath ar chomhairle ón Roinn Airgeadais agus ó Roinn na nOibreacha Poiblí, agus ní raibh siadsan sásta leis na moltaí atá á gcur insteach ag muintir an oileáin féin maidir leis an togra seo.

    <Speaker pid="PatrickOMalley" hpid="Mr. P. O'Malley Mr. P. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he has satisfied himself regarding the present position whereby only accident and emergency cases can now be dealt with by most Dublin hospitals; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon) Rory O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied that hospitals in Dublin are capable of fulfilling their obligations to the accident and emergency system and of providing a satisfactory level of service to others who need access to an acute hospital.  Admissions from accident and emergency departments account for only half of admissions to acute hospitals in Dublin.  However, I have asked the Eastern Health Board to establish a steering group representing the hospitals on the Dublin accident and emergency roster and work has already commenced on an examination of how the system might be improved.</P>
      <P>I should also point out to the Deputy that only a very small proportion of those who attend A &amp; E departments need admission to a hospital bed.  The Deputy should also be aware that increasingly many of those requiring acute hospital treatment are dealt with in outpatient departments or on a day basis and those are unaffected by the A &amp; E system.</P>
      <P>Finally I should say that I am concerned that hospital accident and emergency departments, especially in urban areas, are used by those who may not really need the services of an acute hospital. I am examining how general practitioners could relieve the burden placed on hospitals.  I intend also to highlight the extent to which accidents which could be avoided contribute to the workload of hospitals.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister is satisfied that there is no problem why is it that he asked the health board to establish a committee?  Has the Minister given the committee a time limit by which they must bring their deliberations to a conclusion? Is the Minister aware that the Mater Hospital in Dublin have put 390 of their 450 beds at the disposal of the accident and emergency services?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy was listening to me she would have heard me say that I was concerned about how accident and emergency departments are being used.  Obviously, I am concerned at the numbers who have been attending accident and emergency departments and the impact that accidents and emergencies are having on the admission policies in hospitals.  However, I am satisfied that there are sufficient beds available to deal with essential cases that do not enter hospital through accident and emergency departments.  In fact, marginally more than 50 per cent of the beds in the six major Dublin hospitals are available for patients who do not enter through accident and emergency departments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister ask the committee to bring their deliberations to a conclusion by the end of December?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously, I will be monitoring what is going on and I will be receiving reports.  I am anxious that the committee come forward with a satisfactory solution.  Certainly, I am anxious that they expedite their work but it is more important that they do their job efficiently and if that takes more time, then so be it.  I should like to add that since January I received regular reports on what is happening in the six major hospitals, the three on the north side, Beaumont, the Mater and the James Connolly Memorial Hospital, and the three on the south side, the Meath, St. Vincent's and St. James's.  I am looking at various improvements that might be made to increase the efficiency of the accident and emergency services and to <Col N="1351" /> ensure that more people can be treated as outpatients.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that a number of consultants and GPs have been obliged to send patients through A &amp; E departments because they have no hope of getting an elective admission to the general surgical areas of the hospitals?  Is the Minister aware that this is the only way they have of getting a bed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>While I am aware that that is happening I do not accept that it is the only resort they have.  I have indicated that more than 50 per cent of the beds are available for normal inpatient admissions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one hospital available on the south side and one on the north side from 5 p.m. each evening until the following morning to cater for the catchment areas on the north and south side.  That has the effect of relieving pressure on the other two hospitals because of the high workload through their accident and emergency departments. I have an open mind on whether all the hospitals should be open to cater for their own catchment areas or not and I hope the committee investigating the accident and emergency services will look at that.  I am satisfied that the service is sufficient to cater for the catchment areas but I am a little concerned that patients may find themselves in different hospitals; for example that a person suffering from bronchial asthma might find himself or herself in three different <Col N="1352" /> hospitals over the course of a short period of time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>This proposal is under consideration by my Department in consultation with the health board.  The Deputy will appreciate that the scope for developing additional services is limited, since new services can be financed only by re-allocation from other areas but I recognise that the efforts of this voluntary group merits sympathetic consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am relieved to hear that the project has not been abandoned.  The Minister will be aware that a meeting took place between representatives of the group and the CEO of the South Eastern Health Board on 1 September and that the information given at that meeting was that the project would not go ahead.  Is the Minister aware that it was stated at that meeting that the amount of capital moneys available for the project, as indicated by the Minister's predecessor, Deputy Desmond, would not be available and that the moneys raised by the group by voluntary contributions in Wexford would be channelled into another project? Indeed, I am relieved to hear that the project is ongoing.  Would the Minister give us an update on the position and say whether there is a firm commitment to the provision of such a centre in Enniscorthy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>The South Eastern Health Board have indicated to the Department that the provision of a residential facility for mentally handicapped adults is their current priority in the development of services for the mentally handicapped in County Wexford and that there needs to be an outlet for adolescents at present in the child centre at <Col N="1353" /> St. John of Gods, Enniscorthy.  Obviously, the question of providing funds for the commissioning of such a residential unit will be considered in the context of the finance available for the development of services for the mentally handicapped generally.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister if he is making a commitment to the Dawn group and to the people of County Wexford that he is well disposed to the provision of this centre?  Obviously, the money cannot be provided out of the funds of the South Eastern Health Board as it is a major capital development.  Will the Minister guarantee that he will consider favourably this project in the immediate future?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am well disposed to this project.  I recognise that the Dawn organisation have raised over £100,000 themselves and I compliment them on that.  However, the final decision will have to be made in the light of the funding available for mentally handicapped services generally.</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of the acute shortage of residential facilities for the adult mentally handicapped in County Wexford?  The child centre at St. John of Gods in Enniscorthy cannot take in any more because the places are filled by residents who are now adults.  Will the Minister ensure that within the capital programme to be allocated to the South Eastern Health Board, a commitment is made to commence this project in 1989? Will he also clarify whether it will be a multi-purpose residential unit or a unit exclusively for the mentally handicapped?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have said, I am aware that the South Eastern Health Board consider the provision of a facility for mentally handicapped adults as a priority in the development of their services for the mentally handicapped.  I will keep that in mind.  I am aware of the work that St. John of Gods in Enniscorthy and Summerhill House are doing but I accept <Col N="1354" /> that the South Eastern Health Board see it as a priority in the development of their service.  However, the funding depends on the funding generally available for mentally handicapped services.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am gratified by the Minister's clarification of the question.  May I ask him whether he will indicate directly to the Dawn group that he is well disposed to the project and that the £150,000 now available from voluntary contributions in County Wexford for this project will at least be well matched by public funds in the immediate future.</P>

      <P>I would not like to mislead the Deputy.  I did not say that the funds will be well matched but that I was well disposed to the project and will be considering it in the light of the allocations. I have no doubt that if I were to write to the Dawn group in County Wexford, they would have heard already from Deputies Howlin and Yates as well as Deputies Hugh Byrne and Browne that I was well disposed to the project.</P>

    <P>It is agreed between the managements of the health services and the IMO that there is considerable scope to improve the cost-effectiveness of prescribing by giving clear guidance to doctors in the <Col N="1355" /> appropriate use of drugs and the relative cost and therapeutic benefits of the very many drugs which are available, many of them in multiple forms.</P>
    <P>I am not yet in receipt of the finalised work of the group and, as the Deputy will appreciate, I cannot therefore make any detailed comments on the contents of the proposed formulary.</P>
    <P>It has been agreed that co-operation in the implementation of the formulary on lines to be agreed between my Department and the IMO will form part of the terms of the new GMS doctor's contract. I am confident, therefore, that the benefits of more cost-effective prescribing will be experienced throughout the GMS. The operation of the formulary will be closely monitored and arrangements for the supply of drugs can be modified as necessary in the light of experience.</P>
    <P>While the formulary working group derives from the GMS negotiations, the formulary will, I hope, prove a useful guide for economic and cost conscious prescribing in general practice as a whole.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister not accept that a fundamental weakness in achieving major reforms in the cost of drugs &mdash; which we all want to see and which have emerged from the negotiations which are welcomed but costly &mdash; is that the formulary is voluntary rather than obligatory?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept that viewpoint.  I am very pleased that we will have a formulary, even though it is many years late.  I consider doctors to have the right to prescribe what they believe is in the best interest of a patient.  I do not think we should interfere with that right lightly but doctors have a responsibility to be economic in their prescribing, all things being equal.  I hope, now that they have a formulary, that they will prescribe efficiently and at the same time economically and use generic products where such are suitable for the treatment of individual patients.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister accept, <Col N="1356" /> arising out of his reply, that the only difference in respect of some generic and branded products is that the generics do not have to bear the research and development costs?  They are equally good, if not better drugs, within their range.  Is the Minister aware that within some areas consultant physicians are operating formularies very successfully while in other areas they are not?  Will he try to bring uniformity to this area as soon as possible?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that there are many generic products which are equal in efficacy to a proprietary brand of drug. I consider that doctors have an obligation to look at their prescribing habits, and while ensuring in the interests of their patients that their prescribing is efficient, that they be satisfied also as to the economics of their prescribing.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Health if his attention has been drawn to a proposal from the management of the Southern Health Board to locate maternity services for the Cork region on the site of the Erinville ear, nose and throat complex which involved capital investment while adequate facilities with ancillary services are available at the existing St. Finbarr's Hospital, which, if continued would mean one less hospital for the board to administer; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>There is agreement in principle that maternity services in Cork should be located on a single campus. The possibility of concentrating facilities on the St. Finbarr's site was examined by a committee representative of the Department and the Southern Health Board.  However, the capital cost of that option was considerably greater than <Col N="1358" /> developing a maternity service on the Erinville-Eye, Ear and Throat Hospital site.  The Eye, Ear and Throat Hospital will be made available to the Southern Health Board following the transfer of ophthalmic services to the Cork Regional Hospital which is taking place at present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister sufficiently informed when he states that representatives of his Department and the management of the Southern Health Board have considered this matter when, in fact, it was stated at a health board meeting that this move was initiated by the management of the Southern Health Board?  We were told in the Bantry and Mallow areas that all the accommodation would be provided in St. Finbarr's Hospital where there are 75 beds and all the ancillary services, for example, the blood bank, laundry facilities and so on. We were told that it was proposed to take over that hospital and to have maternity services there as well as in the Erinville Hospital which is on a different site in the Western Road in Cork and where there are no parking facilities.  In the St. Finbarr's Hospital area there is sufficient parking accommodation and all the ancillary services.  Would the Minister agree that this change is a wanton waste of public money?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCoy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he will make general practitioners more aware of the financial incentives to improve their surgeries so that they can undertake many routine tests and thus relieve much of the pressure on hospitals; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>Under existing agreements with general practitioners in the GMS scheme, health boards may give grants towards the provision of new practice premises or for the improvement or extension of existing premises.  In assessing applications for grants the health boards will have regard to the size of the doctors' list of patients, the nature and extent of existing accommodation and alternative facilities already provided by the health boards in the area.</P>
      <P>On the matter of the transfer of routine tests and treatments from general hospitals to the general practice environment, I am confident that the new arrangements for doctors participating in the GMS scheme, due for implementation on 1 January 1989, contains the necessary structures and incentives to support such transfers, where appropriate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>First, would the Minister agree that in addition to the grants available through the health boards, the tax incentives available through the tax system are not widely known by GPs and that if they were more publicised many GPs might be more willing to improve their facilities?  Secondly, would the Minister agree that certain tests, for <Col N="1361" /> example, cardiographs, blood and chest tests could be carried out in a doctor's surgery for about 20 per cent of the cost of doing the same tests in hospital?</P>

      <P>In relation to the second question I agree that there is a number of procedures which in the interests of patients should be carried out at general practice level and would also be economically worthwhile from the point of view of the use of the hospital resource, including the tests referred to by the Deputy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>While I do not have the specific details of how the £3 million will be spent I can say that there will be investment to provide additional resources for the employment of support staff, in practice, for continuing education to update skills and for the purchase of appropriate equipment.  A committee are sitting at present under the chairmanship of Professor Sexton of the ESRI to look at what tests might be appropriate to give a special fee to the <Col N="1362" /> practitioner which would have the effect referred to earlier by Deputy Harney, of having tests carried out at general practitioner level rather than at the hospital.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I would not accept the latter part of the question.  I believe that doctors will decide what they are competent to do in their own surgery. There is scope for a lot of tests to be carried out in the doctor's surgery which are not carried out there at present.  I share the concern of Deputy Howlin that doctors are becoming more conscious of litigation and that there is quite a lot of investigation carried out that may not necessarily be in the best interest of medical practice as a whole.  This is something to which we must address ourselves but I am not sure there is any good answer to it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>The measures taken to combat the spread of AIDS in Ireland can be summarised as follows: epidemiological monitoring of the infection; screening of blood and blood products; training for health care staff and the provision of relevant information to these staff; public information programmes, employing television, radio and printed media; expansion of the sexually transmitted diseases services; funding of voluntary agencies working in the area of AIDS; provision of education about <Col N="1363" /> AIDS in schools; and expansion of services for IV drug abusers with particular emphasis on one-to-one contact and counselling through &ldquo;Outreach&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>My Department has been monitoring the spread of HIV infection and the specific measures outlined above have been implemented to take account of the specific epidemiology of AIDS in Ireland where spread through IV drug abuse is significant.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the necessary available measures have been taken in Ireland.  Surveys carried out idicate a high level of knowledge among the public about AIDS.  Four hundred and fifty thousand pounds of lottery funds have been spent on special AIDS projects this year.  This money has allowed a considerable expansion of the services available for HIV infected people.  New STD clinics have been opened.  Additional counselling services have been provided. The services of voluntary agencies have been expanded because of the grants of lottery money.</P>
      <P>A new Outreach service developed to enable one-to-one contact to be made with IV drug abusers is now being operated by the Eastern Health Board. Officials of my Department attend a number of international fora including WHO, EC and Council of Europe groups to participate in and to keep abreast of developments in the monitoring, treatment or prevention of AIDS which are emerging internationally and which could be adopted here.  While we can never say that we are satisfied that enough has been done either nationally or internationally to stop the spread of AIDS, I am satisfied that we have made very real progress, particularly in the last year, in developing our AIDS treatment and prevention strategies.</P>

      <P>A public information programme was carried out in May 1987 through television, radio and newspaper advertising, and a booklet and free phone service were available, at a total cost of £500,000.  Public knowledge about AIDS is being reinforced through a mass media programme and on a more individual level the personal worries and queries of individuals have been addresed through a detailed booklet and a free phone service. The booklet is available through pharmacies, public health clinics and doctors, and the telephone service will continue for the present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of what survey was carried out, following that information programme a survey was carried out by the Health Education Bureau to determine the effectiveness of the programme. A clear majority of people considered it very good in helping them to understand AIDS.  In general, changes in people's <Col N="1366" /> knowledge about AIDS were in the desired direction and there was an improvement in people's knowledge of the modes of transmission of AIDS. These findings were confirmed by a survey conducted by Lansdowne Market Research Ltd. for the <i>Sunday Press.</i></P>
    <P>On the question of those most at risk, we would regard drug abusers as one such group who are most at risk and, as I have already stated in the main reply to the question, various measures have been taken in an effort to reach drug abusers in a one-to-one way and the national coordinating committee on drugs, of which my colleague the Minister of State, Deputy Leyden, is chairman, are watching this situation very closely and, in particular, I would refer to the Outreach programme being operated by the Eastern Health Board.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister not agree that the biggest failure of the AIDS programme in relation to the combat and spread of AIDS has been its failure to reach target groups such as intravenous drug users?  Would he consider looking again at some of the Outreach programmes and the lack of co-ordination with voluntary organisations who are trying to do valuable work in this area because there seems to be a lack of co-ordination in this area at present?</P>

      <P>I accept that it is very difficult to reach drug abusers but I am satisfied that much excellent work has been carried out in the past year as a result of funding provided from the national lottery &mdash; a sum of £450,000 &mdash; to bodies such as the Eastern Health Board for their Outreach programme and to a number of voluntary bodies who are working with drug abusers and are in a position to reach them in a one-to-one way.  This is necessary because, as we all accept, advertising public information programmes through the mass media is not very effective in reaching some of the people who are most at risk.</P>

      <P>The Minister indicated that a considerable sum was spent on <Col N="1367" /> the initial publicity campaign in May last year.  In view of the frightening figures he has given for deaths and positive blood tests, is it his intention to establish an ongoing campaign to reinforce the notion that AIDS is an ever-present threat to the well being and health of the community? There is a complacency about AIDS. Everybody was aware of it last year but because the public end of the campaign has stopped, people seem to think that the problem has been overcome.  Will the Minister consider establishing an ongoing powerful campaign to underscore the dreadful consequences of this disease for this country?</P>

      <P>There is an ongoing campaign, perhaps not of the mass media nature that we had in 1987.  Part of the money allocated to the EHB is being used in a private community based Outreach AIDS health information programme focused on drug abusers in Dublin and their contacts with their families.  A freefone service is still available and the booklet which was published is still available. This year for the first time a programme was prepared for school leavers because it is my intention and that of my colleague, the Minister for Education, that no child should leave school without knowing the facts about AIDS.  At the moment there are discussions as to the measures for long-term education so that children will be made aware of the facts about AIDS before leaving school. Before that programme got under way the directors of community care and the medical officers of the health boards in co-operation with the local school authorities ensured that such education was provided in 1988.</P>

      <P>The promised review of dental services has been carried out by a small working group under the chairmanship of my colleague, Deputy Terry Leyden, (Minister of State at my Department) and I am at present examining the findings and recommendations contained in the Working Group's report.  In regard to orthodontic services in the North Eastern Health Board the position is that the board already avail of the services of private specialist orthodontists to treat eligible patients but this is not sufficient to meet the demand for such treatment in the area.  However, the health board is assessing all cases on the waiting list and is finding that considerable numbers do not have conditions meriting the provision of treatment under the terms of the guidelines laid down by my Department.</P>
      <P>Arrangements are being made at present between the North Eastern Health Board and the Dublin Dental Hospital for the post-graduate training in orthodontics of a dental surgeon sponsored by the health board.  Under this arrangement a certain amount of orthodontic treatment will be provided in the Dublin Dental Hospital specifically for North Eastern Health Board patients. This should lead to a considerable improvement in the availability of orthodontic treatment for North Eastern Health Board patients.</P>

Is the Minister also aware that there are many serious cases on that waiting list and that although I have made every effort to have the orthodontist see them and have them treated, I have failed?</P>

Arrangements are being made between the North Eastern Health board and the Dublin dental hospital for the training of a postgraduate dentist in orthodontics, and that will help to alleviate the situation. It is important to remind the House that when advertisements were placed for five orthodontists to cover the eight health board areas, only one post was filled because of the unavailability of orthodontists to take up the other four posts.</P>

      <P>In view of the waiting time outlined by my colleague, Deputy Boylan, does the Minister agree that the waiting time is entirely unsatisfactory, particularly as during that time malformation is taking place in young people's teeth and gums so that by the time these patients are reached the malformations will be beyond correction? Would the Minister agree that it is a little foolish to talk about training dentists &mdash; although that is a good thing for those who will come along in a few years time &mdash; and that it is not a sufficient remedy for those who are on the waiting list now? If the Minister does not get in private dentists or dentists from Northern Ireland a whole generation will have malformed teeth.</P>

      <P>We are talking about <Col N="1371" /> the orthodontic services.  There are dentists in the public service and this is a question of training a dentist to do orthodontic work.  I consider it unacceptable that people have to wait for an orthodontic service but as the House is aware four health boards were unable to recruit orthodontists when they advertised for established posts.  The North Eastern Health board are taking a reasonable course in having an orthodontist trained in the Dublin dental hospital.  While that is happening priority cases from the North Eastern Health Board area will be attended to in the Dublin dental hospital.</P>

      <P>I have received a detailed report from the Meath Hospital on the treatment of this patient.  I regret that the patient had to spend 11 hours on a trolley awaiting admission to a hospital bed.  The report confirms that all proper medical and nursing care was provided by the hospital and that food and drink and proper bed clothing were supplied, contrary to the unfounded allegations made in the media at the time.</P>
      <P>The Meath Hospital has since September effected improvements in reception and admission of accident and emergency patients.  These include provision of a 19-bed admission ward, provision of 24-hour X-ray cover in the A and E Department when the hospital is on call, and provision of a theatre in the A and E department for minor surgical procedures.  A nurse to screen all incoming patients on a Triage basis has also been appointed.  A new A and E consultant will take up duty early in 1989.</P>

It is important to ensure the maximum co-ordination between the hospitals.  I should add in relation to the Meath and the Adelaide particularly that there will always be some difficulty by reason of having the hospitals on separate compuses until such time as they move to Tallaght Hospital.

I referred <Col N="1375" /> to some of them in my reply.  Until such time as the hospitals move to Tallaght we need a unified admissions policy and a single management.

      <P>Will the Minister clarify the statement by the management of Temple Street Hospital that during the month of September when admissions were sought to beds, as recommended by the A and E consultant, there were no beds available in Temple Street, Crumlin or Harcourt Street?  Arising out of the report he has commissioned and visits by officials, can the Minister confirm whether this is true and, if so, state what arrangements he will make to rectify the situation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been unable to establish that requests were made for beds, particularly in Our Lady's Hospital, Crumlin, on the occasions mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of recent rumours that he intends to close Temple Street and will he make a statement on that?  Will he clarify the position in relation to the atrocious facilities in the outpatient and casualty department which was on the verge of getting approval in 1986 for a £2.7 million construction programme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am well aware of the rumours and when I receive the report of the group who are looking into Temple Street I will make whatever decision is in the best interests of the children attending that hospital.  I should reiterate, in relation to the hospital itself, that there is a very high morale obtaining among the nursing staff and a very high level of patient care and that there is no evidence that doctors or nurses are placing their patients at risk.  I am well aware of statements made by consultants in the hospital.  I might also reiterate &mdash; for the benefit of the House &mdash; the type of statements made which the group must examine and deal with.  There were four main issues raised.  These were the conditions in the casualty and admissions area of the hospital which were said to be so squalid and primitive &mdash; to use the words of a consultant &mdash; that it is a matter of time only before a child dies or suffers severe brain damage.  Second, children with suspect bruising being sent home to possible violent abuse; third, children left unattended on trolleys overnight due to cutbacks and ward closures and, fourth, risks involved in transferring young patients to other Dublin hospitals by ambulance.  When those allegations were investigated before we sent the group in &mdash; when the chief medical officer went up alone &mdash; he was unable to find evidence to substantiate them.  In fact, on the question of trolleys, it appears that the hospital do not use trolleys, that beds are available in the casualty department. Those were some of the more serious allegations made against the hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the contrary I have to say that in the <i>Irish Independent</i> Catherine Troy wrote two full columns on the hospital in Temple Street and could find no cause whatsoever for concern.  Therefore it is imperative that I await the report of the group who have been sent in.  But I am satisfied that the children who attend <Col N="1379" /> Temple Street are receiving an excellent level of service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 73 and 186 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For some years past I have been concerned about the level of the dental services being provided by the health boards for eligible persons.  It was for this reason that some months ago I set up a working group under the chairmanship of the Minister of State at my Department to review health board dental services and, <Col N="1380" /> where appropriate, to make recommendations for their improvement.  I am at present examining the working group's findings and recommendations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister acknowledge that the dental service is in a shambles, that the 1979 <i>ad hoc</i> scheme &mdash; whereby medical card holders were referred to general dentists has been abolished by most health boards so that in effect there is no dental service?  Is the Minister aware that medical card holders cannot even obtain a set of dentures by way of the provisions of the health service but are told to pay £200 or £300 for them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>

      <P>As a result of that concern I requested my colleague, the Minister of State, to examine the dental services provided in the various health board areas to ascertain how they might be improved.  I am glad to note that he has made practical, sensible recommendations. We shall be ascertaining how we might implement some of these recommendations.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 30, 45, 58 and 74 together.</P>
      <P>The VHI final annual accounts for the year ended 29 February, 1988 have recently become available to me and will be presented to the Dáil shortly.</P>
      <P>As announced by me in the House on Friday last, the VHI board have appointed Mr. Noel Fox as a recovery manager to produce and implement a viable recovery and strategic plan for the next five years.  I welcome this initiative by the VHI Board.  As also announced in the House on Friday, I have appointed Mr. Fox to be a member of the VHI Board.</P>
      <P>I do not wish to comment further on VHI finances at this time.  I am not in a position yet to say what particular measures will be required to improve the VHI's financial position.  However, I should like to reassure the House and the general public that I have no reason to think that the VHI will not continue as a viable and important part of the health service structure in the future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister confirm that he received &mdash; during the summer &mdash; an application from the VHI Board to increase premia on plans A, B and C by 8 per cent and on plans D and E by 15 per cent?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I received an application from the VHI for increases to be effective from 1 December; that is the usual date.  As the House will be aware, I requested a firm of consultants to examine the VHI Board as far back as July last, to examine their present position and particularly to examine the implications of 1992 on the VHI.  Because I expected the first part of that report in October a decision was not taken on the board's application at that time.  I expect now that the recovery manager will submit an amended plan of that submitted by the VHI Board, which will be examined without delay, when we shall take whatever action we deem appropriate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister confirm that for the year ending 29 February 1988 the VHI suffered a net loss of £10 million, that is an operating loss of £17 million offset by £7 million of investment profits?  Would the Minister agree that the future viability of the VHI is now in doubt, that the VHI have indicated to him that, unless they get sanction for increases in premia of the Order I have indicated, they will be unable to continue to operate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important that I reply to the allegation by Deputy Howlin that the viability of the VHI is in doubt. I should say that the viability of the VHI is in absolutely no doubt.  As I have said, a firm of consultants were appointed in July last.  Appropriate action is being taken.  I accept that there were losses incurred.  Their annual accounts will be submitted to the Dáil in the near future. I accept that there were underwriting losses but those were met from reserves and return on investments.  Therefore there is no serious problem <i>vis-à-vis</i> the VHI.  Everything is in hand.  The VHI <Col N="1383" /> will continue to provide an excellent and valuable service to those people who wish to avail of it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. MacSharry) Ray MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. MacSharry)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to approve the terms of the Convention establishing the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency, and to enable this country to honour the financial and other obligations associated with membership of that agency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency, or MIGA for short, is the most recent member of the World Bank Group.  It was established last April and almost all the major industrial countries, including seven of our EC partners, have now joined the Agency.  Ireland is a strong supporter of the World Bank and is an active member of all affiliates.  By enabling us to ratify the MIGA Convention, this Bill will ensure that we can now participate fully in all aspects of the <Col N="1530" /> groups's operations.  The various institutions, taken as a group, offer a wide range of services and expertise.  It is intended that the activities of MIGA will complement those of the other organisations, and that conflicting priorities will be avoided.  In particular, MIGA may be seen as a link between the World Bank Group and the international business community.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will be aware, there is general agreement that foreign direct investment in developing countries enhances their capacity for growth and strengthens their economies.  Unfortunately, all too often, investment opportunities are not taken because conditions in these countries may be such as to create doubts in the minds of investors as to the security of their investments.  Also, despite the fact that many industrial countries have guarantee schemes similar to that offered by MIGA, there can still be difficulties in finding adequate insurance cover in such cases.</P>
    <P>MIGA is an attempt to remove such impediments.  It has the specific aim of encouraging investment flows to developing countries by providing insurance guarantees against non-commercial risks. Such risks can include restrictions on the transfer of currency, the expropriation of assets, the risk of war or civil disturbance and breach of contract.</P>
    <P>Guarantee schemes in isolation will not, however, produce miracles.  A favourable investment climate and appropriate policies by governments are necessary too.  In this respect, an important role which MIGA will also have, in addition to its guarantee function, will be in advising host governments on their investment laws and regulatory and other policies affecting foreign direct investment programmes.  It is also hoped that MIGA will heighten the awareness of investors to the investment opportunities offered by developing countries.</P>
    <P>The type of investments eligible for cover will include equity investment, different forms of direct investment, and medium or long-term loans made or guaranteed by owners of equity in the enterprise concerned.  Investments <Col N="1531" /> guaranteed by the agency will have to be new, a designation which covers investments made to expand an existing investment and the reinvestment of earnings which might otherwise be transferred outside the host country.  In this way, profits will be encouraged to remain in the country concerned and existing investments could well be strengthened. Guarantees can also apply to foreign capital which citizens transfer from abroad for reinvestment in their homeland, upon the joint application of the Government and the investor concerned. In this way, the return of flight capital may be encouraged.</P>
    <P>MIGA's capital base is £1.082 billion. Each member will be entitled to subscribe for a specified number of shares and, in Ireland's case, this number is 369. In terms of total cost, our subscription will amount to about IR£2.750 million at current exchange rates.  However, only 10 per cent of this amount will be paid in cash.  Both this cash element, and a further 10 per cent in promissory notes, are payable within 90 days of ratification. The balance of 80 per cent will be subject to call by the agency to meet any exceptional obligations which might arise during its early years.  As the agency is expected to conduct its activities on a sound business basis, and to meet its financing needs from premiums and fees, recourse to either the promissory notes or to the callable capital is not anticipated.  I should also add that any paid-in contribution will count as part of our official development assistance programme.</P>
    <P>It is envisaged that industrial and developing countries will be fully equal partners within the organisation of MIGA.  This is reflected in the intention that voting power will be split evenly between the two groups.  Moreover, for the first three years of MIGA's operations, while membership will still be somewhat fluid, a system of supplementary votes will ensure that the position of the minority grouping will be protected.  An important feature of MIGA's guarantee operations will be that the proposed investment must first <Col N="1532" /> be approved by the host country before any contract of guarantee may be concluded. This will give the host country an opportunity to evaluate the investment and will also ensure that it is fully in accord with its development needs.</P>
    <P>There can be no quarrel with the view that developing countries should encourage inward direct investment to the maximum extent possible, particularly in view of the burden of their debt repayments and, in many cases, their impaired creditworthiness.  Direct foreign investment offers a way for developing countries to acquire much-needed foreign exchange without adding to their debtservicing liabilities and to some extent, can fill the gap left by reduced commercial bank lending.  Of course, leaving aside the investment finance itself, there are benefits in terms of increased output and employment, not to mention the advantages attendant on the transfer of technology, modern management skills and marketing know-how.</P>
    <P>In my opening remarks, I referred to the fact that MIGA is designed to complement the activities of the other agencies in the World Bank Group.  There will be a particularly close complementarity between MIGA and the International Finance Corporation.  The IFC's objective is also to encourage direct investment in developing countries and it does this in a variety of ways &mdash; it makes equity investments in and gives loans mainly to privately-owned enterprises, it helps develop local capital markets and financial institutions and it offers technical advice to Governments on the encouragement of private investment.  Given this close complementarity between MIGA and the IFC, both agencies will co-operate fully in achieving their common aim.</P>
    <P>MIGA is a new institution and any real judgment as to its effectiveness will not be possible for some time to come.  While we should not be overly-ambitious regarding its likely achievements, at least in the early years, the main measure of its success will be the extent to which it is able to promote flows of additional <Col N="1533" /> financial resources to developing countries. Net direct investment flows to the capital importing countries peaked in 1981 at $14 billion and fell sharply to $10 billion in 1983.  They have remained at roughly that level ever since.  If MIGA helps to redress that situation, even in a small way, its creation will have been worthwhile.</P>
    <P>Before I touch on the essential provisions of the Bill, I should also like to draw Deputies' attention to the fact that under the terms of Article 29 (5) (2) of the Constitution it will be necessary for the Dáil to pass the motion, which is number 12 on today's Order Paper and which formally approves the terms of the MIGA Convention.  This will ensure that the convention is binding upon us in international law.</P>
    <P>Turning to the Bill itself, section 1 defines various terms.</P>
    <P>Section 2 provides for the approval of the terms of the convention.</P>
    <P>Section 3 contains the financial and other provisions.  In particular, subsection (2) provides for the payment out of the central fund both of our initial subscription, and of any subsequent subscriptions which might arise if the agency's capital were to be increased and we were to participate in that increase.  Subsection (3) provides for the issue of promissory notes.  Subsection (4) provides for the disposal of any moneys received under the convention, for example, the refund of any moneys paid on call.  As is customary, the Central Bank will act as depository for MIGA and subsection (5) makes provision for this.  In addition, this subsection also covers the possibility that the Central Bank may advance any moneys required for subscription payments. Under subsection (6), the servicing costs associated with any moneys thus advanced will be charged on the central fund.</P>
    <P>Section 4 provides for the recognition by the State of MIGA's subrogation rights.  Subrogation is a generally accepted principle in insurance law.  In this case it will mean that where an investment is compensated by MIGA, under the terms of a contract of guarantee, <Col N="1534" /> MIGA will then assume the rights of that investor against the host country where the investment was located.</P>
    <P>Section 5 specifies that arbitration judgments involving MIGA will have the force of law in this country.</P>
    <P>Section 6 contains the Short Title to the Bill and the terms of the MIGA Convention itself are set out in the Schedule to the Bill.</P>
    <P>I recommend this Bill for the approval of the House.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> As the explanatory memorandum states in the first paragraph, this Bill will permit ratification by Ireland of the Convention establishing the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency which is generally referred to as MIGA, and will enable the State to comply with the financial and other obligations of membership.</P>
      <P>I would like at the outset to congratulate the predecessor to the Minister for Finance and now deputy leader of Fine Gael, Deputy John Bruton, who, as former Minister for Finance, took a personal interest in the negotiations which led to the establishment of MIGA, and I welcome the present Minister's initiative in bringing the Bill before the House, the passage of which will permit ratification by Ireland of the Convention.</P>
      <P>Investment in Third World countries is fundamental to their growth and development. The situation has improved in Third World countries in recent years, especially in Asian countries &mdash; and I am speaking not just of South Korea, Singapore and Taiwan but of the Asian region as a whole.</P>
      <P>The same is not so in South America however.  South America drifts increasingly into debt, and this is accompanied by lower living standards and more political instability.</P>
      <P>The situation in Africa is nothing short of disastrous.  Sub-Saharan Africa has gone into a tailspin of lower productivity which has led to and will continue to lead to widespread destitution, famine and death.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1535" /> Any initiative which seeks to encourage direct foreign investment in developing countries is not only necessary but essential if tragedies such as that which took place in Ethiopia and the Sudan are not to be repeated again and again in the coming years.</P>
    <P>The DAC countries, that is the OECD assistance countries, have failed to live up to their stated obligations of providing development assistance to Third World countries.  While it is true that for Asian countries development aid is declining in importance, for many of the least developed countries, even in Asia, and for many poor people living in Asian and in Latin American countries, development aid remains an important factor and a source of hope.  It is absolutely vital for Africa.</P>
    <P>The targets of the DAC countries however have not been met.  These countries now are spending $37 billion annually on development co-operation activities.  This amount means, in real terms, a slowing down of the percentage increase over the last decade.  The original annual target for overseas development was 0.7 per cent of the gross domestic product of these countries and $37 billion annually is exactly half of that target.  Living up to the promised target would mean the expenditure of an additional $37 billion or so per annum.</P>
    <P>As the Minister has stated, the paid in element of the MIGA fund will be classified as official development assistance and will be payable from our central fund so I feel it appropriate to comment on our attitude to overseas development aid because this is going to be reckoned as part of it.  There is no doubt at all that Ireland has been one of the leading culprits in not meeting its obligations and fulfilling its targets under ODA.  Not only have we not achieved the committed target of 0.7 per cent of GDP but we are well below the average payment of 0.35 per cent of GDP for the OECD countries. In fact since the present Government came into power our development aid has been further reduced from 0.25 per cent of GDP to 0.18 per cent of GDP. <Col N="1536" /> We would need to contribute over £100 million annually extra to achieve our promised target.  Against a background of total callousness and failure by the present Government to live up to their international obligations in this respect, any initiative is welcome and, in this context, I welcome the introduction of this Bill by the Minister.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note that if the industrial nations, including ourselves, had lived up to promises made over the past years, the international debt problem of Third World countries would have been solved since the sum involved in outstanding debts in Third World countries of $37 billion represents the difference between what was promised and what was delivered.  I wonder what contribution a convention such as this will make to the relief of hunger and to increased living standards in the Third World while those countries continue to flounder in the massive international debt which accrued during the seventies and early eighties.</P>
    <P>Monetary transfers from the south, the underdeveloped countries of the Third World, to the north, that is to the industrial countries, are on the increase.  Interesting figures were brought to my attention recently.  In the early eighties there was a major transfer from the northern countries to the underdeveloped countries of the south.  In 1980 the transfer from north to south was $30.6 billion; in 1981, $35 billion; in 1982, £17.8 billion and in 1983, $7.1 billion. However, by 1984 this had gone into reverse.  The reverse transfer from the underdeveloped south to the industrial north was £7.3 billion in 1984, by 1985 this had gone up to $20.8 billion and by 1986 that figure had gone to $30.6 billion. Those figures were produced by the World Bank and all totals are the net transfers between industrialised and developing countries.  It is evident from those figures that from 1983 onwards the underdeveloped countries have been transferring billions of dollars of their resources in debt repayments to the industrialised countries.  Those transfers exceed the sums that have been provided <Col N="1537" /> in aid by the industrialised countries to Third World countries.</P>
    <P>In those circumstances is it any wonder that there is anger in the Third World when, under the pretence of the rich countries aiding the poor countries, they are actually subsidising the rich?  I will deal with the Bill in some detail on Committee Stage.  When we are dealing with section 2 which ratifies the convention, I hope to refer at length to the terms of the convention which are contained in the Schedule to the Bill.</P>
    <P>I should like to pose a question to the Minister and I hope he will respond when replying to Second Stage.  It is an accepted international principle that trade follows the flag but in more recent years trade has seemed to follow the ability to insure against risk.  Most countries have internal insurance schemes of one type or another, like our own scheme administered by the Department of Industry and Commerce, which insure against the risk of non-payment when trade is conducted with certain countries. This is an international development of that concept and the insurance provided is for non-commercial risk.  The Schedule, which outlines the terms of the convention for us, enumerates the type of non-commercial risk which will be covered, restrictions in currency transfers, expropriation, breach of contract, civil unrest and so on.  The investing company will still have to carry the commercial risk.</P>
    <P>I wonder to what extent will investment, under the guise of aid, guaranteed by this convention be really to the benefit of the host country, the recipient, rather than to the benefit of the country whose citizens or whose corporate units are investing in the host country.  Quite frequently the concept of trade following the flag has moved to trade following the elimination of commercial risk and I wonder if the industrial nations will, once again, use this convention as a method of eliminating risk in their own commercial activity, as a method of eliminating risk which they are unwilling to carry so that they can benefit further from investments in Third World countries.  Are we starting <Col N="1538" /> in this Convention another cycle of investment in Third World countries posing as aid but in circumstances where the real beneficiaries would be the companies and the individuals who invest rather than the host country intended to be the recipients?</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will comment on what I have said or give the House his views of how he envisages the convention working in practice to the benefit of the recipient countries.  I should like the Minister to deal in detail with the participation by Ireland in the total cost of the underwriting envisaged by the convention. Ireland's share is 369 shares and there is a total cost of about £2.750 million envisaged but I notice that only 10 per cent of this amount will have to be paid in cash and a further 10 per cent in promissory notes.</P>
    <P>I note also that there is an enabling section which allows the fund to draw down the total.  Will the £2.750 million, whether it is drawn down or not, be reckoned as part of our bilateral aid or our ODA or is that the amount that will be drawn down?  Will a nominal draw down be included to exaggerate the amount of aid which we are giving to underdeveloped countries?  Will that amount be computed in the totals while the real sum will be between 10 per cent and 20 per cent of that?  I would like clarification of that point from the Minister.</P>
    <P>I notice that the agency will be managed through a council of governors, a board of directors and a president.  Each member state is entitled to appoint one governor and one alternate governor to the council, the body in which the essential powers of the agency are vested.  I note that the board will be responsible for carrying out the general operations of the agency but when it comes to voting rights the Explanatory Memorandum points out that it is the intention that each group will ultimately have equal voting power.  It states that during the early years of the agency's existence a system of supplementary votes will operate in order to protect the voting position of the minority group.  In this context, which <Col N="1539" /> group is the minority group?  Does that refer to the host countries or the investing industrialised countries?  In numerical terms there are fewer DAC countries than there are underdeveloped countries and, on the face of it, it appears that they are the minority group but on the other hand shares are allocated not only on a national basis but relevant to the amount invested.  There is one subscription vote for each share of stock held by a country. I would like further explanation of the mechanism to protect the minority group.  Is it intended as a protection of the native countries of the investors or is it in the interests of the host countries?</P>
    <P>There are other matters I should like to raise in regard to the Bill but they are more appropriate to Committee Stage.  I would like an opportunity to discuss and seek clarification of certain aspects of the convention which appears as a schedule to the Bill.  I should like to know if it is the intention to discuss that as a separate item or should it be taken under section 2 which simply states that the terms of the convention are hereby approved.  I should like to ask the guidance of the Chair in regard to that matter.  As a number of my colleagues are anxious to contribute to this debate I will delay the House no further but the Chair will be aware of the context in which we envisaged debating the Bill and the reasons we are taking it in terms of a further contribution to an already inadequate payment of official development aid by this country to underdeveloped countries.</P>

      <P>I will endeavour to assist Deputy Noonan as best I can.  I am sure the Deputy appreciates that on Second Stage any Member is free to comment on what is in the Bill or what he or she feels is not in it but should be in it.  That allows for very wide ranging comment.  The schedule will be taken, ordinarily as schedules are taken, as I see it on Committee Stage debate on the schedule.  The indication I have given would allow a Deputy to arrange to do this at a certain distance, if he felt so <Col N="1540" /> disposed.  That is the best advice I can give the Deputy at present.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the House does not intend to amend the convention because that would be a somewhat futile exercise.  I want to point out that this debate is centred on a proposal that Ireland should ratify the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency Convention, which establishes as an off-shoot of the World Bank a new agency designed to give indemnification against non-commercially insurable risks for investment in Third World economies.  The Progressive Democrats welcome this measure in principle.  It is our view that the climate for commercial investment in Third World economies is a definite inhibiting factor which retards economic growth and social development in those countries.</P>
      <P>A substantial international agency and fund which can insure against political and non-commercial risks in respect of investments which have been carefully assessed and adapted to local conditions is in our judgment, a very significant step forward in promoting Third World development.  The developed countries have a clear moral duty to help the Third World.  Sadly, such help, is often intermittent, unco-ordinated and worse still frequently undermined by other actions on the part of the developed world.  Our selfish interests create dumping of agricultural surplus which in turn devastates any agriculture above subsistence level in Third World countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The northern hemisphere by its agricultural programmes and policies creates the conditions for famine in the Third World.  The northern hemisphere showers Third World countries with weapons <Col N="1541" /> and munitions by way of subsidy to its own armaments industries and to further national geo-political aims.  That is not confined to the western section of the northern hemisphere.  It applies to the eastern section also.  The effect is to destabilise politically countries which have no need for such armaments.</P>
    <P>Our commitment to Third World development aid must change dramatically. The work of GOAL in building up a solid agricultural base is commendable, and deserves support.  The MIGA Convention is an important complementary step in industrialisation, but it is not something which is of itself likely to change the basic problems of famine, hunger and destitution in the Third World.  It is likely to be of more benefit to those economies which are on the road to industrialisation than to those who are struggling to keep subsistence agriculture in existence and to stave off famine.</P>
    <P>The work of Concern and other famine relief agencies is vitally necessary and needs our strong support as a community. We must also strive to support and develop democracy, civil liberties and the rule of law in the Third World, not as a form of political or cultural imperialism but rather to nurture and conserve basic political and social justice in those countries. That aspect of Third World aid should not be left to Trocaire alone.  This House, the law reform agencies of this State, the Judiciary, our legal professions, can also, by voluntary aid help to sustain democratic instituitions, laws and rights in the Third World.  Amnesty International is one organisation active in that area on a voluntary basis.</P>
    <P>Is it not time that as parliamentarians, some of us as lawyers, and others involved in the executive side of this State, that we put that collective expertise at the disposal of Third World democracies in order to sustain democracy and create stable conditions rather than giving them arms to fight off insurrections and internal crises and to subvert the rule, based on the democratic principle of one man, one vote?  I believe that democracy, civil liberties and the rule of <Col N="1542" /> law cannot be transplanted <i>en bloc</i> by way of a patronising post-imperial gesture to the Third World but where they do exist they can be nurtured and sustained by institutions and people in Ireland who have experience of and insight into the problems of those countries.</P>
    <P>I wonder if our democratic institutions &mdash; our Parliament, our courts, our system of Government and our professionals &mdash; really provide their fair share in this sphere?  I doubt it very much.  Those who work in these areas are hiding their light under a bushel.  There is very much work to be done in the Third World.  I suggest that our approach to creating the conditions for social justice in the Third World should involve our own agencies and personnel who fulfil those functions at home.</P>
    <P>The profile of Irish international development aid is very disappointing.  In 1988 the level of spending on international co-operation was reduced by 21 per cent &mdash; more than £2 million.  This year the same Vote shows a nominal 10 per cent increase, but in real terms the value of our international co-operation budget is down 15 per cent on its level of two years ago.  Worse still, bilateral aid, the one area where we have discretion as opposed to multilateral aid where our commitment is ordained by forces outside our control, is being further reduced this year, by 10 per cent.  That is on top of a reduction of £3 million last year.</P>
    <P>In general terms, this bilateral aid is focused on countries which are least developed &mdash; Lesotho, Sudan, Tanzania and Zambia.  The Government have made major cutbacks in the aid to these countries in the past two years; millions of pounds have been cut from our expenditure programmes.  As a community we have down-graded Government aid to the Third World in the one area where we had a choice in the matter, bilaterial aid, where our discretion determines the level of aid rather than multilaterial aid where we are bound by international obligation to contribute to international funds.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1543" /> While some may argue that as a borrowing, developing nation ourselves, our first priority is to achieve fiancial viability at home, the fact is that the Government choose to ignore and to avoid politically sensitive expenditure programmes for cutting and to cut instead the bilateral aid programme because obviously the recipients of aid from that programme have not votes in this country.  These cutbacks have continued for two years and have decimated aid to our so-called priority countries &mdash; that is a phrase we use to describe Lesotho, Tanzania, Zambia and Sudan.</P>
    <P>In 1988 the cutbacks in bilaterial aid were concentrated on co-financing aid projects which were slashed by 74 per cent.  The same kind of cuts are likely again this year.  The level of overseas development aid has fallen from £42 million in 1986 to £33 million in 1988 &mdash; from 0.25 per cent of GNP it has slipped back to 0.18 per cent.  In terms of meeting the UN target of 0.7 per cent of GNP originally to be met by 1980, the further we are from 1980 the further we are going away from that target.  The cash subscriptions to MIGA are supposed to be a further reduction in the funds already earmarked for overseas development aid.  In this regard it is worthwhile and revealing to look at the actual phraseology of the explanatory memorandum which states:</P>
    <P>Ireland's share allocation in MIGA is 369 shares at a total cost of $3,992,580, or IR£2.75 million approximately at current exchange rates.  The paid-in element, which will be classified as Official Development Assistance and payable from Central Fund services, will be 10 per cent in cash and a further 10 per cent in demand notes, to be encashed only if the Agency is unable to meet its obligations.  Payment of our subscription will be made within ninety days of Ireland ratifying the Convention.</P>
    <P>In other words our contribution to a fund which is there to indemnify investors <Col N="1544" /> against arbitrary political action and other non-commercial risks is now being classified as overseas development aid. That is fair enough in one sense but if it is coming out of the existing budget and the Estimate prepared for 1988 it means that in other areas there is to be a corresponding cutback.  Deputy Noonan queried whether the whole nominal sum is to be included as part of our multilateral aid programme?  I doubt if that is intended based on paragraph 6 of the explanatory memorandum, but if it is, that would compound the concerns I have expressed.</P>
    <P>The development assistance committee of the OECD, the DAC as referred to earlier, are to examine Ireland's overseas development aid programme in 1988.  This year there is to be a review of our performance.  It is worthwhile noting that in previous years they were complimentary and supportive of our efforts by way of bilateral aid in Lesotho, Sudan, Tanzania and Zambia three of which were classified as least developed countries.  It is interesting to note that the comprehensive public expenditure programme which was circulated to Deputies in this House recently and which drew down precisely on this issue stated that Ireland's overseas development aid was reviewed by the development assistance committee &mdash; DAC of the OECD &mdash; in 1986.  The committee expressed its appreciation of the quality of Ireland's aid which was provided entirely in the form of grants.  The bulk of bilateral aid was extended to four low income sub-Saharan African countries &mdash; the ones I mentioned &mdash; three of which were least developed countries. Aid to the least developed countries as a group was well above the DAC average. The DAC would again review Ireland's ODA in 1988.</P>
    <P>Is that not sad in this year when our performance is going to be assessed?  Perhaps it is fitting in another sense when we are going to slash that budget yet again. By the time that review occurs the compliments which were given to us in earlier years will be substituted by &mdash; I hope &mdash; justified and well merited criticism that <Col N="1545" /> we always choose the easiest targets when it comes to expenditure cuts.</P>
    <P>For the second year running we are providing a pathetic £1,000 in our estimates for next year for international disaster relief.  This compares with actual expenditure, funded on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis, of £715,000 and £600,000 in 1987 and 1988 respectively.</P>
    <P>Even in terms of food aid the real value of aid provided for in the 1989 estimates is lower than in 1988.  We have only to look at subhead I.1 of Vote 33 relating to the Department of Agriculture and Food to find that out.  The sad fact is that virtually on every front we are reversing our record of improvement since 1974 when Ireland's overseas development aid programme was first established on a formal basis.  The aid then amounted to 0.05 per cent of GNP.  It rose to nearly 0.25 per cent and it was targeted to rise to 0.7 per cent under our moral commitment to the UN to attempt to achieve that target by 1980.  It is now on the way back down again and it is down to 0.18 per cent of GNP.  We were more than half way towards our goal of giving 0.15 per cent of GNP to the least developed countries.  That achievement this year has again been thrown away and undermined.</P>
    <P>I know the Government face financial difficulties and budgetary constraints but the one thing I want to emphasise is that every time the Cabinet sit around the table with a view to making economies there is one certain result, that is, that people who have no TDs in this Dáil but who rely on us as much as our constituents do are starving and living in subsistence economies.  If every time their interests are cast aside and they get the cut, then I wonder what the real extent of our commitment to Third World aid is.  If every time the Government make economies they go to the Third World allocation to raid the locker, if that is to be the policy of this Government &mdash; that we are suspending any commitment to the UN targets &mdash; why not say that and be honest?  What is going on now is flimflam and public relations <Col N="1546" /> politics which when examined shows that we are going in the wrong direction.</P>
    <P>We are one of the beneficiaries of high priced agriculture in this country and we are one of the economies creating agricultural surpluses which are causing famine and starvation in Third World countries because they eliminate subsistence agriculture and drive out any effort on the part of indigenous agriculture to commercialise itself or make itself safe from climatic catastrophies. We have a moral obligation to spell out a five year development plan for overseas development aid.  What would the five year development plan be?  I am not asking that every single project should be set out in a five year plan but I think it is reasonable that the Government should say that we propose over five years to restore, at the very least, the real value of the moneys we were giving to Third World aid a few years ago and to map out precisely how we will do that.  There is nothing to constrain the Government from doing that.  On the other hand I am convinced that if there is no strategy enunciated by Government as to where they are going in terms of overseas development aid the Minister for Finance next year will snip £1 million or £2 million out of Third World aid in real terms in order to make the books balance.</P>
    <P>We are very good at projecting job targets and tourist targets and setting out five year and three year plans for national recovery and for employment in various sectors.  Why cannot any Minister of this Government specify in advance for the next five years the shape and volume, in global terms, of Ireland's overseas development aid programme.  If we did that we would be able to judge in each budget by how much and to what extent the Government were living up to our communal obligations to the Third World.</P>
    <P>I also call on the Government to establish an official voluntary, legislative, judicial and legal programme to sustain democracy, the rule of law and civil liberties by seconding personnel with experience in those fields for voluntary duties overseas.  What I have in mind in <Col N="1547" /> that context is an Irish version of the peace corps but I am not talking about fresh faced kids going out to work in Third World countries, I am talking about people who have experience in, for instance, the guaranteeing of human rights, in establishing procedures for people in detention, in vindicating the rights of those who have been deprived of their civil liberties and in helping Legislatures in the Third World to do their job.  I suggest we have the resources here to give on a political front help to the Third World and by virtue of our neutral status and by virtue of our own constitutional and national history such political aid offered by us would be received as genuine help and not as an effort to dominate or to mould the institutions of the recipient countries in any particular direction.</P>
    <P>This Bill is like so many others passed in this House such as environmental measures on air pollution and the like, it is window dressing to a large extent.  If it means that Ireland is going to put more into Third World development aid, that is all very well, but if it means that more of our resources are to be applied to what is effectively an insurance fund for Third World investment and less are to go to our bilateral aid programmes, which I believe is the consequence of this particular measure, then it is disguising with a well intentioned and superficially attractive legislative gloss what is a further slide away from our moral and international political obligations.  Legislation without resources is about as much help to overseas development as legislation to amend or repeal the laws of gravity.  We in the Progressive Democrats support this Bill but we have to point out the sad fact that it is a milestone on a road which has sadly doubled back on the direction whence we came and in which direction we were travelling just three or four years ago.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Firstly, it has to be re-emphasised that the main purpose of this Bill is to permit ratification by Ireland <Col N="1548" /> of the convention establishing the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency and to enable the State to comply with the financial and other obligations of membership of that new agency.  The Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency is a member of the World Bank group and its main objective is to encourage foreign direct and presumably private investors with financial guarantees against non-commercial risks such as restrictions of currency transfers, expropriation, breach of contract, or civil unrest.  Under the Convention Ireland will be expected to make a payment of £275,000 in cash within 90 days of ratification and a similar sum in demand notes, which will be cashed only if the agency are unable to meet their obligations.</P>
      <P>It has to be said that measures which assist in promoting economic progress in the under-developed and developing countries are of course very welcome, but it is unlikely that the establishment of this new agency is going to have any great impact on those countries which are facing the most severe problems from hunger and deprivation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The need for effective measures to help these countries is now more acute than ever.  The situation in many parts of the Third World has deteriorated rapidly in the past decade due to a combination of political and climatic factors.  For instance, commodity prices, on which many Third World countries depend, have fallen to the lowest level in 30 years with a consequent fall of 15 per cent in the purchasing power of Third World exports in the first half of this decade. The massive burden of Third World debt &mdash; now estimated to be in excess of US $1 trillion &mdash; a lack of new investment and static aid levels resulted in an outflow of more than US $30 billion from the Third World during 1986 alone.  Countries like Ethiopia, Sudan and Bangladesh have had to face appalling problems from famine and natural disasters such as flooding.  Within the past ten days Nicaragua has been devastated by a hurricane which has destroyed the homes of more than one in ten of the population.  Up to 40,000 children are <Col N="1549" /> estimated to die needlessly every day from the effects of hunger and disease &mdash; hunger that could be ended and diseases that could in most cases be cured &mdash; yet in many Third World countries great wealth and great deprivation exist side by side.</P>
    <P>The tragic human consequences of the developments I have just mentioned were summed up by UNICEF in their 1987 report on <i>The State of the World's Children</i> and I quote:</P>
    <P>Malnutrition during the 1980's is increasing in many parts of the developing world.  Evidence of rising malnutrition exists in ten African countries; (plus) Belize, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Jamaica, Uruguay and parts of the Philippines and Sri Lanka.  Infant mortality has been rising in some area &mdash; including Barbados, Brazil, Ghana and Uruguay &mdash; after decades of decline, while the trends towards improvement has been halted in at least 21 countries.  The proportion of low birth-weight babies increased in at least ten countries between 1979 and 1982, including Barbados, Cameroon, Guinea-Bissau, Jamaica, Malaysia, Rwanda and Tanzania.  Diseases thought to have been eliminated have reappeared &mdash; yaws and yellow fever in Ghana, for example, and malaria in Peru.  And these are just the countries for which information is available.</P>
    <P>The failure of the more developed world to respond adequately to the crisis of hunger, disease, death and poverty in the Third World verges on the criminal.  Of course we have serious problems in our own country but our difficulties pale into virtual insignificance when compared with those of the Third World countries. I should like to bring the attention of the Minister and the House to a report produced by Trócaire called <i>The Costs of Cutting Third World Aid</i>.  This report makes a very strong case against further cuts in overseas development aid by the Government.  On page four of the report there is a table which outlines the basic quality of life indicators and compares them with statistics in Ireland.  I want to mention a few of them.  It compares <Col N="1550" /> statistics for Lesotho, Sudan, Tanzania, Zambia and Ireland.  In relation to gross national product <i>per capita</i> in US dollars, it points out that we have 20 times the gross national product <i>per capita</i> at around US $5,000 whereas in Lesotho, Sudan, Tanzania and Zimbabi it ranges from US $250 to US $370.  The average daily calorie intake <i>per capita</i> in those four countries compared with Ireland shows that we have something like onethird more or, to put it another way, the other four countries have a third less calorie intake than the population in Ireland.  The infant mortality rate per 1,000 live births in those four countries ranges from 82 to 108 compared with Ireland which has a rate of nine per 1,000 live births.  The average life expectancy in those four countries ranges from 49 to 55 whereas in Ireland it is 74 on average.</P>
    <P>Those statistics very clearly, but perhaps very coldly, indicate the kind of life which most children born in Third World countries have to face.  Against this background the decision of the Government last year to cut Ireland's bilateral or direct aid to the Third World by 30 per cent in real terms was surely one of the most cruel and heartless decisions to have been taken by the Fianna Fáil Government since coming into office.  In 1987 we spent £24.7 million in international co-operation. This year that figure will be just £21.65 million.  Our bilateral aid fund has been cut in the 1989 Estimates by 10 per cent, from £10 million to £9 million.  So far as this country's financial commitment to the Third World is concerned &mdash; and obviously I am talking about Government commitment &mdash; it seems to be a case of one step forward and two steps backwards.</P>
    <P>Non-governmental organisations on the other hand such as Trócaire and Concern have had a very good and positive record in the area of development aid. The response of the Irish people to appeals such as the Band Aid appeal for Ethiopia has been especially generous but the response of successive Irish Governments has been one of broken promises.</P>
    <P>Ireland has never come anywhere near <Col N="1551" /> meeting the target level of 0.7 per cent of gross national product or, to put it more simply, a commitment of 70p out of every £100 of gross national product which was set by the United Nations.  The last Coalition Government promised to increase overseas development aid to £50.9 million by 1987.  The actual figure allocated in the 1987 Coalition budget was £44.4 million which would have represented about 0.26 per cent of GNP. This was cut back even further by Fianna Fáil.  A target date must be set for this country to reach the target figure of 0.7 per cent of GNP.  A date should be set and a timetable agreed and adhered to without qualification.</P>
    <P>I think it is worth while to again quote the document produced by Trócaire called <i>The Costs of Cutting Third World Aid</i>.  The document points out and I quote:</P>
    <P>While Ireland reduces its aid, the need in developing countries remains vast.  Over 500 million people are chronically hungry in the Third World and while progress has been made in the last three decades, in certain areas the need is growing.  The United Nations World Food Council (WFC) points out that &ldquo;the 1980s have become a decade of declining staple-food consumption in many low-income countries, which can least afford a further decline of already inadequate average diets....  Declining food availability affects above all the poor, who simply have no way of further tightening their belts below their survival diets without severe risks to their health and lives.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The report goes on to say:</P>
    <P>In total, the number of children in the developing world suffering from what has come to be called proteinenergy malnutrition increased from 150 million in 1975 to close to 160 million in 1984....  Malnutrition and disease caused the unnecessary deaths of some 14 million children under five every year during the first half of this decade.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1552" /> That is an appalling state of affairs in this world where there is such vast wealth and the capacity for the creation of such vast wealth at a time when we belong to a community which stores vast quantities of food and destroys vast quantities of food because it does not suit the market to put it up for sale or to distribute it.  This is something on which Ireland as a member of the Community should take a very strong stand.  We should make it clear that we are not prepared to stand over that and the best way to do that is to meet the commitments we have made over the years to provide at least the minimum of 0.7 per cent of GNP.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, it is very doubtful if the establishment of this agency is going to have any significant impact on the scale of the problem facing Third World countries.  It could in some respects be seen as an attempt by the World Bank to &ldquo;privatise&rdquo; development aid.  The fact is, however, that the 40 most underdeveloped countries are just not considered to be credit worthy, and are not likely to attract private investment.</P>
    <P>There must also be doubt about the role of the World Bank and particularly about its willingness to take the sort of urgent measures to help the Third World deal with its problem.  While the World Bank plays a major role in international matters, its policies are largely determined by five of the major western industrialised nations, the USA, the UK, West Germany, France and Japan, and its policies in recent years in particular have reflected the rampant &ldquo;free market&rdquo; ethic of these countries &mdash; ethics which ensure that the strong exploit the weak and that the rich ignore the poor.  The World Bank has never shown any determination to see fundamental developments in the Third World which would impinge on the self interest of the major countries referred to.  Indeed many of these countries see the Third World simply as markets for products and they are loath to see any developments there which would upset the balance of their own economies.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1553" /> The rather complicated voting structure in the new agency also seems to have been designed to ensure that the major nations retain control over policy.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that voting in the World Bank and in the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency is not, as it is in most other UN and other international bodies, on the democratic basis of one country, one vote.</P>
    <P>I find it strange also that Ireland should be included in category one of the members of the new agency, along with all the developed nations, while our EC partners, Spain, Portugal and Greece, are included in category two, with some of the poorest countries.  Does this mean for instance, that investment in Spain, Portugal and Greece, by third countries will be guaranteed by the agency?  I would ask the Minister to clarify this point in his response to the debate.</P>
    <P>I would also ask for clarification of the paragraph in the explanatory memorandum which says that this country's payment to the agency will be classified as Official Development Assistance.  Does this mean that our already meagre allocation of money for direct development aid, will be cut further by the £275,000 to cover the initial payment to the agency?</P>
    <P>I am also very alarmed to see South Africa included along with Ireland in the list of developed countries.  It is totally hypocritical to suggest that South Africa has any role to play in encouraging development in the Third World countries. The problems of many Third World countries such as Angola and Mozambique have been greatly exacerbated by the direct and indirect military intervention of South Africa.  In Angola the South African armed forces and the UNITA forces which it backs have brought death and destruction to the south of the country.  In Mozambique, RENALMO, which is organised, trained, armed and financed by South Africa has deliberately set out to destroy the economic and social infrastructure of the country, and has greatly contributed to the problems of famine and hunger.  South Africa should be shunned by the civilised world.  It should have no <Col N="1554" /> place in this or any other international agency until is has scrapped its apartheid policies and its policies of interfering and intervening in other countries.</P>
    <P>We are not opposing this new agency. We hope it will have some benefiting effects although we do not see a lot of hope for it doing anything significant.  I would ask the Minister to clarify the points I have raised.  I hope he will be in a position to state that our overseas development aid will be restored and will not be cut as is being proposed in the Estimates.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I must express my very serious disquiet at the content of the Minister's speech.  I find it strange that there is not a representative from the Department of Foreign Affairs here while we are discussing this issue.  I say this having had the experience of watching international development association section loan legislation requirements come here before this House again and again and being passed through in relatively brief periods without any discussion as to the implications of passing this legislation for our overall foreign policy.  In dealing with the International Development Association section of the World Bank, we are dealing with the soft loan section of the World Bank and the matter is not perhaps serious but I must say that I have to consider, having read the Minister's speech, whether, as foreign affairs spokesperson for the Labour Party, I will have to recommend to my party to perhaps even oppose this legislation on the strength of the speech I have before me. I say this in a considered way because normally when legislation involving small amounts are brought before the House it is considered that it is not worth while delaying the legislation and so on.  I want to take up and contest a number of points as ones that do not represent the view of my party or the view of the Irish people. In paragraph 3, page 1 of the Minister's speech he says:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputies will be aware, there is general agreement that foreign direct <Col N="1555" /> investment in developing countries enhances their capacity for growth and strengthens their economies.  Unfortunately, all too often, investment opportunities are not taken because conditions in these countries may be such as to create doubts in the minds of investors as to the security of their investments.  Also, despite the fact that many industrial countries have guarantee schemes similar to that offered by MIGA, there can still be difficulties in finding adequate insurance cover in such cases.</P>
    <P>That is not the view of the international community and that is not the view of people in Ireland who look at the World Bank.  That is the view of the US, the view of Mrs. Thatcher and of a number of others and I would ask Members of this House to place it in comparison with a basic document issued by the Chilean Government in an introduction to trade and investment, which says that the figures of foreign investment in Chile have exhibited a sustained upsurge in the past ten years, that this is the result no doubt of a policy which guarantees investors a treatment consistent with their rights under the operation of an economic system that has evident significant social as well as economic progress to warrant essential future stability required for the execution of substantial investment projects, and that accordingly, three fundamental principles represent the basis of the Chilean foreign investment policy &mdash; equal treatment to national and foreign investors, free access to the various markets and economic sectors for foreign investors and minimum state interference in connection with the activities of foreign investors.  It goes on to say that as commonly known, a clear and stable policy is not sufficient however, to entice foreign investors, that several other factors must be simultaneously available to make attractive investment in a given country, and that in the particular case of Chile, such factors are, the operation of a stable economic policy open to foreign markets, availability of first level <Col N="1556" /> infrastructure and services and excellent professionals and labour availability to comparative advantages in various sectors including agriculture, forestry, fishing and mining and respect for private property and social stability.</P>
    <P>It is extraordinary to find a speech by an Irish Minister for Finance on an aspect of foreign affairs affecting our relationship with world institutions which repeats verbatim the justification by General Pinochet's Government for foreign investment in Chile.  This House is a Parliament where words and statements should mean something.  I repeat what the Minister said:</P>
    <P>As Deputies will be aware, there is general agreement that foreign direct investment in developing countries enhances their capacity for growth and strengthens their economies.</P>
    <P>That view is a tendentious one which does not represent the view of my party or of many people in Ireland.  They would object in the strongest possible terms. The Minister went on to make offensive remarks about many other countries who are part of the world community of nations.  His speech continued:</P>
    <P>MIGA is an attempt to remove such impediments.  It has the specific aim of encouraging investment flows to developing countries by providing insurance guarantees against non-commercial risks.  Such risks can include restrictions on the transfer of currency, the expropriation of assets, the risk of war or civil disturbance and breach of contract.</P>
    <P>Is this to say that in countries where there is a struggle going on to remove a dictatorship such as in Marcos's Philippines, the administration of Pinochet in Chile or to remove General Stroessner, we can say we have a responsibility to defend private speculative international investment and say that those who are struggling within these countries are somehow creating unstable conditions?  Who do we think we are?  This is a House to which I <Col N="1557" /> have to come week after week listening to what I can only call republican guff and so-called decolonisation positions from different people around the House.  This language is the language of the coloniser, the language of the rich and the language of the north in international economic terms.  It is not taking into consideration the view of the south in relation to international aid.  It is offensive and insulting language in relation to many countries where there is a problem about economic structures and who are struggling for human rights in the economic and social realm.  I have had a good personal working relationship with the Minister for many years and I would ask him when replying to this debate to disown some of this language because of what it could possibly create by way of a bad impression internationally.</P>
    <P>The Minister went on to say:</P>
    <P>Guarantee schemes in isolation will not, however, produce miracles.  A favourable investment climate and appropriate policies by governments are necessary too.  In this respect, an important role which MIGA will also have, in addition to its guarantee function, will be in advising host governments on their investment laws and regulatory and other policies affecting foreign direct investment programmes.</P>
    <P>That is what was said to Julius Nyerere when he was forced to abandon the process of native development in Tanzania at a meeting before he returned as President to his country.  The Minister and those who might have influenced this atrocious speech may be glad to hear President Nyerere's speech in 1981.  He stated:</P>
    <P>The World Bank and the IMF were set up by and are still controlled by the rich nations of the world.  Whether they are now effective in serving the purpose for which they were established is, I would have thought, questionable. But what is quite certain is that apart from the IDA, a subsidiary of the World Bank, they are not instruments <Col N="1558" /> for attacking world poverty and dependency. The IMF, in particular, endorses and serves the present international financial structure, rather than in any way acting as a corrective in its injustices.  Further, although it is a creature of the developed nations, these hide behind the IMF when they find it convenient.  They pretend it has a special expertise and is politically neutral; when a poor country seeks credit, it is therefore told first to reach an understanding with the IMF.</P>
    <P>I say in parenthesis that I am not confusing the IMF and the World Bank.  I have read the publications from the World Bank, including their most recent one about supporting private investment and so forth.  I had hoped that we would not be in the front row in trying to disgrace ourselves by prostrating ourselves in this new kind of international relationship with the Third World.</P>
    <P>Dr. Nyerere went on to say:</P>
    <P>This approach must be ended and replaced by a system which will support development and not crush it, as in the current deplorable case of Jamaica.</P>
    <P>Michael Manley in Jamaica wanted to give bread to his people and he was broken by the international financial system.  Nyerere was forced from office because he could not face the personal problem of looking at the concept he had for native Tanzanian development being scrapped in front of his nose, with the example of a capitulating Kenya next door to Tanzania</P>
    <P>Now that we have taken in the speeches of the Minister for Finance to quoting Pinochet economics in relation to aid, I should like to tell the other side of the story.  I was recently in Chile, as some Members of this House will know. In the briefing document <i>Chile &mdash; A Resource Book</i> issued by the United States Embassy in 1988, there is a page which describes the Chilean economy and states:</P>
    <P>Chile is now in its third year of 5 per cent-plus growth and its fifth year of <Col N="1559" /> positive numbers, following a massive recession in 1982 and 1983.  Inflation has been reduced to one of the lowest levels now experienced in Latin America, investment (both domestic and foreign) is strong, unemployment rates are dropping while the workforce expands.  Real wages are climbing, but from an extremely low base.  Perhaps more important for a highly indebted developing country, Chile is running a substantial trade surplus.  Exports now represent nearly a third of gross national product.  Chilean officials state that they will export more this year than Argentina.</P>
    <P>It could almost describe this country &mdash; exports up, investment up, inflation down and the only things wrong being emigration, poverty and unemployment. May be that comparison is the one which is getting home to the people in the Department of Finance when they are asking their Minister to make speeches such as he has made this afternoon.</P>
    <P>The other side of it is very interesting. While these figures were being presented as one face of the Chilean economy &mdash; I am only using it as a case study to refute the kind of nonsense to which I have just listened &mdash; those indicators were established at a time when the average Chilean was poorer than he was 16 years earlier. In addition the right to organise trade unions was lost, something which is not true here.  Wages are 44 per cent lower than in 1973 and overall income is down 15 per cent from what it was in 1973. There is no social security system; it has been curtailed.  In negotiating with the World Bank and international institutions the social fabric dealing with basic needs has been scrapped.  The health system has been privatised.  People get credits which they can cash in at private health institutions.  One could go on and on.  In 1970, 17 per cent of the Chilean population were classified as poor.  In 1987, 47 per cent were classified as poor, involving five million people and many children.</P>
    <P>There were, therefore, if you like, two <Col N="1560" /> faces to the economy.  What we are doing is taking the official gloss, the rhetoric, of external, disembodied, dehumanised type of economics and saying that this is the logic we will follow.  Therefore, on a November day, in the Irish Republic the Minister for Finance seeks authorisation to lend the great international assistance that Ireland has to offer to establish a new agency which will guarantee the risks of any social disturbances, such as liberation movements, or any kind of upset that investors might suffer if they invested in any part of the south in the world.</P>
    <P>What a disgraceful kind of attitude to have.  Of course it will come back, as it always does in this casadh an tsúgáin kind of politics we have in this House, that these are matters for Finance and have nothing to do with Foreign Affairs; that it is the remit of Foreign Affairs to deal with our international policy.  I believe there is still somebody alive down in Iveagh House dealing with overseas development aid.  That thinking, in the speech to which we have just listened this afternoon is, quite frankly, an atrocious attitude to take.</P>
    <P>For example, the Minister had this to say about the obligation that will arise:</P>
    <P>Each member will be entittled to subscribe for a specified number of shares and, in Ireland's case, this number is 369.</P>
    <P>I am sure that is terribly important. The quotation continues:</P>
    <P>In terms of total cost, our subscription will amount to about IR£2.750 million at current exchange rates.  However, only 10 per cent of this amount will be paid in cash.</P>
    <P>When one looks at the dreary document that constitutes the Estimate for Overseas Development Aid this year this means that yet again, whatever little we will give, we will be giving because we are forced to do so under international obligations while the amount we give by discretion will become tinier and tinier.</P>
    <P>What is most interesting is that in the case of this converted Government they <Col N="1561" /> seem to have passed on that conversion to the rest of the apostles so fast that it is unbelievable as an exercise in faith itself.  The one thing the Government do not have, that nobody in this House has, is a mandate to cut overseas development aid.  Nobody went before the people saying that they were going to freeze the existing level of overseas development aid, or that they were going to cut it back. Certainly they did not say &mdash; in the course of preparation of the Estimates in 1986, 1987 or 1988 &mdash; they were seeking a mandate to cut aid more than cuts in every other area &mdash; 36 per cent in one area, 29 per cent in another and so on.  They did not say to the Irish people: because you are so generous &mdash; another kind of lottery &mdash; this time you are not gambling but putting your hands in your pockets and, because you are so generous, we are going to cut our own aid at Government level.</P>
    <P>If one looks at where that development aid has been cut one notes that last week the ebullient acting Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, came into the House and said &mdash; in another disgraceful comparison &mdash; that when he had been asked as part of the general community of Ministers of Foreign Affairs by the President of Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, to respond to the greatest disaster that had occurred in Nicaragua in recent times he said, &ldquo;we are watching the situation; we are being briefed; we are told it is not as bad as it might seem; we are told it is not as bad as Bangladesh and Sudan,&rdquo; thereby making the seedy comparison of one major disaster part of the world with another.  Of course the truth is that whoever is advising the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs about Nicaragua might have referred to the official statement from the Nicaraguan Embassy in London that said that the disaster was as bad, or worse, in parts of Nicaragua than the 1975 earthquake, that one house in ten had been affected by it, that 300,000 people had been made homeless or had had to move; that 40 people were missing on the outskirts of Managua.  But our Minister for Foreign Affairs said they had been <Col N="1562" /> advised that it was not as bad as it might seem, that hard choices had to be made and we had to send money from the national lottery to Sudan and Bangladesh. When history comes to be written I hope people will read the records of this House for the last couple of years. I hope they will look at parliamentary questions when they will discover that I asked, week after week, about our office in Sudan.  For example, when we rented the office we appointed an individual to take up a position there, to set up an aid programme.  That was 18 months before the famine in Sudan.  They will note that the Minister was asked every week and month what they were doing about it. The fact of the matter is that the Government closed the office in Sudan, brought the official home and appointed him to a post in Iveagh House.  Then, when the Sudanese famine was happening, they decided, late in the day, to respond from the national lottery.  Let the world know that: Ireland's foreign policy in relation to aid is to close offices in advance, remove the personnel; then when everyone else in the world is contributing to the point of embarrassment, go back to the gambling fund, take a bit from the national lottery and throw it out.  But even crumbs from the national lottery were not available to a Government whose Vice-President and Foreign Minister we entertained here.</P>
    <P>In Tanzania, another country in the bilateral aid programme, there was the winding down of projects of which many Members of this House were aware, in Kilosa and other places.  Incidentally these projects were not set up for those parts of Tanzania.  They were set up as model projects to be replicated and translated to other places where they would be models of community development. They are gone as well; they do not really matter.</P>
    <P>When one looks at the other different countries, the different projects there, one discovers the people in APSO who are being called home as are the people in DEVCO.  There is now a new philosophy which is more or less this: maybe there is money in Third World poverty and debt? <Col N="1563" /> Would it not be nice if they gave us all contracts &mdash; if we sent off our medical personnel and got paid for doing so &mdash; for building this or that?  It is almost an insult to the company but we have almost a Masstock theory of development in current Government circles.</P>
    <P>Supposing it were true, that none of this had anything to do with foreign affairs, then why is there not any reference in the Ministers speech this afternoon to the other issues of trade and debt?  This speech is about removing the insecurity of foreign investors, about Ireland's international commitments, our obligations under the Constitution to pass this today so that we will be able to remove the insecurities of these people. When will we hear about an overall approach on the part of this country towards the international financial institutions? Do the people we appoint or nominate to directorates in these different financial institutions ever write home?  Or should they sent postcards saying how they are getting on?  What is our view on the structure of international trade?  What is our view on the restructuring of GATT so that it might help the South in relation to trade?  What is our view in relation to the debt anyhow? When we go to the United Nations what is our view in relation to the Latin American countries?  What proportion of GDP do we think countries should pay in order to fulfil that commitment?  I know the answer that will come back &mdash; we are a small little country; we have to look after ourselves and are we not debt-ridden; are we not doing nicely with our General Pinochetic economics?  They call it the absence of economic rights in Chile.  We call it emigration and unemployment here when we get our rare attacks of honesty.</P>
    <P>I agree with what Deputy de Rossa has just said, that we have spectacles regularly in this House.  I am not being in the slightest emotional about it.  I just feel that in relation to the question of our relationship to the international financial institutions, to foreign policy and aid, we are disgracing ourselves more day after <Col N="1564" /> day.  I would offer one concept alone for consideration, that of mutual interdependency. If we are to take our mutual interdependence seriously do we not need to recognise that it is in our approach towards the international financial institutions, our initiatives and energy should be used in twisting these institutions into such a shape as will meet the needs of the developing countries rather than those of the major donor countries?  Where is there any evidence to be found that we are doing so?</P>
    <P>What about women in development? What about all of these issues?  The answer is this: this country, if it ever dies, will not die in a way that anyone will notice.  It will gradually fall asleep and die in its sleep because, in foreign policy at present, we are beginning to be noticed as the sleepwalkers: we do not stand foranything; we do not have a view on anything. We have a lovely principle in regard to all the people struggling for liberation.  We picked up this principle somewhere on the road between Westminster and here.  It is that we do not recognise opposition or liberation movements and we tell people like the blacks struggling in South Africa, for example, that we will recognise them when Apartheid has been removed.  We tell all the other countries the same thing. We tell the Salvadoreans that if they ever achieve true democracy in El Salvador we will then recognise them.  Are we not wonderful?  We treat the colonised who got free to establish themselves, in a unique, sleveen kind of foreign policy in the late eighties.  I am getting tired of it all being justified and accepted on the basis of some windy statements that all these matters are an on-going process under constant review.  That is Alka Selzer kind of language and we have been getting more and more of it when we asked questions about foreign policy.  The truth is that we have no position on the international financial institutions by way of philosophy or policy.  We have no philosophy or position on trade or on the debt.  We have no concept of recognising oppositional forces and we never analyse the impact of international borrowings <Col N="1565" /> on the internal structured economics in terms of rights.  We are intervening now to guarantee the people who might take a risk, who might buy copper shares in Chile.  If the copper mines were nationalised that would be a tragedy and the Irish people would like to know that they will be contributing to bailing out these discontented people, these poor hapless investors who got upset when the people demanded some of what was their own in the first place.</P>
    <P>There are a number of principles &mdash; but I am not interested in being negative &mdash; which could be made.  The Minister is correct in saying that this is not the time to discuss the whole question of aid in detail.  We may get ten minutes in the next 12 months to do that so we must not burden anybody today in case we take advantage of our ten minutes in advance. I do not agree with much of what Deputy McDowell said but I agree that there should be a co-ordinated approach towards aid.  It is very important and there could be an all-party commitment &mdash; there is consensus in this regard &mdash; towards reaching an aid target over a period of years.  We could all agree on that but no response is forthcoming. There is no point in saying that the former Taoiseach, Deputy FitzGerald, rejigged the figures by saying he was talking about the previous year and not the previous five years.  I am not interested in riddles. There is a possibility that there would be support from all parties for a continuous movement, over a short period, towards achieving our aid target.</P>
    <P>A second point is that our multilateral aid could and should be maintained in conjunction with an examination of international agencies who are receiving it and looking at the pattern of its impact on the poorest in the different countries to which it is going.  Very often there is an enormous difference between agency to State aid and agency to people aid.  An examination of the funding of water schemes in Africa would give a clear example.  No doubt the Minister will answer a question which arises in relation to how all the philosophy in his speech fits in as being consistent with our attitude towards the <Col N="1566" /> United Nations development programme? Do we say one thing when we are dealing with the World Bank and another at the UN?  Maybe we have two policies and that, being Irish, it does not bother us if they contradict each other.</P>
    <P>What about our attitude towards the International Fund for Agricultural Development?  What is our philosophy in relation to the International Development Association to which I referred earlier? It is time to come clean in relation to the amount of Irish aid &mdash; tied aid &mdash; we give because of our existing commitments under international agreements.  We should specify the discretionary component of our aid.  It is time, equally, in relation to the question of the overall debate to talk about the world financial agencies.  As Deputy De Rossa pointed out, we are speaking at a time when most of the imports to the Third World countries have increased in price.  There has been a slump in relation to many of the basic commodies being exported by the countries of the south.</P>
    <P>It is very clear &mdash; and many writers, including Susan George, have said it &mdash; that unless there is a renegotiated new international economic order there will be one famine after another.  Are we waiting to get our kicks from watching one famine after another shown on our television screens?  All the people who examined the causes of world hunger, malnutrition and disease and all the avoidable illnesses &mdash; Deputy De Rossa referred to UNICEF &mdash; have pointed out the tiny amount of resources which would be necessary to complete a vaccination programme by 1990.  They have already pioneered, through ORT and through different kinds of charts and so on in relation to the progress of children, programmes which have saved a number of children.  Have they saved babies and children to die as adults in a world that refuses to critically glance at the structure of its trade, aid and debt?</P>
    <P>There could be a role for Ireland, which prides itself on some kind of moral <Col N="1567" /> authority, to look critically at the structure of these institutions instead of sleep-walking its way through assent in something which, at the end of the day, is working against the peopled part of the world and not towards any kind of philosophy of life itself.  We are living in a very contradictory situation, one where the work of the non-governmental organisations and the voluntary contributions of the Irish people are being used to frustrate the official actions taking place in the name of the Irish people.  Thus, without a whit of shame, the Minister for Foreign Affairs will say that last year the Irish people gave so much money for aid. He will not bother to break down the amount and say whether it was by voluntary subscriptions initiated by Mr. Geldof or given by the Government.  The Minister is not too worried whether it came from the national lottery or if it is under the Estimates for the Department of Foreign Affairs.</P>
    <P>I listened with interest to the Minister for Foreign Affairs last week saying that he wanted to nail this canard that there was only a sum of £1,000 in the Estimates for disaster relief.  That is the sum mentioned in the Estimates but he is really saying he is keeping a line open and that he can always give more later.  Of course it did not seem to matter that it came from the lottery.  The people working in the field for aid want to know if the bilateral projects will continue or have they been so structurally damaged by another run of cuts that they will not be able to continue.  The people working in different, special projects want to know the future of those projects.  We never answer these questions.</P>
    <P>A number of principles could and should affect our policies in relation to the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency.  Now that we have wasted our time discussing MIGA I suggest that there are other interests and principles at which we might look, for example, at our pattern of discriminating support for aid projects and loan applications in terms of whether they satisfy basic economic and social needs.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1568" /> We should develop a philosophy of support for the eradication of hard core poverty in the Third World.  We should look at projects directed at education, literacy and participation and at the whole question of people's ability to take part in affairs governing their country.  I gave an example from Chile simply to illustrate that.  Chile can look sweet from outside in relation to the literature I quoted, but the experience inside was a life of deprivation, poverty and exclusion for five million people.  Is our loyalty in terms of these institutions towards the peopled world or towards international investment?  I say &ldquo;congratulations&rdquo; to those involved in preparing this.  It is the most brazen speech I have heard in a long time and it is extreme in its language on the rights of the free market, liberal economy.  I hope nobody abroad reads it because I hope to continue to travel abroad occasionally and I hope, because of its disgraceful language, that nobody will ever be able to quote it to me.  The problem is that we no longer think about our development strategy because we do not have one.  We say nothing about food and rural development.  We do not look at the question of access to markets. There is nothing in any speech I have heard from the Minister for Finance or the Minister for Foreign Affairs about the international commodities market and how it excludes many Third World countries.  There is nothing about technological transfers and the way they are weighted in favour of the north.  There is nothing at all in relation to a philosophy of debt or, for example, the sale of armaments to the Third World.  There is nothing about women, or about ecological and environmental projects and whether they should be favoured when they come before the different international institutions.  We are in a time when it is almost facile to look for informing principles for our development policy, and in the absence of a development policy there can be no theory, policy or philosophy of aid.  Unfortunately, we can look forward more and more to the little messages that come back in terms <Col N="1569" /> of our international obligations and what we are required to do.</P>
    <P>I conclude by saying that I reject absolutely the suggestion made in this speech at the point at which I began, that there is support in Ireland, this country, for the philosophy of this speech here, that our role in international lending institutions is one of guaranteeing the risks of foreign investment, of saying as stated here, that it is upsetting for foreign investment very often to be located in countries where there is instability.  We have no right to make those remarks.  We are not bankers, we are politicians.  We are not the international copper company of the world.  We are not investing in mines.  We are not De Beers.  We are politicians.  We are supposed to reflect the feeling of the people.  You can expect that kind of thing from people who would be investing in South Africa.  You do not expect it from people who are elected to this House.</P>
    <P>Then we have these trite remarks about having guaranteed the risks of social instability, and in case the peasants got stroppy we would be able to say something else as well.  We give a lecture to people who have more courage than we have, politicised decent people who have enough courage to struggle, often against insuperable odds.  We give them a lecture. The Minister said, &ldquo;A favourable investment climate and appropriate policies by governments are necessary too&rdquo; Who are we to lecture anybody when people are flying from our country through lack of work, when people are homeless and in poverty, when old people no longer look forward to dying in dignity or to proper health care in their old age?  Who are we to give lectures on international meteorology?  Having talked about the weather instead of economics for years we are now taking to lecturing the world?  Maybe the Minister is thinking of not going to Europe but of going on a world tour.  He said, &ldquo;A favourable investment climate and appropriate policies by governments are necessary&rdquo;.  Think of the sheer arrogance of that kind of remark.  I suppose what is encouraging is that the Minister will not be making this kind of speech so often. <Col N="1570" /> It is merely that he considers he has to when issues like the question of our relationship to the Third World, particularly through the joint shared forum of international institutions, manage to surface like a mad mushroom occasionally in this House where we rarely discuss anything of relevance any more.</P>
    <P>Then the Minister refers to the International Finance Corporation and I quote:</P>
    <P>The IFC's objective is also to encourage direct investment in developing countries and it does this in a variety of ways &mdash; it makes equity investments in and gives loans mainly to privately-owned enterprises, it helps develop local capital markets and financial institutions and it offers technical advice to governments on the encouragement of private investment.</P>
    <P>So we have taken it on ourselves to look after private investment.</P>

      <P>I am quoting from the Minister's speech about this.  That is the best I can do.  Here is the nice part:</P>
      <P>Before I touch on the essential provisions of the Bill, I should also like to draw Deputies' attention to the fact that under the terms of Article 29.5.2º of the Constitution it will be necessary for the Dáil to pass the motion, ...</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I realise that, but all I know is that the Constitution, however bad it was in 1937, was about something much more principled than this version of our relationship to international and financial institutions.  Therefore, I regret to say that I have to think and ask my colleagues <Col N="1571" /> to think whether our disagreement which was represented by way of philosophy in this speech is so serious that we will refuse to support this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mr. Barnes Mr. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome at least an opportunity for us within this forum to have some discussion and debate on the whole area of an Irish role in Third World development particularly as we pride ourselves on the fact that we seem to share a certain identity and experience with developing countries, having so recently developed ourselves, although Deputy Higgins might feel we have not reached a great sense of development yet.  I would like to address my few remarks to that area of our identity and experience and particularly what our commitment should be to developing countries without losing sight of the experience we have so recently had of being colonised and robbed of our resources, being denied our education and being contemptuously used by what was considered the coloniser. We all have deep within us a great sense of and a reaction to what was put upon for so long and we can never afford, not alone not to lose sight of it, but to neglect to make a commitment alongside that experience.  I say to the Minister here today, to the present Government and to all who may be in Government in the future, that I would like to feel we could make some kind of reform, of amendment, of softening of the process.  This should be done particularly in the areas of the World Bank, of the International Monetary Fund and the huge money cartels that hold the Third World countries to ransom.  We have a moral right to do it and we can do it out of our own experience.  We should be co-operating in any area that will improve the rights, independence and development of developing countries, insisting on our riders to what is being done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I share the concern and anger at what has been done to the developing countries up to now by the richer countries. We have creamed off their resources and reduced them to a lifestyle of total dependency on the crumbs that fall from the <Col N="1572" /> rich man's table.  We have denied them the right to choose what crops they will grow and that resources they will use for their own needs by forcing them into a situation of having to grow quick cash crops that will go even to feed the interest on the debts incurred by them.  It is such an uneven game that all of us, particularly politicians, must cry out and use our political and international influence to get the cartels of banks and moneylenders to bring a halt to it, to put a moratorium on it, to decide that in some way they will allow the developing countries not alone to survive but to grow as they would wish themselves with the benign support of countries that have made it already.</P>
    <P>I will not go over ground that has been covered already by Deputies De Rossa, Higgins and others.  Perhaps I could cheer Deputy Higgins up a little by quoting from a book that he would probably feel should almost be censored were he not as liberal as he is.  I refer to the World Bank Annual Report of 1988.  Within that report there is an awareness and a consciousness that we can work on.  If we write into our agreement to conventions the solutions to the problems that the World Bank report is raising then we can be an influence and we can help to do what all of us in this House would like to do.  On page 22 of the report is what we all know to be the harsh reality:</P>
    <P>Improvements in the current balances of developing countries in 1987 reflect increased exports, as well as cutbacks in imports in the highly indebted, middle-income developing countries and low-income countries in Africa.  For these two groups of countries, estimates of recent growth in production generally remain low.</P>
    <P>Then they add what all of us have got to take on:</P>
    <P>Thus, differences in growth between the countries constrained by debt and those that do not have serious debt problems continue to be marked.</P>
    <P>They will continue to be marked and those countries constrained by debt will not have a chance of survival unless the <Col N="1573" /> richer countries and the money markets of this world come together to roll on that debt to dissolve it, to reduce it in some way.  Further on the report makes reference to technical assistance and this is something that we all feel a great sense of concern about, particularly when we talk about private investment and protecting private investment which this agreement would help.  I do not think that <i>carte blanche</i> should be given to private investment without a lot of conditions being written in as to how and where they can invest, from the point of view of the good of the host country and not of the investment company itself.  Again on page 78 of the report it is stated:</P>
    <P>The analysis concluded that effective utilisation, absorption, and sustainability of technical assistance were hampered by the fact that (a) it was often seen as being imposed by donors rather than being a response to local demand; (b) some technical-assistance projects were overdesigned, reflecting an unrealistic assessment of borrowers' needs; (c) resources and efforts were often dissipated because of lack of coordination among the donors.</P>
    <P>In another part of the report the very serious point, which Deputy Higgins has made, is referred to, that is, the lack of continuity, that can be promised within these.  Among the conditions we should write in is that the host country should not have the investment imposed and it should be in line with the development and benefit of that country and not the investment company itself.  Above all we should not get rid of our second rate or redundant weapons or machinery to Third World and developing countries who are not alone not trained to use them but, as a result, only incur a larger debt than they have already.</P>
    <P>The social implications of development from the first world, as we call it, are very serious as well.  The World Bank takes this into consideration also.  As a result of industrialisation and development in many of the developing countries hard problems follow which need solutions. Sometimes the solutions create problems <Col N="1574" /> that also need to be tackled.  Often there is an increase in consumer prices and a reduction in public employment which leads not alone to unemployment but to less than minimal basic wages for workers trying to get work elsewhere.  I would also try to put in a condition that when investment companies do invest there would be certain basic conditions of work and basic wages accompanying the investment that would not allow developing and Third World countries to be used as cheap labour with no national or personal development of their own.  It is interesting that in that respect the World Bank report tells us that some action programmes have been undertaken in several developing countries to try to counter this.  Again, I wonder if there is any area within our Department of Foreign Affairs that could keep a watching brief on these action programmes and projects that are being attempted in certain developing countries to see how effective they are or if we could learn from them and, hopefully, import them into other countries that might not yet have access to them; that is what dissemination of information is all about. For instance, the World Bank has created a task force on poverty and food security to prepare programmes to give priority to cost effective policies, to raise the income of people who are too poor to buy adequate amounts of food, and also to develop ways to stabilise incomes and prices and improve response to emergencies and increase the effectiveness of food aid.  The bank has not embarked on that just as an exercise in itself; what it wishes to do is to use the results of these task forces and projects that they have set up in conjunction with the donors and the agencies investing in such countries, so monitoring and learning from such projects is absolutely essential.</P>
    <P>As a developing country we should have a greater insight into what is involved.  We must ensure that development work takes account of the environment and the dignity of the people in the countries being assisted.  Very often development projects are terminated <Col N="1575" /> before they have an opportunity of succeeding because management structures of the First World are operated.  Often the responsibility is not delegated by the supporting agency and local people are seldom trained in management structures so that they can take over the project. That should be the ultimate objective of our aid programmes in developing countries. External agencies, in their efforts to succeed in Third World countries, on occasions damage the autonomy of those countries and their people.  Very often financial and training decisions are made without regard for the local people.</P>
    <P>When contributing to debates on developing countries I never miss an opportunity to refer to the role of women in them.  Members will be aware that many of the agricultural programmes in developing countries are initiated and carried through by women.  However, women are excluded from the decisionmaking process and training programmes. That is unfortunate and is to the detriment of many projects.  For example, the Netherlands and Sweden have instructed their diplomatic missions in several developing countries to help fund womens' groups and projects sponsored by women.  In fact, the Netherlands attached a condition to the overseas aid they give to the effect that women must be part of the project being established. I would like to see a similar condition attached to all projects.</P>
    <P>A great deal of the aid we give to developing countries goes towards the educating and training of the natives. However, disease is rampant and life expectancy is short.  Living conditions in most countries are unbearable.  There is a great need to concentrate on educating those people.  For instance, infant mortality, and the risks of maternal mortality, are very high in developing countries and much higher among mothers aged below 20 or over 35, for closely spaced pregnancies and for fourth or higher pregnancies. Due to constraints on the economies of those countries and the high infant mortality rate there is great pressure on mothers to produce many children <Col N="1576" /> in the hope that some of them will survive. That shortens the mother's life and leads to overcrowding.  Infant mortality rates in those countries are horrendous and none of us should feel happy about them.</P>
    <P>If family planning was practised extensively womens lives would be saved. There is a need to improve access to education in that area.  Women with four or more years of education have one to three children fewer than women with no education.  They are also more likely to use contraception.  However, women are still gravely disadvantaged in education. In 1984 in developing countries there were only 82 girls for every 100 boys in primary school and at secondary level only 69 girls for each 100 boys.  In 1985 the female illiteracy rate at 49 per cent of adult women was almost twice the male rate of 28 per cent.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs, and the Minister for Finance, to bear that incredibly important dimension in mind at all times.  In encouraging people to invest we should insist on protections for the people of the host countries rather than concentrating on the profit motive.  We should be embarrassed that we did not increase our overseas development aid.  Other member states, and Scandinavian countries, have endeavoured to reach their targets.  In fact, most countries increased their aid in times of recession.  Trócaire, in the course of a briefing document circulated to Members, pointed out that in the countries where the contribution was highest and where the UN target was reached, two factors were to the fore, the political will existed and the people were in favour of sending aid to developing countries. We can feel proud of the fact that the popular will exists here to aid the Third World.  We have poverty, unemployment and emigration here but last year Trócaire raised more than £3 million for developing countries.  Those who contributed to that campaign want the Government to match that figure.  Voluntary contributions have increased annually but the Government's aid has been cut.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1577" /> All parties should make a commitment to increase our contribution until we reach our target.  We have no idea of what can be done in developing countries because we do not debate the issue often enough.  I suggest that the Government establish a foreign affairs committee to deal with such issues.  If reports of such a committee were debated in the Houses of the Oireachtas we would learn of the problems of the Third World.  We should have a greater commitment to the people of the Third World.  We owe that to the people in the developing countries.  We have a real moral and Christian duty to them and Irish people in particular have a certain commitment in that area.  We also have a duty and a responsibility to report back to the Irish people who by their contribution have shown in the past that they wish this aid, not alone to continue but to increase.</P>

      <P>I am glad that the opportunity has presented itself so early since my appointment to use the occasion of this Bill to have a general debate on our overseas development aid.  Previous spokespersons from the party have indicated that while we in Fine Gael welcome the publication of this Bill which will allow ratification of the convention establishing a multilateral investment guarantee agency, we deplore every other aspect of this Government's action in relation to Ireland's overseas development assistance programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We welcome the fact that this Bill is before the House.  It gives us an opportunity for the first time since the publication of the Estimates of publicly airing our concern at the direction the Government are taking with regard to the total aid programme and in particular to the bilateral aid programme.  The financial commitment entered into as a result of the passing of this Bill today involves an increase in our multilateral commitment, but we note with concern that this seems <Col N="1578" /> to have been funded by cuts in our bilateral aid programme.  We find this totally unacceptable, given that bilateral aid goes to the poorest of the poor, for whom this agency will have little relevance.</P>
    <P>The agency is to be welcomed as a new agency of the World Bank.  In the context of our commitment to our EC partners we are obliged to implement this Bill and to proceed with commitments alrady entered into.  Deputy Michael Noonan, referred to the initiatives taken by Deputy John Bruton at European level to encourage our EC partners to move rapidly in developing this area so that extra resources would be directed into development.  This is very much needed to seek to reverse the outflow of resources from the developing countries into the developed areas, a point that was dealt with in detail by Deputy Noonan.</P>
    <P>It is a major shortcoming of the Bill that it will benefit the middle income developing countries and that the poorest of the poor, whom we target for bilateral aid, will be excluded.  It is relevant that we look at what we are doing to those countries.  We are single minded in saying to the Minister opposite that we are setting a mark that this must be the end of the decline and that we must return to the commitment we had undertaken along with our partners in the OECD to reach the UN target as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>Along with the attacks on health care, these unprecedented cuts over the past two years must rank as this Government's greatest shame.  In 18 months the Fianna Fáil Government have wiped out years of slow but steady progress towards achieving the UN targets established for all member countries.  There is obviously, as Deputy Barnes more generally put her finger on it a lack of political commitment and vision on the benches opposite.  I know this matter is not strictly the responsibility of the Minister for Finance. The Department of Foreign Affairs and the Department of the Taoiseach indeed all of us, have a responsibility to the world's poorest.  The Government do not seem to share the vision and commitment which shaped our development aid programme slowly along the right road from <Col N="1579" /> 1973.  This programme allowed us to hold our heads high and offer a lead to others in Europe and elsewhere in the world.</P>
    <P>Others have referred to the fact that we are not a highly developed country. We are not many generations removed from what these developing countries are currently experiencing.  It is because of that memory that we hold our commitments so strongly.  We are proud of our commitment from 1973 on.  We made progress &mdash; and I would remind the Minister that we initiated our programme of expanding our aid to the Third World at a time when we faced an oil crisis and very difficult financial circumstances.  We developed our bilateral aid programme and we moved slowly but steadily in the right direction.  What has happened in the past two years is unprecedented and has gone by without adequate comment in this House.</P>
    <P>The bilateral aid programme is not the only programme affected.  Twenty five children die every minute.  That figure is very hard to come to terms with but I would like that we in this House dwell on it.  We have been talking on this subject for a little over two and a quarter hours and during this time close to 1,000 children have died in the developing countries. That is a very real statistic.  I would like that we bear that fact in mind and that we strengthen our resolve to do what we as part of an international group in the UN have identified as the minimum required of the developed countries to contribute towards the development of the less developed countries.</P>
    <P>In the recently published Estimates our official aid was once again severely attacked.  This leaves us the third lowest of the OECD countries in the matter of the provision of aid.  In the recently published Estimates, bilateral aid which was pioneered by Ireland &mdash; and in which we gave the lead to many other countries &mdash; has been slashed again.  For the first time ever there is no provision for disaster relief in the major Estimates.  We are led to suppose that the lottery may help but that is an entirely inadequate response to <Col N="1580" /> disaster which is no uncommon occurrence in the Third World.  It is inevitable that there will be disaster.  There are constant disasters, and increasingly so, with climatic problems in recent years.  A provision for disaster relief is the minimum we should try to provide.  Certainly we should also have disaster relief funds available through the national lottery, as additional funds which may be available in response to a very great crisis.  Furthermore, there is no provision &mdash; and this was referred to by both Deputies McDowell and Higgins &mdash; other than a nominal £1,000 for a contribution to the UN world food programme, which traditionally came out of the agriculture Vote.  Perhaps we are to expect that this may be dealt with by way of lottery funds, I am not familiar with too many agricultural projects being supported from the lottery funds.  This is a further cut in aid of the most basic kind, food aid, which we have traditionally been associated with.</P>
    <P>Indeed, our disaster relief is a tradition which goes back to the fifties &mdash; well in advance of our overseas development aid programme &mdash; when we had very little to share.  Even if one could ignore the human, Christian and moral motivations which these cuts deeply offend, Trócaire pointed out recently that our investment in aid is recouped substantially by receipts in terms of salaries and contracts in the developing world.  That is a double edged sword and, as Deputy Noonan indicated, as it becomes attractive, motivations which were originally altruistic can change and, consequently, it is very necessary to watch carefully the motivation and the impact of what we do.  Deputy Higgins also aired this issue.</P>
    <P>Let us look at the history of Ireland's development policy.  As other members have said, it is based on our colonial relationship with Britain, which leaves us with a short enough memory, but it conditions public and political opinion towards a sympathetic attitude to the problems of developing countries.  Our approach developed an international context as a result of UN membership. Within the UN we found ourselves with <Col N="1581" /> an unique voice and an unique contribution to make by virtue of our experience.</P>
    <P>When we joined the EC we attempted to align ourselves with the Netherlands and Denmark who also had a positive approach towards the developing world and encouraged the formal incorporation of development aid as one of our basic objectives of Irish policy.  In 1973 the year in which we joined the EC there was for the first time commitment by the new Government to increase official development aid substantially and thereafter, in absolute terms, as a percentage of GNP in a planned manner over a period of years.  That was contained in a speech delivered by the then Minister for Foreign Affairs with Government approval. Therefore in 1973 we first stepped along the road towards official governmental commitment to an overseas development aid programme as an important part of our foreign affairs policy.  Each year since then we have moved along steadily until last year and this year.  Very difficult negotiations, with the many competing interests which there always are when it comes to budget times, have been eroded so substantially that when it comes to reinstating them, as I believe we must &mdash; and I hope there can be no argument against that from the Government side of the House &mdash; it will make it all the more difficult to get ourselves slowly back on the steps of progress which we all wish to take towards the UN target.</P>
    <P>In 1970 the UN established a target of .7 per cent of GNP as the desirable target to be reached.  In May 1973 we aimed at an annual increase of the order of .05 per cent of GNP.  Given the financial problems facing the State after the oil crisis this commitment was entered into with some hesitation.  A number of speakers concluded their contributions by asking, and I at this point ask the Minister who has a particular influence on budgetary matters, to relay to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, who we hope will have an ongoing interest in matters and influence in Europe&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and to the Government benches the single view of all Members of this House that we are disgracing ourselves and that we must return to establish a programme of steady progress towards achieving the UN target. The need is enormous and many Deputies in addressing this matter have referred to the need and have quoted from Trócaire's position paper both of this year and last year indicating that the problems instead of being alleviated in this decade have got worse; certainly in two of the major regions.  Malnutrition and disease caused the unnecessary deaths of some 14 million children under five every year during the first half of this decade.  While it is at its worst in Asia severe malnutrition has recently become wide-spread in sub-Saharan Africa, a most serious condition affecting the health of children.  Those details are contained in Trócaire's position paper of 1988.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The least developed countries to whom we in particular directed our bilateral aid are virtually entirely dependent on aid other than perhaps their single cash crop for which they are receiving the lowest prices for many years.  They are uniquely dependent on bilateral aid or direct cash aid from bilateral and multilateral agencies. In this context it is unacceptable that this is where we have chosen to make our cut.  It is also unacceptable, particularly in an EC and world environment where many of the countries involve themselves were colonising countries.  Irish agencies have easier access to these countries than do many of the larger countries due to their colonial associations, bitterness and problems arising out of historical relationships.  We were in a unique position to develop programmes and we took the lead.  We have developed a very high profile but that is all changed.  Deputy McDowell referred to the OECD's DAC report of the performance of each country in achieving their targets and indicated, quite rightly, that for the first time we were criticised strongly for failing to reach our targets and for cutting aid over and above even the level of general cutbacks implemented throughout the different sectors of the Government's <Col N="1583" /> budget.  Extraordinarily the development aid areas suffered more than the average cutback in all other Departments.</P>
    <P>The situation becomes even less defensible when we look at what is happening in most other developed countries who are also seeking to reach the UN target.  Some have reached it and exceeded it and have set their own targets in excess of the UN target of 0.7 per cent. Some of these countries have set targets of 1 per cent of GNP and even in excess of that figure.  While only four countries have exceeded the target, most countries have established steady programmes of increasing aid over a number of years in an attempt to reach the targets.  As regards the UK, Mrs. Thatcher came in for some comment from Deputy Higgins but even there the aid figures in the statement on public expenditure for January 1988 indicate an increase in aid expenditure in real terms over the next three years.  Provision for the overseas aid programme is planned to grow by an annual average of 4.8 per cent during the period 1987-88 to 1990-91.</P>
    <P>One of the interesting features of aid in all the programmes of the other countries is how they are beginning to select qualitatively the type of aid they will give. In the case of Japan the area of debt obligations is one they are examining closely.  In that context in the area where we excelled and where we were uniquely placed to move in in a sympathetic way where the doors would not be open to all other agencies in all other countries, we have cut off that area of activity and reduced it substantially in the last two years.</P>
    <P>Swiss aid increased by 4.7 per cent in national currency in 1987.  These figures largely relate to 1987 and as such the 1988 assessment will obviously leave us further out of line.  There the Confederation have projected in their current financial plan to represent about .35 per cent of GNP early in the next decade and they have selected particular aid programmes which they will support.  The Swedish ODA expands in real terms roughly in line with GNP growth.  At .85 per cent <Col N="1584" /> the Swedish ODA GNP ratio is among the highest in the DAC and is expected to remain at a very high level.  I could go on and list them all but I will not do that. There are perhaps only two or three other countries in the list who have cut their development aid and often it relates to the fact that they had a long period of expansion.  Most countries are moving steadily towards the target and, as I have said, most have agreed new initiatives in the areas which suit them.</P>
    <P>In that context I should like to return to the central reason for us in Fine Gael choosing this debate as an opportunity to hone in on this major change in policy in the past two years.  First, by way of an aside I should like to refer to the vision of Deputy McDowell and other members of the legal profession following perhaps the experience of one of our colleagues who went out to the Third World with optical equipment and who led a team of enthusiasts who wanted to offer their services in those countries.  Do I take it from that that Deputy McDowell is finding the direct political arena a little unsatisfactory, unsuitable, unrewarding or unfulfilling?</P>
    <P>As Deputy Barnes said, the challenge for us as politicians is to give the same priority to this very important programme as the public give to it and to reverse the trend of the past two years.  I hope that the Minister in his response will indicate where the Government stand in relation to our commitment to reach the UN target.  I hope he will reassure us that we will be back on line in the next budget and that no more estimates will be presented by the Fianna Fáil Government which will further cut aid or will not reverse the trend of the past two years.</P>

      <P>I will be brief in my contribution.  The first thing I want to do &mdash; and I imagine I will not be alone on this &mdash; is to welcome the Bill before the House.  Private investment and private enterprise have an important role to play in the Third World and the risks of investment are such that in the absence of effective guarantees, whether on the basis of individual countries putting <Col N="1585" /> schemes in operation or a multilateral approach, people will be very reluctant to invest.  Consequently, I welcome the Bill.</P>
      <P>It is worth saying that what we are about here is a guarantee scheme and that the nature of a guarantee scheme is that it is a fall back mechanism.  Effectively it says to people who have made investment decisions &ldquo;You are not sticking your neck our completely and there is some kind of a long stop or safeguard&rdquo;. We hope that the existence of that long stop or safeguard will tip the balance in favour of a decision to invest in a developing country.  However, that is all it can do; it can only tip the balance and it clearly will not cause people to invest if they believe there is no possibility whatever of a return on an investment.</P>
      <P>One of the things which is striking is the extent to which much of the Third World &mdash; and I am generalising here &mdash; has become more open to the private sector and private investment in recent years.  For example, the number of countries in Africa with notionally Marxist governments which have promulgated legislation on profits and repatriation of profits would do credit to many of us who like to think of ourselves as living in an open and mixed economy.  If one looks, for example, at the investment legislation in Mozambique I think it is fair to say that it represents a headline which many of us would have few difficulties with.  If one looks at the legislation that was put through during the past three of four years in Tanzania &mdash; a country which historically had a very centralised socialist society &mdash; again the change is towards a much more receptive climate for the private sector.</P>

      <P>I think it is fair to say that by and large the climate is increasingly sympathetic to private investment.  Difficulties remain and it is appropriate that those who seek to assist should be prepared to raise those difficulties and discuss them with the countries which are now seeking investment. Certainly one of those difficulties is the extent to which many of these countries are extraordinarily bureaucratic.  Some time ago I had an opportunity to attend a conference of the SADCC and at that conference the general secretary, Dr. Malone, conceded that it was hardly an inducement to foreign investment for a would-be industrialist, when he turns up at an airport, to be invited to change a certain amount of currency into the local currency but during the rest of the time he is there not allowed to spend the local currency and then have to labour with little prospect of success to change it back into a hard currency on his way out.  It is appropriate that we say to countries which seek investment and which we want to encourage to obtain investment, and in order to assist them obtaining investment are prepared to put this guarantee scheme in place &mdash; that whatever they can do to make their climate for private investment more attractive will certainly prove very worthwhile.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems that the argument for us playing our part in responding to the needs of the developing world are absolutely overwhelming and that they exist on all sorts of different levels.  I suppose the most compelling argument of all has to be the basic one couched in terms of humanity or morality &mdash; the need to respond to people who are suffering. During the course of the debate people have itemised what form that suffering <Col N="1587" /> takes &mdash; children dying from easily preventable diseases or subcontinents experiencing grave food shortages.  Perhaps the most basic argument is the absolute human obligation to respond to those who are in need.</P>
    <P>There is, too, a need to respond just in terms of what one might describe as enlightened self-interest.  As a small country which does not invest heavily in defence or whatever, obviously we have a particular interest in a stable world order but a situation in which much of the world finds itself in grinding poverty is not conducive to the creation of such an order.  Again in the area of enlightened self-interest we live by trade and we clearly have an interest in achieving a situation where there are more potential customers around who will be in a position to trade with us and, most specifically, people who will be in a position to buy our goods.</P>
    <P>Other speakers have mentioned the fact that there is a direct economic benefit in terms of our ability to create jobs in the semi-State sector through consultancies and so on and the fact that very many Irish people have found employment either with the various international agencies or are directly employed in our own programme.  It has often struck me that it is appropriate to regard this question of working in the Third World, whether in a voluntary capacity or in a professional capacity, as a significant &mdash; though obviously limited &mdash; element in Irish manpower policy and that this should be built into our various calculations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think Deputy Flaherty should be pressed on this point.  She cannot be entirely objective.</P>
      <P>The other reason we should enthusiastically involve ourselves is that there is the clearest possible evidence that it works.  It seems to me that some times people have a tendency to say, &ldquo;The Third World will always be with us,&rdquo; as people at one time were wont to say &ldquo;The poor will always be with us,&rdquo; and that they will contribute, whether as individuals on a voluntary basis or whether they do their bit as a government, but they ask what it is actually achieving.  It is achieving a great deal.  Much has been achieved in the space of the last two decades.  In the early sixties the stories that dominated the newspapers were of food shortages in India and China.  These countries are now self sufficient, in part because of outside assistance, in part because of sensible domestic policies and in part because of their ability to harness technology and produce drought resistant strains of grain and rice and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we are prepared to put the effort and resources in, the results can be obtained. Does it really matter as to what role we play, whether we hover around 0.23 per cent of GNP as we have tended to in recent years, or whether we attain the UN target, seeing that it is not a great deal of money one way or the other?  It does matter because, particularly since our membership of the UN, we have carved out quite a distinctive niche for ourselves and this means that in the past we have had a voice that was listened to with some respect.  The fact that our aid has always been other than in the form of loans, that our aid has never been tied and has always been non directive, responding to the needs and wishes of our partner countries, rather than on the basis of what we think is best for them, means that we have been able to <Col N="1589" /> approach the question on a somewhat different basis from some of the more traditional donors, that we have been able to have a common cause with a number of other countries who have a similar philosophical position.  We did so through the so-called like minded group when we got together to talk with people like the Scandinavians, the Canadians, the Dutch and so on.</P>
    <P>The fact that so much of our activity is on a co-funding basis, harnessing the enthusiasm of the non Governmental organisations in a way that does not happen anywhere else and that we have so many micro projects, mean that our aid programme in the past has been worthwhile.  That means that it is not just a question of how much money we put in.  It means that we have something to say at meetings of the DAC of the OECD and that we have something to say when aid questions come up to be discussed by the European Community.  As a country which had a small but growing and appreciated programme that at this stage had received a very enthusiastic endorsement from the DAC, we could speak with some conviction.  We did not simply ask other countries to put their money in.  We have shown our seriousness by putting our money in.  But the real tragedy of the reverse that has taken place is not so much that some Irish programmes will not now take place, because often the volume of activity that we will manage will be influenced as much by what happens on the crunch option as by what is put in or out of the Estimates.  The direct relationship between activity and what is in the Estimates is not as clear cut as many would believe.  By halting and reversing what has been a growing programme you lose all credibility and all right to exhort others to greater effort. That is very disappointing indeed.</P>
    <P>I have a certain understanding and sympathy with the Minister of State with responsibility in these areas in the difficulty in which he finds himself.  I realise that it is not easy to defend a budget aimed at the developing world and that it is not easy, given that so many of our <Col N="1590" /> products are health and education projects, at a time when we are cutting back on health and education at home, to say that we want to increase our programmes for technological education in Lesotho. There is an apparent contradiction between spending less on the VEC system at home and more on technological education in Lesotho.  I understand the Minister's difficulties but they will continue so long as it is left to the Minister of State to take his chance on the annual Estimate procedure.  For that reason there is a very strong argument for us to approach this on an all party basis and take the question of development aid outside of the normal budgetary process.</P>
    <P>We should set ourselves modest targets to increase our aid programme to an agreed figure over the period of the next five or ten years, a figure that would be accepted by all parties in the House so that when individual estimates are being considered, that money would be spoken for and it would not be a question of having to decide whether to go forward, backwards or stand still in a given year. Everyone would known that all the parties had committed themselves to programmed growth at specified rates.  Only by that approach will we make progress. If we fail to do that nobody will be able to plan.</P>
    <P>If one wants to build a school or a hospital in Leitrim, if the money is in the Estimates, one can make reasonable headway with the building during the period for which the money is provided. However, the lead-in time between taking a decision here and being able to carry it out at a distance of some thousands of miles, in a bureaucratic society, is a very long one indeed.  That means that for people not to be able to plan with any certainty some years in advance is a very serious impediment.  It means that we do not get the value that we would otherwise get for the money we spend because people are not in a position to know which programmes they can invest in, maintain at an existing level or expand.  Our failure to do that means that our aid is less effective.  The only way we <Col N="1591" /> can give confidence to those involved is if we agree to approach this on an all party basis.  That would have to be on the basis that it was being approached without prejudice.  I can well imagine that the Minister for Finance would make an exception and agree that something sought was laudible and that the aspirations of people were admirable, but if one were to start making exceptions we would be told that everything was a special case.  If we decide that we will not impose limits on our expenditure on development aid, we will then be told that education or health or the need to develop agriculture are all special cases. I have no doubt that some people would seek to treat as a precedent any concession granted on the overseas development area.  For that reason there should be all-party agreement that development aid would grow, but that that would carry no messages for any other area of public expenditure.  I make no secret of the fact that I support the idea of controlling public expenditure and that I am prepared to tolerate some very unpalatable decisions to have that achieved domestically, but the people of the Third World should not be co-victims of our own profligacy of the past.</P>

      <P>Perhaps I can convince my colleague, Deputy Higgins, to join in the all-party approach acceding to the establishment of this body.  There may be some aspects of my speech other than those related to its direct establishment in which I would have his total agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is quite clear that the establishment of this body will help to encourage foreign investment in developing countries.  It is an additional instrument by which countries in the Third World can be helped, <Col N="1592" /> and from that point of view it is to be welcomed.  In many discussions in international fora I detected an attitude, particularly among speakers from the United States and to some extent from the United Kindgdom, that help to the developing countries should be totally related to that kind of approach.  If that is the quibble being expressed by Deputy Higgins, then I can understand his viewpoint. I see the establishment of MIGA as an additional instrument and not a substitution for other forms of support and aid for countries of the third World. I believe it will be a useful body which may over a period make an impact, but I do not expect miracles.  The amount of funding in which we are involved &mdash; a total of £275,000 &mdash; is a drop in the ocean, but let us not at the christening of this new body set it off without our full blessing and benediction.  I support the Minister in getting this through the House.  It is well to recall the efforts of his predecessor, Deputy John Bruton, who was instrumental in securing the support of EC member states for this approach.  I fully support the Bill, with the reservation that we should not expect too much from the establishment of this body.</P>
    <P>The debate has opened up the broader issue of ODA and many of my colleagues have given their view.  It is important that all Members of the House should indicate to the Government their alarm and reaction to the trend which has developed.  I am one who has been fully supportive of the efforts of this Government at macro level to restore this country to solvency, although I have some serious reservations at micro level.  I press upon the Minister that the restoration of solvency must not be done at the expense of people dying of hunger and starvation in the Third World.  Effectively this is what has happened. ODA has been seen as a soft target by the Government.  I voice my objection to that approach.  It is not enough to pay lip service to reaching the UN target or making other advances in the area of overseas aid and development co-operation.  Actions must match words. Over the years there has been a lot of lip service from the colleagues of the <Col N="1593" /> Minister for Finance but actions have not matched words.  The slashing of the ODA budget in the past two years has set back the cause of development co-operation to an enormous extent.  It is appropriate that Members should strongly express their disapproval of that course of action by the Government.  It has been accompanied by a degree of cynical hypocrisy in relation to our obligation to the Third World, which does not help those who are anxious to encourage development co-operation.  We should use the opportunity of this debate to make a plea to the Minister and his colleagues in Government to change course and consider an all-party approach to a planned programme of overseas aid, restoring it initially to the level at which we left it and gradually expanding on a phased basis towards the UN target.  That is the only way in which to take this whole matter out of party politics and make a positive programmed advance towards the target to which we all committed ourselves many years ago.</P>
    <P>It is relevant to look at the background. We in Europe can remember a time when this Continent did not enjoy full and plenty.  Folktales in Ireland bring us back to the time of our own famine.  Those who have read and talked about the famine must feel a twinge of conscience which would affect even the most hard hearted, knowing that on this very day hundreds of millions are at starvation level and thousands, including the very young and the very old, will not survive into the morrow.  I do not think that a country like ours which suffered in the past, particularly in the last century, can overlook that fact.  Perhaps with the pressures of life it is easy to close our minds to it but we must not do so.  It is happening today and it will happen tomorrow.  Clearly it calls for a response. It is salutary to recall that it is not very long ago that the Marshall Plan was responsible for huge shipments of food and other assistance to Europe in the late forties and early fifties.  Many of us can remember it to some degree.  Right into the sixties this country was a recipient of aid from the UN special fund.  That is <Col N="1594" /> the background for us in Ireland and in Europe.  The position has largely turned around for the EC and for us, despite our problems.  When we talk about poverty in this country it must be clearly realised that the kind of poverty we are talking about bears no relationship to that in the worst situations in the developing world.</P>
    <P>Over the years this country has had a marvellous tradition whereby the flag has been carried, mainly by our missionaries, to virtually all parts of the developing world.  It is in relatively recent times that we have had the establishment of an official aid programme, leading to the establishment of the bilateral aid programme by the national Coalition Government in 1974.  I think it can be fairly said that this marked a turning point in the development of our official development assistance.  This included the establishment of the agency for personal service overseas, the identification of priority countries and the establishment of various projects and programmes there.</P>

    <P>The following motion was moved by <Col N="1595" /> Deputy Yates on Tuesday, 25 October, 1988:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That Dáil Éireann, sharing the serious public concern about the quality of health care, calls for a fundamental re-organisation of the delivery of health services, in order to free resources which could then be used selectively to improve the quality of service and expand the provision for priority needs.  The following reforms are required:</P>
    <P>1.  The establishment of An Bord Sláinte, a semi-State body, to replace the Health Boards and streamline the management and delivery of health services.</P>
    <P>2.  Cost-cutting reforms in the areas of administration, the purchase of medical and non-medical supplies, certain consultants fees, the rationalisation of laboratory facilities, the greater use of computerisation and better property management.</P>
    <P>3.  A revision of the method of funding voluntary public hospitals by the introduction of clinical budgeting and separate ear-marked allocations for National Tertiary Services.</P>
    <P>4.  The appointment in each hospital of a general manager.</P>
    <P>5.  Hospital managers and An Bord Sláinte should be specifically charged with ensuring much greater co-ordination between hospitals and Community and Primary Care Services.</P>
    <P>6.  An Bord Sláinte should draw up and implement a National Hospital Plan for acute services, including the concentration of the most modern equipment and advanced skills in regional centres of excellence, where they can be fully utilised to the benefit of the community.  These centres should be backed up by the complementary provision of local hospitals with specified levels of care.</P>
    <P>7.  Improved medical management through greater development of General <Col N="1596" /> Practitioner Services including improved access to Hospital Diagnostic Services and Consultant opinion.</P>
    <P>8.  The re-examination of methods of payment for health care on the basis of giving incentives to preventative medicine and positive health activities.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 3:</P>
    <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;priority needs&rdquo; in the fourth line and substitute the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Recognising that it is now estimated that in excess of 10,000 public patients are on waiting lists for hospital admission, many of whom are awaiting hospitalisation for over 12 months, calls on the Minister for Health to:</P>
    <P>1.  Introduce a new funding system for hospitals which would guarantee equality of access to essential services for public and private patients.</P>
    <P>2.  Alter the present arrangements where by a large number of hospital beds are currently occupied by long stay patients at a cost of up to £1,400.00 per week, many of whom could be more appropriately cared for in properly regulated nursing homes for a quarter of the cost.</P>
    <P>3.  Improve the incentives for General Practitioners to become more involved in many diagnostic services and thereby releasing much of the unnecessary pressure on hospital services.</P>
    <P>4.  Promote practical proposals for the development of community health care, involving an expansion of the home-help and community nursing services, and</P>
    <P>5.  Rationalise the number of Health Boards given that one of the existing eight, the Eastern Health Board, caters for 41 per cent of the population.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I am grateful to you, a Cheann Comhairle.  I was in the process last week of commenting on the motion in the name of the Fine Gael Party and the substantial amendment put down by the Labour Party on the whole area of health expenditure.  Last week I indicated the existing crisis in the health services, a crisis brought about by lack of resources and not in any way by administrative difficulties.  I have stated emphatically that the Labour Party have no difficulty in addressing any proposals to restructure the health proposals, or any proposals to deliver services more efficiently.  I have also stated quite emphatically that it is a delusion and a smokescreen to suggest that the crisis, which everybody acknowledges now except apparently the Minister, within the health services can be solved by some sleight of hand through reorganising administration.  To that end, we do not intend letting the Fianna Fáil Party, or indeed the Fine Gael Party, off the crucial hook, which is that resources must be provided to enable the health services to survive and to provide facilities and services to the people.</P>
      <P>I gave comparisons last week, one of which was in relation to our expenditure as expressed as a percentage of GNP.  I said that under the stewardship of the former Minister, Deputy Desmond, expenditure on the health services was maintained at 7 per cent of GNP and that from the time of the election of this Government, despite their promises and hypes during the election campaign, expenditure as a percentage of GNP has been consistently curtailed, from 6.6 per cent of GNP in 1987 to 6.4 per cent in 1988 and now to the expected 6.2 per cent for next year according to the Estimates. That was the Estimate that was put before us last week, supported not alone by the Government but by Fine Gael and the Progressive Democrats.  The crucial issue is the amount of money to be made available to run the health services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1598" /> We heard with interest the Minister of State's contribution last week when he said: &ldquo;I must confess at being somewhat mystified as to the source of the Labour Party's figure for GNP.&rdquo;  To ease the Minister's mystification, I will give him the source.  It is page 14 of the Estimates for the Public Services 1989, published by his Government.  It would be interesting to hear if the Minister has somehow changed the Estimates, or is he adding in capital expenditure, or something else to come up with the figure of 7.1 per cent that he indicated to the House last week?</P>
    <P>We need to get some basic facts straight.  The last time international comparisons about health spending were gathered was in 1984, when the OECD published a major study on the subject. I said last week that at that time Ireland spent 6.9 per cent of GNP on health when the overall average there was 5.6 per cent.  Our expenditure is not outside the European norm, despite our very high dependency ratios.  What we are asking for is simply the maintenance of expenditure, not the savage cuts that have been implemented by this administration.  We have asked that the Minister will acknowledge the crisis and not try to fudge the issues.</P>
    <P>The Fine Gael Party have produced many red herrings throughout this debate.  I see on today's Order Paper a raft of questions from the Fine Gael spokesman on Health directed to the Minister asking again and again for extra expenditure.  They cannot play the game both ways.  They cannot ask for extra expenditure, playing to every lobby, and at the same time say that they are satisfied with the overall expenditure.  The Fine Gael spokesman called for us to establish a target of 3 per cent for administration costs.  If we are to meet that target there are at least some parts of the country where additional administrative staff would have to be employed because there are health boards and hospitals where the cost of administration is considerably less than 3 per cent of the total budget.</P>
    <P>Even if the total cost of administration <Col N="1599" /> is more than 3 per cent, how do Fine Gael propose to add extra beds and nursing and medical staff from the paltry savings that would be made from firing some essential clerical workers now employed?  It would be interesting to quantify all those who are designated administrative workers, because, as I have stated before, many of these are people who are front line deliverers of services, community welfare officers, social workers and the like.  What experience leads Fine Gael to the view that increased centralisation will lead to less administration?  Have they forgotten that the creation of the health boards was a move away from local administration of the health services, which was based on a county administration structure prior to the establishment of the health boards? If the regionalisation of the health services led to more administration, as it did, why would further concentration of power in Dublin be a solution to the problem?</P>
    <P>I might suggest to Fine Gael that if they want to see how centralisation affects staffing they might look at another Government Department, the Department of Agriculture, where it takes more than 4,000 civil servants to deliver services that contain a fraction of the complexity of the caring services.  The 300 civil servants employed by the Department of Health, looked at in that light, can hardly be accused of being a substantial burden on the service.  Health is not like a factory.  One cannot decide that what was done with a service like Posts and Telegraphs, or what was done with CIE can apply to the health services and everything will be all right.  This issue must be looked at from the perspective of the kind of society we want here.  Do we really want a society in which only those who can afford care will get it, because that is what is happening?  For entirely material reasons we have begun to abandon the commitment that once reflected us in a better light.  Even at its most basic we were people who believed in looking after our own, particularly the weak.  Now, that is all gone, or at least <Col N="1600" /> Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael are determined to undermine it, to change it to a philosophy in which, in the words of Neil Kinnock, the only word is &ldquo;me&rdquo; and the only time is &ldquo;now&rdquo;.  That is not the kind of society for which I want to stand.  I do not believe that is the kind of society the vast majority of our people want to create.</P>
    <P>That is why, in the Labour Party amendment, we propose that the only acceptable target would be 7 per cent of GNP on health spending.  Within that target there is still plenty of room to deliver a health service that, in turn, will deliver care to the point of need as efficiently and effectively as posible.  No other target is worth aiming at.</P>
    <P>This evening the Labour Party will not allow Fine Gael or the Progressive Democrats to distance themselves from the coalition they have established with this administration, and from the responsibility they share with Fianna Fáil for the savagery that is affecting and dismantling the health services throughout the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be brief.  In fact I do not need a great deal of time to pour scorn on this proposal.  It strikes me that the central issue before us is the proposition by Deputy Yates that the replacement of the eight single health boards obtaining by a single State-sponsored body in some way would be an improvement. Very seldom do I agree with Deputy Howlin.  Had I more time I would deal with some of the mischievous bunkum he put about this House today and last week.  The reality is that the proposition before us &mdash; that we can improve our delivery of health services by creating a more centralised structure &mdash; is a dangerous myth.  I am pleased that at least some of the Opposition parties see that it is a myth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There were a couple of points raised <Col N="1601" /> by Deputy Yates last week I must touch on.  Throughout a long, detailed speech the word &ldquo;care&rdquo; was conspicuously missing. The reality is, if we are to do something about the health services, we will not do so by self-delusion.  If the concept is that a State-sponsored body on the lines of, say, Telecom Éireann, An Post or the ESB in some way would be a more caring structure than the eight obtaining health boards or constitute an improvement, well then God help us.  It strikes me as extraordinary that anybody should propagate this mythology in this House at this time.  A debate on the health services is a serious issue.  If there is to be a responsible debate on the health services it must be conducted at a serious level. The argument put forward by Deputy Yates last week is not a serious one, the proposition is not a serious one and is deserving of rejection on those grounds.</P>
    <P>As a member of a health board it is my belief that, within the health administration, there is far too much centralisation. The boards, if they have a fault &mdash; and particularly the Eastern Health Board of which I am a member &mdash; it is that they are centralised.  Indeed the movement to the health boards away from county administration of the health services in 1971 was a move that was in accord with thinking in public administration at that time.  But to suggest we should move the full way and centralise these services under a State-sponsored body which would deliver caring services in the sort of structure obtaining in, say, the ESB is a dangerous myth.  Hopefully that myth will be debunked here this evening.</P>

To his credit, that was a point Deputy Yates made last week.  If I sat where Deputy <Col N="1602" /> Yates now is I can assure him that if I were concerned and a spokesperson of a political party wishing to be considered a serious political party I would not come up with this sort of ráiméis for the improvement of health administration. There is nothing to commend what Deputy Yates had to say last week.</P>

      <P>There were a number of issues raised in this debate, an important one, because what the Fine Gael motion set out to do was to acknowledge that there was a health crisis and to say that, yes, some aspects of resolving that crisis need the targeting of money in certain areas towards the patient.  I went to the trouble &mdash; which is fairly unique in Opposition &mdash; of actually saying, within the health budget, where the money would come from.  Indeed I have drawn the ire of different sectors in health by saying specifically that they were either ripping off the system, in the case of pathologists, or in relation to over-administration, that we were paying too much for drugs and so on.  In response to that motion the Minister had this to say:</P>
      <P>I must firstly reject utterly the suggestion that there is a problem about the quality of health care in this country.</P>
      <P>&mdash; and he underlined the point.  Nobody else believes that.  It is as simple as that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Only this afternoon most of my questions to the Minister were ones of information. I asked about three areas and their waiting lists.  These are the Minister's figures, not mine: in-patient for orthopaedic surgery &mdash; those are people in pain awaiting hip operations &mdash; 7,200; out-patient, 9,200; ENT &mdash; many children requiring urgent treatment such as tonsillectomies, grommets and so on, 3,000; opthalmology, such as cataracts on <Col N="1603" /> eyes, where treatment at the right time is very important, over 3,000.  Those are just three areas and I could have gone into many more.  Therefore, it will be seen that there is a problem about the quality of the health service.</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;the point is lost.  If one cannot get the service when it is needed, then it is a poor quality service.  There are also major gaps in the service which I have outlined.  For example, the dental service is not satisfactory and the Minister knows it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Fair enough.  But there was a scheme called the <i>ad hoc</i> scheme whereby a medical card holder could be referred to a general practitioner dentist and avail of his services.  That has been abolished.  There is not an orthodontic service and there are 23,000 people awaiting such treatment.  In relation to geriatric people there is not a comprehensive set of geriatric units across the country.  In each community care area, there is not the appropriate care for geriatrics. There is a limbo between psychiatric care, community care and acute care, in some cases, very expensive acute care.  Coming into the winter I fear for some geriatric patients.  We have closed some less expensive convalescent care hospitals with detrimental effects.  Of course it was not the Minister who decided this.  He was very clever; he said: we impose a cash limit and an embargo <Col N="1604" /> and left the health boards to do the dirty work.</P>

      <P>The point has been made in relation to the Labour Party &mdash; and I listened with interest to what they had to say &mdash; that we should really get down to the issue of spending more money on health.  There is no doubt but that more money could be spent on health&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I could willingly convince my colleagues and this House to throw £500 million more at the health services, getting a better service for the mentally handicapped, getting all of the services we need, both in-patient and in relation to community care.  It would be a good thing socially and otherwise.  But the fact of the matter is that the people who argue for more money for health care argue for more money for education, more money for social welfare to deal with poverty, more money for State industry to create State jobs while at the same time, Deputy Spring comes forward with a policy to reduce the PAYE burden.  Each of those is laudable in itself and I will not criticise them&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>If you add up the sum total of all those things the arithmetic does not equal socialism.  Unfortunately it equals irresponsibility because, under this Government, the national debt has risen by £2 billion.  The Minister wrings his hands and says that the health service is about caring.  I received information in answer to a Dáil question that the Minister's public relations advisers are being paid £26,000 to tell him that we need <Col N="1605" /> a caring Minister with a good bedside manner&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us not be confused by this camouflage.  We all care.  The reason Fine Gael put down this motion is because we are very concerned.  Indeed, we are so concerned that we have gone to the trouble of saying where the money will be found and we have listed the inefficiencies and wastage.</P>
      <P>In relation to wastage, yesterday there was a massive increase in the cost of drugs.  The Bill for drugs in 1988 is something in the region of £120 million, five years ago it was £85 million.  The increase is totally unjustified.  The very same drugs can be bought in Belgium, Italy, Spain and France at, in some cases, one-third of the price.  If there was an argument that these drugs should be bought to maintain Irish jobs or because of a deal with Irish pharmaceutical companies, it might be justified but only 5 per cent of the drugs used in the health service are made in Ireland.  We have linked the prices we pay to the UK.</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>It is unjustified and it is remarkable that when there is a lack of care for patients the Minister can stand over a situation where multinationals are ripping off the Irish taxpayer.  It is simply unacceptable.  When the original deal was completed the climate was totally different. The Minister knows that and he also knows that hospitals do not benefit from major elements of the agreement with the GMS in terms of the 104 per cent trade rated average and the 5 per cent <Col N="1606" /> rebate.  Hospitals buy in bulk so they are paying even more for drugs.</P>
      <P>I was surprised to learn, in reply to another Dáil question, that over 7,000 people are involved in administration in the health service.  Some managers, for whom I have a great deal of respect &mdash; many of them are underpaid and are moving to the private sector &mdash; say that they run very efficient health boards. They are correct but they are confusing management expenditure with administration expenditure.  I am trying to point out that, in the non-care areas such as laboratories, medical records and so on as opposed to people behind desks, we are spending too much.  In some cases, the Minister has refused to invest small amounts of money in computerisation which could save a lot of money.  I will give one example in this regard.  Cork Regional Hospital spent £60,000 on a thermostat to control the heating so that it would not be full on with the window open.  They needed that money to save £100,000 per year.  That is the kind of logic I am trying to bring into the health services and not a bord sláinte to get rid of eight health boards as Deputy Roche said.  I am talking about dozens of voluntary public hospitals which operate in total isolation with certain prima donnas saying how things should be run.  They are not subject to any control and when there is a disaster and people are on trolleys the Minister has to send his chief medical officer scurrying to do reports on Temple Street and the Meath.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>The people responsible for the GP service have little or no relationship with the consumers of £720 million of hospital expenditure.  There are scores of voluntary organisations contracting for services and other individual boards.  In the delivery of health care they should all be on the same team.  The health service is over-administered and undermanaged. It does not focus on the patient or allocate money for patients.  Very large sums of money are allocated to individual hospitals but the Minister does not insist on the level of care they provide.  In one public statement, he said that is all he intended to do.  If there is to be an organised health service it must be streamlined.</P>
      <P>I put forward an argument for clinical budgeting which requires a certain amount of information technology but which will save money.  The present system says that if a hospital has underbudgeted it will be screwed next year. The Minister penalises efficiency and gives no incentive for good management. The Labour Party are perfectly entitled to give their views on the overall question of resources to all the spending Departments but this motion does not seek to merely get into that debate again.  We are talking about the way the health service is run and the important thing is to direct the money towards the patient.  That is what this motion seeks to do although I am disappointed that neither private medicine, nor any point of ideology was mentioned&mdash;&mdash;</P>

At the end of the day the Dáil is given an opportunity, through this constructive, positive motion, to state where the resources should be targeted and to do the type of things which the good managers in the health service want to do.

When Deputy Desmond was Minister he was supportive of the bord sláinte proposals.  The reform issues have been ducked and dodged by the Minister and he has deliberately stepped back in a very cute political way with the best political advice.  The result is that there are cash limits and an embargo. Just because the dental service is nonstatutory it must go.  Is that good planning? Does it have regard for the patient? No.  The Minister's record on hospital planning leaves a lot to be desired as is evident from his own health board area who passed a judgment on his performance.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;care&rdquo; in the second line and insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(i)  notes the Exchequer expenditure on the health services has been progressively cut back each year, from 7 per cent of GNP in 1986 to 6.6 per cent of GNP in 1987, 6.4 per cent of GNP in 1988, and to an expected 6.2 per cent in 1989;</P>
      <P>(ii)  further notes that as a consequence, health expenditure in Ireland, which was higher than the OECD average until 1986, is now substantially below the OECD average, particularly having regard to the high dependency ratio in Ireland;</P>
      <P>(iii)  believes that there is now a major crisis in the health services, which will, in the absence of emergency action, cause loss of life and very considerable hardship throughout the community;</P>
      <P>(iv)  believes also that there are gross inequalities in the delivery of care, as a result of the emergence of a two-tier system of health care, which has already been condemned by many organisations including the Churches;</P>
      <P>(v)  asserts that these crises must be resolved immediately, and cannot be resolved in the short term by improvements in administration, however desirable they may be in the longer term;</P>
      <P>(vi)  notes that the Government, in addition to making substantial savings as a result of underspending (in overall terms) in the current year, has also received substantial amounts of revenue over and above expectations, through the Tax Amnesty and other sources;</P>
      <P>(vii)  resolves therefore that a proportion of those savings and additional revenue, at least sufficient to restore health expenditure to its 1986 level of 7 per cent of GNP, should be set aside and allocated to the Health Estimate for 1989, and instructs the Government to make this additional allocation immediately.&rdquo;</P>

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - Protection of Part-Time Workers (Employment) Bill, 1988: First Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Debate resumed on the following Motion:</P>
    <P>That leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to provide for equal treatment of part-time workers and to make unlawful in relation to their employment certain kinds of treatment.</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash; (Deputy De Rossa.)</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that the Minister has not found it possible, so far at any rate, to withdraw his opposition to the Bill.  In moving the motion for leave to introduce this Private Members' Bill, it is important to note that what the Bill proposes to do is to extend legal protection to part time workers who have to work fewer than 18 hours a week because that is the period for which they are employed.</P>
    <P>The fact that many workers now enjoy this protection is as a result of long years of campaigning by the labour and trade union movement.  Unfortunately, many part time workers do not enjoy that protection.  The trade union movement have been campaigning for many years for the extension of this protection to part time workers.  This Bill is an effort by The Worker's Party to have the protection of the law extended to those who are without legal protection &mdash; and I understand <Col N="1620" /> officially that is about 20,000 workers at present &mdash; and those who work fewer than 18 hours per week, many of whom are existing on pay levels well below the poverty line.</P>
    <P>The nature of the workforce is changing rapidly and there is a need for legislation to keep up with the changing trends.  Employers are looking for what they call a &ldquo;flexible&rdquo; workforce and indeed there should be no problem with this provided that all workers are given the basic protection of the law and that &ldquo;flexible&rdquo; does not mean exploitable or expendable.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that employing part time workers for fewer than 18 hours per week can be very attractive for employers as they can hire and fire with impunity. This creates an atmosphere of fear in the workplace with employees reluctant to seek improvements in their wages and conditions in case they lose their jobs, as has happened.  There is also no doubt that the absence of adequate protection for part time workers encourages people to remain in the black economy.  Therefore, a measure such as this could have a very positive spin off by making it attractive of part time workers to come into the white economy, thereby increasing revenue from employers' tax and PRSI contributions. At present, those who work fewer than 18 hours per week are not covered by the Redundancy Payments Acts, the Maternity (Protection of Employees) Act, the Protection of Employment Insolvency Act, the Unfair Dismissals Act, the Holidays Act or the Minimum Notice Act.</P>
    <P>Our Bill seeks to extend the protection of these pieces of legislation to all workers.  The European Community is very keen on the principle of equal treatment, but that principle particularly coming up to 1992 must be broader than simply the question of equality for men and women.  The principle of equal treatment should be applicable to all workers and those who are forced by circumstances to work fewer hours than the norm should not be discriminated against.  Social protection for workers in most EC countries is stronger and better <Col N="1621" /> than in Ireland.  Indeed, in 1982 a draft EC directive on protection for part-time workers was prepared, but its progress was blocked by conservative elements in the EC.  In drafting this Bill we have had regard to that draft EC directive and also to the ICTU proposals made to the Minister for Labour which arose from a submission made under the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>.  This Bill seeks to extend employee protection legislation to part time workers.  We recognise that the separate problem of extending full social welfare rights to part-time workers would need to be addressed in another Bill on which we are working.  The cost implications of extending the protections envisaged in our Bill would be negligible. It would require a .8 per cent increase in employers' PRSI, of 80p per £100 of wages paid plus <i>pro rata</i> holiday pay for annual hours worked.</P>

      <P>The Government decision to oppose this Bill last week is quite extraordinary, because what they are doing is opposing even the printing and circulation of the Bill.  I have no doubt that the printing and circulation of this Bill would add considerably to the debate which is required on this issue.  It is only appropriate that a Bill on this issue from the Members of the House should be circulated.  As I have already indicated, the Labour Party, the Progressive Democrats, the Fine Gael Party and the Independents in this House have indicated their support for the printing and circulation of the Bill.</P>

      <P>The development of technology and the <Col N="1622" /> demands of the market are now such that many industries require employees to work atypical working patterns.  These include week on, week off, complex shift rotas or job sharing arrangements.  In addition the personal circumstances and choices of many people dictate a preference to work on a part-time or irregular basis.  In order to facilitate those employees who for family or other reasons wish to work on a part-time basis, and to provide a flexible labour market in a competitive economy, we must recognise the fact that part time and atypical work patterns will increasingly be a feature of the employment scene.</P>
      <P>At present, in this country, approximately one in every twenty employees is in regular part-time work.  The number of part-time employees has increased over the last ten years from 39,400 in 1977 to 57,700 in 1986.  Despite this increase, part-time employment still constitutes only a modest percentage of total employment.  It is important that the scale of part-time employment be realised.  Some of the more spectacular news reports might lead one to believe that we are becoming a nation of part-time workers.  The facts do not support this view.</P>
      <P>While many people doing part-time work seek full-time employment and would move given the opportunity, others voluntarily wish to continue working on this basis.  Information collected as part of the 1986 Labour Force Survey indicates that 46 per cent of women work part-time because of family responsibilities and 25 per cent because they do not want a full time job.  As almost three quarters &mdash; 74 per cent &mdash; of all part-time employees in Ireland are women, it is clear that part-time employment suits many of the workers who are employed on this basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The issue which we as legislators must address &mdash; and this is aside from considerations of motivation and statistics &mdash; is how best to regulate part-time employment. We must allow the potential of this sector of the employment market to be fully realised, while simultaneously affording basic rights to all workers <Col N="1623" /> employed on a regular basis.  A balanced legislative response is therefore called for.  One which excessively regulates part-time employment could discourage employers and reduce the employment potential of this sector.  A total lack of legislative protection leaves employees open to exploitation.</P>
    <P>I have been conscious of the need to review the position of part-time workers by reference to the labour legislation administered by my Department.  I have accordingly initiated a review of the situation regarding part-time employment and, as part of the consultative process, I wrote some time ago to both the ICTU and FUE asking for their views.  The social partners will approach the issue from their own perspectives.  In the interests of attaining the balance to which I have already referred, however, I feel that it is important that consultations be comprehensive.  Subsequently decisions will then be well-informed and effective at improving the situation of those whose vulnerability on the labour market is being exploited, in the absence of applicable law.</P>
    <P>At the moment much of the protective legislation administered by my Department makes no distinction between full time and part time workers.  Legislation such as the Conditions of Employment Acts, 1936 and 1944, the Shop Conditions and Employment Acts, 1938 and 1942, the Payment of Wages Act, 1979, the Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Act, 1974, and the Employment Equality Act, 1977 applies to all workers irrespective of the hours they work.  Some Acts exclude workers who are not employed for a minimum number of hours.  These are the Unfair Dismissals Act, 1977, the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act, 1973, the Holidays (Employees) Act, 1977, the Maternity (Protection of Employees') Act, 1981 and the Redundancies Payment Act.</P>
    <P>The ICTU have already forwarded a submission and I am hopeful of receiving the views of the FUE shortly.  When I have considered both submissions I will undertake detailed discussions with both <Col N="1624" /> sides.  I have already had preliminary discussions with the Congress of Trade Unions.  Then I will be in a proper position to decide on the scope and level of regulation required.</P>
    <P>This brings me on to the Bill proposed by The Workers' Party.  The Bill is by and large a reproduction of a submission by the ICTU to my Department in the matter.  The omnibus charter proposed ignores any implications for amendment of specific and detailed provisions of existing labour legislation, which would require to be amended if legal clarity is to be a consideration.  It also ignores the relationships between existing enactments in their scope and coverage and parallel provisions in the social security code.  The draft Bill presupposes a greenfield legal context which is not the case.</P>
    <P>I must conclude consultations with both sides of industry in line with the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and with the policy of collective bargaining, before legislation can be brought forward by the Government.  These discussions with both sides of industry will take place before we proceed further to draw up a package which represents a balanced approach to the needs of both employers and employees.  The Bill proposed by The Workers' Party does not achieve the required balance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Basically, out of this debate I want to see a commitment by Government to seek an all-party approach to agreement on a phased increase in our overseas aid, with a timetable agreed for the attainment of the UN target of 0.7 per cent.  In the light of recent experience, that is probably the best way in which progress can now be made.  The overseas aid programme funding had increased to around £45 million by the time I moved out of office as Minister of State for Development and over the period of time that I was in office there had been steady if unspectacular progress made towards the UN target. Now all that progress has been lost.  The funding has been slashed by the present administration.  Perhaps that would not be worthy of such utter condemnation were it not for the inordinate amount taken out of the ODA budget by comparison with other areas.</P>
      <P>My general approach is that we must take the necessary steps leading to national solvency, but clearly an inordinate proportion was taken out of the ODA budget.  What is left now is largely mandatory, funding that we have to pay anyway because of our membership of the United Nations and various subsidiary bodies of the United Nations and because of our membership of the European Community.  It was the discretionary element of the ODA budget which came under the axe to the tune of about £11 million.  That would indicate that it was a soft target, demonstrating a completely uncaring attitude to the needs of the hungry, the defenceless and the dying in the developing countries.  It also indicates that the commitments made over a period of time and the undertakings given have not been observed.</P>
      <P>While we all have different interpretations of how to progress towards the UN target, never was it envisaged, or indicated by any member of the present Government, that we would actually go into reverse and begin to reduce our aid. That raises the question as to whether it is considered that the needs of those countries are any less now or that there are fewer people dying of hunger and disease there.  Or is it that there is an insufficient interest here in those problems? I believe very strongly that the answer to all those questions is no.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I referred earlier to the cynicism that has crept into the whole question of how we handle our official aid programme.  It needs to be recorded that the attitude of the Government is perhaps typified by that of the present Taoiseach, in that in 1982 the Taoiseach failed to reappoint a Minister of State with responsibility for overseas aid, contemptuously dismissing such an appointment at the time as being both superfluous and supernumerary. Yet, in 1984, during our Presidency of <Col N="1629" /> the European Community, at the height of the famine in Ethiopia, at a time when I was visiting some of the death camps there on behalf not just of Ireland but of the EC as a whole, the present Taoiseach, then Leader of the Opposition, had the gall to claim that the problem of famine in Africa was of such proportions that we should have a full Cabinet Minister here to deal with it.  That is the kind of hypocrisy and cynical comment that does nothing for those who are seriously interested in the cause of the people of the Third World.  It is very clear to me that the leopard has not changed his spots because the Taoiseach has been the Leader of a Government who have decimated the aid programme, who have put it back to the state it was in in 1981.</P>
    <P>I might give one quotation as follows:</P>
    <P>There is too much to be done and there are too many people at present suffering from the indignities of hunger, povery and deprivation of the most fundamental human rights waiting for our response.</P>
    <P>Those are not my words.  They are taken from the script of a former Fianna Fáil Minister for Foreign Affairs some years ago.  However those words are as apt today as when they were spoken.  The only difference is that our response is so different.  It is necessary that the present Government set out exactly what is our response.  Does the 26th richest nation in the world have an obligation to the poorest of the poor, some of whom have an income <i>per capita</i> less than 5 per cent of ours?  Is there an obligation to the people in those countries?  Do we ignore the plight of those afflicted by natural and man made disasters in Bangladesh, Ethiopia, the Sudan and other countries of the world ravaged by floods, earthquakes, endemic poverty, civil and uncivil wars?</P>
    <P>A further question needs to be addressed, that is on what moral basis can we claim what we regard as our entitlements to European Community support for the poorest regions of the Community, of which we are one, when we ourselves ignore the plight of those in a much worse <Col N="1630" /> position than ours?  That raises the question as to whether it is in our interest to accept that there is an obligation on the part of wealthy nations to assist the poor and the weak.  One side of the coin is the fact that we use that argument at European Community level with the result that we secure a substantial flow of money, particularly through the Structural Funds which we hope will increase considerably in ensuing years.  But, how can we legitimately claim that when, on the other hand, we are not discharging our obligations to those countries so much weaker than ours.</P>
    <P>It is necessary to raise one other issue, that is that apart from the intangible moral benefits emanating from co-operation with our fellow men, we must question whether our future is not inextricably bound up with the developing world though not in circumstances such as occurred here, that these countries, we hope, over a reasonable period, will themselves have reached a stage of development at which trade with them and so on will be more and more in our mutual interests.  Those are some of the questions that need to be addressed.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to dwell on that point very much more other than to say that this is a country that committed itself to a new international economic order.  We enthusiastically endorsed many of the recommendations of the Brandt Report and its theme of mutuality of interest.  I suggest that the basis of that approach is as relevant today as it was at the time such commitments were given.  Indeed, perhaps at a more mundane level, it is relevant also to point out that overseas aid does not constitute one-way traffic. There is a return to the country at many levels.  There is also a return at a financial level.  A recent report of DEVCO indicates the substantial overseas earnings, in the developing world mainly, of our semi-State bodies under the umbrella of DEVCO, now totalling almost £100 million. I am not one who would say that some of that would not have been earned had we not been involved in overseas development aid but I have no doubt from my experience that the fact that we <Col N="1631" /> made a reasonable effort in relation to overseas aid considerably helped the efforts of people in our semi-State bodies to develop their consultancy and other business links in the developing world.</P>
    <P>My overall approach as to why we should be involved is, at one level, related to the humanitarian aspect.  There is also a political and an economic dimension. On all three scores I have no doubt that it is very much in the interest of this country, that it is the right and proper thing to do, that we set about restoring what has been lost in that area, that once again we get going on the path towards the UN target.</P>
    <P>There is one last point I want to make, that is in relation to the attitude of the general public.  I am not speaking in general terms because, when I was in office, through the advisory council, we had a survey conducted on the attitudes of our people.  We wanted to discover our people's views on the causes of poverty and their choice of likely solutions to those problems.  In addition, an attempt was made to discover the general attitude to development aid and ascertain whether this was mirrored by people's personal efforts and by their attitude to the Government's aid programme.  It was significant that that detailed survey indicated that there was a very favourable attitude towards aid in the Third World, expressed by 91 per cent of the people surveyed.  This positive orientation was further reinforced by the very high degree of personal commitment exhibited because, of the people surveyed, it was clear that 93 per cent had themselves helped.</P>
    <P>That is the background against which I put the proposal to Government arising out of our discussion on this Bill.  The answer is that in this House we attempt to establish all party agreement, with the initiative emanating from the present Government.  The aim should be to seek an agreement on a phased increase in our overseas aid.  Furthermore the aim should be to seek all-party agreement on a timetable, agreed by all, for the attainment of the UN target.  In that way the whole <Col N="1632" /> question would be taken out of the political arena.  It gives me no great joy to come into the House and castigate the Government on their approach.  I would much prefer to join the Government in an approach, the benefits of which would be clearly seen in our official development assistance programme and the results of which would be there for many years to come.</P>
    <P>I approve of the Bill and it was right and proper that when Deputy Bruton was in office, he ensured that there was a rapid response from our colleagues in the European Community.  When it is passed, the Bill will be a useful addition to the range of instruments available to those who are anxious to help people in the Third World.  However, it will not work miracles.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I strongly support the Bill for reasons which have already been outlined in the debate.  There are two ways of helping Third World countries to deal with their problems.  One is to give them the opportunity to help themselves by producing more goods and selling them overseas and the other is to give them money in the form of aid to try to keep them satisfied in their present situation.</P>
      <P>It is far more preferable to opt for an approach to Third World development which gives them an opportunity to produce and export their goods.  It is also very important to encourage Third World countries to learn from the mistakes of the richer countries in so far as achieving economic growth is concerned.  The lesson learned in the developed world since the last war has been that centrally planned economies do not work, that politicians deciding what you should invest in is a recipe for failure because virtually all the countries in Europe that have had politically led investment policies where governments decided to invest in steel mills, ship building facilities and other big government schemes, where all the political, constituency and local pressures were brought to bear to get politicians to make what were essentially market decisions, led to disaster.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1633" /> We have huge problems in Europe as a result of that type of decision making by governments in Europe and it is very important that Third World countries should be discouraged from making similar mistakes.  Indeed, since the last war, some of those countries followed our approach.  India, for example, decided that it should get into heavy industry in a big way, with disastrous results. Increasingly, Third World countries now realise that they will not expand on that basis but on the basis of going for private sector investments which are related to the prevailing market rather than relating to the vision in the eye of a politician. MIGA is particularly important because it encourages private sector investment in Third World countries.  The present approach of giving aid in the form of giving it to governments can, unfortunately, be a source of corruption in some countries.  The aid, because of under-developed political structures, does not go where it is supposed to but is used to line the pockets of those who are in political power in those countries. That is not the intention of the donor but it is frequently the result.  If, on the other hand, you go for the approach contained in MIGA, whereby you encourage private sector interests in the developed world to put their money on a commercial basis into Third World countries directly, then you avoid all the difficulties of being tangled up with political problems in the countries concerned.</P>
    <P>It is extremely important that we are taking this step of encouraging autonomous commercial development in Third World countries.  There are, however, a number of difficulties in this regard.  One major difficulty is the fact that many Third World countries are so heavily in debt that the interest rates applying in them are such that local commercial enterprises cannot start.  Governments in such countries may be committed to repaying debts, repaying money which they put into prestigious and wasteful projects.  The position now is that private sector investors in Third World countries cannot establish themselves and take the opportunities that are there.  I will give <Col N="1634" /> an example of this which is contained in the recent World Bank report which said that the growth rate of the real GDP in 17 heavily indebted countries needs to be, on average, at 4 per cent a year for the next ten years if they are to deal with their debt problem.  This will permit a <i>per capita</i> growth in consumption in the countries concerned of only 1 per cent. In other words, for every extra £4 they produce they will be allowed to keep £1 and the other £3 will be spent in debt servicing to assist the solvency of the banks of the world.</P>
    <P>We should ask fundamental questions instead of discussing giving a little more aid.  The World Bank report also made it clear that, for the most heavily indebted developing countries, the debt overhang is so constrained that corrective domestic policies alone will not produce a viable solution to their problems.  In other words, they are bankrupt in commercial terms, they cannot get out of their present situation.  Whereas a company or individual in that position can go into liquidation, be declared bankrupt and pay whatever it can to its creditors &mdash; perhaps 50p in the £ &mdash; close the books and start again with whatever controls are necessary to ensure that it is not done in an abusive fashion, it is not open to these dreadfully poor countries who are heavily burdened with debt to be declared bankrupt.</P>
    <P>The Minister has been and will continue to be in a position to influence the policies of world institutions which need to address the question of whether there should be fundamental legal changes in the position in regard to sovereign debt. The present adjustment programmes which are being engaged in by these Third World countries are, in some cases, incapable of ever achieving their objectives. Simply giving them more money, on even softer loans, does not solve the fundamental problem of some of these Third World countries.  They will never get out of their difficulties.  Would it not be better to put an end to their agony?  I know this has implications for the balance sheets of Continental Illinois and some of the other big banks in America and <Col N="1635" /> Europe who are very widely and heavily exposed to Third World debt.  Any suggestion that this debt might not be collectable could lead to problems for those banks.  On the other hand, it must be said that those banks have already made substantial write downs of their debt as far as Third World countries are concerned.  Some of them have written off half the debt and nothing happened. However, they are still trying to collect the entire amount even though, on their books, they have written off half of it.</P>
    <P>In respect of these very poor countries, is there not a need for, in the context either of the international DAC negotiations, at the annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund or some other place, an orderly solution to find a way of importing into international sovereign borrowing some of the escape mechanisms that exist in ordinary commerce for companies who get into severe difficulties?  That suggestion may sound extremely radical in the context of this House but it is not by any means, as it is being widely canvassed at present in international development circles.  I would be interested to hear the Minister's attitude to that.</P>
    <P>The Third World problem is in some countries but not in all, and the Third World is far from being uniform in its configuration.  Some parts of the Third World have in recent times been doing quite well, others quite deplorably.  The World Bank has estimated that between 340 million and 730 million people in the world are malnourished, that in the 36 poorest countries in the world during the seventies the food consumption per head fell by 3 per cent.  In other words, in 1980 they were eating 3 per cent less than they had available to eat in 1970.  That is appalling.</P>
    <P>Also the share of developing countries in world agricultural trade is falling.  They have reduced their share of agricultural trade.  Fourty-four per cent of world trade in food was in the control of developing countries in the 1961-63 period.  That had fallen to 34 per cent in the 1982-84 period.</P>
    <P>Conversely, because of policies like the <Col N="1636" /> CAP which subsidise agriculture in the developed countries, the share of the industrial market economies in world agricultural trade rose between the two same periods from 46 per cent of the total to 62 per cent of the total.  In other words, our share of world agricultural trade increased by 15 points whereas theirs fell by 10 points.  That is because a great deal of money is being devoted to encouraging food production in the parts of the world where people have too much to eat and are concerning themselves with going on diets &mdash; nobody in this House at the moment needs to do so more than myself &mdash; and at the same time in the countries of the world where food is needed most their governments are discouraging food production.  They are putting all their emphasis on industrialisation and are taxing agriculture.  The very countries in which starvation is taking place are taxing their own agriculture in order to subsidise industry.  It is truly perverse.  They are taxing agriculture to subsidise industry, because the agricultural markets of the world are closed to them, whereas the industrial markets of the world are open to them.  The agricultural markets of the world are closed to them because countries like Europe and the USA are maintaining protectionist agricultural policies, and, let it be said, no country is more supportive of such policies than Ireland, for obvious reasons.  Fifteen per cent of our population is working in agriculture. I figure there will be a major change in this because what is happening just does not make economic sense.</P>
    <P>I think we are going to see in the world trade negotiations which will end by 1990, the Uruguay round, some of these policies that are keeping Third World countries out of the world food market under very severe pressure because the Americans have made a proposal that all these subsidies be abolished.  The CAIRNS Group are supporting those and I believe that the developed world will do so, which will leave Japan and Europe, the other two industrial market economies who maintain agricultural protection, rather isolated in the world.</P>
    <P>One might say that even to utter such <Col N="1637" /> sentiments here in this House is treasonable to the interests of Irish farmers, and I represent Irish farmers or at least many of them, in the Dáil.  However, I do not think the interests of Irish farmers are assisted by encouraging them into certain types of production, buying land for example, and investing at considerable cost to themselves, under the aegis of policies which depend solely on politicians to keep them in being.  That is the case with agricultural prices at the moment.  They are politically determined prices depending entirely on political will.  They are not depending on the economic fundamentals.  That means that farmers could find, if the political climate changed, as it could in the world GATT negotiations, that investments they had made that were worth £50,000 at the time they made them with hard earned borrowings and savings are worth only half what they put into them because the agricultural prices situation has changed as a result of a political decision.  Therefore, is is not doing farmers a favour particularly to encourage them to assume that these policies are immutable.</P>
    <P>Certainly, we have the difficulty here of speaking to two audiences.  If we say here to our own farmers that these policies may be changed and then go out to Europe and try to say they should not be changed, clearly we are in a difficult situation in regard to negotiating because people will say, &ldquo;but you are telling your own people back home that you might have to give in and you are saying here that you cannot give in.&rdquo;  We must find a way of getting ourselves out of this difficulty.  We must find a way of gradually readjusting our agriculture to normal international trading conditions, because the type of heavily protected agriculture we have &ldquo;enjoyed&rdquo; since the last war is historically rather unusual.  The general trend has been for relatively free trade in agriculture.  For instance, the World Bank has estimated &mdash; this is an interesting statistic in the light of what we have heard about world aid that has been given here to Third World countries &mdash; that the OECD countries spent $27 billion during the 1982-84 period on official <Col N="1638" /> development assistance.  However, they estimate that a global liberalisation of agricultural policies would confer benefits amounting to $64 billion on both the industrial and the developing countries, in other words twice as much of a benefit as the total official development assistance being given by the OECD countries. They say further that the biggest gainers from expensive support systems for agriculture are not the countries that give the support, like Western Europe and America, but the Eastern European non market economies who are able to get butter for half nothing, for example, under these policies.</P>
    <P>We need to look as a country very seriously at these agricultural trade issues in the medium and long terms because the problem will not go away.  It has serious implications for food production in Third World countries because if their farmers cannot export their surplus food production in the years when they have a surplus they will not produce it at all. That is why we have got to create something nearer to free trade in agriculture if the world hunger problem is to be overcome.</P>
    <P>There is no country in Europe for which that has more serious adverse implications than Ireland, but it seems to be a trend that is there and we are not going to be able, simply by protesting about it, hearing nothing, seeing nothing and objecting, to stop it.  I hope the Minister will be able in his response to indicate the view of his Department to the world development report of the World Bank which addresses all of these issues, and I am conscious of the fact that he is a Governor of the World Bank which produced this report.</P>
    <P>To revert to the provisions of this Bill, I would like to ask the Minister if the liabilities of Ireland are strictly limited to the amounts subscribed and on call or is there a possibility that any further liabilities could arise?  Does the Minister expect that there will be any Irish companies that will be making investments under the guarantees being provided by MIGA and what steps will he or anybody in this country be taking to encourage the <Col N="1639" /> Irish private sector to make investments of this kind?  We have very substantial overseas investment now by Irish companies, for instance, in North America. Is there any possibility that some of that could be channelled to appropriate projects in the Third World countries, assuming that these are profitable projects?</P>
    <P>Would the Minister explain in greater detail how the arrangement has been made in regard to voting in the MIGA, the purpose of which would be to ensure that there would be no groups of countries in a permanent minority situation? The Minister referred to this in his speech.  He said that the voting power would be split evenly between groups, donors and recipients but he also went on to explain that a system of supplementary votes will ensure that the position of the minority groupings in the MIGA will be protected.  It sounds extremely complicated and I wonder how it will work in a situation where one has majority rule but with supplementary arrangements to ensure that the minority do not lose.  Will there be a total institutional paralysis? Will decisions be capable of being taken at all under such arrangements?  I would also like to ask the Minister if he is satisfied that the International Finance Corporation, which itself is given the role of making sure equity investment in Third World Countries, is working effectively.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Also, what criteria are being used for these equity investments and is the Minister satisfied that more could not be done in this area?  Would he consider that perhaps Irish authorities might consider encouraging relevant investment agencies in this country, such as the National Development Corporation, to make equity investments in the Third World rather than have all our assistance given in the form of aid as it is now given?  Is this something that he would consider to be a redirection of our own domestic policies which would be worthwhile?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1640" /> In conclusion, the main point I would like to make is that this system, which encourages investment in Third World countries, will only work if the markets are open to the Third World countries to export the results of that investment. Investment by the IDA makes no sense unless companies have the ability to sell what they are producing.  That same consideration applies equally in Third World countries.  It is the obligation of developed countries like Ireland to concern themselves just as much with opening up markets to Third World countries to sell what they produce as it is to invest in giving them the capacity to produce. It is a recipe for disaster simply to give them the money to invest in production unless we are able to open up the markets to them.  This applies not just in agriculture but also in areas such as textiles where we have a multifibre agreement which keeps clothing from Third World countries effectively out of large parts of the developed world.  Clothing and agriculture are two of the few areas in which an unskilled workforce can engage in traded activity.  There is no point in saying to the Ministers for Industry and Commerce of some of these countries that if they want to get into the production of semi-conductors or computers there is no obstacle and that they will be let in tariff free.  The fact is that their workforces are not capable of doing this; they are capable of producing food, clothing, shoes and a few other relatively simple products.  Yet they are the very ones that we keep out of our markets. My policy so far as Third World development is concerned is a policy of trade rather than aid.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T. Fitzpatrick Mr. T. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>My contribution will be very short but I want to put on record a couple of things I feel very strongly about.  The object of this Bill is to enable this country to ratify a convention which is setting up an insurance agency which will encourage investment in the Third World by the better-off developed countries.  It proposes to encourage these countries to set up industries in the Third World by providing this insurance fund <Col N="1641" /> which will guarantee the investing companies against the losses incurred by activities outside the economic sphere, like civil strife, war or that sort of thing.</P>
      <P>The object of this Bill of course is a good thing.  In so far as it goes it is laudable and it is to be encouraged.  The amount of money we are committing ourselves to invest is something like £2,750,000 towards a capital base of £1.082 billion but of that £2,750,000 only 10 per cent would be paid in cash and the rest would be paid by instalments or some other way.  I honestly believe that this is an attempt to salve the national conscience because of our gross failure and miserable performance towards providing relief for the Third World.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Bruton told us, help can be given to these undeveloped countries in two ways, first, by training and setting up industries such as this Bill will encourage and, secondly, the direct way, of providing food and money to purchase food to keep body and soul together in these unfortunate people.  Down through the years we in this country who are comparatively well off have behaved in a miserable way in the context of playing our part towards looking after these people.  It is all right saying that we are going to train them and that we will set up industries there to get them working. That reminded me of Question Time today when we were talking about dental treatment for young children at school. The Minister for Health conceded, so far as I could see, that there was a big problem here.  He conceded to Deputy Andrew Boylan that there was something like seven years waiting time.  His solution for this problem was to get in touch with the Dental Hospital in Dublin to get dentists trained, to recruit them and to get them into the field.  In the meantime we will have thousands upon thousands of unfortunate children with malformed gums, with crooked teeth, going through the world with this handicap, handicapped so far as their appearance is concerned, handicapped so far as eating and talking are concerned and in so far as getting jobs is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, the plight of the unfortunate <Col N="1642" /> infants with the huge tummies who go without food is more serious because not only will they have physical handicaps but they will probably die of starvation. The Government, and their predecessors, have not been generous as far as aid is concerned.  While the last administration did not behave as badly as this Government they were not great either and I was associated with them. However, I understand that the Government reduced the cash contribution to Third World countries last year and this year at a time when they spent money generously in other ways.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that I will be accused of introducing political argument into this debate if I say that we are spending the proceeds of the national lottery as if we had all the services we require and as if the £70 million or £80 million coming from the lottery was a bonanza, a windfall or a pools win we did not know how to spend.  In my view we are neglecting our duties although we take a lot of pride in ourselves on the world scene.  We project ourselves as a learned country, a nation to be admired on the sports field and one responsible for sending missionaries throughout the world.  The amount of money required for Third World aid would not make us any worse off than we are but it would do a lot of good for Third World countries.</P>
    <P>It is important that we contribute to these programmes for the example we would give.  If we played our part and attained the target set for us by the UN &mdash; we are not near it and we do not look like reaching it &mdash; we would encourage other countries to act in a similar fashion. We could point out that our country, which does not have great resources, is discharging its duty as best it can.  By our example we would be shaming other countries into following us.</P>
    <P>I accept that good example will not do a lot for the starving children that we see on our television screens.  We switch off such programmes because we are ashamed to look at those pictures.  We are not comfortable when such pictures are shown on television and we either leave the room or turn off the set.  The <Col N="1643" /> amount of money we are asked to give might not make a lot of difference to the starving children but we should at least discharge our obligation and set a good example.  We should remember that those unfortunate children will never develop to enjoy the benefits of anything that is contained in the Bill.  Those children will die within a few years, if not months.</P>

      <P>I should like to thank those who contributed to the debate.  At the outset I did not think so many Members would be anxious to contribute and in their own way they all made important speeches. I should like to be associated with the remarks made about Deputy John Bruton who, in his capacity as Minister, promoted and supported this development. Members will agree that most of the debate has centred on Official Development Assistance and that very little, with the exception of a few points, referred to the Bill.  I will deal with some of the points raised in the debate bearing in mind that we have a time constraint.  I may not have time to deal with some of the important questions raised.  I should like to tell the House that £275,000 of the £2.75 million will be counted as ODA allocation.  Deputy John Bruton raised questions about the £2.75 million and I should like to tell him that that is the maximum payable under the Bill but it is unlikely that the figure will go as high as that.</P>

He asked why we were involved in category 1 and the reply is that that is the way we opted.  He pointed out that Spain, Portugal and Greece were in category 2 and that is what they opted for.  In fact, Spain have since opted as a category 1 country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was asked how much investment under MIGA will benefit developing countries.  I should like to tell the House that MIGA investment will not be aid.  It is expected that it will be commercial in nature and will show a profit to the investor.  It is expected also that the investment will be of benefit to the host country.  There is provision that MIGA can insure an investment only after the host country approves it.  In other words, the interests of the host country are taken into account in the operation of MIGA. There was a great deal of talk about investment generally and why it was necessary.  In my opening remarks I pointed out that investment flows to capital importing countries peaked in 1981 at $14 billion and fell sharply to $10 billion in 1983 where it has remained since.  One can see the enormous impact that must have had on the capital importing countries and that is why investment is necessary. Notwithstanding the fact that <Col N="1645" /> Deputy Michael Higgins might be concerned about the contents of my speech, I began to think during the course of his address that he had not very much to say other than to condemn the speech and the form of words used therein.  It is important that every Deputy should realise, regardless of what philosophy they follow, that in order that money is invested there first must be a gilt-edged investment record, and the investment must make a profit.  This applies whether the money is invested in this country or in the Third World.  In a situation which does not allow that kind of atmosphere to exist investment will not take place.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>That is one point of view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>MIGA is trying to overcome that problem in many instances throughout the world.  Because these conditions do not exist, the investment opportunities are not taken.  We have to try to encourage private investment in these areas because they need the investment just the same as everybody else, regardless of the philosophy they pursue. Deputy Michael Higgins took exception when I said:</P>
      <P>As Deputies will be aware, there is general agreement that foreign direct investment in developing countries enhances their capacity for growth and strengthens their economies.</P>
      <P>That is a fact, whether the Deputy takes exception to it or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Twenty years of development studies say otherwise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the position. Many countries represented at the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund are really anxious to encourage people to invest in their economies.  This legislation will encourage that.  We are quite satisfied that it will enhance investment in these areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is envisaged that industrial and developing countries will be fully equal partners within the organisation of <Col N="1646" /> MIGA.  That is reflected in a point that has been raised by many people about the voting powers, and I will come to this in a moment.</P>
    <P>I have already said and I want to emphasise it again because it is important in the context of what Deputy M. Higgins has said, that the important feature of MIGA's guaranteed operation will be that the proposed investment must first be approved by the host countries before any contract of guarantee may be concluded. This will give the host country an opportunity to evaluate the investment and it will also ensure that it is fully in accord with its development needs.  It is important to put those points on record again notwithstanding the fact that I already made them in my initial remarks.</P>
    <P>Because of the technical nature of the voting arrangements, I think the best response I can give is to read from the commentary on the convention establishing the multilateral investment guarantee agency on the question of voting, adjustment of subscriptions and representation:</P>
    <P>The voting structure of the Agency reflects the view that Category One and Category Two countries have an equal stake in foreign investment, that cooperation between them is essential, and that both groups of countries should, when all eligible countries become members, have equal voting powers (50/50).  It is also recognised that a member's voting power should reflect its relative capital subscription. The Convention, therefore, provides that each member is to have 177 membership votes plus one subscription vote for each share of stock held by it (Article 39 (a)).  The number of membership votes is computed so as to ensure that if all Bank members joined the Agency, developing countries as a group would have the same voting power as developed countries as a group.  In order to protect the minority group before such equality is reached, this group would receive, during the three years after entry into force of the Convention, supplementary votes <Col N="1647" /> which would allow it to have as a group 40 per cent of the total voting power. These supplementary votes would be distributed among the members of the group concerned in proportion to their relative subscription votes and would be automatically increased or decreased, as the case may be, so as to maintain the 40 per cent voting power of the group (Article 39 (b)).  Even during the transition period, such supplementary votes would be cancelled whenever the group reached 40 per cent of the total voting power through subscription and membership votes.  In any case, supplementary votes would be cancelled at the end of the three year period.  During this three-year period, all decision of the Council and the Board would be taken by a special majority of at least two-thirds of the total voting power representing at least fifty-five per cent of total subscriptions, except if a specific decision was subject to a higher majority under the Convention, in which case, the higher majority would be controlling (Article 39 (d)).  An example of the latter would be certain amendments to the Convention (Article 59 (a)).</P>
    <P>I think that should explain the matter as it is a very technical problem.  There were so many points raised that I felt the best way to explain the procedure was to put that on the record.</P>
    <P>Questions were raised about the monitoring of MIGA operations and projects. The operation of MIGA will be monitored on a continuing basis by its board of directors.  We shall be kept informed of all developments and Ireland's adviser to the constituency's executive director will keep a particularly close watch on matters.  Deputy Flaherty said that the convention would only help middle income countries.  I refute that and say it will help all developed, under-developed and developing countries.</P>
    <P>I will not give a detailed reply to Deputy Bruton's questions about the methods available to sovereign borrowers of a type similar to those operating <Col N="1648" /> in the commercial markets.  I would welcome the proposals made at the Toronto Summit for a menu of options aimed at reducing the debt burden of the poorer countries.  There are different options required depending on whether it is a middle income or less developed country.</P>
    <P>Deputy Michael Higgins was very emotional in his contribution.  In the finish I did not know whether he wanted aid to go to these countries at all.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">

      <P>In the Deputy's contribution to this debate he did not suggest any way in which we would find an extra pound to give to development aid.  At the same time the same Deputies came along on this very night and voted on the Health Estimates.  Demands were made in this House last week for funds to meet the flood disaster in parts of this country, not to speak of the Third World.  We are all concerned about the Third World. However, we have to be realistic and, unfortunately, too many people come into this House and deal in isolation with the matter before the House.  They are for proper financial control and the savings that need to be made but not to hit them.  We will all be wise in the future and perhaps some of the suggestions may be&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>We have already done all we can in the context of budgetary adjustment policies that have been adopted since 1987 in all areas and this has necessitated a restrictive attitude to overseas development assistance as well as to other domestic expenditure. We are all familiar with the budgetary difficulties which successive governments have faced but few have done anything about them.  It is very easy for people to say we should do more.  In this regard nobody would like to do more than myself.  When we talk about what we are doing in this area I think it is only right to put on record especially when we compare ourselves to other countries that everything we give is given in grant form which is non-refundable.  Many of the countries that are held out to us as <Col N="1650" /> examples that we should try to follow are giving a mixture of both repayable loans and grants.  These repayable loans for which high interest is charged have put poorer countries into the difficulties which were described here this evening. Everything we do is on the basis of good investment in good projects for the benefit of the people concerned.</P>
      <P>It is a good thing to recall that now and again.  Even though it has been mentioned by Deputy Higgins it is important because what we are dealing with here is not just the taxpayers' money that is channelled by the Government to official development assistance but also the massive contributions that are made by the people at large to the various organisations and non-governmental agencies such as GOAL, Trócaire, Concern and so on which amounted to something of the order of £16 million in 1987.  Added to what the Exchequer gave of taxpayers money this would have brought our contribution up from 0.22 per cent of GNP to 0.31 per cent which would put us way up in the category.  Some of the countries which we are compared with do not have organisations such as GOAL, Concern or Trócaire doing this excellent work.  It is important that we put everything in context.</P>
      <P>I meet many people here in Ireland who are very concerned about the way certain spokespersons continue to decry the great efforts that are being made with a combination of both the non-governmental and the government agencies.  It is about time we stood up on our feet and told the world at large that we are doing all we can as a people in the circumstances in which we find ourselves and we want to do more.  What we should be doing is encouraging our neighbours, particularly those in Europe and in the Americas, to do much more, as they can do, and to come up to the level of commitment that is there from the Irish people both directly and indirectly.  It is important to put that on the record.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think it is for Deputies to come into this House and say that we are disgracing ourselves or that we should be ashamed of ourselves or embarrassed <Col N="1651" /> about what we are doing.  That is wrong considering all that we are doing not only through this House but through the assistance we give to the non-governmental agencies who are operating as well.  There is much more I could say, a Cheann Comhairle, but it is only right, as the House agreed to take all stages of both this Bill and the motion, that I leave it at that at this stage.  There were some other things I could have covered but if the House agrees we should move on to the other stages of the Bill.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I move amendment No. 1.</P>
      <P>In page 2, line 20, to delete &ldquo;Finance&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;Foreign Affairs&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment relates to the definitions section and is put down to suggest that the appropriate Minister, as defined in the definitions section, should be changed from the Minister for Finance to the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  I do this because, as the Minister for Finance has said on Second Stage, the paid-in element will be classified as official development assistance and will be payable from Central Fund services.  Since the Department of Foreign Affairs have responsibility for <Col N="1652" /> our official development assistance programme I think it is more appropriate that the Minister, in the definitions section, should be the Minister for Foreign Affairs and that consequential changes should be made in the Bill to make the appropriate Minister the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  The Minister in his reply has not clarified whether a separate allocation will be moved in the budget when the Estimates are amended, including a sum of at least £275,000 in the Vote for the Office of the Minister for Finance to cover this aid.</P>
    <P>Many of the contributions here today seem to take it for granted that the 10 per cent payable in cash initially would be drawn from the official development assistance subhead in the Vote of the Department of Foreign Affairs.  If this is so and the Minister has not yet clarified it I think that is another reason for suggesting that the appropriate Minister is the Minister for Foreign Affairs and not the Minister for Finance.  I can appreciate how it ended up within the remit of the Minister for Finance, as MIGA is a subsidiary agency of the World Bank and the Minister is a governor of the World Bank and Finance Ministers are the Ministers who are responsible for World Bank activities in their capacity as governors of the international body.  In our particular circumstances there is an argument to be made for centralising control of aid and of MIGA in the Department of Foreign Affairs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>

      <P>It is not in the Vote for Foreign Affairs, it is coming from the Central Fund.  We cannot accept this amendment because under the Bretton Woods Agreement Acts, 1957, which established Ireland's membership of the World Bank and the IMF, the Minister for Finance was assigned responsibility for all payments to the bank.  This procedure was followed in 1960 when Ireland became a member of the International Development Association, an affiliate of the World Bank.  As MIGA is in exactly the same position, that is the way we have got to proceed.  I have no alternative but to oppose the suggested amendment.</P>

      <P>The section states that: &ldquo;The terms of the Convention are hereby approved.&rdquo;  I hope the Minister will strive not to be too emotional or too ideological in his reply.  Everything I have said so far in my contribution has been based on experience from inside the developing world rather than inside a Department of State.  In relation to section 2 I want to make a point about <Col N="1654" /> this Dáil and about the Seanad and the mechanism by which conventions that affect legislation are more or less drafted into legislation in one swoop.  I am not making this point about the Minister's particular use of it this evening.  It is the fourth time in this Dáil session that an intercomplicated convention has been attached to legislation without the Oireachtas having the opportunity of debating the convention in detail as existed in other parliamentary assemblies of the European Community.  It is a different political parliamentary practice and on which I might say, without being emotional, I deplore.  With regard to section 2, in so far as it makes reference to the basic convention, I should like the Minister to clarify some points in the convention.</P>
      <P>With regard to Article 11 in Chapter III of the Bill I want the Minister to give me some explanation of the usage of the words &ldquo;any legislative action or administrative action or omission attributable to the host government which has the effect of depriving the holder of a guarantee of his ownership or control of&rdquo;, and these are the important words, &ldquo;or of a substantial benefit from, his investment...&rdquo;.  What exactly is meant by the words &ldquo;or a substantial benefit from his investment&rdquo;?  With regard to Article 11 (a) (iv), what is meant by the term, &ldquo;any military action or civil disturbance in any territory of the host country to which this Convention shall be applicable as provided in Article 66&rdquo;?  A number of the signatory countries, particularly those in Part II of Schedule A, for example, El Salvador, are countries in which there is civil disturbance.  What is the meaning of this term?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is late and I am anxious not to discommode the House in any way but I want to say that I do not like the idea of conventions which are binding being discussed in an almost <i>en passant</i> way prior to the passing of legislation.  What we have here is a very short Bill with a brief number of sections and attached to it a major convention which expresses our relationship to the international community and to other countries.  These are <Col N="1655" /> points which immediately occurred to me because they are not met by the argument in another part of the convention that the host country has to be satisfied by the terms of the convention.  If language is used it should be specific and I would appreciate it if the Minister would advise the House as to what is meant by the use of the language I have referred to.</P>

      <P>A couple of points were raised by Deputy Higgins in relation to Article 11 (a) (ii).  The term &ldquo;substantial benefit&rdquo; means profits.  In other words, a person will be in a position to repatriate his profits.  With regard to Article 11 (a) (iv), War and Civil Disturbance, the term &ldquo;any military action&rdquo; means exactly what it says here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I am sorry, but that does not meet my point.  My point is that the listed countries include countries such as the Philippines, El Salvador and so forth.  Are we talking about new civil disturbances directly affecting the investment projects or are we talking about the general use of the term?  A good six of these countries are in the throes of civil war.  Are we talking about new civil disturbances affecting the conditions of the investment or are we talking about general conditions of civil disturbance at the time of signing?  It is a very simple question. I presume we knew what it meant when we signed the convention.</P>

      <P>Article 11 (a) (iv) encompasses the risk of war and civil disturbance.  It is intended to include revolutions, insurrections, <i>coups d'étât</i> and civil or political events which are typically outside the control of the host government. Acts of terrorism and similar activities which are specifically directed against the holder of a guarantee are, however, not intended to be covered by this provision but may be covered under Article 11 (b) which is discussed further on.  In relation to the exact points raised by the Deputy, I think Article 66 is relevant in so far as territorial applications are concerned.  Article 66 states:</P>
      <P>This Convention shall apply to all territories under the jurisdiction of a member including the territories for whose international relations a member is responsible, except those which are excluded by such member by written notice to the depository of this Convention either at the time of ratification, acceptance or approval or subsequently.</P>

I sought to move an amendment to this section whereby I would have substituted the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; for the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; in an attempt to make this section mandatory on the Minister.  I got a very kind letter from you, a Cheann Comhairle, saying that my amendment was out of order because if I was to make this section mandatory by way of an amendment it <Col N="1657" /> would impose a potential charge on the Revenue Commissioners.  But, of course, the Minister may change the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; to &ldquo;shall&rdquo; because there is no constitutional inhibition on him imposing a charge on the Revenue Commissioners.

I accept what the Minister said about the Bretton Woods Acts because obviously one would need discretion and discretion was deliberately written into the Acts.  With <Col N="1658" /> regard to this Bill before the House, and the attached Schedule, it is the intention of the House to subscribe to the convention &mdash; if that is the appropriate term to use &mdash; but from an Irish point of view, the convention will become inoperable if we do not subscribe our 10 per cent in cash and subsequently our 10 per cent in promissory notes.  This section allows the Minister the discretion not to proceed. It is not a question of discretion in the manner or the form he thinks fit; he can refuse to go ahead.  If the section read &ldquo;The Minister shall create and issue to the Agency, in such form as he thinks fit, such non-interest-bearing and non-negotiable notes or other obligations...&rdquo; then the Minister would maintain the discretion which he suggested he needs.  The way the section is drafted at present would allow the Minister or his successor to leave the convention on the shelf in Merrion Street.</P>

The Convention says they &ldquo;shall&rdquo; be paid and yet in drafting the Bill to put the Convention into effect the people who drafted the Bill changed the word to &ldquo;may&rdquo;.  I accept the Minister's bona fides but it is typical of the belt and brace approach which we frequently have to our international obligations.  In the text of the convention and in the text of section 3 there is a number of examples of where &ldquo;shall&rdquo; is used rather than &ldquo;may&rdquo; and once &ldquo;may&rdquo; is put in it is an attempt to give a discretion, whether or not the Minister accepts it.  There is nothing I can do about this because my amendment has been ruled out of order.  It is impossible for anybody in Opposition to move an amendment which might involve a potential charge on the Revenue, so I am prepared to leave the argument there but I am dissatisfied with it and I do not believe that people who draft legislation and who advise on the method of its drafting should always look for a potential out, just in case.

I accept that subrogation is a normal part of insurance convention and activity but here when we go to Article 18, line 12, it says that the contract of guarantee shall provide the terms and conditions of such subrogation. Will the Minister cast some light on that? It also goes on to suggest at paragraph (c):</P>
      <P>Amounts in the currency of the host country acquired by the Agency as subrogee pursuant to Section (a) above shall be accorded, with respect to use and conversion, treatment by the host country as favourable as the treatment to which such funds would be entitled in the hands of the holder of the guarantee...</P>

This means that in the event of compensation being paid by the agency to an investor the agency would be <Col N="1661" /> entitled to assume all the rights of the investor against the host country in which the event giving rise to the claim originally occurred.

What would be the position of an Irish semi-State company who wished to invest in a Third World country?

There is also a suggestion later in the preamble in Chapter 1 that the Agency will encourage third <Col N="1662" /> parties to carry out appropriate complementary activities to promote the flow of investment.  It seems that agencies such as the IDA or SFADCo in the provision of consultancy services to Third World countries would fall within the terms of the preamble.

When I initially sought to raise this matter I referred to the failure and refusal of the Minister to respond, but in the interim period he has afforded me some insight on an informal basis.  I appreciate that it is more a failure than a refusal on his behalf and that of his Department to respond to the queries raised.</P>
      <P>It is important to outline briefly the facts surrounding the death of Mr. Creevey.  He was a man in his fifties who was in good health and had not been seen by a doctor for six years prior to his unfortunate death.  On Friday, 8 May 1987 he was found in a semi-conscious condition on the Kilbarrack Road at approximately 11.40 p.m. and was removed from there by ambulance to Jervis Street hospital.  I am advised that the journey took approximately 14 minutes.  He was received at Jervis Street hospital at the casualty outpatients section.  Despite the fact that he was carrying documents on his person, including a bus ticket with his photograph and name, an ESB bill with his name and address, his wages slip with similar details and other items, his wife, Angela was not contacted as to his condition or whereabouts until 1.30 p.m. on Saturday, 9 May 1987.  This was some thirteen and three quarter hours later.  Mrs. Creevey went directly to the hospital and arrived there at approximately 2 p.m. on Saturday, 9 May 1987, She met a nurse and was taken to her husband, whom she identified to the nurse.  At this stage Mr. Creevey was still in the casualty department, resting on a casualty trolley.  A young male doctor approached and advised Mrs. Creevey that her husband had vomited and he had &ldquo;got up blood&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1664" /> An examination had been carried out on him which established he was not suffering from ulcers and the doctor stated that he was unsure as to where the blood came from.  It should be stated that Mr. Creevey had no history of illness or difficulties and had not seen a doctor for some six years prior to his admission to Jervis Street Hospital on this occasion. Mrs. Creevey found her husband to be semi-conscious and while he appeared to recognise her he found it difficult to speak.  Mrs. Creevey noticed he had difficulty in moving his lips and getting words out.</P>
    <P>Later that same evening Mrs. Creevey found her husband in exactly the same condition and she became more alarmed.</P>
    <P>Some emphasis had been placed on the fact that Mr. Creevey had been drinking and the attention of the staff seemed to be directed in the belief that he was in some way labouring under the consumption of alcohol.  It had been suggested to Mrs. Creevey that her husband's condition was due to alcohol consumption, but she realised it was more serious as he showed no indication of coming around or &ldquo;sobering up&rdquo;.  He was still being detained in an observation ward, off casualty, and had not been fully admitted to the hospital.  This was late on Saturday evening.</P>
    <P>On Mrs. Creevey's return to Jervis Street Hospital on Sunday, 10 May 1987 she found her husband fully unconscious and unwakeable.  This was at lunch time. He was breathing heavily.  On demanding to see a doctor she was told that all tests had been carried out on him and that nothing was showing up.  Mrs. Creevey asked if her husband's head had been examined as she seemed to notice some bruising over his left eye.  This had not apparently been done and an X-ray was immediately carried out.</P>
    <P>Later in the evening she returned again to the hospital in the company of a friend and neighbour.  Mr. Creevey clearly was not improving.  Mrs. Creevey and her friend drew attention to the fact that Mr. Creevey's head appeared to be swollen and in some way distorted towards the <Col N="1665" /> rear.  Mrs. Creevey was advised that X-rays taken earlier at her request had shown up nothing.  The suggestion was made by Mrs. Creevey's friend that a lumbar puncture should be taken as they felt that something attacking or damaging the brain was at hand.  For the second time the hospital responded to the request of a lay person and visitor.  The tests were carried out.  At approximately 9.30 p.m. on Saturday it was established for the first time that Mr. Creevey was suffering from a massive brain haemorrhage and the hospital authorities proposed removing him immediately to the Richmond Hospital, which was better equipped to deal with his condition.</P>
    <P>The following morning, Monday, 11 May 1987 on phoning the hospital Mrs. Creevey was advised that her husband had bled further and had not been removed to the Richmond as had been agreed.  She was asked to come to the hospital immediately as things were deteriorating and eventually that day her husband died.</P>
    <P>Most of these facts were laid before the Minister in a letter sent by me and dated 29 January this year.  Shortly afterwards I forwarded an authority signed by Mrs. Creevey allowing for the facts to be disclosed to me on her behalf, as has been established by the Minister.  In the letter of January I raised a number of important queries which required answers.  I still require answers to these queries.</P>
    <P>In the first place, what caused the delay in Mrs. Creevey's being notified of the whereabouts of her husband and his condition on the night of Friday, 8 May and morning of Saturday, 9 May 1987, given all the personal details and documents carried on his person?  Secondly, why was he still in casualty, lying on a trolley, up to the time of Mrs. Creevey's first visit on the afternoon of Saturday, 9 May 1987?  Why was it only after her intervention that her husband was fully admitted, X-rayed and examined for brain damage and had a lumbar puncture carried out?  Why was so much reliance placed by the medical staff on Mr. Creevey's apparent alcohol consumption in <Col N="1666" /> the face of other obvious medical symptoms and indications &mdash; obvious to the lay persons and visitors at Mr. Creevey's bedside?  Why was Mr. Creevey's brain damage, which was of huge proportions, not discovered and diagnosed until late on Sunday evening, almost two days after his admission to hospital?  Why was Mr. Creevey not transferred to the Richmond Hospital at a much earlier stage in view of his condition and evident symptoms and injuries?  More importantly, why was an inquest not carried out into the circumstances of his unusual, untimely and unfortunate death?  I understand that even to date no inquest has taken place on this extraordinary affair.</P>
    <P>The major question is, why was a fully able-bodied man, who went after work on a Friday evening in May of 1987 for a social drink, taken in these circumstances to Jervis Street Hospital and why ultimately did he die?  It is a particularly unusual and unfortunate case, but one which raises very important questions with regard to the overall delivery of medical services, not just at Jervis Street Hospital but indeed perhaps elsewhere throughout the country.  It is unfortunate that this type of situation appears to have been recurring.  I am particularly interested, as a Deputy of this House, in pursuing, with the full permission of Mrs. Creevey, the unfortunate circumstances surrounding her husband's death.  Her question is: &ldquo;Why did my husband die?&rdquo; Why was he so poorly attended to and what can the Minister do to help her to understand all this?</P>
    <P>I pursued the matter to the floor of the House tonight because having written in January of this year and a number of times by way of reminders to the Minister since then, I was advised on 3 February of this year that he was making inquiries into the matter and would write to me &ldquo;as soon as possible&rdquo;.  I was advised again on 25 April in exactly similar terms.  On 9 May the Minister began to explain some of his difficulties.  He indicated that he was making &ldquo;urgent inquiries&rdquo;.  He said that, as I should be aware, the records of Jervis Street Hospital were transferred to Beaumont Hospital and that that hospital <Col N="1667" /> was not yet in a position to reply to his inquiries.  He advised me that he would be in touch with me again when the matter had been finalised.  The anniversary of Mr. Creevey's death had passed and no answers had been forthcoming. In June the Minister replied that he would write as soon as possible. Again, in August there was exactly the same response and for that reason, on resumption of the House in this term, I had undertaken to Mrs. Creevey that I would seek the opportunity of a few moments time on the floor of the House to pursue her inquiries through me to the Minister who, I believe, must ultimately be answerable for the events as they unfold in our hospitals on a daily basis.</P>
    <P>I do not seek in this intervention to lay the blame anywhere and in particular do not wish to seek to draw any cloud over the difficult conditions under which junior staff, particularly, in our busy casualty hospitals must operate.  I believe, nonetheless, that Mr. Creevey's case raises important questions, not just for the bereaved Mrs. Creevey and her family but also for the Minister and for his Department, to establish exactly the conditions operating in our casualty hospitals and departments in the city and elsewhere and to ensure, for him and for all of us, that circumstances are working well within those institutions so that, in particular, there will not be a recurrence of these unfortunate events and that there will not be any more deaths in our hospitals in circumstances similar to Mr. Creevey's case which certainly suggests and demands many answers.  I hope that <Col N="1668" /> the Minister can enlighten us on some of these tonight.</P>

      <P>First, I would like to apologise to the Deputy for the delay involved in providing him with an answer to his inquiries in this case.  I had hoped that my inquiries would have been completed before now but despite the diligence with which the matter has been pursued in my Department, some of the information required was sent to my Department only a few days ago.  I might add that I have a list of 26 different items in chronological order back to 29 January of this year when Deputy McCartan wrote in relation to the case.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will, I am sure, appreciate that certain difficulties arise because Jervis Street Hospital has been closed since late 1987.  I accept that some aspects of this case are disturbing.  I decided to refer the papers to the Attorney General. I am asking him to consider if further action might appropriately be taken, having regard to all the circumstances of the case.  I want to assure the Deputy that I will do everything I can to ensure that the family and their representative are facilitated in pursuing any further inquiries they may wish to make.  I will be requesting the consultants and the hospital authorities concerned to cooperate in every way possible in ensuring that any information reasonably required is provided.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.50 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 3 November 1988.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>The tracing of female offspring of women who took diethylstyboestrol (DES) would be almost impossible for a number of reasons.  Principally, in practical terms, few women could be expected to rememine <Col N="1385" /> ber the drugs administered to them during pregnancy in the forties, fifties and sixties and, given the lapse of time, few patient record cards kept by doctors for that era would remain in existence.</P>
      <P>While I am conscious of the concern in relation to the development of DES-related cancer in the daughters of women who received treatment with diethylstyboestrol, I feel that this whole area should be approached cautiously so as to ensure against unduly raising fears among women in relation to the possibility of their developing cancer.</P>
      <P>I understand that the development of vaginal cancer in such cases is quite rare and that the main concerns centre on a perceived need to make the medical profession more aware of the appropriate form of treatment in the case of young women presenting with benign abnormalities such as vaginal adenosis which may be DES-related.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 22 and 223 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children provides a national service for children suffering from cancer.  In 1987 approximately 60 new oncology cases were referred to the hospital.  There has been a significant increase in the referral rate in 1988 and the hospital anticipates seeing 85 new cases by the end of the year. There is no immediate or obvious explanation for this increase.  Doctors at the <Col N="1389" /> hospital are not convinced that there has been an increase in the incidence of cancer among children but suspect that the increase is due to a greater awareness among GPs of the services available at Crumlin.</P>
    <P>Given the specialised nature of this service and skills required of those who work in the specialty, it is impossible to increase staff overnight.  In any event the increase in referrals observed in 1988 may not be sustained.  There were seven bone marrow transplants performed at the hospital in 1987; it is anticipated that up to 17 such procedures will be carried out in 1988.</P>
    <P>I am considering the requirements of the unit in the context of the 1989 revenue allocation for the hospital.</P>

It is a matter for the Southern Health Board to determine the priority to be accorded to the development of these facilities at Mallow Hospital.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 28, 36 and 213 together.</P>
      <P>The detailed information requested by the Deputies is not yet available to my Department.  Detailed activity statistics in respect of each acute hospital is currently being collected.  However, on 31 December 1986 there existed a total acute hospital bed complement of approximately 14,000 beds.  A recent survey by my Department showed that there were approximately 11,200 such beds in use on 1 October 1988, of which it is estimated 2,000 are non-public beds.</P>
      <P>The reduction in hospital beds over the last two years was necessary to effect a long overdue rationalisation of acute hospital services in this country.  This reduction in bed numbers has been offset by increased activity on an out-patient basis and by the provision of day beds and 5-day beds which has enabled a large number of procedures to be carried out far more efficiently than heretofore.</P>
      <P>The number of acute consultantstaffed hospital beds in use in the State represents roughly 3.2 beds per thousand population.  I propose to circulate in the Official Report a tabular statement showing the bed/population ratios per 1,000 population in eight EC Member States. However, these comparisons need to be treated with caution since the categories of beds can be defined differently in the various countries.</P>

      <P>The waiting list for total hip replacements in the North Eastern Health Board area has not changed very much over the past four years.  The number on the list in 1985 was 187; in 1986 the figure rose to 199 and fell to 179 last year.

      <P>I am concerned at the length of time some patients have to wait for this procedure but I am satisfied that the situation in the North Eastern Health Board area will improve in the near future.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 32, 59 and 179 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy will appreciate, the level of activity and the staffing which can be made available in each hospital is dependent on the level of resource which can be provided.  It is now generally <Col N="1394" /> agreed that our economic circumstances require a reduction in public expenditure including expenditure on health services. In this situation, it is incumbent on each health agency to ensure that the funding which is made available to it is allocated to meet essential and priority services.  I am satisfied that the resource which is provided to hospitals is sufficient to cater for the provision and adequate staffing of these services.  My Department has directed local management to ensure that these services are protected and in the current year an employment control mechanism has been established which enables critical staff vacancies to be filled. This mechanism also allows my Department to undertake detailed monitoring of the changes taking place in staffing in the health boards and hospitals.  Inevitably, problems will arise but these can be resolved at local level.  For example, in the case of St. James's Hospital where the matter of nursing staff working extra hours arose, measures have been introduced and accepted by staff which will ensure that extra hours will be worked by nursing staff in emergency cases only.</P>

      <P>The present position is that all the heavy items of equipment such as the X-ray units have been installed and I have allocated £2.5 million to the North Eastern Health Board to complete the equipping process.  At present over £1 million has been spent and the equipment is being installed.  The health board is currently placing orders for the balance of the equipment and I am assured that all the necessary equipment will be in place and ready for operation by the spring of 1989.

      <P>I am aware of the call from the Consumers Association of Ireland to put an end to mercury soap production in Ireland.</P>
      <P>Under the Medical Preparations (Licensing of Manufacture) Regulations, 1984 which were made under the Health Act 1947, a manufacturer's licence is required by a person manufacturing medicinal products in Ireland.  As regards Mercuric Iodide Soap, the National Drugs Advisory Board inspected the manufacturing plant in question to assess the manufacturing facilities and whether these facilities were sufficient in the light of the quality and safety requirements as applied by the NDAB to the manufacture of medicines.  The Board reported to me that the manufacturing process was satisfactory and I, as Minister for Health and the competent licensing authority under the Regulations, issued a manufacturer's licence in October 1987.</P>
      <P>Under the Medical Preparations (Licensing Advertisement and Sale) Regulations, 1984, the company requires a product authorisation if it wishes to place the products on the market in Ireland.  The company has not applied to the Department of Health for such an authorisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to assessing the manufacturing process both the Department of Health and, independent medical persons, analysed the medical literature available and concluded that there is no evidence reported in the literature to link mercuric iodide soap with mercurial intoxication.  There are some indications in the literature of adverse health effects being associated with Mercury Creams and it is important to distinguish between <Col N="1397" /> one type of product and another, and the medical evidence relating to the respective products when considering a course of action to take which is governed in law.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, it is my view that the thrust of health policy should be to maximise the potential of primary health care services within a broad national policy of health promotion.  In this regard I have asked health boards to ensure that adequate resources are allocated from within their budgets to further these objectives.  However, the allocation of resources to individual service areas is primarily a matter for the health boards in the light of the resources made available to them by my Department. In this instance, the development of community care is a matter for the Southern Health Board.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 48 and 49 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provision of maternity services in County Louth is a matter for the North Eastern Health Board in the first instance.  The closure of the maternity unit at Louth County Hospital from 1 to 20 October arose not because of cutbacks but because the arrangements made by the health board for the provision of locum cover during the absence of the permanent consultant obstetrician/gynaecologist, who is on annual leave, fell through.  The locum cover had in fact been arranged in advance but unfortunately these arrangements fell through at short notice for reasons outside of the control of the health board.  Another suitable locum obstetrician/gynaecologist was not available to the board at such short notice and <Col N="1403" /> in order to provide a satisfactory level of service all deliveries were referred to Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital at Drogheda during the period of closure.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the board responded swiftly and dealt in a most expeditious manner with a set of circumstances which could not be foreseen and were outside its control.</P>
    <P>I am informed that the maternity unit at Louth County Hospital re-opened on 21 October when a suitable locum became available.  This locum was available until 1 November only and a second locum was to provide cover from today. I now understand today that there is some problem in having this person registered by the Medical Council and I am keeping the matter under review.</P>

      <P>Medical cards are issued to those who, in the opinion of chief executive officers, are unable to provide general practitioner services for themselves and their dependants without undue hardship.  In determining eligibility, chief executive officers take into account the financial and other general circumstances of applicants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1404" /> Those suffering from a long term illness which gives rise to substantial health care expenditure would have such costs taken into account and viewed sympathetically in that determination.  Non-medical card patients with one of the 15 particular conditions scheduled under the long term illness scheme are entitled to receive drugs and medicines for that condition free of charge under the LTI scheme.  As part of their continuing review of these patients' circumstances, health boards may issue a medical card, rather than a long term illness book, to patients suffering from one of these LTI scheduled conditions, where the patient's financial and other circumstances warrant this on an individual basis.  Patients with a long term condition, outside the remit of the LTI scheme, are treated similarly.  There could be no justification for issuing medical cards generally to persons, regardless of their means or circumstances, on the sole grounds that they are diagnosed as suffering from one of the 15 conditions scheduled under the LTI scheme.</P>

      <P>Before addressing the particular comparison made by the Deputy, I would like to make some points about international comparisons in general.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Countries vary in their interpretation of what constitutes health expenditure. For example, cash allowances to disabled persons are classified as health expenditure in Ireland but not in Britain.  The OECD recognises these variations as representing difficulties in making meaningful comparisons.  Furthermore in the OECD's own reports, it concedes that comparative financial data &ldquo;cannot be used to compare real quantities of health <Col N="1410" /> services across countries&rdquo;.  This equally applies to comparison of quality.</P>
    <P>Having made these points, let me say that the Deputy has been very selective in his choice of comparative data.  For the period 1960 to 1984 the OECD figures show Ireland's growth in real expenditure on health to be significantly higher than the United Kingdom, the United States and the OECD average.  In 1984 public expenditure on health in Ireland represented 7.0 of GDP.  This compares with 5.2 in the UK, 4.4 in the U.S. and 5.9 for the OECD average.</P>

      <P>My Department have been monitoring the outcome of breast cancer screening programmes in other countries.  There is some evidence that where these programmes are introduced on a phased basis, with expert staff, good equipment and adequate back-up facilities, they can reduce the number of deaths from breast cancer in women aged 50 years and over. However, in some countries with extensive breast cancer screening services there has been no reduction in the overall number of deaths from breast cancer.</P>
      <P>In the interest of the health of Irish women, I consider that we must have excellence in all the basic requirements of a screening programme before such a programme is introduced.  The outcome of any breast cancer screening programme must be carefully monitored to ensure it is reaching its objective of reducing deaths from breast cancer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Clinical breast examination is available to Irish women from their general practitioners and they may be referred for mammography to hospitals throughout the country.  The expertise of radio-graphers carrying out mammography <Col N="1411" /> and of radiologists reporting on the mammograms is increasing.  Breast cancer clinics are now developing in association with mammography facilities.  Therefore, the basic requirements of expertise and equipment for a screening programme are gradually developing in this country. The service has now reached the level that I am now considering an application for funds for the establishment of a breast cancer screening programme for women aged over 50 years of age in a specific catchment area.  This project will act as a pilot project for possible expansion of screening services at a later date.</P>

      <P>National lottery funds are allocated through my Departments to arts, culture and Irish language related projects.  To date in 1988, £11.813 million has been allocated.  Details in relation to funding for specific projects were given in reply to Questions Nos. 65, 66 and 69 on 19 October 1988.</P>
      <P>None of the groups listed by the Deputy are directly in receipt of funding from my Departments.  However, all citizens, including women, parents and children, and the community in general stand to benefit as a result of this increased level of funding for arts and culture and Irish language related projects.</P>

      <P>Treasure, or treasure trove, is defined as gold or silver in bullion, plate or coin concealed with the intention of recovery at some later date. The table below gives details in relation to amounts of treasure trove acquired by the National Museum in the years 1983-1988. It also gives details of objects of base metals and other materials which do not constitute treasure trove, although often of great archaeological or historical importance, acquired by the Museum over the same period.  It is not the practice to provide valuations of material but the total cost of acquisition/finders rewards in each year is as follows:</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs arising from his reply to Parliamentary Question No. 73 of 9 December 1987, if he will update the information given on that occasion to the present date; the measures which are in force to ensure that none of the overflights in Irish airspace were carrying nuclear weapons, payloads of any kind or any dangerous substances; whether the total banning of overflights of all military aircraft will be considered; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <P>Information regarding foreign military aircraft for which permission to overfly Ireland was sought in the period December 1987 to October 1988 is set out in the following tabular statement. <Col N="1417" /> As I said in a reply to a question on this subject on 16 February last, permission for such overflights is normally granted provided certain conditions are met.  The most important of which are that the aircraft by unarmed, not carry arms, ammunition or explosives nor engage in intelligence-gathering.  That the flights in <Col N="1418" /> question do not form part of military exercises or operations and that the aircraft shall not, without the express permission of the Minister for Tourism and Transport, carry any dangerous goods. No consideration is being given to the banning of overflights by military aircraft.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs if his attention has been drawn to a booklet entitled <i>Persecution of the Ba-hai's in Iran;</i> and the action he has taken regarding this religious minority and the systematic campaign to eliminate them which has taken and is taking place.</P>

      <P>A booklet entitled <i>Persecution of the Ba-hai's in Iran, 1979-1986</i> has been drawn to my attention.  Relevant recent material available to me includes a report on the situation of human rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran prepared by the Special Representative of the Commission on Human Rights for the current session of the UN General Assembly.  That report indicates that by July 1988 a number of prominent Ba-hai's imprisoned because of their faith had been released or had their sentences reduced and that no new arrests had been reported since February 1988.</P>
      <P>We are concerned at reports of continued infringments of human rights in Iran including persecution of members of the Ba-hai's faith.  We follow closely the evolution of these matters and have pursued the question actively in the frame-work of European Political Co-operation, at the UN Human Rights Commission and at the UN General Assembly as well as in bilateral contacts with the Iranian authorities.  We have supported all the resolutions presented at the UN on the situation of human rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran.  Reference is regularly made in these resolutions to the situation of minority groups such as the Ba-hai's.  Together with a majority of our partners in the Twelve, we have on several occasions and consistently since 1986 co-sponsored these resolutions.  The admission in 1986 of a number of Iranian Ba-hai refugees to this country was a practical manifestation of our humanitarian concern. We will continue to follow closely developments relating to the Ba-hai community in Iran and to make known our concern as appropriate.</P>

      <P>The <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> identified the size and burden of the national debt, high interest rates, the stagnation in productive investment over the previous five years and the erosion of our competitive position by cost pressures as being among the principal factors inhibiting sustained economic development, including employment expansion.</P>
      <P>The programme also outlined the Government's strategy to address these problems.  A fiscal policy which faced the financial realities was identified as the key to putting the economy back on the path to long term sustained economic growth.  Consequently, the strategy sought to create a fiscal, exchange rate and competitiveness climate conducive to such growth, supplemented by an intensification of practical measures to generate increased job opportunities on a sectoral basis.</P>
      <P>Evidence is mounting that the strategy is working and that an environment supportive of increased investment, the key to expansion of sustainable employment, is emerging.  Confirmation is to be found in the recently released results of the 1988 Labour Force Survey which shows that the previous unfavourable trend in total employment has been reversed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. MacSharry) Ray MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. MacSharry)</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the first part of the Deputy's question, I have to date given certificates to seven companies under section 39B of the Finance Act 1980 (inserted by section 30 of the Finance Act 1987).  The companies are:</P>
      <P>&mdash;Gandon Securities Ltd,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&mdash;KB Financial Services (Ireland) Ltd, <Col N="1429" />&mdash;North Wall Street Investments,</P>
    <P>&mdash;Reflex International Financial Services Ltd,</P>
    <P>&mdash;IBI International Finance Ltd,</P>
    <P>&mdash;Ulster International Finance Ltd, and</P>
    <P>&mdash;Cambridge International Finance Ltd.</P>
    <P>As regards the second part of the Deputy's question, applications are formally received by me only after they have been passed by the Board of the Industrial Development Authority and approved by the Certification Advisory Committee, which consist of representatives of my Department, the Department of Industry and Commerce, the Central Bank of Ireland and the Industrial Development Authority.  To date, 41 applications have been approved by that Committee.</P>
    <P>In regard to the third part of the Deputy's question, while it would not be appropriate for me to give details of the conditions imposed on individual companies, including the employment condition, I can tell the Deputy that the seven companies certified to date have undertaken to create a total of 162 jobs. The other 34 projects approved to date, and which are in the process of being certified, involve 863 jobs.</P>
    <P>In respect of the fourth part of the question, I can assure the Deputy that all companies are offered the same package of incentives and that no special or additional incentives have been offered to any particular company.</P>
    <P>As regards the last part of the question, the marketing of the centre has gone extremely well to date.  This is evidenced by the relatively large number of projects already approved in such a short period of time and by the large number of inquiries about the centre that continue to be made.  I am confident that many of these inquiries will lead to concrete worthwhile projects in the near future and that the centre will prove to be a great success.</P>

      <P>The reports received by the Commissioners of Public Works and the <Col N="1434" /> National Museum of Ireland would indicate that, up to 1987, archaeological sites and national monuments were being interfered with persistently by persons using metal detectors.  Since the National Monuments (Amendment) Act, 1987, which introduced heavy fines and imprisonment for unauthorised use of metal detectors to search for archaeological objects, was enacted, one case only warranting prosecution has been reported to the commissioners.</P>
      <P>The possibility of an amnesty in relation to illegally excavated artefacts would require careful consideration but the feasibility and usefulness of the proposal are being examined.</P>

      <Col N="1435" /> The marsh is the habit of a rare plant Puccinellia Fasciculata (Torr) Bicknell (Tufted Salt Marsh Grass) which is protected under the Flora Protection Order, 1987 (S.I.

      <P>These regulations prescribe standards to be complied with in restaurants for the purposes of qualifying for a Bord Fáilte Certificate of approval which is a prerequisite for restaurants applying through the courts for a special restaurant licence.

      <P>There are also provisions in the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1988 relating to the size of waiting areas and the presence of bar facilities in licensed restaurants.</P>
      <P>Bord Fáilte are responsible for enforcing the regulations.  They have informed me that their experience to date has been that where restaurants have had to modify premises to meet the prescribed standards, such modifications have not seriously diminished the architectural character of the restaurants concerned.

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Food if his attention has been drawn to the fact that the recent Combat Poverty report highlighted the fact that there is a significant problem of poverty in rural areas and that farming households make up nearly one quarter of households below the 50 per cent poverty line; and his reaction to these recommendations in the report focusing on this issue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. O'Kennedy) Minister for Agriculture (Mr. O'Kennedy)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have noted the contents of the report by the Combat Poverty Agency on poverty and the social welfare system in Ireland.  The issue of rural poverty is highlighted in the report and the conclusion is that new and diversified income sources need to be generated in rural areas.  This is entirely in line with the thinking behind the pilot scheme for Integrated Rural Development which I initiated recently.</P>
      <P>I hope that the findings of this pilot programme can form the basis for a longer term national programme for rural development which could receive support under the EC Structural Funds.  Such support would be in line with the commitments towards maintaining an economically healthy rural society, expressed by the EC Commission in its recent document on &ldquo;The Future of Rural Society&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, the programme for western development, which will provide opportunities for small farmers to <Col N="1446" /> increase their incomes, has been extended to all the less favoured areas in the country.</P>
    <P>Discussions are also continuing at EC Council level on the proposal to institute a system of income aids for those farm families and workers whose income is below a minimum acceptable standard.</P>
    <P>Finally, I expect that the current plans to increase EC Structural Funds will generate increased economic activity in rural areas, and thus provide employment and income opportunities which can assist in tackling poverty in rural areas.</P>

      <P>The purpose of the scheme of grants to voluntary organisations administered by my Department is to give support to voluntary organisations undertaking projects in the social services area.  Under the scheme a sum of £750,000 was made available this year for once-off grants for particular projects being undertaken by such organisations. In addition there was special allocations of £100,000 to the St. Vincent de Paul Society for Personal Development and <Col N="1447" /> Home Management courses for some 5,000 families and £50,000 under a pilot scheme for grants to voluntary organisations providing opportunities for unemployed people to become involved in their activities.</P>
      <P>The vast bulk of the grants under the scheme are paid to organisations providing services in local communities, including services for women, parents and children and in other cases the projects involved would indirectly benefit these categories.  A full list of the grants allocated to date in 1988 under the scheme is attached.</P>
      <P>Of the 68 organisations affiliated to the Council for the Status of Women a number have received grants in previous years for particular projects.  In 1988 one such group, the National Association of Widows in Ireland, received a grant of £1,500 for the publication of a report.</P>

      <P>The person concerned is not entitled to disability benefit from my Department.  He had been in receipt of sickness benefit from the United Kingdom while resident in this country.</P>
      <P>At the request of UK social security authorities the person concerned was referred for examination by a medical referee of my Department who expressed the opinion that he was capable of work. He was then referred to a second medical referee who also expressed the opinion that he was capable of work.  The UK authorities were informed accordingly. These arrangements are made under the EC Social Security Regulations for Migrant Workers which provide for cooperation between social security authorities in the medical supervision of claims.</P>
      <P>It is understood that the UK authorities disallowed the person's claim for benefit and that he has lodged an appeal.</P>

      <P>The person concerned has claimed disability benefit from 25 March 1988.  He was not eligible for payment as he had less than the required 39 contributions in the 1986-87 contribution year which governed his claim.  However, credited contributions were awarded from 29 March 1988, the fourth day of incapacity.</P>
      <P>The person concerned was examined by a medical referee of my Department on 1 September 1988 who expressed the opinion that he was capable of work and was not entitled to the award of credited contributions from 2 September 1988.

      <P>A number of leaflets have been produced by the Department outlining the eligibility conditions of the unified national fuel scheme.  These are available from the information offices of the Department in Dublin and around the country and from the health boards and post offices.  Copies have also been sent to the Oireachtas Library.</P>
      <P>The standardisation of the fuel schemes which I initiated last year is now being completed.  As a result, uniform criteria as to eligibility will apply throughout the country for the first time, subject to the proviso that existing entitlements will be preserved, and all beneficiaries will from now on have their entitlement to fuel allowances determined and paid in the same way as their qualifying payments. Thus, the Department will cater for the entitlement of pensioners, the Department's local offices will deal with the long-term unemployed and the health boards will look after the need of beneficiaries under schemes they administer, namely, supplementary welfare allowance, disabled person's maintenance allowance and infectious diseases maintenance allowance.</P>
      <P>The unified national fuel scheme is a non-statutory one.  Its operation requires the issue of guidelines and instructions tailored to suit the specified needs or responsibilities of the various personnel concerned.  The health boards and the Department's staff in headquarters, their investigative staff around the country and their staff in the local offices were all circularised in this way.  These communications are for the internal use of staff in the Department and of the health boards.</P>

In assessing means, earnings of up to £312 for a single person increased by £208 for a married person and by £104 in respect of each dependent child are not taken into account.  This is in addition to the standard £6 means disregard for receipt of a maximum pension.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that there are about 1,700 blind pensioners under age 66. Details of the numbers of blind pensioners who are working are not available and it is not therefore possible to determine how much of their means relates to earnings and how much comes from other sources.  It is not possible, therefore, to estimate the cost of increasing the allowances in respect of earnings.</P>

With the significant increase in fleet capacity which has taken place in Ireland since 1984, the scale of the reduction implied in Ireland's case is significantly greater than 3 per cent.

      <P>It is <Col N="1463" /> assumed that the Deputy's question relates to the rented housing stock of Dún Laoghaire Corporation.  The latest information supplied by the corporation indicated that at 31 December 1986 they had 240 dwellings without indoor toilets. Loan finance is available from my Department for necessary improvement works to local authority housing including the provision of toilet facilities.  In addition, where the provision of toilet facilities forms part of major remedial works to an estate of pre-1940 dwellings, such work may be grant aided by my Department under the remedial works scheme.  The funds available under that scheme are allocated having regard to the overall demands by authorities for funding, the amount of funds available and the priorities accorded by individual authorities to their various proposals.</P>

      <P>However, explanations concerning the calculation of the amounts claimed, i.e. £191,691.93 is one case and £17,679.80 in the other, are awaited from the receiver of the group of companies and the trustees of the pension schemes.  The receiver indicated recently that the trustees and himself wished to meet the officials involved in my Department to discuss the applications.  My Department are endeavouring to arrange a meeting at the earliest possible date.  I am hoping that the information requested will be supplied either at the meeting or very soon thereafter, so that the examination of the applications can be completed and payments issued by my Department with the minimum delay.</P>

      <P>The advertising of tobacco products is controlled by the Tobacco (Control of Advertising, Sponsorship &amp; Sales Promotion) (No. 2) Regulations, 1986.  In summary, under these regulations advertisements for tobacco products can appear only in newspapers, magazines and other similar publications.  They can also appear internally in points of retail sale.  Advertisements for tobacco products cannot appear in comics or other publications directed primarily to persons under 18 years of age, or externally at points of retail sale.</P>
      <P>Advertisements for tobacco products may contain only a brand name, brand emblem, corporate name and emblem and one single representation of the tobacco product and package.  They may also contain an indication of the place of manufacture, type, size, quantity and price, an approved health warning (which in the case of cigarettes must come from a choice of four such approved warnings and which must be rotated periodically) and a plain background consisting of one even colour.  Advertisements cannot contain certain claims or recommendations which would mislead persons about the product.</P>
      <P>Every package must contain an approved health warning on both the front and back of the package.  On the front of the package, the warning shall be &ldquo;smoking is a health hazard&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>On the back one of the following:</P>
      <P>&mdash;Smoking causes cancer.</P>
      <P>&mdash;Smokers die younger.</P>
      <P>&mdash;Smoking kills.</P>
      <P>&mdash;Smoking causes heart disease.</P>
      <P>The 1986 regulations also control the sponsorship of events.  An event which was not sponsored by the tobacco industry prior to 1 May 1986 cannot now be sponsored.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Tobacco (Health Promotion and <Col N="1474" /> Protection) Act, 1988, provides for the prohibition and restriction on the consumption of tobacco products in designated areas and facilities.  Specifically the Act provides for the prohibition or restriction on smoking on aircraft, trains, public service vehicles, health premises, schools, cinemas, theatres and the public offices of buildings which belong to or are in the occupation of the State or a body established under an Act of the Oireachtas or in any other area designated by the Minister.  Regulations are annually being drafted to give effect to section 2 of the Act.  The Act also prohibits the sale of tobacco products to persons under 16 years of age.</P>
    <P>Another feature of the Act is the direct ban on the sale etc. of oral smokeless tobacco products, products which are being marketed as &ldquo;safe&rdquo; alternatives to cigarettes in an effort to maintain the levels, consumption and sales of tobacco products.  It provides for banning the sale, importation, manufacture etc. of oral smokeless tobaccos.</P>
    <P>Prior to 1988 the responsibility for conducting public information/education campaigns lay with the Health Education Bureau.  Anti-smoking campaigns were one of the bureau's on-going activities from its establishment in 1975.</P>
    <P>Since the transfer of responsibility for health promotion to my Department an anti-smoking campaign was conducted in February, 1988.  A major campaign is planned in 1989 to coincide with the Europe Against Cancer Year and the introduction of the regulations on smoking in public places referred to above.</P>

      <P>I consider that there is scope for a very significant contribution to be made by doctors in promoting the health of their patients and in the practice of preventive medicine.  This is, or course, the primary role of those engaged in community medicine employed by the health boards. I would regard it as a matter of professional responsibility for all doctors to <Col N="1482" /> advise their patients, as the opportunity presents, on matters such as smoking, diet and exercise which are of central importance in the prevention of illness and premature death.  With regard to the specific contribution of general practitioners, I have approved specific payments to be made to general practitioners who participate in the Measles, Mumps, Rubella campaign.  The new terms agreed for doctors participating in the GMS make it clear that preventive services form part of the GMS.  The new payment system to be introduced has as a major benefit the fact that doctors will have the opportunity to arrange their activities so as to permit longer consultations where necessary; this is particularly important in the context of prevention.  Discussions are continuing with the IMO on the question of whether a specific payment should be made for special services, including services of a preventive character, which are not a normal feature of general practice and which should be encouraged. This is an area which will be kept under continuing review and can be a means of encouraging innovation in areas which are clearly cost-effective.</P>

    <P>I have recently had a review carried out of the policies and systems implementation since 1982 to date and as a result of this review I have agreed that future policies will not be based on standardised systems but that health agencies should evaluate and select the most suitable hardware and software to meet their requirements, according to procedures and standards laid down by my Department and following the drawing up of an information technology (IT) plan for each health agency.  Priority will be given to the major health agencies, health boards and larger hospitals, but some provision will be made for the smaller agencies.  The priority applications will continue to be hospital information systems, financial systems and the community care area.</P>
    <P>It has also been agreed that, from 1989 onwards, there will be a special subhead in my Department's Vote for computerisation of health boards, hospitals and other health facilities.  This will facilitate the drawing up of an agreed planned implementation process over a period of time.  It will also ensure that computerisation will not be in competition with other projects for capital funding or other resources.</P>

Other hospitals provide a limited laboratory service doing routine tests, the remainder of the tests being done by one of the larger hospitals with which they have developed links.  A considerable amount of preliminary work has already been done in reviewing the organisation of our laboratory services.  We are looking at the usage of laboratory services, the number <Col N="1485" /> of major laboratories that are appropriate, given our geography and modern means of communication, the work arrangements in laboratories, and the initiatives which can be taken to improve productivity and accuracy.

    <P>With regard to the appointment of occupational therapists, the position is that, in common with all other grades, all health agencies have the opportunity on a monthly basis of notifying my Department of their priority requirements in the making of permanent appointments. Approvals are then issued in accordance with current Government policy on public service employment.  Under this process, a total of seven occupational therapists posts have been approved for <Col N="1487" /> permanent appointment to date in 1988.

      <P>AIDS</P>
      <P>The Council of Ministers are concerned with the fight against AIDS which is a priority international issue in the field of public health.

    <P>This involves exchange of views on the activities of the Community and member states in the fight against cancer with particular reference to European Cancer Information Year in 1989.  The programme is divided into four main areas, cancer prevention, information and health education in the prevention of cancer, training of health professionals and cancer research.  A &ldquo;European Week <Col N="1491" /> Against Cancer&rdquo; was organised in May 1988 which was very successful in Ireland and generated a lot of interest and discussion about cancer among the general public.</P>
    <P>Tobacco</P>
    <P>Smoking is a major cause of premature mortality and preventable morbidity in Europe.  Discussions on tobacco control concern proposals for a directive on the labelling of tobacco products broadly in line with existing Irish regulations, and the printing of tar and nicotine levels on cigarette packets.  Anti-smoking measures are seen as a central component of the fight against cancer in the community.</P>

      <P>The provision of speech therapy services in County Kerry is a matter for the Southern Health Board.  I understand that there is at present a vacancy for a speech therapist in that area which the board has been unable to fill as yet.  The position about speech therapy services in the Southern Health Board area generally is under review at present.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health whether the stipulation that, as and from 1 July 1987, DFLL8 tablets would be subject to prescription only as required by virtue of the Medical Preparations (Control of Sale) Regulations, 1987 has been effective; whether any action has been taken arising from the abuse of such tablets; and if this abuse has ceased.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon) Rory O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>Information available to my Department would suggest that abuse of DFLL8 tablets is not a problem at the moment.  I would feel that a number of initiatives taken in 1987 have contributed to the stamping out of an emerging problem of abuse involving this product.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1503" /> The first step involved the introduction on 1 July 1987 of general prescription controls over preparations of dihydrocodeine (including DFLL8 tablets) under the Medical Preparations (Control of Sale) Regulations, 1987 (S.I. No. 18 of 1987).</P>
    <P>In view of the fact that these general prescription controls were not in themselves sufficient to deal with the emerging problem of abuse of the tablets, I decided to extend the control regime provided for under the Misuse of Drugs Acts, 1977 and 1984 to preparations containing down to 10mg of dihydrocodeine.  This initiative was given effect to by virtue of the Misuse of Drugs (Exemption) (Amendment) Order, 1987 (S.I. No. 264 of 1987) which came into force on 16 October 1987.  This order has had the effect of making it an offence to supply or to have DFLL8 tablets in one's possession without an authority.  In addition the stricter Misuse of Drugs prescription writing and record keeping requirements now apply to DFLL8 tablets.</P>
    <P>The taking of this action has had the effect of facilitating monitoring of prescriptions issued for DFLL8 tablets, thereby enabling me to have recourse to the investigative procedures provided for under the Misuse of Drugs Acts 1977 and 1984 in cases of alleged irresponsible prescribing of the drug by doctors.</P>

The Army Pensions Acts provide that where compensation is received after the award of any such pension, the award may be reviewed and, having regard to the amount of such compensation, the pension may be either terminated or reduced.

    <P>The only organisation on the list submitted by the Deputy which received funding from my Department's national lottery allocation for youth is the Dublin Travellers' Education and Development Group.  That group have in 1988 been allocated a special grant of £6,300 in respect of a youth project.  There is no provision under my Department's lottery allocation for youth from which grants might be paid to local community development associations.</P>
    <P>The capital grant scheme for the provision of recreational facilities operated by my Department is specifically designed to assist local initiatives by voluntary community organisations in the provision of recreational, leisure and community facilities.</P>
    <P>Compilation of the details requested by the Deputy as it would relate to the 270 or so allocations made under the capital grant scheme would require an inordinate amount of staff time and I am not prepared to divert staff for that purpose from their essential duties associated with the administration of the scheme.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Education if she will sanction payment of a higher education grant, to a person (details supplied) in County Cork whose father is suffering from Alzheimer's disease, which necessitates the payment of over half the family income to a nursing home.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the conditions to be complied with by a candidate in order to qualify for a higher education grant is that the reckonable income of his/her parents or guardians be within the relevant limit set out in the means test tables in the scheme of the year he/she qualified <Col N="1520" /> academiclly for a grant by virtue of successes in the leaving certificate examination (in this case, the scheme of 1985).</P>
      <P>For the purposes of the scheme the term &ldquo;reckonable income&rdquo; means gross income from all sources, less any sum paid by way of contribution to a superannuation fund, and excluding also children's allowances under the Social Welfare Acts, holiday earnings of the candidate and payments under the family income supplement scheme.</P>
      <P>There is no provision in the scheme whereby medical expenses may be deducted from the gross income in order to bring the reckonable income within the limits of the means test.  In this case, it is understood from Cork County Council, that the reckonable income is greater than the relevant income limit and, accordingly, that a grant may not be paid.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>There are no immediate proposals to grant-aid the provision of a new boys' national school at Ballybunion, County Kerry.  I have, however, asked <Col N="1521" /> the local primary inspector to look into the quality of the accommodation at the existing boys' national school and to make recommendations with a view to its improvement.  The school authorities will be informed as soon as possible of the outcome of this investigation.  As the Deputy probably knows, boys also attend the local convent national school, so that the general organisation of first-level educational facilities in the Ballybunion area is also a factor to be considered.</P>
