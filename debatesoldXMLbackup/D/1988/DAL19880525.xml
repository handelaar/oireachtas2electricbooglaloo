In view of the enormous additional costs and delays inflicted on the building industry because of the ambiguity that surrounds building construction standards and the fact that we have only five or six working weeks before the summer recess, I appeal to the Taoiseach and the Minister for the Environment to consider the establishment of a special committee to pursue this matter.  It is non-partisan and noncontentious.</P>

      <P>This amendment deals with the definition section.  I propose a small addition to subsection (1) (e) which would allow for the inclusion of animal health in that definition.

    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 4, subsection (1) (f), line 1, after &ldquo;economics&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;socioeconomics, farm forestry and agri-tourism&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to broaden the definition of agriculture so as to include socio-economic matters, farm forestry and agri-tourism.  This would bring the terms of reference of the new organisation more into line with the existing terms of reference of ACOT and AFT.  It is a change which has been specifically requested by one of the major unions representing staff.  At a time when <Col N="9" /> agriculture is facing enormous difficulties and when it seems that the days of the CAP are numbered, it is important that those who live on the land and want to remain there should have access to all the advice and training necessary to allow them to consider diversifying into what might be considered non-farming areas.</P>
    <P>There is tremendous potential in this area.  People must be made conscious of that potential and the best way to do that is to make provision in the Bill.  At present there is a Bill going through the Dáil which provides for the establishment of a new commercial State forestry board, a development which we welcome very much.  However, we have always made it clear that we have no objection to private enterprise getting involved in forestry.  Indeed there are many generous grants and subsidies to allow them to do so.</P>
    <P>When people talk about private investment in forestry they are usually referring to large institutional investment but there is also scope for individual small-scale farm development.  In my area there have been a few small forestry developments. Land which is marginal for agriculture but suitable for forestry could produce valuable forest crops without reducing the agricultural potential of the remaining land.  One of the problems for farmers interested in investing in forestry is the length of time taken to produce a return on the investment.  However, there are now a number of quick growing trees becoming available which make this a more attractive proposition.</P>
    <P>As so many farmers are facing an uphill struggle, the potential for diversifying into strictly non-farming areas such as agri-tourism is particularly important. Farmhouse holidays have been a considerable success in a number of areas but their potential as a source of income for farm families has not been fully developed.  People who grow up in rural Ireland often do not appreciate the attractions of a farm holiday for urban families both in Ireland and abroad.  Our amendment simply asks that the definition of agriculture be extended to include these areas so that the new unified farm <Col N="10" /> body will be able to offer training and advice in these areas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>I am anxious that the definitions of the areas we are covering be broadened slightly to include the areas referred to in my amendment, farm forestry and agri-tourism.  These areas are already within the remit of the amalgamated farm bodies.  I ask the Minister to indicate that the references in the Bill are not exclusive and that we are not tightly confined to the words used in the Bill.  If the Minister would indicate that, I would be quite happy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me assure both Deputies that not only is that the intention but in fact I would like to think that I have demonstrated by action as well as words my commitment to rural development.</P>
      <P>First, I want to assure the House that the definition of rural development and the inclusion of rural development in agricultural economics, as the Deputies will see, is intended deliberately to cover all other aspects of what we call farm development as distinct from agriculture. If we were to start to define such aspects now, such as agri-tourism &mdash; which is a very important part of it &mdash; something else might emerge later that is not included, for example, alternative land usage, such as conversion to golf courses or development of land for recreational purposes.  I want to assure the House that by not indicating each of these in detail, and I totally endorse what has been said by both Deputies, I do not wish to exclude any such matters in the future.</P>
      <P>This is illustrated by two developments which have been introduced recently. First, I negotiated a range of special actions across a whole range of activities in the western package and they cover the matters that have been referred to, and agri-tourism and forestry are specifically covered in the western package. I introduced as a pilot programme, in advance of anywhere else in Europe, the integrated rural development pilot programme. They extend to the areas we are talking about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="11" /> I want to assure both Deputy Sherlock and Deputy Stagg that if for one moment I thought these matters were to be excluded I would be rushing to include specific data.  My worry is that if I included specific matters I would exclude something else by implication.  Incidentally the function of the amalgamated body is exactly the same as the existing legislation on AFT and ACOT, and ACOT in particular, under the existing legislation carry out socio-economic programmes as part of their remit.  There is no reason at all when we are repeating exactly the same functions in the new amalgamated authority that they would do other than carry on the socio-economic programmes.  Deputy Sherlock can be assured of that point.</P>
    <P>However, I acknowledge there is a slight change that forestry is not specifically mentioned in this section but I would like to draw the Deputy's attention to section 4 (8) where it is mentioned and I quote:</P>
    <P>The reference in subsection (1) (a) to advisory services in agriculture shall be construed as including a reference to advisory services in relation to the growing of trees as part of a farming enterprise and the establishment of shelter belts of trees ...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If that does not cover it, I do not think anything else will.  I want to assure both Deputies that I am in total agreement with them and in my view the legislation covers these points comprehensively.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the Minister's very positive reply, would he consider putting in some type of clause on Report Stage to cover any possibility of his wishes being circumvented at any stage?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware of the fact that there are other provisions in the Bill which give me power where necessary &mdash; not me, but the Minister of the day and that is more important because it is not the opinion of the Minister that is important but the actual function for whatever Minister will <Col N="12" /> be there &mdash; to give direction, or recommendation at least, to the authority to engage in certain kinds of programmes. That is included specifically because it is anticipated that we are in a period of revolutionary change in land usage.</P>
      <P>As we address the problem now in May 1988, no matter how far-seeing we want to be, it is more than likely that our successors in title in 1998 will be looking at a totally different scene.  The people involved in 1968 or 1978 would not recognise much of what is happening in agricultural husbandry and farm development now.  At this point I do not want to introduce specifics that can be interpreted in a court, and they are interpreted sometimes, as being so specific as by implication to exclude other things. That is the advice I have from the professional draftsman.  I have a personal opinion on that but I do not like wearing two hats.</P>

      <P>In section 40 there is a specific reference to the growing of trees as part of the farming enterprise and I accept that.

      <P>No one has the font of all knowledge on this matter.  I have to go by the legal advice given to me. Rural development is included, which is the catchall in terms of rural enterprise. No one can tell a landowner that he is excluded from engaging in forestry, agri-tourism, fish farming or anything else, provided it is done within the law. &ldquo;Rural development&rdquo; is a very broad phrase.  That is the best guarantee that is there.  If you put in a phrase such as &ldquo;agri-tourism,&rdquo; first, the phrase does not exist in legal definition.  We all have an idea of what we know it to mean.  Someday a court will define it, but until then it is the term as defined that will limit the scope of what is introduced here.</P>

      <P>In relation to farm forestry, I would like to ask the Minister if there is a danger of duplication with the Department of Forestry.  It has to be said that there is much talk not only about marginal land but also about set aside and I imagine that much more agricultural land will be planted.  If an individual or a farmer wants to plant trees he will have to seek advice and research, which he will get from the new authority. I am a little concerned about the duplication factor.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the other side of the coin, and we have to try to get the balance right.  The new authority, Coillte, will have exclusive responsibility for developing the forest programme.  What this is doing is simply building on a relationship that already exists.  There is already a very good, co-ordinated relationship between ACOT and the forestry service and we want to ensure that that will continue.  No attempt will be made here to get into what you might call the area specifically covered by the Department of Forestry at present or the new body, Coillte.  For example, if the new body want to suggest to prospective forest developers or farmers that they should seek advice as to the type of soil that will best produce trees, then they will have the capacity to give that advice. I do not think we want to block them from giving such advice.  The new authority will not be engaging directly in anything of the nature of enterprise development.  That will be left to the forestry board.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In page 5, subsection (1), lines 5 to <Col N="14" /> 18, to delete the definitions of &ldquo;agricultural research&rdquo; and &ldquo;basic veterinary research&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo; `agricultural research' includes research in relation to all aspects of agriculture, forestry, plant breeding and veterinary research;</P>
    <P>`veterinary research' includes research in relation to diseases of animals and poultry;&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The purpose of my amendment &mdash; I think it is inherent in the other proposals also &mdash; is to somewhat broaden the definition of agricultural research.  The second part of my amendment focuses on the references to basic veterinary research.  I want to remove the word &ldquo;basic&rdquo; from that definition because this is not a meaningful distinction in Irish circumstances. As is proposed at present, the new farm body are excluded, by definition of basic veterinary research, from the diagnosis of disease and also from engaging in the investigations, tests, inquiries or trials for the purpose of schemes or programmes of the Minister in relation to the eradication of diseases of animals or the promotion, enforcement or control of animal hygiene.  In general terms it would be accepted that the new farm body should not get involved in diagnosis <i>per se</i> but that they should have the opportunity of being involved in trials and tests thereafter. The purpose of my proposal is to establish a statutory provision which would enable that position to apply.</P>
    <P>My concern is that if the present statutory exclusion is retained in the Bill it would totally tie the hands not just of the farm body but also of the Minister, or any future Minister, if he wanted to make some administrative changes in the future.  I can see changes occurring in relation to the new TB body.  There might be the possibility of some co-ordinated approach between that body and the farm body.  It is not a matter now to decide exactly what those administrative arrangements will be.  I am just saying, let us not tie the hands of the Minister for the future; let him not be statutorily <Col N="15" /> excluded from making such arrangements.</P>

Having considered the matter, I am satisfied that this amendment will not cut across the purpose of the Bill and I am prepared to accept it.  If we accept amendment No. 4 that will also embrace amendments Nos. 5 and 6.  The intention was to ensure that we had the basic function of diagnosis, investigation and testing which has been, as Deputy O'Keeffe has rightly pointed out, and will continue to be, a function of the veterinary services of the department.  I certainly would not want to risk an exclusion that would prevent the new authority, in the course of, say, a programme of genetic engineering such as is being conducted at Moorepark, from basic diagnostic research.  On that basis I accept this amendment.</P>

      <P>I wish to make a few brief points in support of amendment No. 6.  The amendment seeks the deletion of paragraph (b) of section 1 which states that basic veterinary research does not include investigations, tests, inquiries or trials for the purpose of schemes or programmes of the Minister in relation to eradication of disease of animals or the <Col N="16" /> promotion, enforcement or control of animal hygiene.  Our main objection to this paragraph is that it seems to preclude the involvement of the new organisation in the carrying out of tests in, for instance, the TB or brucellosis eradication schemes.  Why should the new body not be given an active role in the campaign to eradicate bovine TB and brucellosis?  The unsuccessful campaign to eradicate these diseases has been one of the greatest scandals in the history of agriculture in this State.</P>

      <P>In page 5, subsection (1), lines 15 to 18, to delete paragraph (b). </P>
      <P>We are making a case to delete paragraph (b) and I hope our amendment will be accepted.  The campaign to eradicate the disease has been one of the greatest scandals in the history of agriculture in this State.  More than £1,000 million have been spent in the past 20 years, and yet we are no nearer to a disease-free herd. Vets have made huge sums of money out of the campaign.  Fees paid annually to private veterinary practitioners for testing under the disease eradication scheme over the past five years were: in 1983, £10.6 million; in 1984, £8.3 million; in 1985, £11.9 million; in 1986, £11 million and in 1987, £12 million.  Are we going to allow this to continue indefinitely?</P>
      <P>This is something I want to tease out. Why should not the new body be allowed to use the expertise and skill available to assist them in the campaign against these diseases?  We hear a lot from Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and the Progressive Democrats about how the private sector should be allowed to compete with the public sector, for example, in the transport area. Why should not the private sector be allowed to compete with the public sector in this area also?  There is no reason the simple task of taking a blood sample from an animal has to be done by a vet.  I have been hearing that for the past 20 years since the scheme was introduced.</P>
      <P>If a person goes to a hospital for a blood test, more than likely it will be done by a nurse.  Why should blood samples under these schemes not be taken by technicians?  The new body would be in an ideal position to provide these services. If we are serious about tackling disease eradication we should take the handcuffs off the new body and allow them to get involved in this area.  I thank you for allowing me to make those points because I wanted to get them across very clearly.</P>

The board will be very conscious of the case the Deputy made.  The mechanics of how blood tests are taken will be for them to decide, not for this Authority.  I am sure they will use the resources of this Authority and the diagnostic services of the Department of Agriculture and Food to maximum effect.  However, I take the point the Deputy raised.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
      <P>In page 5, subsection (1), line 22, to delete &ldquo;Teagasc&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;ACOTT&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>All these amendments focus on the name for the new farm body.  There has been considerable debate on this but one thing that emerged is that there has been universal dissatisfaction with the name &ldquo;Teagasc&rdquo;.  There have been difficulties with pronunciation, references to its literal definition and so on.  The straight definition of &ldquo;Teagasc&rdquo; is &ldquo;doctrine&rdquo; as in Teagasc Chríostí but some more unusual definitions have been produced.  In one old Irish dictionary I found &ldquo;Teagasc&rdquo; defined as magic spells or incantations. That gave rise to other stories about the new body which I will not go into.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While there has been universal criticism of the name, there has not been universal approval of a new name.  I have examined different possibilities and my colleague, Deputy Gibbons, has also come up with a proposal.  I eventually came to the conclusion that of all the names suggested, ACOTT was probably <Col N="19" /> the one which would get the broadest support.  Other names proposed like FIOS, FIOSRÚ, An Chomhairle Talmhaíochta or Forbairt, Cumas, or Comhar.  All were looked at but problems arose with virtually all of them.</P>
    <P>In relation to ACOTT, I accept in advance that it might touch on the sensitivities of the members of the Agricultural Institute, but let me assure the members and staff of the institute that there is no such intention on my part.  We are including the &ldquo;A&rdquo; and &ldquo;T&rdquo; of AFT. The basis of ACOTT is taking the original name, An Chomhairle Oiliúna Talmhaíochta and adding &ldquo;agus Taighde,&rdquo;&ldquo;and research&rdquo; to the original ACOT title.  An Chomhairle Oiliúna Talmhaíochta becomes An Chomhairle Oiliúna agus Taighde Talmhaíochta, for short, ACOTT.</P>
    <P>The brand name is important, the name with which people can identify, one that is widely understood throughout the community.  The short name ACOT has been well recognised all over the country. It seems that it would only require a slight change for ACOTT to include research, giving a wider identification and acceptability to the new-found body.</P>
    <P>This question of brand image and name is perhaps more important than might appear at first glance.  I read lately a financial report based on a possible takeover of a very major chocolate firm.  I noticed that the report did not concentrate on the assets, the plant or machinery, in relation to the value of the firm, but on the brand names which were associated with it &mdash; Kit-kat, After Eight, Black Magic.  These are names which are well known, certainly in this country and in many others.  That public recognition places a huge value on them.  For that reason, in a similar way public recognition of the name ACOT is something which should not be thrown aside lightly. I suggest that my colleagues might consider this proposal to cover that situation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support the sentiments expressed by my colleague on the basis that AFT and ACOT have <Col N="20" /> already been established as being synonymous with research, development, education, etc. in the agricultural sphere. It would be unfortunate to depart entirely from those benchmarks that have been accepted by the agricultural community and the community in general as being fundamental to the industry.  Also, with the introduction of a new Bill or a new authority, the purpose of which is to replace what were previously found to have been satisfactory authorities, recognition should be given to both outgoing bodies.  Their name as well as their function should be incorporated, in so far as this is possible, in the new authority.  The Minister may have differing views on that.</P>
      <P>If for no other reason than to give recognition to the efforts of both outgoing bodies, in some way the Minister should try to incorporate the names of those two bodies within the new one. With all due respect of the meaning of the word, I do not think that Teagasc is likely to do that.  I fear that there might be a certain amount of apprehension generated within the farming community and among those who were involved in the outgoing bodies of ACOT and AFT that perhaps much more might be involved than a mere change in the name, that there could well be a very dramatic change in the basic functions of the new body as compared with the old and that these might not necessarily be beneficial to the agricultural industry.  I formally support my colleague.</P>

      <P>First, I would have to agree with the two last speakers about the name of Teagasc.  I consider it very inappropriate.  After giving this a great deal of consideration, I decided to introduce, for a couple of reasons an English version, that is, the Agricultural Research Development Authority.  The first is that the amalgamation of ACOT and AFT is a dramatic change and we need a definite, new name.  If this name is to have English and European recognition, it is important that it be something that people understand.  On that account I am proposing ARDA.  Not only did <Col N="21" /> Europeans not understand ACOT, but our own farmers, for whom all these services were provided, did not and do not understand what ACOT means today.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I should have wished Deputy O'Keeffe to have elaborated a little on the definition of Teagasc and to have made comparisons.  Deputy Gibbons now has put forward his amendment. I want to make the point that people are confused about the word ACOT and how much more confused will they be about ARDA?  There is, however, need for a name other than Teagasc.  I should like to put it on record that I favour ACOT at this point as the name.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>There is not anything like unanimity as to what the name should be.  I have no total commitment to any name but let me say, not with tongue in cheek, that one of the matters that are important is that the name should be known, identified and actually acknowledged to be the name.  The first reaction to the name that I proposed was in some instances amusement and in some rejection, but because this debate has been going on for some time and the name has been repeated very often, I must admit now that Teagasc has the first precondition &mdash; it is well known, certainly at this stage, where it would not have been known before.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Secondly, it has an Irish flavour, which is a very important element.  I do not understand the case made by Deputy Gibbons about Europeans not understanding this or that.  If there is one thing that Europeans expect from each country within that greater European family, it is that it will present and vindicate its character and culture as part of the wider European family.  We do not have to do something so that the Germans, British, <Col N="22" /> French and others will find it acceptable to them.  I do not want to go into this argument too widely.  I do not want to dismiss either ACOT or ARDA.  They are very reasonable attempts on the part of both my colleagues.  However, would they be any more amenable to European understanding than Teagasc?  There is no case that would suggest that they would. In fact, the case has been made already this morning that the farmers did not understand what ACOT meant, but they used it.</P>
    <P>One of my colleagues mentioned the brand name of Kit-kat.  If ever one were to think of a name that would seem, on the face of it, to denigrate the notion of wholesome food, I would have thought that it would be Kit-kat, with the implications of kitty-katty.  Still it is, as has been mentioned, one of the better known brand names and obviously one of the most acceptable.  As Deputy O'Keeffe has pointed out, research into the philology of the Irish term will show that Teagasc can mean a variety of things. I hope from now on that it will mean something like applying the basis of learning and research to our most fundamental function &mdash; agricultural production. I do not want to seem to be rigid about this but there is no better alternative.  Tá a fhios ag gach éinne go bhfuil an t-ainm seo &ldquo;Teagasc&rdquo; á chur againn ar an chomhairle seo.  Os rud é go bhfuil a fhios sin ag daoine, I am inclined to think that it is the best available and it has the flavour of being very Irish.</P>

The case now being made by the Minister is that there was so much criticism of the name Teagasc that it has become well known and qualifies on that basis.  If the Minister feels that the alternatives put on offer are not good enough, I will not press my amendment.</P>

      <P>In page 6, subsection (2), line 28, to delete &ldquo;34 and 36&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;34, 36 and 59&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is a technical amendment to delete &ldquo;34 and 36&rdquo; and to substitute &ldquo;34, 36 and 59&rdquo;.  The reason for this is that section 4 (2) provides for the transfer to Teagasc of all of the functions enjoyed by AFT and ACOT under the original 1977 Act immediately before the establishment day, except sections 34 and 36 which provided for staff schemes for ACOT and functions for the committees of agriculture. The Attorney General has advised me that the intention of section 58 of the 1977 Act which deals with consideration to committees of agriculture from property transferred would, strictly speaking, require Teagasc to have an entry made in the annual estimate submitted to the Minister regarding local contributions, even though the Minister will now no longer have a function in this. Accordingly, the Attorney General has advised that section 59 should be included with sections 34 and 36 as functions excepted in the general transfer of functions. It is purely technical.</P>

    <P>In page 6, subsection (3), line 36, <Col N="24" /> after &ldquo;industry&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and any further matters as may be decided by ACOTT with the consent of the Minister&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This amendment deals with the priority functions of Teagasc.  The section sets out the principal functions and subsection (3), without prejudice to the generality of subsections (1) and (2) provides that Teagasc shall have particular regard to certain areas.  The areas selected by the Minister are ones with which I have no quibble.  They are very important areas. They are the areas of agricultural training and education for young persons and research and development in relation to food.  The purpose of my amendment is to ensure that those priorities are not set in concrete for all time.  In years to come another area may be of top priority.  It would be appropriate for the Minister of the day and Teagasc to be entitled to give that area priority rather than having their hands statutorily tied.</P>
    <P>My amendment is to leave the door open in the future to cater for another major priority area.  Under the Bill as presently framed it may not be possible to give another area that priority.  I know that at the moment rural development is in its early stages but in ten years time, the concept of rural development might be of much greater importance and there might be a lot more funding for it both nationally and from the EC.  It might be the thinking at that time that rural development should be given top priority.  The Bill should be framed in such a way that the board of Teagasc at the time, with the consent of the Minister, should be able to establish rural development as such a priority.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>This relates to a matter we have already dealt with in an earlier amendment to which I showed a positive disposition.  Deputy O'Keeffe makes the point that, if we make specific reference to two or three areas now, the Minister of the day could be precluded from extending this Bill to cover other areas.  There is not any risk of that.  The reason for the specific reference to the <Col N="25" /> training of young farmers and to research and development in the area of food processing is to reflect the importance which the Government of the day attach to those areas.  That is not to suggest that there will not be some other areas of development that cannot be envisaged now.  This provision is merely meant to be indicative of the current priorities and, I hope, a signal to succeeding Ministers for Agriculture and Food that the priorities of the day should be reflected.  If I as Minister could not give some general direction or sense of priority to the new authority as to where I would like them to focus, I could be said to be leaving things very vague without any sense of policy priority, particularly as that policy priority is shared universally in this House.</P>
      <P>The purpose of section 13 is that Teagasc should make a report on their activities to the Minister at the end of each financial year and the report shall include information in such form and regarding such matters as the Minister may direct.  The Minister has certain powers having regard to that report. There is scope in that for Teagasc to put forward in their annual programme of activities any other matters they feel should get special attention.  I hope they will use that scope in each year to put forward proposals on areas which warrant special attention.  I am not going against the spirit of what Deputy O'Keeffe says, but the amendment is unnecessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One example to illustrate my point is ACOT where the demand for services from ACOT has changed dramatically even over the past three years.  Up to about two years ago or less, most farmers went to ACOT in relation to what would be regarded as normal husbandry, in relation to soil development, in relation to increasing milk yields, the weight and conformation of animals and the yield in cereals.  All of these things were a first priority and understandably so.  I have been informed that the greatest demand is for the effluent control service in silage, a service which did not exist up until a few years ago.  That is what most farmers <Col N="26" /> are looking for now.  There is also a demand for the service on financial management of farm enterprises, and again such a service was not provided effectively by ACOT up until almost two years ago.  I only mention those as examples to show how the pace of change is so rapid, if not revolutionary.  The provisions outlined in section 13 will be used.  I accept the spirit and the rationale behind what Deputy O'Keeffe is saying, but I hope he can also accept that another general phrase like that is not necessary.</P>

      <P>If the Minister feels that the subsection as presently framed would not pre-empt the options for Teagasc in the future, that is OK by me. I was worried that, if there were to be a national consensus that special priority should be given to another area in the future, there should be the possibility of it being included within the terms of this subsection.  However, I take the point which has been made by the Minister that, either through a direction from the Minister or a request from the board, the provisions are such at present that any such priority area could be accommodated. Therefore, I am prepared to withdraw the amendment.</P>

      <Col N="28" /> The Minister has been very fair with us in regard to the proposlas we made in an effort to unlock the statutory shackles when discussing the definitions and what is and what is not veterinary research and agricultural research.  The purpose of this amendment is to further unlock those shackles; but, as I see the Minister smiling, let me say that I am not suggesting that we throw away the key altogether.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to appear to be anti-Civil Service, but basically it appears that the subsection is framed in such a way as to protect their own research and testing functions.  I can well understand why they would seek to protect them; but, on the other hand, I do not think this subsection has any place in legislation.  At the end of the day it would be a matter for the Minister to decide on the allocation of the functions as between his Department and Teagasc. The Minister is aware of my views on this issue.  I believe, in so far as it can be done administratively, that it would be far more cost effective to have many of the research and testing functions of the Department carried out by Teagasc.  That is a substantive issue which I am not going to go into.  In regard to the legislative framework for Teagasc which we are now discussing, I think it is inappropriate that there should be an exclusion section. Quite bluntly, I think this subsection has been included to protect the departmental empire.  Other ways and means would be open to the Department to fight their corner as between themselves and Teagasc.  I do not think it is appropriate for such an exclusion section to be included in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This subsection specifically excludes Teagasc from engaging in a wide area of testing of livestock or poultry, testing of grass, cereal, root or vegetable seeds, potatoes or plants for the purposes of certification schemes, testing samples of seeds or testing or analysing samples of fertilisers and so on unless authorised by the Minister in writing to do so.  It is <Col N="29" /> inappropriate to have that subsection included in the Bill.  The Minister may correct me and say that it has been inserted for another purpose.  But essentially my view is that it should not be there at all and for that reason I have moved this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has anticipated my response.  If I were to concede on this I would be throwing away the key and saying in effect that I had no right to get into the House at all.  Let me give him the reason why this section was included.  If I were to adopt this amendment it would allow Teagasc to become involved in the testing of livestock and poultry under our national breeding programmes for which the Minister of the day must certify standards, not just national standards but also European standards.  It is a requirement under European law that the Minister of each country would certify standards and this would also extend to the testing of seeds and plants.  As I have said, there is a statutory responsibility on the Minister to certify these standards on a national level and, as we will be dealing with an internal market in 1992, for the broader European domestic market, if one could call it such and I believe we should.  That is why that responsibility is on the Minister of the day alone.  It has to be done on the basis of the testing carried out on his behalf.  I am not saying that other people are not competent to do this testing, but this is purely a certification and testing function.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should remember also that the provisions contained in this subsection would allow the Minister to authorise Teagasc to carry out such activities should the need arise in the future.  The responsibility would have to remain with the Minister. The Deputy may reasonably say that this is another cover for the determination of the officials of the Department not to concede part of their empire. We are all jealous of whatever it is we control.  But I think I can assure you &mdash; and it is evident &mdash; that that has not been the approach at all.  A lot has been happening.  I have to say that I have not <Col N="30" /> seen another group of officials who are so ready to look at their functions in relation to tomorrow than the officials in my Department.  When I discussed the TB problem with them there was no battle.  There may have been before&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I can tell the Deputy that there really was not, that the battle was outside between the vets and the farm associations.  When they came back and said to us: &ldquo;We cannot agree it, we then agreed it&rdquo;.  The same applies here but I do not want to go into that.  They do not need to be vindicated by me.  No matter what is said, there will always be that suggestion.  I do not think the Deputy needs to be concerned about that.  This simply confirms the provisions contained in the 1977 Act which, of course, would not be sufficient justification for inserting them again.  I might put it to the Deputy on this basis, that it will enable the Minister of the day to engage the services of Teagasc where necessary.  Let us suppose that a farmer came along and said: &ldquo;I got this test done by Teagasc and this certificate says it is different from your test&rdquo;.  I am not saying that one test has to be better than the other but all kinds of problems can arise.  Somebody must have responsibility in regard to this, that is all, and we will engage the services of Teagasc where appropriate.</P>

      <P>Notwithstanding what the Minister has said, I would make the point that, while the same section was incorporated in the 1977 Act, times have changed considerably since then.  There are greater pressures and needs for research and development now than there were then, particularly bearing in mind the need to eatablish ourselves on the world scene to an even greater extent.</P>

It was in considering those statutory exclusions that I raised this issue.  I am not as concerned at all about subsection (5) because the Minister does have the power, in writing, to ask Teagasc to engage in any of these activities.  We will let the battle between the Department and Teagasc run on.  There will not be a statutory exclusion and, from that point of view, I am prepared to withdraw my amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 20:</P>
      <P>In page 7, subsection (7) (a), line 33, to delete &ldquo;that is wholly owned by Teagasc&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="32" /> I regard this amendment as a serious one because it goes to the root as to whether Teagasc will be able to have a commercial face in the years ahead.  Because of the restriction on Exchequer funding, obviously Teagasc will have to be able to use their resources to best effect to raise what revenue they can in the years ahead. There is such a shortfall in funding that that will have to be a major function of Teagasc.  I am not suggesting that they are being set up as a commercial body. What I am saying is that they will need to be able to use all the instruments available to them to exploit commercially some of their resources, in particular in the research area.  It seems to me that, because of the vast wealth of expertise and experience developed over the years, there will be possibilities for commercial exploitation in such areas as bio-technology and embryo transfers in the area of plant breeding, indeed possibly even from the National Food Centre.</P>
    <P>Of course Teagasc themselves could engage directly in such commercial exploitation, but let us bear in mind that that will not constitute their principal function.  Also they may not have the kind of expertise needed in the marketplace &mdash; that is not advanced as a criticism &mdash; but it should be said that that will not be their principal function.  I would envisage that Teagasc may involve themselves in joint ventures with other State, semi-State bodies or with private interests from the point of view of the commercial exploitation of such resources.</P>
    <P>The problem arises because the Bill, as drafted at present, will not permit of that.  That is why I tabled a series of amendments to loosen the position in regard to subsidiaries.  The first is the requirement in the Bill, as drafted, that a subsidiary be wholly-owned.  Quite frankly, from the commercial point of view, that makes any joint venture operation a total non-starter.  The ability to form subsidiaries, normally understood in commercial terms, would be non-existent. It would mean it would have to be wholly owned.  In these circumstances the question may well be posed: what is the <Col N="33" /> point in forming a subsidiary at all other than for administrative reasons?  I can foresee the possibility of considerable amounts of external finance being available to invest with Teagasc, to invest venture capital in such subsidiaries.  That will not be possible unless we change the requirement that such subsidiaries be wholly owned.  Nobody with venture capital will invest in a subsidiary of Teagasc that is wholly-owned by Teagasc.  If they want to make a venture investment they will want to share the equity.  That is normal commercial practice and I see nothing wrong with it.</P>
    <P>Tied in with this approach are the restrictive provisions in relation to how such subsidiaries should operate.  In framing my amendments I have endeavoured to bear in mind the anxieties of the Minister and those of his colleague, the Minister for Finance, to have the ability to ensure that such a subsidiary would not, as it were, run away with itself.  My amendments have been designed in order to leave the overall power in regard to policy and expenditure remaining with the Minister and the Minister for Finance. However, I have not gone quite that far.  From the point of view of the share capital we must at least remove the requirement that a subsidiary be wholly owned.  From the point of view of the ability of the Minister to issue directions as to the programmes and activities of such a subsidiary, that would be entirely inappropriate to a body that might have a commercial face and in which there might be external investment.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 21 relates to the question of the disposal of any assets of such a subsidiary requiring the consent of the Minister for Finance.  Again, that would be inappropriate to a subsidiary that might be involved in the marketplace.  I urge the Minister to open the door to enable Teagasc to have the power to capitalise on their resources, either directly or jointly with others, in the marketplace in the future.  As the Bill is presently framed it would be well-nigh impossible for them to run a commercialised service on a business-like footing.  That is the purpose of my amendments and I <Col N="34" /> strongly urge the Minister to accept them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is interesting that the issue Deputy O'Keeffe addresses arises because of the new scope being given to Teagasc, which the institute did not have up to now.  Under the legislation I am proposing that we can set up wholly owned subsidiaries under Teagasc to act, and that is very important, in the same manner as Teagasc are conditioned and equipped to act in respect of the activities of those wholly owned subsidiaries.  I think all of us would agree that this is necessary.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Keeffe is asking me, having gone that far, to go further and I think this is where we get into some difficulty.  This would involve the setting up of commercial ventures, possibly in association with outside interests, and, as I understand from him this would clearly involve the production and marketing of products that would not be appropriate to a non-commercial State funded organisations. We must remember that we are talking about a non-commercial State funded support body.  We are not talking about a commercial State funded body. If commercial bodies, State funded or otherwise, want to get involved in joint ventures or whatever else, as is happening at present in relation to Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann and many other bodies like that, there is no bar on them because they are in the commercial arena and they operate there on the same basis as anybody else.  Of course, there will be considerations of risk and prudence but, subject to that, they are not prevented from getting involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is asking me to break out into completely new ground which, incidentally, is not there either for the other promotional bodies like FÁS.  They are not allowed under the legislation which gives effect to them to get involved through partly owned subsidiaries in commercial activities by way of joint ventures of one form or another.  There are a good many reasons for this.  It will not <Col N="35" /> surprise the Deputy to know that permanent responsibility for this resides in the Department of Finance &mdash; it is not just the view of the current Minister for Finance &mdash; and they would not be able to accept that a promotional body, with a State guarantee could get involved in a commercial activity by way of joint venture. You are either one or the other and that is the view that exists.</P>
    <P>I want to make it clear that I want the authority &mdash; and I have said this many times &mdash; to be more commercially orientated in respect of their functions and in the actual provision of services.  I want them to be much more commercially orientated than has been the case.  This legislation is intended to apply that in the area of research, education and advice, which is really their fundamental function, and not in the area of commercial enterprise in the marketplace.  If they were to engage in joint ventures of one kind or another this could deflect the Authority from their primary purpose and could lead to a dissipation of resources.  I also want to tell the Deputy &mdash; and this will not surprise the Deputy because it is not a matter that would occur to me only &mdash; it has been made known to me that many people in the private sector would have very serious reservations &mdash; if not very strong objections &mdash; about a State sponsored promotional body, with all that that means, being able to engage in competition with people in the private sector in an area where they have to compete without any State sponsorship or support.  That could give rise to problems.</P>
    <P>I accept &mdash; and I do not think there is any difference between Deputy O'Keeffe's thinking and mine on this &mdash; the need to make Teagasc as commercially sensitive as possible.  That can be achieved if the Authority enter into licensing, royalty or franchise arrangements so that they can exploit effectively the results of research.  I want them to do that and I want them to engage in hard bargaining in relation to contracts and consultancies. It is not just what I want; I think it is what all of us want and I hope they want <Col N="36" /> it also.  Any genuine lack of resources to bring promising lines of research to the stage of commercial viability could, for instance, be met by using Teagasc's borrowing powers under this legislation.</P>
    <P>The Deputy might say: &ldquo;This power, of course, can only be exercised with the consent of the Minister and the Minister for Finance&rdquo;.  That is the position in respect of all borrowing conducted by these bodies.  I think Deputies could reasonably expect that if these bodies go in the direction we want them to go, the Minister of the day, and certainly this Minister, would not prevent them from engaging in a commercial approach to their primary functions and they could reasonably expect to get consent for that in the circumstances.  This is a fundamental issue and the Government are conscious that if they once allow promotional semi-State bodies, with all the guarantees and special protection they have, to get involved in joint ventures in competition with the private sector who have no such advantages and if they allow them to be distracted or have their energy and resources dissipated by commercial enterprises as distinct from what their fundamental role would be, this would be a major change and it is not one the Government and I, at this time at least, can see our way to making.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed at the Minister's reaction.  In fact there is a fundamental contradiction in the Minister's approach to this issue.  He accepts the need for Teagasc to have a commercial face.  That is obvious from the point of view of the huge reduction in Exchequer funding.  If they are to operate effectively, obviously they will have to have recourse to alternative sources of revenue.  If we accept that there should be a revenue raising aspect to the new farm body, it seems to be madness to deny them the normal commercial forms and instruments available to others.  How can they compete for revenue in the marketplace when they are so restrictively tied down by the terms of the legislation? It will be a major disservice to Teagasc to continue with the provisions in relation <Col N="37" /> to subsidiaries as presently framed.  Furthermore, it closes off major possibilities of revenue raising by Teagasc in the years ahead.</P>
      <P>As I mentioned earlier, they clearly have vast resources in terms of technology and research into bio-technology and so on.  In some instances it may be a question of competing in the market but in others it is not.  There may be an element of competition in regard to research into embryo transfers, but is it not mad that Teagasc should be left to compete in future without being able to compete on level terms with the rest of the market?  On the other hand, does it not close off entirely the possibility of external investment in the kind of developments we are talking about if there is a continued insistence on having the subsidiaries wholly owned by Teagasc?</P>
      <P>I am aware that already such possibilities are under consideration and they could be of major benefit to Teagasc from the revenue point of view.  It does not really make sense to insist that subsidiaries would have to be wholly owned, thereby closing off all such possibilities to Teagasc.  I understand the attitude of the Minister and the Minister for Finance in wanting to keep a strong element of control from the expenditure point of view.  For that reason I would be prepared to leave the restrictions on subsidiaries tighter than I had envisaged in my series of amendments.  I wanted to loosen the position in regard to subsidiaries so that Teagasc would be in a position to exploit the resources it has and have reasonable revenue-raising capacity in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most fundamental issue is in regard to being wholly owned.  If the Minister will not go along with me on the question of permitting Teagasc to establish subsidiaries other than those that are wholly owned, the other considerations do not arise at all because the question of subsidiaries would not be relevant in the context in which the Minister and I have been discussing them. I urge the Minister to rethink this if only in relation to the requirement that subsidiaries be wholly owned.  If the Minister <Col N="38" /> does not accept that a change is needed on that issue, he will bear the responsibility for closing off a major window of opportunity for Teagasc in the years ahead.  Whatever about the other amendments in relation to subsidiaries &mdash; and I am prepared to accept that some are not as relevant as others &mdash; the fundamental principle that subsidiaries be wholly owned is central.  Again, I strongly urge the Minister to accept that that should not be a requirement, at least from the legislative point of view.</P>
    <P>If the Minister is prepared to delete that requirement both he and the Minister for Finance will have a whole range of controls available to them to ensure that such a subsidiary would not go astray in any way.  Some views offered to me are to the effect that the various controls in the Bill would seriously damage the prospects of any such subsidiary, but the question does not arise at all unless the Minister is prepared to accept the possibility that such subsidiary could be other than wholly owned by Teagasc.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not prepared to accept an amendment which would delete the condition that a subsidiary be wholly owned and I will again give the reasons.  We are dealing here with a body which is to provide a service; it is not a commercial body.  Because it is essentially a service body there is no question of it competing in the marketplace for revenue.  That is not its function.  They are not meant to be out competing in the marketplace with other commercial organisations, be they semi-State or private. They are meant to be commerciallyoriented in respect of the service they provide and they are meant to provide value for money and to guarantee, when they undertake consultancy contracts or royalty arrangements with the meat industry, for instance, to apply sound hard-headed commercial criteria in respect of the service they provide.  Equally, the body for whom they provide the service can feel assured that there is no risk of the people providing the service becoming involved, through a back door, in a joint venture with a competitor of <Col N="39" /> theirs.  If one is going to provide a service specifically limited to advice and research, then it follows that one should not engage in something that could be inconsistent with that service.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may have misunderstood me, although I did not think I could have been misunderstood, when I said I wanted them to have a commercial approach in respect of the service they were to provide.  That is not to say the Government would want to see a change of direction where semi-State bodies engaged in promotional services would, for the first time, be cleared to engage in joint ventures in competition with people who do not have the benefits and advantages they have, the people who would normally be calling on their services.  That is the distinction.</P>
      <P>If we were dealing this morning with a commercial State body I would not be making this case but we are dealing with a service body.  I want to see them maximising the revenue they get from the service they provide, but only from the service they provide, and not for risktaking in regard to any other enterprise that is not appropriate to a service body. I hope they will be hard-nosed in respect of the service they provide and the criteria they apply and I will give some evidence of that later on.  I do not want to see their whole function being changed by risk taking.</P>

      <P>As a result of what the Minister has said we will have to redefine what was previously regarded as the service sector of the public service.  What we are looking at now is a mixture of commerce and service.  Teagasc will not simply be providing a service funded from the general Exchequer but will be selling their services in various forms in the marketplace in competition with the private sector.  In what circumstances would it be necessary for Teagasc to set up a wholly owned subsidiary?  What is the reason for that?  Why could not Teagasc assign duties to some of their staff and say: &ldquo;That is your job; you carry out that <Col N="40" /> particular function&rdquo;?  What is the necessity for setting up the wholly owned subsidiary we are talking about?  Without having the benefit of the Minister's reply, can he see a case in which a joint venture type of activity could be carried out by Teagasc and the private sector?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is implicit in one of the later sections.  An example of a wholly owned subsidiary would be a consultancy service overseas where it would be necessary to have separate registration for the purpose of consultancy arrangements by way of contract with the country or the body concerned.  There would be others as well.  I hope it is clear to the House that I do not want to be restrictive or rigid, much less authoritarian, in respect of this legislation but it does raise fundamental issues.  When we are dealing with a service body which is funded by the State to provide that service the approach I am adhering to is the appropriate one.</P>
      <P>Incidentally, because we are breaking out into new territory and are providing, for the first time, for wholly owned subsidiaries the question has arisen as to why it should be confined to a wholly owned subsidiary.  In the sense I am a victim of my own innovation in that we are doing something very new.  I do not see any problem in respect of a wholly owned subsidiary which will be conditioned and regulated under the same circumstances as Teagasc themselves.  An agent should be in a position to act in the same manner and under the same conditions as the principal.  That is a fundamental condition of law in any event and that is all I am trying to translate into the new provision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will not anticipate what might happen with wholly owned subsidiaries.  If it happened in practice that somebody were to come back in a year, two years or whenever in the course of the annual reports, I would not close my mind to what might be reasonable at that time. I cannot envisage such a case but the principle across the whole range of service bodies in the semi-State sector would <Col N="41" /> then automatically change.  That is a very important principle at this point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I have made the case and I thought I had made it logically and fairly.  Deputy Stagg focused in on the fundamental issue of what is the point in having subsidiaries if they are to be framed in the fashion proposed in the Bill.  I believe the Minister is making a major mistake on this issue.  I can see that my proposal conflicts with an essential principle not just of the Minister but of the Government.  I do not see that I can make any further headway by logical argument.  I predict that it is a question that will have to be returned to in the years ahead by way of amending legislation.</P>
      <P>I conclude by reiterating that it is a fundamental major mistake on the part of the Minister and the Government.  The new farm body which is suffering from many disabilities at birth, particularly from the point of view of funding and personnel who have left, will now find that they will be more restricted in the future.  The Minister and the Government are not prepared to concede on this point and on that basis I do not intend to push my amendments any further.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am asked to give my views on amendment No. 27.  If we were to accept this amendment it would remove ministerial control on the numbers, grades, pay and conditions of the staff members of Teagasc and <i>ipso facto</i> subsidiaries of Teagasc.  Not surprisingly, I cannot agree to doing that.</P>
      <P>These controls are standard in legislation of this kind and have been introduced also in the FÁS legislation.  The Deputy will be aware that the Minister and the Minister for Finance of the day have responsibility in relation to the funding and for that reason an obligation in relation to the amount of the funding, the grades and numbers involved that would be paid out of that funding.  The Government should not repudiate that as part of their responsibility.  It is important to assert that each Government obviously will want to be able to exercise that function. If they do not the function of the Minister of the day is going to be totally undermined.</P>
      <P>I am not one who wants to see unnecessary interference in any way by any Minister.  On the other hand, powers are there and can be used effectively, or sometimes slightly misused &mdash; I will not say wrongly used.  This is not a way of imposing bureaucratic control.  I do want to imply that public servants are always indulging in bureaucratic control; that is not the case.  However, this is not just a way of someone putting a dead hand on the new authority, their grades, numbers, pay and conditions.  It is the guarantee that the elected representatives in Government will have both the responsibility and the opportunity to be able to control how the money is spent to the extent of the numbers, grades, staff and questions of that kind.  If we were to concede this amendment our successors in title, whoever they might be, would have major problems down the line.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>While I appreciate the Minister's views in this regard and take into account that the Minister and the Minister for Finance must have overall responsibility and the final say in relation to the determination of amounts, charges <Col N="46" /> etc., in discussing the last section we talked about the commercial nature of the enterprise.  The Minister envisaged as per the discussion on the previous section giving Teagasc a commercial thrust and, as it were, having them operate on a commercial basis while keeping within the general ambit of the Bill.  Would he not see that running into conflict with the subsection in the sense that it might well come to pass that the Minister may for very good reasons such as keeping control of public expenditure etc., impose a restriction which would be contrary to the opinion he expressed on the previous section or, on the other hand, he might well have to impose a restriction whereby the commercial thrust he expected Teagasc to have would be negatived by virtue of a decision he might have to make?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us look at the subsections.  They provide that Teagasc may appoint such numbers or persons to be members of the staff of Teagasc as they may determine &mdash; that is going a long way &mdash; with the consent of the Minister and the Minister for Finance.  Again, because it is there, the same provision is made for the subsidiaries.  The board of a subsidiary may appoint such a number of persons to be members of the staff of the subsidiary as they may determine with the consent of the Minister and the Minister for Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy has made a good point. The purpose of that provision is that if &mdash; taking this commercial approach to the services they provide and going out there and selling the services as they are doing &mdash; it emerges that they can identify a need in the market for those services and then claim they need an extra programme to provide this and to recruit an extra consultant staff to back it up, that is for them.  They would then come along and claim that over and above the staff complement and grades they had needed to recruit one or two others for a particular purpose in the short time or on a permanent basis.  To do that they come to the Minister and the Minister for Finance. That is why I envisage a possibility <Col N="47" /> the Deputy refers to.  If the occasion arises I hope they will come looking for such consent in respect of such new ventures in regard to the provision of these new services.  I hope they will and that is why it is in there and for no other purpose. That said, after all, if they want to recruit someone and claim the grade at which they want to recruit him is that of deputy director, at that point someone has to have the authority to say, &ldquo;Wait&rdquo;, and that is where the Minister and the Minister for Finance come in.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 30:</P>
      <P>In page 8, subsection (3), line 48, after &ldquo;not&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;, save with the approval of the Minister,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This proposal is not related to the subsidiary concept although it has connections with it.  I wish to focus on a different point and, unusually for me, I am proposing an addition which requires the approval of the Minister.  Subsection (3) refers to the possibility of activities carried on by Teagasc outside the State and it provides that such activities shall be charged for at a figure which shall be not less than the cost of the performance of the function.  I propose that the Minister should retain power to enable Teagasc or a subsidiary to perform such a function for a figure which, in certain circumstances, could be less than the cost of the performance of the function.</P>
      <P>In some ways I am relating this to my own experience in overseas development and I can envisage major opportunities in the developing world for Teagasc to use their expertise in Africa, Asia and other places.  There are major contract possibilities through the European Community and the United Nations agencies which could be open to Teagasc to bid for.  Very often these contracts are based on an initial feasibility study with, perhaps, a major contract following. Teagasc should be in the same position as any other organisation from the point of view of being able to bid for these contracts.  That might, of necessity, mean that at the initial stage a degree of investment would be necessary &mdash; sometimes referred to as seed capital &mdash; to enable them to be effectively involved in such activities.  Perhaps the European Community might establish a feasibility contract in Lesotho and Tanzania for which Teagasc would bid with the idea that on completion of the feasibility study a major contract would follow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It might make commercial sense that the initial bid would be at a figure less <Col N="49" /> than the cost of performing the function because it would be a calculated investment, the return on which could be the securing of the post-feasibility contract. Without unnecessarily giving total freedom to Teagasc to engage in international activities, at the same time it would be appropriate for the Minister to retain the power to enable him to make such an investment and to provide seed capital in an overseas operation where, in the Minister's view, such an investment makes sense because of the possibilities arising thereafter.  I urge the Minister to accept this amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>We have dealt with the amendment to the section, but I am anxious to raise a number of points on the section and I presume that is in order. This is one of the core sections and if it is passed the services to farmers will be seriously undermined.  Already there has been a serious privatisation of the service outside the control of ACOT and that will be accelerated when staff accept voluntary redundancy and set up shop outside the door of ACOT offices.  I have no doubt that a majority of farmers who up to now have availed of the services of ACOT will, as a result of the decision to impose a charge for such services, no longer seek advice from ACOT.  That is the most serious outcome of the Bill.  I am not referring to the large farmers engaged in high productive farming but to the small farmers.  I appreciate that I am not allowed develop this issue at any great length, but it is my intention to <Col N="51" /> oppose the passage of this section and I am seeking support from other opposition parties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make a number of observations about the section.  According to the terms of reference for the new body they, in addition to providing services for which charges can be applied, have a responsibility for delivering services to assist and encourage farm families to make the best use of their resources and to adopt systems of practices of particular national importance. Subsection (3) provides that not less than three months before the end of each financial year of Teagasc, it shall furnish to the Minister a report in writing. In our amendment we wanted adequate financial provision so that any services in the national interest would rank as an expense of the authority.  We wanted that taken into account in determining the amount of the annual grant to the authority. However, I accept the ruling of the Chair in regard to that amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to point out to the Deputy that there has been a welcome and positive development in relation to the services provided by ACOT and the Institute on the basis of the value of the services.  If they are worth getting they are worth paying for.  There is no unlimited pool of money available. If the people seeking the service do not make some contribution towards the cost of it the only option left is that the taxpayers, who are not benefiting directly from the service, will be asked to pay. Deputy Stagg should consider the implications of that.  If a farmer who is getting a service that is worthwhile, useful and beneficial does not pay for that service the only option left open to the Government is to ask the factory worker in Kildare, or elsewhere, who may not be directly benefiting from the service, to pay for the service.  There is no fairy godmother around who will throw money at us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure the new authority will operate the system in a measured and <Col N="52" /> reasoned way.  Last year ACOT, despite all the statements made when I presented these proposals that this would not be possible, that it would be placing an intolerable burden on farmers, collected more than expected.  I understand that they collected more than £1 million.  I am pleased to be able to say that small farmers were not derived of the services they required.  I do not have any evidence that people could not get that service because they did not have the means to pay for it.  It is a tribute to ACOT that that was the position.  Secondly, because the scheme was introduced in a measured way it established a very healthy relationship between the beneficiary &mdash; namely, the producer &mdash; and the professional person providing the service.</P>
    <P>The basis of a charge or fee is as long established as professionals are, going back thousands of years, to the classical period of the Greeks and Romans.  I do not intend to deal with that at any great length now.  When one pays for a service one has a guarantee that one will get something worth paying for.  If that service is not adequate or good, one has a right to protest; but, if one does not pay there is no privy or consideration, as they say in law, to enable one to take any action in respect of any negligence that may arise.  In my view a very healthy relationship has been built up because of this.  The same applies to the Institute. When one looks at the non-Exchequer receipts in respect of the Institute and ACOT one will see that they show a fairly healthy progression.  I want that to continue.  It is important that both organisations can prove that they can give an excellent service and, for that reason, that it is worth paying for.  I cannot imagine small farmers not getting the same service in the future as they got in the past.  I expect that to be a feature of the approach of Teagasc.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to get involved in a philosophical argument with the Minister at this stage, but I am concerned that we are setting up a new body that has commercial orientation.  Their requirement will be to get in money for <Col N="53" /> the services they are providing and that will mean that persons other than those who can afford to pay &mdash; I am talking about a big number of people &mdash; will not be able to pay at the coal-face for the service.  They will be excluded under the terms of reference given to the new body. We are telling that new organisation that they must become viable.  Who will the local director send the adviser to?  Will he send the adviser to the farmer who is in a position to pay or will he send the adviser to the farmer who cannot afford to pay for the service?</P>

      <P>Many matters concerning the new body are not included in the Bill. For example, we do not know where the new body will get funding from.  What proportion of the funding will come from the State?  They are important matters. In this section we are dealing with the question of raising funds from the people who will be availing of the services at the coal-face, at the point of delivery of the service.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>We do not need to quibble unduly about that.  I contend that farmers who can afford to pay will get service because we need to get in the money but that farmers who cannot afford to pay will be second rate.  We will have to twotier service.  I come from a rural area and am the son of a small farmer.  I am conscious of the fact that farmers will not go cap in hand for a means test to get the service they cannot afford to pay for. That attitude is widespread throughout the country.  People are very proud and do not want others to know if they are in financial difficulty.  Small farmers simply will do without.  It is estimated by the professional staff of ACOT that 60,000 <Col N="54" /> fewer farmers will be contacted than before these measures were introduced. A total of 80,000 were contacted in 1986 and they estimate that under this legislation they will be contacting 20,000.  The charges are not the only reason, but I will deal with that at a later stage.  I take the point that there are no free dinners and that everything must be paid for.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">

    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's colleague should be tackling the problem of devising an equitable tax system so that farmers who can afford it pay their fair share. The services we are talking about could be provided through a collective tax system.  The regressive system proposed here means that tax will be charged at the point of delivery of the service.  It will have the effect of stopping people who most need the service.  I would ask the Minister to consider this matter seriously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister gave a very clear indication that people who could not afford it would not be charged for the service.  I share the views expressed by Deputy Stagg.  Could the Minister be more specific in outlining the criteria to be applied in assessing whether a person should have to pay for a service?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I invite Deputy Stagg to look at the terms of the legislation. Section 6 (1) provides that Teagasc or a subsidiary may make such charges as it considers appropriate in consideration of the performance by it of its functions.  It goes on to say in subsection (2) that the determination of the amounts of charges by Teagasc or a subsidiary for educational, training and advisory services shall be subject to the approval of the Minister and the Minister for Finance. There is no point in making general statements to the effect that the small farmer will be crucified.  The charges will be drawn up by Teagasc, who will consider what will be appropriate for customers in special circumstances.  I cannot give a guarantee that people will pay nothing <Col N="55" /> for services at a certain level; but it is unfair to estimate, as Deputy Stagg has done, that so many thousand will be left without service.  It has not happened so far.  If there are people ready, willing and able to pay for the service, surely it is reasonable that they should do so.  If they do not, then the factory employees in Athy, Naas or Newbridge will have to pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">

      <P>A whole range of services is being provided, such as farm walks, together with instruction.  Talks, seminars and discussions are taking place related to a whole range of matters.  They are all provided without any question of charge.  People are benefiting greatly. This is a very important part of the whole programme being conducted by ACOT. There is a valuable exchange of information at seminars.  Charges are not an issue.  There might be some admission charge but not such as will break anybody's back.  Leaflets are being distributed regularly.  Videos are also used. Deputy Stagg can be quite satisfied.  We are talking in terms of group consultation and a whole range of things which were not the practice ten years ago.  I am glad the service is using modern means of communication, providing discs and videos for farmers who want to avail of them.  I hope Deputy Stagg will not overstate his case by saying the small farmers are to be devastated, I was reared among small farmers.  I am part of them.  The only member of the family in the generation before me who did not continue in farming was my mother.  I have more first cousins in small farming than Deputy Stagg has.  I have some sympathy for them, to say the least.</P>

      <P>The small farmers of North Tipperary have looked after the Minister very well, not just politically but in every other way.  We are talking about means <Col N="56" /> testing for farmers before they get services. I should like the Minister to be specific about the criteria.  Another question which arises is the amount of money the Minister envisages will be raised from the proposed charges.  What percentage of the budget of Teagasc will these charges represent?  It is important to have this information.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not appear to be relevant now.  Means testing would be a matter for the new authority and I would be pre-empting them if I were to lay down the means criteria in each case. I can assure the Deputy that I will &mdash; I think the House would want me to do this, and I think the Authority would expect that I would do so &mdash; in terms of general direction and policy indicate to them very clearly that the scale of charges which they deem appropriate, that is in the legislation and which I would have to approve, should be such as will take account of the specific character of farming in the different areas and the specific condition of individual farmers.</P>

      <P>If the matter is to proceed on that basis I wish to make it clear that because the legislative provision already exists for charges I do not intend to participate in any such division. I am more concerned that we will have an opportunity of debating the other sections of the Bill which were to be dealt with before 1.30 p.m.  I take on board the point raised by Deputy Stagg that consideration has to be given to small <Col N="57" /> farmers and, indeed, farmers with financial difficulties.  We discussed this at length in relation to the order before the House about three or four months ago. We received concrete assurances at the time that small farmers and farmers in financial difficulty would be given full and proper consideration in the graduation of any scale of charges.  While the legislative power for charging obviously has to continue in the Bill, I would expect from the Minister an assurance that any scale of charges proposed by Teagasc for the future would not receive approval unless the existing system is continued under which full consideration is given to small farmers and those in financial difficulties. If the Minister is prepared to give me that assurance I will not oppose this section.</P>

      <P>I certainly am prepared to give the Deputy that assurance. That is the action that I have taken already this year.  The charges that were imposed by ACOT this year had to be submitted to the Minister for approval and they were introduced taking account of the criteria we have applied.  I will give an assurance to the Deputy that I will certainly take into account the priorities that we have for small farmers and those in special conditions before granting approval for a scale of charges.</P>

Cé acu atá i gceist: an cúram nua é nó an cúram é a bhí ar an Údarás i gcónaí, agus más cúram é a bhí ar an Udarás i gcónaí, cén fath go raibh an Taoiseach ag iarraidh a chur ina luí ar an Údarás gur rud nua a bhí i gceist?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 5, 21, 23 and 24 together.</P>
      <P>The reports I have received indicate that there has been a very good response to the quota restructuring scheme which I negotiated as part of last year's EC price fixing package.  The only apparent difficulty seems to be that in some areas the demand made by producers seeking to buy additional quotas exceeded the supply of quotas available for sale.  Under the terms of the scheme I arranged that in those circumstances smaller scale producers would have priority access to the quotas available.  Priority has also been given to other producers with special difficulties such as farmers with animal disease problems.</P>
      <P>Smaller scale producers will, of course, now also have the opportunity of having priority access to quotas available under the temporary leasing scheme at a maximum cost of 15p per gallon for 1988-89. This is the first year in which Community regulations allowed such a scheme to be operated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the terms of the scheme leases must be drawn up and completed by 31 July 1988 and the period of the lease will expire on 31 March 1989.  The portion of a producer's quota to be leased cannot exceed a limit of 70 per cent of his quota, except in the case of a producer whose herd was depopulated under the disease (TB and Brucellosis) eradication schemes in either 1987 or in 1988, prior <Col N="68" /> to 31 July, where the portion permitted to be leased will be increased to 99 per cent.  Payments made for the leased quota shall not be more than 15p for each gallon leased.</P>
    <P>Quotas offered for leasing will form a pool in each co-operative or dairy area and at least 60 per cent of this pool will be allocated to suppliers whose quotas do not exceed 25,000 gallons.</P>
    <P>Taken together with the restructuring scheme, the temporary leasing scheme represents the first real attempt to make the quota arrangements more flexible mainly in the interests of the special category farmers.  I have asked the Quota Review Group to advise on how this process of introducing flexibility into the arrangements can be intensified in future years and I will, of course, take full account of the group's view in future decisions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinPGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I have received representations from a number of small scale producers and it would appear that it is out of the reach of small scale producers to purchase additional quotas.  If they are going to survive in agriculture we should try to encourage them to go into milk as it is the only viable area for small scale producers.  An industrial worker would be paid a minimum wage but it is not possible for a farmer to make a living from a quota of between 5,000 gallons and 10,000 gallons.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinPGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister tell us if anything can be done to alleviate this problem?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have particular concern for small scale producers.  All of the schemes I have introduced since becoming Minister have one characteristic &mdash; priority is given to young farmers and small scale producers.  The Deputy will be aware that special priority is being given to small scale producers in each of the schemes which I have announced, <Col N="69" /> including the restructuring scheme and the leasing scheme which I have just announced.  I believe this should have been done four years ago.  Prior to my taking action it was the power of the cheque book which determined whether a person would be able to purchase a quota.  I have now intervened and both the small scale producer and the young farmer can feel protected.  As a result of my actions, while it is not the same in all cases, the price per gallon is now as low as 75p.  It varies.  I can assure the House that it will remain a priority of mine to ensure that in all schemes priority will be given to young farmers and small scale producers.  Over time I think the price will come down even more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to ask the Minister two brief supplementary questions. The Minister referred to suppliers whose quotas do not exceed 25,000 gallons. Does this mean that the previous reference to a 10,000 gallon quota for young farmers coming into agriculture has now been eliminated?  In 1982 farmers found their quotas cut as a result of disease and I asked previously that special attention be given to these farmers.  Can the Minister tell us whether they are being given this attention?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with what the Deputy has said.  Those farmers who were unlucky to find their quotas cut as a result of disease in the period in question are being given priority in these schemes.  Secondly, in relation to the Deputy's question in regard to a quota of 10,000 gallons for young farmers I can tell him that there has been no change. Young farmers are being given priority in the restructuring scheme, in the fleximilk scheme and now in this leasing scheme along with the small scale producers with a quota of less than 25,000 gallons.  The actions which we are taking belatedly &mdash; not our fault; I wish they had been taken previously &mdash; are having the desired effect and I hope that over a period of two to three years the price will come down and access to quotas for <Col N="70" /> young farmers and small scale producers will be improved.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously, I cannot intervene in legal obligations which have been entered into.  If leasing agreements have been entered into they would still stand.  I have asked the Quota Review Committee, which represents all the farming organisations, Macra na Feirme and ICOS, to make short-term urgent recommendations on temporary leasing agreements.  They have now done so. Temporary leasing is one matter and long term leasing is another, but I cannot intervene in legal obligations which have been entered into.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinPGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>The ideal would be to have a minimum quota.  Can the Minister tell us whether there is any evidence to suggest that small scale producers are getting out of milk?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>There is some evidence of this.  When this restriction was introduced in 1984 &mdash; and I was no more involved then than the Deputy is now &mdash; it had an effect on small scale producers both in this country and in Europe.  What I have being trying to do over the last 12 months is to minimise the damage of this decision, which was taken before I became Minister, on small scale producers and young farmers.  I believe we are doing that.  Secondly, we are trying to minimise the damage so as to ensure we will come through this quota regime better than other countries in Europe, and I believe we are doing that also.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister serious when he anticipates that the price for the small producer of a quota purchase will come down over the next couple of years? Is the Minister not aware that in Holland at present milk is making £5 a gallon from purchase of quota and does he seriously suggest that this country is going to be exempt from that kind of price trend in the years ahead?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The point which the Deputy has just made only underlines what I have already said.  It is because of the scarcity of milk in Holland that they are paying that price.  Milk is more scarce there than it is here because we are managing the consequences of it.  They are entering into joint ventures with co-ops in this country, such as Waterford Co-Op, in order to ensure that they will have milk to make their cheeses.  The figures indicate that there has been a reduction. It is not the same all over the country. Some of the larger Co-ops are paying of the order of £1.20 per gallon but in the west and north-east they are paying much less.  One Co-op are paying as low as 75p per gallon.  So, the indications are reasonably encouraging.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinPGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 and 14 together.</P>
      <P>Under the revised Western Package it is intended to offer attractive rates of grant for the control of pollution on farms in the disadvantaged areas.  Before this scheme can be introduced it must be approved by the EC Commission as part of the overall programme for implementing the package.  The programme has been forwarded to Brussels.  I am pressing for a very early decision.  I will make an announcement in the matter at the earliest possible date.</P>
      <P>Even before our formal submission of the programme there have been continuing discussions with the Commission to ensure that there will be no undue delay in securing the necessary approval.</P>
      <P>In negotiating with the EC following the review of the package I was particularly anxious to obtain changes in the scheme which would reflect the demand for pollution controls and which would be based on the real current needs of farmers in the disadvantaged areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>What rate of grant is the Minister proposing be given in respect of anti-pollution measures under the revised Western Package?  Does he not think that the point I raised in my question is a worthy one and would considerably help the anti-pollution drive in the country if he would indicate &mdash; irrespective of the time it will take to have the package put in place &mdash; that work started now should be allowed under the provisions of the revised Western Package when the appropriate regulation is implemented?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the <Col N="73" /> Deputy's first question is that I have applied for the maximum rate of grant. That is exactly what the Commission are now considering in regard to my application. I cannot anticipate just now&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to anticipate what the Commission may do. This question is being asked while the matter is being considered by them. Second, because of the urgency involved, which I accept, I have discussed this myself with Vice-President Andriessen and have arranged for officials from the Commission to come to my Department &mdash; they have been there all last week &mdash; to extract this particular part of a very comprehensive Western Package to afford it special priority.  I would hope it will be possible to move ahead on this even before the rest of the Western Package. I cannot anticipate what will be the decision of the Commission or when that decision will be given, but I have put it to them as a matter of extreme urgency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister is now proposing to take this part of the regulation and give it absolute priority from the point of view of putting it in place &mdash; an approach with which I totally agree &mdash; could he give us a reasonable estimate now, within a matter of weeks, of when that portion would be in place?  Second, would he not think it would be a sensible approach to adopt my proposal and indicate to this House now that whoever begins anti-pollution work after today will not be excluded from the terms of the revised Western Package when it is put in place?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the special features of this package, which I negotiated only six weeks to two months ago, is that we will be getting up to 70 per cent <Col N="74" /> recoupment of the costs from the EC.  In view of the fact that they will be paying 70 per cent of those costs they feel entitled to be consulted at least as to the implementation of the scheme.  Obviously, in advance of that sanction I cannot say that I am now proposing, irrespective of the opinion of the Commission, to implement it on the following terms.  On the other hand, I can say to the Deputy that I have conveyed to the Commission, the Vice-President, senior officials and those at every level, that this matter is extremely urgent for us.  I would hope a decision would be forthcoming within weeks, at most.  The Deputy will know that in regard to European negotiations were I to announce now, irrespective of what the Commission may say, that the grant element will be X and two weeks later the Commission were to tell us the grant element will be Y, that would not be a satisfactory way to operate.</P>

In view of the huge financial burden on farmers in controlling pollution in their farmyards would the Minister consider allowing them a three-year interim redesigning period in which to bring their farms up to the requisite standard, particularly as many of them are already encountering financial problems?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is because of the importance I attach to this that, uniquely, I got consent &mdash; I might add that I am the only Minister and we the only country in Europe to have got such consent &mdash; to this package and support for this kind of programme.  I agree with what the Deputy has said.  I am endeavouring to have it introduced as flexibly as possible. I do not want to go one step further at this point.  I want to ensure that almost every farmer in disadvantaged areas, <Col N="75" /> which now comprise 62 per cent of the country, will be able to avail of this package as quickly as possible.  It would be my hope, by way of the flexible approach of the Commission to my request, shortly to be able to give the signal to go ahead. It cannot come a day too soon as far as I am concerned.</P>

To demonstrate the measure of importance I attach to it, I should say that the amount of money involved on this aspect of the Western Package, taking 1987 and 1988 together, is 2.8 million ECUs.  I have provided in 1989 for 15 million ECUs and in 1990 for 17.4 million ECUs.  Those increased figures alone give the lie to what Deputy Carey is suggesting.

      <P>No official request <Col N="77" /> has been received from Nicaraguan authorities for a separate allocation from Ireland of milk powder as food aid.  The European Community is, however, supplying very substantial quantities of food aid including milk powder to Nicaragua and Ireland as a member of the Community participates in and strongly supports these measures.</P>
      <P>The European Community has been giving to food aid assistance to Nicaragua since 1979.  In each of the years 1985, 1986 and 1987 it has granted aid to Nicaragua in the form of cereals, milk powder, butteroil, vegetable oil and beans.  One thousand eight hundred tonnes of milk powder were granted in each of the years 1985 and 1986.  In 1987 the allocation was increased to 2,000 tonnes as were those for other products also.</P>
      <P>In view of the special difficulty of the situation in Nicaragua, the European Community is increasing substantially the overall level of food aid to that country still further in 1988 with particular reference to cereals and beans.  This is to be done as a matter of urgency and is a concrete manifestation of the greater European Community assistance for the countries of Central America promised at the Hamburg Conference between Foreign Affairs Ministers for the two sides on 29 February and 1 March last.</P>

      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, while grateful for the indication of continuing support at Community level that the Minister has indicated, I must ask if he is aware that his colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, prior to the meeting of 29 February and 1 March indicated to the Dáil that he had received a specific request from the Nicaraguan Ambassador in London, Francisco d'Escoto, asking for 3,500 tonnes of dried milk and on that occasion a copy of the <Col N="78" /> telex was delivered by me to the Minister for Foreign Affairs?  Is the Minister further aware that the reason for the specific request for 3,500 tonnes of dried milk from Ireland was that Ireland is free from foot and mouth disease, as is Nicaragua. Finally, is the Minister aware that after the meeting of 29 February and 1 March an undertaking was given to me that the 3,500 tonnes of dried milk would be part of Ireland's commitment by way of Community aid?</P>

      <P>I am aware of the Deputy's constant and continuing interest in this matter.  I have to accept in trust, without any qualification, that the Deputy has been pursuing the matter in the manner in which he said.  I can only say from my own knowledge, nonetheless, that what I have said here is factually correct, that no official request has been received from the Nicaraguan authorities.  That said, the Deputy will appreciate that in the special circumstances in which we find ourselves now I do not have the opportunity of consulting to clarify some of the points he makes.  I will look into it but I want to assure him that our response, both bilaterally and particularly in this instance at European level, to the Nicaraguan need will be constant.  I can only look into it.  I am not aware of all the details the Deputy refers to.</P>

      <P>I am grateful to the Minister for his response in a difficult situation.  I would urge him when he reads the telex which I lodged with the Minister for Foreign Affairs formally on behalf of the Nicaraguan Ambassador in London, to note that the request for 3,500 tonnes of dried milk was not only for the reason I said in regard to foot and mouth disease but because it was necessary to strengthen milk used by school children and by elderly members of the population.  On a number of occasions I have been asked what has happened to that and accepted in good faith the assurance that Ireland would meet this straightforward request <Col N="79" /> to itself out of its Community commitment following the meeting of 29 February and 1 March.  I am sure the Minister would agree with me that it is a matter of some concern that I am still not in a position to say whether we will be responding to this humanitarian request for children and old people.</P>

Is there anything the Minister can say specifically about the request for dried milk in view of the situation affecting school children and the elderly in that country?  As well as Community aid, is there anything specifically that Ireland can do in regard to increasing the amount of dried milk?</P>

      <P>Both Deputies and the House generally would acknowledge that the most effective action that can be taken, because of the scope and scale of the action, would be that taken by the European Community, in which action we are actively involved.  We must press for continued and increased food aid programmes at that level.  I can guarantee the Deputy that we will continue to do that and the extent of it seems to reflect the wishes of this House.  I will also see what scope there would be for support nationally.  I will just make one point: we ourselves no longer have quantities of skim milk powder in intervention.  There is such a market demand for ours that we could sell twice as much as we already <Col N="80" /> have.  That said we will look to see how we can help in this.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Food the steps he is taking to alleviate the hardship caused by the dumping of eggs from Northern Ireland and England on the Irish market which is having a serious effect on the price being received by the National Egg Producers of Ireland; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Imports of eggs from Northern Ireland, our only external source of supply, have been declining in recent years.  According to the latest CSO figures, imports of eggs in the first two months of 1988 were 24,245 cases as against 41,041 cases and 73,272 cases in the corresponding periods in 1987 and 1986 respectively.  This trend is also reflected in the recent annual pattern of egg imports from Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am, of course, concerned at the present level of producer prices for eggs in Ireland.  Low returns are now a feature <Col N="81" /> of the trade throughout the European Community and this is somewhat disturbing.</P>
    <P>My concerns about producer prices have been brought to the attention of the European Commission.  I have stressed the need for appropriate action in the management of the egg market to encourage the industry in the member states to take a more responsible view towards the future and ensure that producer returns are adequately safeguarded.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Farrelly has, for some time, been indicating very strong concern about this.  It is admitted by the Minister that there is a major problem as far as producers are concerned. Whether it is related to Northern Ireland or not is a moot point.  Does the Minister believe that there is below-cost selling of eggs in the country at the moment?  What does he believe is the cause of the producers' problems relating to the low prices they are receiving?  What is he going to do about it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The first point is that it is not due to any increase in Northern Ireland as Deputy Farrelly's question seems to suggest.  The pattern is that the level of imports as indicated has dropped dramatically over three years.  They are now only one-third of what they were three years ago.  It is important to acknowledge that there has been at European level a drop of at least 35 per cent on last year's prices throughout the member states.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>We have actually been expressing very serious concern about the poor market situation.  It is a matter we are constantly bringing up and brought up at the Protein and Eggs Management Committee in Brussels as recently as last week.  It is partly due to a lack of promotion in terms of the protein value of eggs.</P>

      <P>There has definitely been a drop in consumption and we have requested a commission to start a publicity campaign to promote egg consumption. We want to see an increase in that publicity campaign.  There are many fads among the public.  The egg has been the victim of such fads for a period but it is, in fact, a very important protein food. If we can get the promotion campaign under way again it will have a major impact here and throughout the European Community.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">

      <P>I am not aware of that.  If I thought imported eggs were getting the benefit of the &ldquo;Guaranteed Irish&rdquo; symbol I would certainly have a look at it.  As the Deputy is aware, the Minister of State and myself have always pointed out that this is the most important asset we have and no one from any other part of the world will present goods with the &ldquo;Guaranteed Irish&rdquo; stamp.  The shipping strike affected the egg market but that has now ended and it should be a help.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that the problem is more serious in this country because our feed prices are that percentage higher?  In addition, the figures the Minister has are the official returns and they may not be the totality of the imports into our country.  Will he not also agree that Northern Ireland is a producer area that depends either on England or the Republic to get rid of their surplus irrespective of the prices and this is having a serious effect on production here?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Ireland's request to participate in the scheme for the supply of food from intervention stocks to the most deprived persons in the Community was submitted to the EC Commission on 19 January this year.  The Commission approved Ireland's application on 24 February.</P>
      <P>The Irish scheme, approved by the Commission, covers: (1) homeless persons accommodated in hostels and shelters run by voluntary organisations and (2) certain social welfare recipients.  The hostels and shelters concerned have been allocated supplies of beef and butter based on their needs to the end of December next.</P>
      <P>The Society of St. Vincent de Paul agreed to operate the scheme to distribute the beef to the social welfare recipients concerned.  Because of the limited nature of the scheme, it was essential that eligibility criteria be drawn up in consultation with the Department of Social Welfare and other bodies concerned. These criteria had then to be used to draw up a detailed picture of the geographical spread of recipients in order to facilitate the proposed distribution of beef.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="84" /> The eligible social welfare categories are as follows: recipients of long-term unemployment assistance who qualify for the fuel allowance; recipients of long-term supplementary welfare allowance and FÁS trainees who qualify for the fuel allowance.</P>
    <P>Intervention beef has, of course, to be processed into family-sized portions. Arrangements have been made at a local level between the Society of St. Vincent de Paul conferences and meat processors and it has been difficult to finalise these arrangements in some areas because of the lack of convenient processing plants. Progress has recently been hindered due to the British shipping dispute and seasonal factors which have resulted in the temporary closure of a number of the processing plants involved.</P>
    <P>However, I am pleased to note that almost all the problems have been surmounted at this stage due to the combined efforts of all concerned.  Processing of the beef has now begun and the distribution will commence as soon as this has been completed.  I would like again to thank the Society of St. Vincent de Paul for agreeing to carry out this difficult operation and the meat plants for agreeing to process the beef free of charge.</P>
    <P>The House will also wish to note that I have obtained the agreement of the EC Commission to sell a limited quantity of top quality Irish intervention beef at very attractive prices to health boards and voluntary hospitals.  I anticipate that the first sales will take place within a matter of weeks.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply.  In February he stated that the scheme would be ready within a short period but this is now almost the end of May.  This is not the time of year when there should be any scheme for the distribution of food, rather it should be in the winter months.  Did the Minister say that a means test will be applied and, if so, who will apply it?  I distinctly heard the Minister say that hostels and homes for the elderly would be allocated supplies of beef and butter but he also said <Col N="85" /> that those in receipt of long-term unemployment assistance etc., would be eligible. I do not want to hear that the Society of St. Vincent de Paul will be assessing those who will be eligible to receive the food.  Perhaps the Minister will spell out clearly who will be responsible for the means testing?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will note that the Commission only agreed to my proposal on 24 February.  I know that is three months ago but I could not begin before that point.  None of us likes means testing and I do not see any need for it. I and my officials are not equipped to ascertain who is most in need and I requested the Minister for Social Welfare to consult with those organisations who are best equipped.  Obviously that immediately suggested the Society of St. Vincent de Paul who drew up guidelines. There are no rules or regulations attaching to the guidelines.  The guidelines are those which the Society of St. Vincent de Paul would be prepared to use in the distribution of the food by them.  I have given indications of those guidelines.  I can assure the Deputy there will not be any means testing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to be over-critical.  Will the Minister not accept that the delays which are outlined in his very comprehensive reply are a disgrace? It has taken three months for the mandarins in his Department to put their heads together with their counterparts in the Department of Social Welfare to draw up this scheme.  Surely that is something that could have been done virtually overnight?  If the poor and the underprivileged people were waiting for the civil servants to distribute the free beef, they would be very hungry before it would arrive.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that a day's delay is a day too long.  I can assure the Deputy that is over now.  I pressed them continually but there were a number of different Departments involved.  The Society of St. Vincent de Paul were entitled to say that before they started to <Col N="86" /> work on the scheme they wanted to know exactly what they were to do.  None of these things can be done overnight.  As it happened, the shipping strike had an effect.  These were matters which were beyond our control.  Now the scheme is ready and I want to see it operating very quickly.</P>

Obviously, the time of most need is in the winter months and that is the time we should try to get the scheme off the ground.  Will he give an undertaking to the House that he would try to do that in future?  Handing out supplements in midsummer is like handing out overcoats at that time of year as well.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the reasons for the delay is one which started in Europe.  Some member states did not want to be involved in the free food scheme.  I then applied, on behalf of this country, for an excess on the Irish portion arising out of what had not been taken up by other member states.  We want to be involved and we want to use this food for the people who need it.  That took some time.  An extra analysis was done but I do not want to go into that because I do not want to get involved in any implication about other member states who do not have the same need as we do. There will be no delay.</P>

There are a number of points about it: (1) the image of Irish food, which I am very concerned about; (2) the less well-off sections of our <Col N="88" /> community depend on these products to a great extent and I am concerned that these products would be of the highest nutritional value.  I am familiar with the report in question and in the meantime I have asked the manufacturers themselves on a voluntary basis to put much more detailed information on food products, because from a competitive point of view it would be in the interests of the industry to put the most comprehensive nutritional and compositional basis for their products on the leaflet itself.</P>

    <P>The intervention arrangements for both beef and dairy products were substantially modified in April 1987 arising from decisions taken by the Council of Ministers in December 1986.  As a result intervention availability has become more restrictive in both sectors and this outlet is now being availed of to a lesser degree than in the past, especially in the case of dairy products.  The continued availability of market intervention continues, however, to play an important role in underpinning market prices and in maintaining confidence in the industries concerned.</P>
    <P>As Minister for Agriculture and Food, I have always encouraged a more market oriented approach and I am pleased to note that our reliance on intervention outlets is declining considerably.  I would also remind the House that Irish cattle prices have reached record levels recently, and in recent weeks the average price has been at or above the Community average price.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister indicate whether in his opinion the reduction of reliance on intervention in the case of beef and meat products is a result of a shorter supply or whether it is entirely as a result of better marketing?  Could he indicate further the amounts of dairy and meat products sold out of intrevention in the same period and so give us some indication as to exactly how effective the whole system is at present?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>In each of these cases it is almost invariably as a result of better marketing.  I think shorter supply has little to do with it.  Look at the amount that has been purchased.  In beef it dropped from 136,000 tonnes to 96,000 tonnes, in butter from 73,848 to 20,372 tonnes and in skimmed milk powder it not only dropped, it vanished from 8,193 tonnes.  That is a consequence of our processors and producers being out there in the world markets selling our products at top prices wherever they are in demand and I have encouraged them to do that wherever it is &mdash; in Germany, South America or anywhere else.  I hope this trend will continue.  If the same trend was evident in the rest of the EC we would not have the problem we face now in the price negotiations in relation to the amounts of beef in intervention.  The experience in Ireland is not matched elsewhere. Intervention stocks are going up elsewhere, showing the market demand for their product is not quite as good, to <Col N="91" /> say the least, as the market demand for ours.</P>

I am also looking for special permission &mdash; I cannot go into detail on this yet &mdash; to use bone-in beef for further processing here, to purchase that out of intervention and to sell it. That is a delicate problem but we are working strongly on it.</P>

      <P>The facts of nature will demonstrate to all Deputies, particularly spokespersons for agriculture, that if there is a problem in relation to the beef herd, that problem was caused three years ago or four years ago.  I cannot suddenly wave a wand and say &ldquo;There is a three-year-old bullock, slaughter him&rdquo; but I am going to do something about it now for three years down the line.  I want to assure the House that, subject to that, the demand for our product throughout the EC is the top demand in Germany, the Netherlands, wherever you go, and we must maintain that.  We will get top prices and we will shift stuff out of intervention.</P>

      <P>From both the legal and practical points of view it would not be possible to make the price agreement apply retrospectively.  Similar delays have, of course, occurred in the past &mdash; including the last few years &mdash; and these have resulted in the extension of existing marketing years to cover the interim period and the application of the eventual agreement from a current or future date. I regret that it has not been possible to reach agreement this year up to now and I can assure the Deputy that I will be doing all in my power to ensure that we reach a satisfactory decision at the next <Col N="93" /> meeting of the Council of Ministers beginning on 13 June.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister accept that there are exceptional delays in concluding the farm price talks?  In relation to milk and the possibility of a green £ devaluation, will the Minister agree that the loss to the farming community, because of the delay, is around £10 million per week?  From that point of view will the Minister agree that it is of major importance to our producers, especially milk producers, that the farm price talks are completed as quickly as possible?  I accept that the matter is not entirely in his hands but some account should be taken of the losses being incurred because of the delay.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy and I have urged the other Ministers&mdash;although there are 11 other countries &mdash; and the Commission to try to reach agreement much more quickly.  I would prefer not to have to spend another full week discussing the matter.  I will be back there next week for bilateral discussions and I will, over a two-day period, impress our case on the German Presidency.  I have been stressing the urgency of this matter since the beginning of January and it has been going on for too long now.  It is time that other countries agreed to conclude the talks but the French, Danish and Belgian elections posed problems.  I have impressed on the Commission the urgency of the matter and that we should try to conclude the talks in the week commencing 13 June.</P>

      <P>I will be pressing for that.  The price agreement last year was reached on 1 July, another year it was on 30 May, and in 1979-80 agreement was reached on 22 June.  Therefore, the delay <Col N="94" /> is not exceptional although I am not happy with it.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is aware that we have been tackling the problem as a matter of urgency.  However, I inherited a certain number of staff and I cannot suddenly tell them to go.  The surplus was there before I took office and that is why the Government took an audit within all Departments.  The vast bulk of the work in the Department of Agriculture and Food is in respect of managing, supervising and channelling funds coming from the European Community. Most of the money comes from the EC and it has to be managed, supervised and paid out.  People should not relate the staff of the Department to what is being done at home through our own resources.</P>

I am very anxious to get the balance right but, as Deputy Hegarty knows, it is a very hard-working Department and we must be careful not to knock people who work hard.  After all, they did not abolish the Land Commission. Indeed, some members of staff were working with me in the Department until 11.30 p.m. last night and I would not like the public to be under the impression that they are all relaxing in the office.</P>

While these statistics would indicate that farmers are retaining heifers for breeding rather than slaughter, nevertheless, the question of further encouraging farmers to do so is being considered by my Department at present in the context of an urgent review of possible ways and means to increase the national cow herd within the constraints imposed by Exchequer and EC requirements.</P>

The Deputy will be encouraged when the correct figure for heifer and cow slaughterings is issued.  I should like to tell him that there has been a significant increase in inseminations in the first six months of this year.  That indicates that farmers are getting the message.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Measures to encourage the development of the beef cow herd and the restructuring of the disadvantaged areas form part of a wider national approach being adopted by the Government in relation to implementing proposals for reform of the Structural Funds which are currently being discussed in the Community following the decisions of the February European Council.</P>
      <P>In my reply of 21 April 1988, I outlined our approach to the restructuring of the disadvantaged areas.  The question of higher rates of Community reimbursement is, of course, central to the Irish approach on this matter.  The Commission have recently indicated that revision of those rates will now fall to be reviewed in the context of reform of the Structural Funds and that question will not therefore, arise directly in the context of the current price negotiations.  It is, however, one I intend to pursue vigorously at every opportunity.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, my primary objective in the price negotiations is to secure a green £ adjustment.  The EC Commission's prices package also includes a proposal to modify the buyingin price for intervention beef and signals that further changes will be made to the intervention arrangements when the present transitional systems ends in December 1988.  I intend, in these contexts, to explore every possibility for securing any concessions that would benefit Irish beef producers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Price talks are talks about prices and if we introduce other elements at the wrong time we will be undermining our negotiating role.  If I am looking for a green £ devaluation and I ask for scope on disadvantaged areas I will be undermining my main case.  I will be adhering to the main case throughout the negotiations.  If at some stage I judge that some concessions might be made I will press that case.  However, I do not think we should confuse the issue when negotiating in regard to prices by introducing other details.  If we do we will be weakening our case.  We are conscious of the need to enhance our national herd and I am confident that the actions we are taking, and propose, will achieve our aim.  I must point out that the one thing the Commission are opposed to, and those who attend Council meetings will have recognised this, is an increase in the beef herd in the Community.  They are totally opposed to that; they want to reduce the herd and if I want to achieve what we are agreed on I cannot present my case as being an instrument for increasing the national herd here.  I must find another way to present my case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>We are seeking to amend this funding section to take into account views and requests submitted to the Minister by Teagasc before decisions on the finances of the Exchequer are made by the Minister and the Minister for Finance.  This section goes to the core of the operations of Teagasc, because without adequate funding I do not see how the new organisation will be able to operate effectively.  I do not intend to go over the background to this amendment except to mention that at the conception stage Teagasc got off to a bad start with a cut in their funding by 43 per cent.  I <Col N="137" /> am concerned that after birth the Minister will be able to present a more hopeful case for the new organisation.</P>
      <P>It is important that before a decision is made on the amount of the Exchequer contribution the views and requests of the board of Teagasc are taken into account. The views of the directors and boards of ACOT and AFT were not taken into account last October and that has left us in an appalling state, with Teagasc being expected to get underway with a cut in the current year of its Exchequer financing from £35 million to £20 million.  I have no doubt that my amendment will improve the Bill.</P>
      <P>I should like the Minister to deal with two further points which are related to my amendment.  My first point concerns the funding of Teagasc in the current year.  To date ACOT and AFT are existing on a hand-to-mouth basis and Teagasc, which is expected to be up and running within the next month or two, will inherit the liabilities of its predecessors, ACOT and AFT.  The Exchequer provision for ACOT and AFT will, I have no doubt, have been used by those constituent parts, ACOT and AFT, in the first seven or eight months of this year.  The very minimum the Minister should do is indicate how in practical terms Teagasc are to operate over the balance of this year.  How does he suggest Teagasc will be properly funded in the medium term, particularly from next year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are three issues arising out of this amendment.  The first is the reasonable suggestion that, before decisions are made as to what the Exchequer advance should be in any year, the views of the board of Teagasc should be taken into account.  The next is the question of how this organisation will survive after its birth.  The Minister made a vague statement last February, repeated by the Minister of State when replying on Second Stage, that Teagasc would not be left short, or words to that effect.  Many people in the organisation want a much clearer picture of what exactly is meant by those remarks.  The third issue is how <Col N="138" /> the Minister sees funding for the future, particularly in 1989 and 1990.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The position both in the short term and the long term can be dealt with on a different level.  In the long term the board of Teagasc will have a major responsibility.  I will try to give general guidelines as to the position in the short term and what I would envisage in the long term.  The Estimate of £20 million for this year was based on certain expectations, the first being that this legislation, which we have been debating since February, would long since have been passed.  We are doing much more positive work on the Bill today than at the earlier stage.  Because the Bill was not completed, the Estimate for the joint authority will be inadequate.  As Minister for Agriculture and Food, I am determined to make up the shortfall within whatever savings I can achieve in my Department.  That is only one element. It will not be possible until much later in the year to identify the extent of those savings, particularly in relation to intervention. Figures suggest that intervention and storage costs will be somewhat less, and that will make a contribution. It will not be anything like sufficient to bridge the gap due to the delay in getting this body under way.  I have had consultations with the authorities and the joint chairmen urging them to enhance as best they can their revenue this year and next year from the services they provide.  I should like to place on record my appreciation of the manner in which they have responded.  The indications are that revenue receipts are quite buoyant, but they will be a lot better when we have an authority who can measure the cost of services to sectors who are ready to use them.  AFT's receipts for the first quarter of the year are of the order of £1.3 million and there is a State grant in respect of the first three months of £3.5 million.  The difference between the two is narrowing.  ACOT's receipts for the first three months of the year are £0.5 million, which is very commendable. Until we get this legislation cleared both organisations are working <Col N="139" /> on overdraft accommodation, which I sanction from time to time as required. We may have to adjust, where necessary, the monthly allocations.</P>
      <P>I have given an indication before, which I now repeat, that the Estimates were based on the expectation of a reduction of 1,000 in staff numbers through the early retirement-voluntary redundancy scheme.  The scheme the Government have agreed to is a voluntary one which depends on the choice of the individual.  I do not intend to break the understanding in the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i> Those who remain in their posts will be paid and the Government will provide the necessary resources on a month to month basis until the new authority is in place.  This is not ideal and obviously I would have preferred the earlier establishment of the authority. The staff reduction is of the order of 460 as against the 1,000 envisaged.</P>
      <P>The new Authority will have very considerable scope and it will be a matter for them to put a value on the services they provide.  They must not look simply to the existing services provided by the two organisations.  Teagasc will have to advertise and sell their services by making people aware of the value of what they have to offer.  Within the service area they will have to act in a commercially aggressive way.  I believe they can and will do it.  An area where they have great scope is product development and marketing in the food sector.  Research will not be confined to product research.  The most important area is market analysis. They could provide a great service by identifying market prospects across a range of countries for some of our smaller companies and co-operatives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know that from discussions I have had with directors of existing bodies and from representatives in my Department on both bodies who have played a very active role in all these consultations and have kept me informed at all levels, we have a good relationship with them.  We are opening up a whole range of new <Col N="140" /> avenues.  It will be up to the new Authority to decide the scope of those services. Next year is another year in terms of the Estimates of public expenditure.  I cannot anticipate at this time, any more than any Minister can, what provision will be made for the new Authority.  We will be starting the Estimates examination early, as we tend to do, but I would be literally estimating an Estimate at this point and I do not think the Deputy would want me to do that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to go back to any criticism about the delay in introducing the legislation or the fact that insufficient time was allocated for Second Stage.  That is water under the bridge. We are making some progress today.  The comments from the Minister were helpful from the point of view of outlining the financial position in the immediate future.  Could the Minister give an estimate as to the expected shortfall in the current year, bearing in mind the level of uptake in voluntary redundancies to date?  Secondly, while I do not expect the Minister to disclose Cabinet discussions as to what will happen in 1989, will the Minister agree that Teagasc and its constituent parts have already been cut not just to the bone but to the marrow of the bone and that it should be the last area to be hit with the axe in any future round of cuts?  Thirdly, in relation to the amendment before the House will the Minister agree that it is sensible that before such decisions are made the views and requests of Teagasc be taken into account?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy used the amendment, and I can understand why, as an opportunity to refer to the funding. I did not address the amendment as such. The amendment is unnecessary as there is ample scope under section 13, when Teagasc are submitting their proposed estimates for the year, to put forward their views and requests then.  That is what is intended to be done.  These will have to be taken into account by the Minister in determining a response to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would be giving a guesstimate of an <Col N="141" /> Estimate as to what the shortfall might be this year if I was to give a figure and I do not think that would be helpful.  It is too early to give that information for two reasons.  The receipts will depend on the returns of existing services.  I am encouraged by the information I am getting.  I do not know what will emerge and it is too early for me to guess that.  As regards the level of charges, again, I would be guessing if I was to give a figure.  I can only say I am reasonably encouraged by the information available to me.  The indications are &mdash; and I do not want to give a wrong impression on this &mdash; that there will be more redundancies but that would be a voluntary decision for the people concerned.  Again, that element has to be taken into account.</P>
    <P>Finally, I cannot know what the possible savings will be.  If we achieve further savings in relation to intervention costs, for instance, which would be very welcome on every front, I would be guessing at this point if I were to say what it is.  I would prefer not to speculate as to what the shortfall might be but there will be a shortfall and there is no question about that.</P>

      <P>I just want to make this point to the Deputy.  When the Minister makes a comment on a figure it takes on a different status from the Opposition spokesman suggesting a figure.  That is the reason I cannot comment on such figures.  If I make any vague comment about a figure it will be thought that that is the figure that will be involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinPGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I view the whole question of funding as fundamental.  If we do not have adequate funding for this new body it is not going to work.  Already research in AFT is under-funded.  If adequate funding is not made available, advice, research and training will grind to a halt.  Morale is already extremely low, as the Minister knows, and we have already lost some of our best people.  The Minister will have to do what he can to make the necessary funds available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>During the earlier Stage of the Bill the Minister of State gave a very firm commitment that there would be absolutely no shortfall and no shortage of essential funds.  It has been calculated fairly widely that the figure required to be provided is about £10 million more than has been provided.  Given the section we are dealing with, can the Minister for Agriculture and Food now tell us that his colleague, the Minister for Finance, will provide this money, in the knowledge that the services and the functions of Teagasc cannot be carried out without this money?  It is absolutely essential that it be made available.  The Minister will have the full support of all Opposition parties in his approach to his colleague and to the Cabinet in seeking this funding.  It is needed for staff and for all the other costs.  Enough money has not been provided and I think the Minister accepts that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="143" />
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that when the Government look at expenditure programmes they have to do so on the basis of calculation and precision in relation to that calculation. It has to be said that Government control of expenditure has been precise to the point of being almost unreal.  I cannot just start to adopt new procedures in Government accounting and ask the Minister for Finance to give me &ldquo;enough money&rdquo;.  The question arises as to what precisely you are speaking of. I would have to say to the Minister for Finance: &ldquo;I am not sure how much money I need but just give me enough&rdquo;.  That is not the way Government business is conducted.  As I have indicated, I am not in a position at this point to say precisely what the amount required will be but when we have that information adequate money will be provided.  In the meantime we are funding on a monthly basis.</P>
      <P>Secondly, I want to make sure that we have our terms clear.  Deputy Stagg said that the Minister of State at my Department said there would be no shortfall.  I do not think he could have said that because it is evident, from the delay in getting this legislation through the House, that there will be a shortfall on what is required.  I was negotiating in Brussels at the time, but I assume what he did say was that whatever moneys would be required would be provided. That is different from saying there would be no shortfall, and I am saying the same thing now.  The Government are very much aware of the importance of this.  I discussed the question of funding well in advance with my colleagues in Government, but not to the point of reaching a decision because we cannot do that at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point raised by Deputy Gibbons falls into the realm of argument.  I have noted two points, two constants in terms of presentation, in the course of public statement on this issue.  The first is that &ldquo;morale is at an all-time low&rdquo;.  There is nothing original about that statement.  It is an Irish style statement that could fit any type of condition and it is being used widely here.  I would like to see a little <Col N="144" /> more original thinking in presentation, I am not saying in the Dáil.  The second point is: what kind of people are always lost in a condition like this?  The answer immediately has to be &ldquo;the best people&rdquo;.</P>

I suggest that what he has seen and mistaken for high morale is a group of people fighting very strongly for survival.  One of the things they need to survive is additional funding from the Department.</P>

      <P>While I accept the validity of the concern expressed by Deputy O'Keeffe and supported by Deputy Durkan, I said this amendment is not necessary because there is ample scope in section 13 under which Teagasc submit their proposed activities and estimates for the year, to put forward their views and requests at that stage and that they will be taken into account.</P>
      <P>I do not want to engage in further argument, but I cannot leave Deputy Gibbons's statement on the record without repudiating it.  He said that consultations with the directors are not giving me the correct flavour of what is happening in the organisations.  In fairness to both directors, even had I confined my consultations to them, I could not leave the implication on them that they were not in contact with their staff.  I believe that they very definitely are.</P>

      <P>I want to make sure that, whereas there are constraints from the point of view of Teagasc to submit reports, programmes and so on, the Department also will be cognisant of the need for expeditious action on their part in dealing with any such reports.  My first amendment is a simple one in relation to the laying before the House of the reports of Teagasc.  I am suggesting a time limit of one month after the receipt of the report by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to amendment No. 50, I am particularly concerned that, where Teagasc submits a programme of proposed activities and estimates of expenditure for the coming financial year, these be not left sitting in a limbo awaiting a response.  At the very minimum I want to see them approved before the beginning of the financial year so that Teagasc would not be in the position that they are in this year, although I know that these are exceptional circumstances.  Before the beginning of the financial year they should be assured of approval for the proposed programme of activities and perhaps the proposed estimates would be either accepted or modified.  That would <Col N="150" /> be the most efficient way in which the organisation could be left to carry out their activities.</P>

I want reasonable flexibility there. It is in the interests of the Authority and the Minister that this should be so.  I think that I can understand what the House would want.

There is no such time limit, for example, in the case of ACOT, but I understand that there is a two month limit in the case of AFT.  It is reasonable that annual reports be made available without delay.  Let me suggest, as a measure of my recognition of the point, that I would be prepared to have a two month time limit acceded to in the new Authority.

      <P>I would like to speak to amendment No. 46 to see if what The Workers' Party propose has already been agreed between the Minister for Agriculture and Food and the spokesman for the Fine Gael Party.  Provision is made in section 13 of the Bill for Teagasc to furnish a report in writing on their proposed activities and on the estimated expenditure for the following year.  This report must be submitted to the Minister three months before the end of the financial year.  Is the Minister now saying that that report should be submitted within one month?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>No, what I am saying is that the request would be approved before the end of the year which in effect <Col N="153" /> amounts to what the Deputy is proposing. It would be approved before the end of the year provided of course that the report was submitted within the timescale the Deputy mentioned.  If for one reason or another they were very late in putting in their request and programme, it would be unreasonable to expect the Minister of the day to give approval.  That is the only reason why I cannot tie it down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>Under our amendment the Minister would have to give approval and outline any changes before the beginning of the new financial year.  We believe that this is a reasonable request and is necessary so that the new body would be able to plan their work for the year.  If there were to be any delays it would make it impossible for the board to plan their activities properly.  On this point we say that three months should be adequate for the Minister to consider any proposals, financial or otherwise, contained in the report.  I accept that it may well be the Minister's intention to respond rapidly to any proposals which may be made.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The staff have claimed that they would be put on the line because of the absolute requirement that there would be no disclosure without prior approval.  This is odd particularly in respect of a body part <Col N="156" /> of whose function is to disseminate information. On the other hand, I do accept that there is a need for guidelines and a statutory requirement in regard to confidentiality. My proposal would reverse the process.  It would retain the provision in regard to the disclosure of information but this would be done in a different way. In other words, Teagasc would have to draw up guidelines as to what could and could not be disclosed.  There would be an absolute requirement not to breach these guidelines.  I suggest this is a reasonable compromise.</P>

No reason has been given to show why it is necessary and there is no such provision in the 1978 ACOT Act.  In any event the contracts which might be a source of concern would legally be subject to requirements.  I do not see why staff should be put on suspicion, as it were, by such strong statutory regulations being inserted concerning their activities.  They are the same staff as we had previously.  We are aware of the very high standard of their work and no incident has ever come to light in which information that should not have been was divulged.  I contend that this provision would create an atmosphere in which staff would be afraid to establish contact and to furnish information, which is their job.  Possibly the Minister is talking about contractual circumstances.  I would say that they are covered in the contracts, simply that information cleared is for the client and it is the client who pays for it.</P>

      <P>We, in The Workers' <Col N="157" /> Party, are concerned about the implications of section 14.  We would prefer to see the section deleted or at least substantially changed.  Everybody accepts the need for confidentiality in the work of the new body.  Confidentiality is a normal requirement of employees of any public body or indeed of a private employer. Breaches of the requirement of confidentiality would be dealt with as a normal disciplinary matter and processed through the usual industrial relations procedures, not, as is proposed in the Bill, through the courts having the possibility of imposing a fine up to £800.  I know that the research staff are very concerned about ethical issues that might arise which could place them in a very difficult position if the provisions of this section remain.  For example, suppose research staff discovered information in the course of their work on a particular matter &mdash; it might relate to the use of hormones and the contamination of meat or other products by radioactivity, or simply that farm incomes were better or worse than had been thought &mdash; the board of Teagasc might come under pressure from interest groups represented on their board not to disclose such information publicly.  Suppose they surrendered to that pressure on the part of a particular lobby group, would such research staff not have a right and duty to make that information public?  Yet, if they did so, acting out of a sense of public spirit and duty, they would end up before the courts.  I contend the provisions of this section would create an unnecessary repressive attitude and an atmosphere within the new body which would not help in the creation of good staff/management relations.  I would ask the Minister to reconsider this aspect.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>In the first instance, I should say that this is not a statutory bar.  The law is not saying that they shall not disclose information under any circumstances because, if that were the case, it would be entirely unreasonable. What I am saying is that the members of the board and staff of Teagasc, or its <Col N="158" /> subsidiaries, shall not disclose any information obtained by them in the performance of their duties without the consent of Teagasc.  I stress that it is information obtained in the performance of their duties only, which is a reasonable requirement.  One can always anticipate extreme cases or circumstances.</P>
      <P>It is in the interest of the Authority and of commercial bodies, who are very jealous of information they receive <i>vis-àvis</i> their competitors, not <i>vis-à-vis</i> Teagasc.  I know, from having had direct consultation with some of our key commercial bodies, that if a major processor, co-operative or whoever engage the services of Teagasc, which I hope will be a feature of the implementation of this legislation, the one thing about which they will seek absolute reassurance is that no other competitor here or elsewhere will have access to that information.  It is in the interests of the body itself that the people who will use the service &mdash; and remember they are very jealous and aggressively competitive, which is probably what makes them successful business people &mdash; are not prepared to risk having certain information disclosed.

    <P>I do not want to argue a particular instance through to the general. However, there have been incidents I should like to think were isolated and do not represent the generally high standards of the personnel concerned; they do that.  But we cannot risk that eventually, that is all.  I contend that the provision is in everybody's best interests.  If we adopted this amendment it would put the onus on Teagasc in every single case and, presumably, in relation to every single detail of what each individual in the organisation should or should not disclose concerning information obtained by them in the course of their work.  I do <Col N="159" /> not think that is what Deputy O'Keeffe wants.  That would be totally unworkable.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Deputy could rely on the fact that it will not be the Minister who will impose the provision, rather will it be Teagasc, and we are talking about the independence and status of that body.</P>

      <P>We now proceed to section 19, amendment No. 58 in the name of Deputy O'Keeffe. I observe that amendments Nos. 59, 60 and 61 are related.  With the agreement of the House, we shall discuss those four amendments together.  Agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 58:</P>
      <P>In page 14, subsection (1) (a), to delete lines 43 and 44.</P>
      <P>We are talking here about the entitlement of the Minister to give directions to Teagasc.  My amendment provides that lines 43 and 44 be deleted from subsection (1) (a).  Whatever about the appropriateness of the Minister being entitled to give directions &mdash; and I do not totally reject the concept &mdash; it appears to me that it is not appropriate that the Minister should issue a direction to Teagasc to refrain from providing certain services or from carrying on certain activities. Remember, there are all the other restrictions already in place.  For example, they must produce their report at the end of the year, before the beginning of the financial year they must produce their programme of activities and an outline of their expenditure for that year and so on.  It does seem to me to be very heavy-handed that in the middle of the year the Minister should then be prepared to send a summons, as it were, to the headquarters of Teagasc saying &ldquo;stop&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me be clear and say I am not pointing the finger at the present incumbent of the office, but there is a danger of ministerial abuse of power in those circumstances. There have been some suggestions that something of a similar <Col N="161" /> kind occurred in relation to the Nuclear Energy Board in the not too distant past; I will not go into the merits or demerits of that.  It seems inappropriate to provide a vehicle which is capable of ministerial abuse.  It is entirely unnecessary in the context of the already tight controls that are there.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 59 falls into the same category.  The Minister is entitled to issue a directive to refrain from incurring expenditure on certain services.  Again, this is all in the context that Teagasc, before the start of the financial year, will have to produce their programme of activities and give a detailed account of expenditures.  It is ludicrous that the Minister should have the power, during the course of the year, to upset the entire apple cart and interfere with expenditure proposed which has already been approved by himself and by the Minister for Finance.  Here I can sense the unseen hand of the Department of Finance gleefully thinking that, on a daily basis, they will be able to call for a direction to be issued to chop the expenditures already approved for Teagasc.  Not satisfied with the damage that may already have been inflicted as happened this year in their overall expenditure, not satisfied with the fact that the absolute details of expenditure have to be approved in advance, they still want to retain this power during the course of the year.  It is altogether inappropriate.</P>
    <P>We are establishing a body that needs to have some degree of autonomy, that is spancelled hand and foot already in relation to the legislation.  There are already 45 instances of ministerial control over Teagasc providing no opportunity whatever for them to stray from the straight and narrow.  I suggest to the Minister that it is entirely appropriate that these two provisions in relation to ministerial directives should be deleted at this stage to allow Teagasc some degree of freedom in relation to their day-to-day activities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to speak on amendment No. 60.  Section 19 gives the <Col N="162" /> Minister what really amounts to dictatorial powers over the new body.  Under this section the Minister will be able to order Teagasc to provide specific services or to refrain from providing specific services, to incur expenditure or to refrain from incurring expenditure, or to reduce expenditure, to refrain from making changes for specified services or to make variations in the charges for specified services. In other words, he will be able to direct almost every possible area of activity of Teagasc.</P>
      <P>We do not believe the Minister should be given these powers without being subject to some sort of restraint or power of recall being given to the Dáil.  Otherwise, there is little point in setting up an independent body with an independent board.  We might just as well make the Minister the official chief executive of Teagasc.  The enormous powers the Minister is being given which, in effect, amount to the ability to change the terms of the Bill, should be the subject of ultimate approval by the Dáil and this could be done by requiring a positive vote of approval for each direction as required in our amendment or giving the Dáil and the Seanad the power to annual any direction as provided in the amendments.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very strongly of the opinion that democracy is about the best system that has been devised to date for ruling one another and it is absolutely essential, with that system, that Parliament is primary, that it has the absolute authority.  Next to that are the Ministers appointed by Parliament.  It is right that the Minister should have authority, in our name, with all areas where public funding is involved.  I would say that aspects outside of that should be involved as well but many people would not agree with me on that.  The State should be involved in areas other than those where public money is involved, but certainly where public money is involved&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>Where public money is involved, as in this case, it is absolutely correct that the Minister should have authority, but I would temper that always by saying he should inform the House that gave him that authority of how and when he has made decisions.  That is all my amendment is suggesting, that he simply places before the House for its information any instructions given under this section so that we will be aware of what is being done on our behalf and when.  I certainly would not attempt to curb the Minister any further than that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies could be understandably apprehensive in a certain scenario but I can assure them that this does not exist in this case.  What we have passed already provides for the approval of programmes by the Minister.  That, by definition, means the Minister can approve or not approve of a programme. As is written in the Bill, it is the balance of one with the other, to provide services or to refrain from providing services etc. If there is any limitation it is imposed on the Minister, and properly so, because he must do that in writing and I would imagine, though it does not specifically say so, that he must give reasons in writing.</P>
      <P>The next section deals with incurring expenditure or refraining from incurring expenditure.  That is what is involved. The House has already given the Minister authority to do this.  If anything, what is here is a constraint in that the Minister must do it in writing.  I believe that is proper because the Authority are entitled to have a formal statement of a Minister's decision to reject as distinct from approving a programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputies can read all kinds of other things into it &mdash; and I am not trying to say that anybody is trying to dream up things.  I understand Deputy Stagg's point that when legislation is being framed people have the right to be reassured about their legitimate concerns and apprehensions.  That is our function here. I do not belong to the school that says if the Minister says it is the case it becomes automatically the case because the law <Col N="164" /> is there and must be interpreted.  Any judicial interpretation of this will see it as a legal formality whereby the Minister conveys his disapproval of programmes in writing and it is an essential part of what we have already passed.</P>
    <P>I would not want it to be any more than that.  If I thought these powers were going to be used in a whimsical way by a Minister because there was a mood in the Department to show people who was boss, I certainly would not want to be part of it.  A research and advisory body should not be subject to that kind of whim.</P>
    <P>If I were to withdraw this I would have to go back and change all the other sections.  This is a safeguard.  The power to approve involves the right to disapprove.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not accept he is confusing the powers which are being conferred on him under the Bill?  The Minister rejects these amendments on the basis that it would upset the other powers.  The case for these amendments is made by the very existence of the other powers.  Under section 13, Teagasc is in a position where at the beginning of any financial year it may not carry on any activity or incur any expenditure unless the report previously submitted has been approved, not just by the Minister but by the Minister for Finance.  At the beginning of the financial year, because of the powers conferred on the Minister under section 13, Teagasc cannot lift a finger without having had their programme of activities and revenue estimates fully approved.  Why then is there a need for the additional power, which is totally separate from section 13, under section 19 whereby a Minister &mdash; we are enacting legislation not just for the Minister, Deputy O'Kennedy; I am not sure how long or how short will be his tenure of office &mdash; can, in addition to the powers contained in section 13, at any stage during the year demand that legitimate activities, already approved by Teagasc, be discontinued?  That seems to me to be gilding the lily from the point <Col N="165" /> of the view of departmental control over the new body.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be inherently repugnant to what is contained in the section to refuse to sanction additional activities which were already approved.  The Minister cannot have it both ways; if he has approved it, he has approved it.  This could not be used to say that what I have already approved I am now going to disapprove.  I cannot envisage all the occasions on which this arose.  I indicated in the course of other sections that you have a programme of approval by the end of the year for the following year.  By definition that allows the Minister to say: &ldquo;I am approving this much of it, but this I am not approving&rdquo;. If that is to be done, it should be indicated in writing.  If they want to incur expenditure on certain programmes we can say &ldquo;yes&rdquo; to 90 per cent or &ldquo;no&rdquo; to 10 per cent, and that should be indicated in writing. The other point is that from time to time approval may be given outside of the annual programme for incurring certain expenditure.  That is a flexible provision, and that is what is envisaged here.  They can get approval and a direction in writing to provide specified services or, alternatively, to refrain from that.  That is not the annual programme, but it could well be in line with the annual programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sections 4 and 5 empower Teagasc to incur expenditure of specified amounts or to increase by specified amounts their expenditure on specified services or specified activities or, as the case may be, to carry on certain activities.  As a natural consequence of that, if you have the authority to tell them to go ahead and incur that expenditure we must have, by definition, otherwise it is not a ministerial function or discretion, the authority to say: &ldquo;No, you do not&rdquo; and that is how you tell them to refrain from incurring expenditure.  One follows by definition the other.  There is balance and counter-balance. If you have one, the other follows automatically; otherwise the primary authority is meaningless, because you do not have any discretion and you cannot say &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  I do not think that is <Col N="166" /> what the House wants me to lay down for all Ministers: that they cannot say &ldquo;No&rdquo; and that they cannot give reasons in writing as to why they will not say &ldquo;No.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister see a difficulty about placing before the House, as is indicated by my amendment, any such instruction which he might give under this section?  Is there some reason the Minister does not say &ldquo;yes&rdquo;?  I do not see any difficulty about it; it gets over all the fears which I have heard expressed. I hope the Minister can simply say &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; and that he would be prepared to lay before the House, or to publish in the House, any such instructions which might issue under the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be illogical to say to the Minister that you have the right to approve, but that does not involve the right to disapprove; you have the right to sanction expenditure, but that does not involve the right to refuse to sanction expenditure.  I cannot see how one should not be an immediate and obvious corollary of the other.  What must be done in relation to the case where the Minister would refuse to sanction &mdash; I do not envisage that happening &mdash; is that he must give it in writing.  I do not think there is any other issue involved here. There does not seem to be any problem in relation to the decisions which we have already taken, the range of actions which are envisaged and the ministerial authority. It is quite likely, and I am not in the business of speculation, that, with the changing demands in what is a revolutionary and dramatic period of change in agriculture research, the question might arise as to whether they would or would not engage in some new type of research in relation to enhancement of milk yields &mdash; this is already going on and there are major arguments about it &mdash; the use of certain injections into cattle which would enhance yields to the point that people are apprehensive about the actual balance of hormones in animals. It might well be that the Minister would say: &ldquo;No, we are not getting into that <Col N="167" /> business.  There are good health reasons why we should not&rdquo;.  They would seek from the Minister advice and direction at that time and he would advise them not to engage in that research.  If the Minister is required to give approval to incur expenditure, surely by definition that means that the Minister must equally be required to express disapproval on certain heads of expenditure.</P>

      <P>Like every group involved either in management or enterprise &mdash; this applies to the semi-State as well as to the private sector &mdash; ideally they would plan their programmes at least on a year to year basis, if not on a multi-annual basis.  Things can happen during the year which would not have been envisaged at the beginning of the year and they might want to make a new proposal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>If that happens in the course of the year, as I have already indicated, that is covered in the legislation. They can actually come back and seek approval for an enhancement of the fund.  By and large, it is at the beginning of the year or, rather at the end of the previous year, that the approval or the disapproval will be conveyed.  If in the course of the year they decide to seek <Col N="168" /> more funds, the Minister must be in a position either to sanction it or, on the other hand, to withhold his sanction.</P>

I appreciate that the Deputies spent a full day on the Committee Stage, but let us acknowledge that, even then, the constraints on our time and on our level of knowledge are very real.  If we have to ask the elected representatives to address themselves on a day to day basis about why a Minister for technical or other reasons refused to convey approval to the authority, Teagasc, we will be bogged down beyond all reason.  If the Dáil, as the assembly of the elected representatives of the people, is going to take on itself an intervening role between a Minister and semi-State bodies, it is going to take on a great deal more than we will be capable of discharging.  Already we are overloaded. We have not the facilities to do the job in the way Deputy Stagg would want us to do it.  We cannot have each such approval put in the formality of an approving order in the House; that would not be feasible.</P>

      <P>I am totally in support of what Deputy Stagg says in relation to the role of this House.  Often when someone is sitting in a ministerial bench he changes his views suddenly.  Fortunately, I have been sitting on both sides of this House for quite a while.  However, looking through the terms of the amendment Deputy Stagg will see that he is introducing a standard provision.  I see nothing wrong with the standard provision, but the amendment provides that: &ldquo;Any such directions in writing by the Minister arising out of subsections (1) and (2) of this section shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas&rdquo;&mdash; that is the standard formula of words &mdash;&ldquo;as soon as may be possible after it is made and, if a resolution annulling the direction is passed by either such House&rdquo;&mdash; there it is really inviting the standard approach most before the House: a debate here on an issue as to whether a Minister and a semi-State body have communicated properly &mdash;&ldquo;within the next 21 days on which that House has sat after the direction is laid before it, the direction shall be annualled accordingly...&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I am sorry from the point of view of the notetaker that I am not reading this carefully and deliberately.  I am suggesting that Deputy Stagg's amendment is quite clear.  I am just rushing through it, but without prejudice to the validity of anything previously done thereunder.</P>
      <P>That is the standard classical formula, and I think it is inviting the elected representatives to involve themselves in an area in which they have never previously been involved.</P>

The intent is to ensure that when the Minister makes decisions under the powers he will &mdash; and should &mdash; have as Minister, the Dáil would know about it.  Does the Minister see any other way under the legislation that the Dáil will know when he <Col N="170" /> makes a decision?  The mechanisms are already in place if any Members of the Dáil want to bring matters to the attention of the House.  There are various formulae for that and, if they do it the wrong way, the Ceann Comhairle will correct them.</P>

I will give two assurances: (1) in so far as a Minister is mentioned in legislation, he is answerable by definition and by obligation to this House, and must be so, and can be questioned in this House and must be liable and amenable to answer that question.  There is no law &mdash; and I would not want to introduce one &mdash; whereby a Minister has power under Statute and then does not have to answer to the elected representatives.  (2) I want to place formally on the record that there will be the annual report and that that report will have to be laid before the House &mdash; that is standard practice &mdash; or, if not, it may be raised at Question Time or wherever else.</P>

      <P>I move amendment `1arNo. 73:</P>
      <P>In page 18, lines 36 and 37, to delete paragraph 2 and substitute the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="176" />&ldquo;2.  Teagasc shall consist of a Chairman who shall be appointed by the Minister, and 10 ordinary members, 6 of whom shall be appointed by the Minister in accordance with paragraph 7 of this Schedule and 4 of whom shall be elected by members of the staff of Teagasc.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to retain the objective of industrial democracy and worker participation in State boards.  It is extraordinary when we have been endeavouring to extend the scope of worker participation in a number of companies and State bodies that we should now form a new State company without making any provisions for worker participation on the board.  It is particularly strange when this Bill is merging two bodies, one of which already has two worker representatives on its board.  Surely the principle should be retained in establishing this new board.</P>
    <P>There is widespread support for the right of the staff to elect representatives to the board.  It is my understanding that the IFA have expressed their support for the principle of worker participation on this board.  I can see no opposition except from the Minister.  Everybody else seems to be in agreement.  Other State boards have introduced some limited form of industrial democracy by electing representatives to their boards.  This has been recognised as well worth while and a good development in industrial relations leading to the more efficient working of the board.  It has also given workers a greater sense of involvement and a greater appreciation of difficulties which may arise.</P>
    <P>The advisory committee on workers participation, which included representatives of the trade unions, the semi-State sector and the private sector, state in their report that all members of the committee share the conviction that increased employee participation is desirable, both for the personal development of the workers and for the benefit of the enterprise.  Other companies have found it to be an excellent development for all concerned.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="177" /> The Bill provides for a board of 11 people.  Our amendment simply provides that four of these should be elected by the workers in the company.  The most important resource will be the human resource, the people concerned in the development of the company.  It is not unreasonable to request that these people be represented on the board.</P>

      <P>I take it we are discussing the various amendments in relation to the board.  I was not happy with the manner in which the board is to be selected, as I indicated in my speech on Second Stage.  My amendment caters for the position of organisations such as the IFA, ICMSA, Macra na Feirme, ICOS and the ICA so that they would have an input to the establishment of the board, not merely at the behest of the Minister of the day.  The Minister has largely met the point in relation to those organisations in the amendment he has proposed.</P>
      <P>My amendment also covers the staff. While I would not go as far as my colleague, Deputy Mac Giolla, it is important that the staff should be represented on the board.  It would be useful if the Minister could give an indication about the appointments he proposes to make under section 7 (a).</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not have the opportunity &mdash; I think it is a matter that the House would want me to refer to &mdash; of dealing with amendment No. 77 which has now been incorporated in the omnibus resolution passed at the end of Committee Stage.  There are elements in that which have been addressed by colleagues in the House.  I would like to use this occasion to indicate the purpose of amendment No. 77, which was adopted and colleagues may wish to pursue this by making points.</P>
      <P>Obviously, considerable discussion has taken place in relation to the constitution of the board and how the board would be nominated, delegated or selected as the case might be.  I have listened to arguments on all sides and I have decided I must maintain a balance.  On the one hand, the most forthright and, I would have to say, persuasive statement against a delegate representative on the board was made by my predecessor in this office, the former Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Deasy.  In a very persuasive way he demonstrated from his personal and political experience and conviction that he would be totally opposed to the notion that this board would be a delegate board, that anyone would be there in a delegate capacity. That was the position I introduced initially.  I am obliged to Deputy Deasy for the very cogent manner in which he demonstrated the reasons which are on the record of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recognise, as I hope others will, that what we want to do here is to embrace as effectively as possible the totality of interests that are obviously involved in this very important area.  I acknowledge <Col N="180" /> that the farm organisations, Macra na Feirme, ICOS and so on, have a very specific role to play but I do not want to name them in the Bill because in the future changes could be made.  There could be another organisation actively engaged in rural development that I do not know about at this point and, therefore, I do not want to name them in the Bill.  I have not so done and I hope the House will understand that.  What I have done &mdash; I hope it will commend itself to the House and to all interested organisations &mdash; is introduced an amendment which has now been adopted.  I would like, for the purpose of facilitating debate on the Final Stage, to say that my purpose in introducing that amendment is that the five persons to be nominated for appointment as members of Teagasc will be nominated by such organisations as the Minister may determine that are representative of persons engaged in agriculture or the promotion or development of the agricultural industry.  The Minister of the day would determine that these organisations are the ones that are representative of agriculture or the promotion or development of agriculture as defined in the Bill.  That extends to the agri-food sector.</P>
    <P>The Minister may appoint as a member of Teagasc one or more persons nominated under this paragraph by such an organisation, in other words, IFA, ICMSA, Macra na Feirme or whatever. They would then nominate one or more persons, depending on what the ministerial power would be, or they could be nominated by a group, which would be designated by the Minister, of such organisations aforesaid.  The purpose of the last part of that sentence is that I cannot anticipate now what may happen ten years down the road.  There could be a co-ordinated group of organisations involved in rural development or agricultural activity or research.  I thought it would be appropriate to cover that possibility.  This is meant to achieve the accommodation between the one view, if I may call it that for the purpose of presentation, the view that each organisation shall be entitled to nominate the <Col N="181" /> person they want on that board and the other view that they have no such right. I am saying the Minister will nominate organisations and that they can nominate people.  The Minister can then decide whether he accepts the people.  That is the right balance.  By and large he or she will not want to go into confrontation but will accept the nominations from the organisations.</P>
    <P>To come back to what Deputy Stagg said, this House only has an authority deriving from the parliamentary representatives and the Minister derives authority from them.  I do not think any Minister should ever concede that authority to any group.  Therefore, I hope it is an accommodation of legitimate interests of each sectoral group but the amendment has been tabled in consequence of ministerial responsibility.</P>
    <P>In regard to what Deputy Mac Giolla has said, I do not want this board, which will have a major function in the future development of agriculture and the agrifood industry, to be constituted on the basis that a different group will represent staff, the farmers, ICOS and the Minister. I do not want that kind of board and I do not want to see staff representatives as such.  I know some people will agree with this and some will disagree but I am giving my own personal and official position and I want to be honest and open about it.  I disagree with it and I reflect, in my presentation, the Government position.  Let me reassure Deputy Mac Giolla that I would regard it as almost bizarre if the appointments to the board did not reflect the professional capacity and qualification of the people we want to draw on.  I would find that an 11-person board would be almost unthinkable or bizarre if there was not on that board a person who would otherwise be qualified to represent staff.</P>

      <P>I wish to make one final point and it is not to be regarded as a sop to Deputy Stagg in the circumstances. I am disposed to accept that part of Deputy Stagg's amendment No. 80, which would substitute the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; for &ldquo;may&rdquo; and to that extent only. That, in itself, is acknowledging what he is suggesting.</P>
      <P>I am using this procedure to enable the House to comment on the final elements of this Bill and I am obliged to the Chair for allowing me to do so.  This is the balance not just between my opinion and the Government's opinion but between the opinions expressed in this House.  There is an obligation on me to find that balance and I think I have done so in this amendment.</P>

      <P>I want clarification on what the House has agreed.  We are on Report Stage and we are going to treat amendments which were down for Committee Stage as amendments on Report Stage.  This means that Deputies are accepting the <Col N="183" /> rules which apply to Report Stage, that is a Member, other than the Member who moves the amendment, may speak only once.  The Minister has made an opening address.  Can I take it that Members will make their contributions and we will then ask the Minister to reply.  Is that agreed? Agreed.  I am calling Deputy Stagg to set the exemplary headline.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>In line with the guidelines you have just laid down, and which I accept wholeheartedly, I want to refer to Committee Stage amendment No. 74 and the Minister's Committee Stage amendment No. 77 which has been incorporated in the Bill.</P>
      <P>I am very disappointed that from what the Minister has said it appears the policy of worker participation in State and semi-State bodies is no longer Government policy.  My amendment proposes a continuation, not an improvement, of the <i>status quo</i> in relation to workers' representation on the board.  At present the ACOT workers elect worker directors to their board and they have given an assurance in this Bill that they will have no less favourable conditions than they enjoy at present.  If they cannot elect people who represent them to the board of their employing body, then they will have less favourable conditions of employment.</P>
      <P>I want to strongly put the case in favour of my amendment and of the proposition that when workers have representatives on the board it is a positive thing for the enterprise.  When people are involved in making decisions that affect them, I believe they carry out those decisions more effectively.  That is basically the concept behind the extension of democracy which is worker participation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am seriously concerned that the Minister is heading for a situation where various interest groups, specifically interest groups of consumers of the service to be provided by Teagasc, will have representation on the board.  If the Minister is agreeable to the workers having their views reflected on the board, the best way to do that is to allow the workers to <Col N="184" /> elect their representatives and to inform the Minister of the names and let him appoint that person or persons.  My proposal is not an advance on the policy of worker democracy, it is simply a continuation of the <i>status quo</i> as laid down in the ACOT 1977 legislation.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to look at this matter again.  I feel so strongly about the right of workers being taken away that I will oppose the Bill on Final Stage if this or something along these lines is not conceded.</P>

      <P>I want to comment on the remarks made by the Minister and I would like clarification from him.  I accept that what he says is correct as far as he is concerned and that he would act in such a manner, but I want to be clear about what a Minister for Agriculture and Food, not this Minister, would be directed to do under Committee Stage amendment No. 77 which says:</P>
      <P>(b) 5 shall be persons nominated for appointment as members of Teagasc by such organisations as the Minister may determine&mdash;</P>
      <P>The Minister will determine the organisations and the organisations will nominate the five members.  In determining the organisation the Minister must see that they are &ldquo;representative of persons engaged in agriculture&rdquo;&mdash; I presume the Minister is aware that agricultural workers as well as farmers come under this heading &mdash;&ldquo;or the promotion or development of the agricultural industry;&rdquo;. This is a huge industry and in the food policy set out in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> it is the intention of this Government to make it even bigger because the food processing industry and the industry based on agriculture is to be the major job creation effort in this Government programme.  The Minister will agree that among the organisations engaged in the agricultural industry would be trade unions which probably represent the majority of people engaged in the promotion or development of the agricultural industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When referring to organisations the <Col N="185" /> Minister mentioned the IFA, the ICMSA and such.  That worried me.  Was his thinking simply on the basis of the IFA, the ICMSA and such like?  It is not clear what organisations the Minister is being instructed to decide on when making these appointments.  The Minister, Deputy O'Kennedy, said it would be bizarre if a Minister did not see the professionalism of people engaged in the industry and ensure that they would be represented, but he was thinking of professions. That also worries me.</P>
    <P>The Minister is against the election of worker representatives to the board &mdash; and says the Government are opposed to the election of workers to boards of companies.  That is an extraordinary statement, as Deputy Stagg said, in view of the fact that the Worker Participation Act was passed by this House to ensure that workers are elected&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is my recollection, and it was Deputy Stagg's recollection too, that the Minister is against worker representatives being elected to boards.  Looking at the amendment before us, I am asking the Minister to tell us if this means a Minister for Agriculture and Food will have to take into account trade unions or representatives of workers' organisations either directly in the agricultural industry &mdash; farm workers &mdash; or in the agricultural processing area.  Will Committee Stage amendment No. 77 ensure that Ministers for Agriculture and Food will take those organisations into account as well as purely farmer organisations?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>It appears that the Minister has taken into account the views expressed, not just by the farming bodies but by ourselves in Opposition on Second Stage.  He has produced this amendment which I have not discussed with any of the farm bodies but which I believe, subject to discussion, may largely meet the concerns that they express.  There are, however, some points that need to be teased out in connection with it.  Would <Col N="186" /> the Minister when replying indicate whether he would propose, in dealing with the five people to be nominated under this provision, to designate just five organisations and would he ask those five organisations to nominate one person? On the other hand, would he designate perhaps more than that number and ask such organisations to nominate more than one person so that there would be an overall pool from which he would then select?  I am not quite clear as to how he proposes to implement the powers, as it were, that he now takes under this amendment.  To some degree it models an amendment put down myself in which I specify five farm organisations &mdash; the IFA, the ICMSA, Macra na Feirme, ICOS and the Irish Countrywomen's Association.  I do not know if the Minister has in mind taking on board the spirit of my amendment and designating those five organisations.  Could he clarify his intentions?  That would clear the air quite a bit.</P>
      <P>In relation to staff, again I would like the Minister to be a little more specific. The Bill as originally framed made no reference to staff at all.  The amendment which I proposed provided for consultation with representatives of the staff. I believe &mdash; and I am told &mdash; that the experience of having members of the staff on the board, particularly with regard to AFT, has worked very well.  I am told that a very good contribution has been made by those members of the staff in board discussions.  From that point of view it seems sensible that that good relationship which has been developed should be continued.  As regards whether it should be done as proposed by Deputies Stagg and Mac Giolla through a system of election or otherwise, at this stage we may not have much option.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want at this stage a clear commitment from the Minister that when these 11 people are nominated there will be one member of the staff, at least, among them.  That would set a lot of minds at ease although it may not totally satisfy those who feel that there must be written into legislation a process of election and so on.  To me, it is the end result that <Col N="187" /> counts.  I genuinely believe that there should be on that board at least one, if not more, persons who are members of the staff.  It would set my mind considerably at ease.  Could the Minister give me a solid undertaking and assurance that that will be the situation?</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I can readily appreciate the Minister's attempt to accommodate in so far as is possible, the various requirements in the appointment of members of the board.  He mentions such organisations as the Minister may determine and that a representative be a person engaged in agriculture, etc.  That is very laudable.  The structure and membership of the board will have a major bearing on the success of Teagasc.  I would sincerely hope that the Minister will carry through exactly what he has indicated here in the House and will not deviate from that, other than to improve it, if anything.  In that connection, I might suggest, following on what my colleague, Deputy Jim O'Keeffe, has just said, that there are two or three ways in which members can be nominated by various voluntary bodies.  The bodies concerned in this case would have five nominees. Each body could be requested to nominate a person, or each body could be requested to nominate two, three or more persons from whom the Minister could pick the membership of the board. The latter option is what applies in the case of appointments to hospital management and development committees and hospital boards as far as the health boards are concerned &mdash; by way of passing reference.  It has been suggested in the past that that system is somewhat open to abuse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the spirit in which the Minister has just spoken and again taking the spirit of the amendment in his own name, No. 77, in order to progress that amendment to its natural and logical conclusion, the reasonable thing to do would be &mdash; having first agreed on the broadest possible number of nominees representative of the various voluntary bodies, and that <Col N="188" /> should also have provision for representation from Teagasc in this case &mdash; that the Minister would then accept the nominee of the individual nominating body rather than have a multiplicity of nominees from whom he will then select. In order that the Minister &mdash; any Minister at any time &mdash; would have the confidence of the organisations who are likely to nominate, it is essential that the nominee or the chosen person of that nominating body would be acceptable to the Minister, rather than have the Minister deciding for the organisation that he would accept A and B but would not accept C.</P>
    <P>It would be in the interest of the success of Teagasc that the Minister would do his utmost to ensure that he could go as far as possible towards accepting the word of the nominating bodies, in that the names that they would submit in their opinion would be the best possible people to serve in their interest on the board.  As I have said, that would also extend to the possibility of accommodating the staff of the new body, on the basis that there could be a useful two-way process of communication within the board, and staff representation in this sense would be there for a constructive purpose, that of relaying to the board the conditions, as they see them, of staff and the circumstances in which they operate on the ground.  The board of Teagasc would then have first-hand information, and the Minister ultimately, as to how the whole process was operated.  That would be far better than to exclude staff representation from the board, as a result of which perhaps a chasm could develop between the board and the staff, which could lead to a less successful operation than we would desire in these circumstances.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me just make a brief point in relation to the original paragraph 7 (b) and the amendment No. 77 which the Minister has just teased out. The original formulation in the Bill refers to the Minister's consultation with such persons as he considers appropriate and the amendment has gone a considerable distance towards meeting the case of <Col N="189" /> those organisations as consumers' services who wish to be involved.</P>
      <P>With regard to amendment No. 77, it is important that it be worded in such a way as not to preclude trade union industrial democratic-type representation. For example, let us suppose it is to be interpreted as organisational from the consumer side.  Then the provisions in section 7 (b) are eroded because the Minister in consulting with organisations which might not include the staff, professional or worker representation, would be consulting in a more explicit sense a lesser part of the universe of people who are involved.</P>
      <P>I listened to the Minister's rationale for amendment No. 77 with some interest. Let us say that the first problem is whether amendment No. 77 explicitly includes the staff associations and unions by way of organisation.  Let us suppose the Minister said yes to that, how then would he find a person or persons?  There would be two ways in which he could do this, first, he could identify the people himself and I have no doubt that he would find suitable criteria by which to nominate them.  He said this procedure would be preferable to workers electing representatives. In his view they would be seen as representing the interests of the staff rather than the corporate interests of the new entity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a far greater danger attached to this because those nominated outside of an elective process would be perceived as being the nominees of the Minister of the day in the organisation.  It may be wrongly construed that they were on an inner track to the Minister's thinking.  On the other hand, if they were to come through an elective process there is no doubt, given the history of industrial democracy and the kind of worker directors who have been elected, that they would meet the requirement of being workers involved in the new circumstance, for example, of defending research within a new board.  Also, they would have been elected and, therefore, would be seen to be representative and they would still be professional.  Not only is there a good principle involved in an <Col N="190" /> organisational sense, there is also a good principle involved in the sense of the Minister being able to stand over the people who will eventually find their way on to the board.</P>
    <P>My final point is that if the Minister decided to go down that road he would be seen to be continuing the accepted principle contained in the Acts setting up the two bodies who are now being merged.  I urge the Minister to consider changing amendment No. 77 to allow for explicit worker representation and a very strong case could be made for this representative to be elected through an elective process rather than being nominated. All the professional people who will work in the new agency will be involved in discussing the research functions of the new agency.  Many worker directors have been accused of being so absorbed by the direction which the company should take in the future that workers tell them they are not representing the workers' view. On balance a very strong case could be made for continuity, organisational effectiveness and for retaining the principle of industrial democracy by making an explicit reference to worker representation and using the mechanism of election, with the Minister being able to nominate the people who come through the elective process.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Not surprisingly a number of very important issues have been raised on this Final Stage.  First of all, I would like to thank the Members of the House, subject to the constraints under which we operated, for the very constructive debate which we have had this afternoon.  I hope my responses to the various points which were raised indicated that I have an open mind on what are going to be the needs of a very important Authority in the promotion of agriculture in the future.  All of the points which have been made were made from experience and with conviction and I can appreciate the weight which is attached to them.  Because of that I intend to address each of the points in reasonable detail and because I am conscious that nobody at this stage has the right to reply I do <Col N="191" /> not think I should take any liberties in making my final contribution.</P>
      <P>The first point I would like to deal with relates to the worker participation issue. I do not know whether Members of the House are aware that as far as the AFT are concerned the unions have no representatives on the board.  Therefore, I am not restricting the matter further than is the case in respect of the research element of the two existing organisations. The House will not see any conspiratorial precedent on my part or on the part of the Government but I ask the House to consider the difference between a promotional body engaged in very sophisticated research and advice and a State or semi-State commercial body.  I think there is a very definite difference and Deputies should not draw too many conclusions from the fact that the board as constituted is <i>sui generis</i> and that other boards in the commercial sphere such as CIE, the Sugar Company and Aer Lingus are going to follow suit.  I do not think that will be the case and in any event it would be a matter for another Minister. I am not making that case but I am saying, having regard to the fact that one of the existing organisations has no union representation and that these are not commercial enterprises where one thinks in terms of the understandable interests of the workers, the Minister of the day should take due account of the interests of the employees and the interests of the professional employees.  The two are inextricably linked in my view and that is what I propose to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To give a precise response to the precise question which was put to me by Deputy Higgins I would like to say that amendment No. 77 is not intended to cover worker representatives but, that having been said, the residual power of the Minister should take account of the role and functions of the staff and my view is that this should reflect that in the board.  Equally, I can state categorically I see no reason why amendment No. 77 by definition excludes trade union representation but it will not be my intention to use it for that purpose.  However, <Col N="192" /> another Minister at another time could use it in that way.</P>
    <P>In that connection let me address a question which was asked by Deputy O'Keeffe as to what unions or organisations one nominates.  I want to leave it open to other Ministers to include or consult whoever they want &mdash; this may meet Deputy Higgins's point half way &mdash; and I do not want to nominate even those whom I intend to consider at this point. The point has been made fairly persuasively that it is not always a question of a one-on-one position, with one organisation nominating one person.  It can arise &mdash; and I am conscious of this &mdash; that there could be a combination of two or three recommending two or three.  I do not want to dismiss that possibility.  For that reason it is possible that a number of organisations might suggest to me or to any other Minister that, together, they would nominate two or three, as distinct from each of them recommending one.  I should like to leave that possibility open if I am to reflect the views of the House.</P>
    <P>Deputy Stagg talked about conditions of employment.  I am very conscious of the conditions of employment of any employee and the security of employment that is an essential feature of a contract of employment.  I would not want to do anything by way of the provisions of this Bill to cut across those conditions or security of employment.  I cannot say I have ever heard the point proposed, that a condition of employment carries or constitutes the right to be represented on a board.  I have never heard that point advanced.  I do not think it is a point that would withstand scrutiny, it is not a condition of employment; what ever else it is it is not a condition of employment.  I can understand the reason for Deputy Stagg advancing the case but I do not think the two are mutually characteristic.  Deputy Stagg made this a condition of his rejection of the Bill, as it stands.  I want to say to him quite clearly: I do not see that as a condition of employment and do not propose to include it in the provisions of this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that.  I could interpret what is there now, putting a nice, loose, easy interpretation on it that might satisfy Deputy Stagg at this point. I do not think that would be right or that I should do so.  Therefore, Deputy Stagg is entitled to reserve his position on it.</P>
      <P>As far as precedent is concerned I should say that whatever is done in a particular case for a particular purpose is not a precedent for or against what might be done in any other case.  Surely the Minister, and more importantly this House, reserves the right not to be bound by precedent?  I have never contended that any of these things represented precedents. The House should acknowledge, at the end of this day, that if there were precedents before me, I departed from them considerably in the course of the final stage of this debate.  Therefore, I do not see why any Minister or Member of this House should be bound by precedent. We are not in a court of law. This is not the Supreme Court, where decisions of one Supreme Court are binding on the next, not at all.  I do not see that there is any question of precedent here.  It may be a guide as to the political priority or conviction of the Government; that is a fact, it is, but it is not a binding precedent in terms of law.</P>
      <P>I think I have covered the points raised. I may not have covered them to the satisfaction or in the manner in which each and every Member wished but, at the end of the day, we have had a very useful discussion.  I have incorporated many suggestions.</P>
      <P>If Deputy Stagg wants to indicate to me that he is not prepared to present the amendment I have indicated, I am now formally saying to him, in respect of his amendment No. 80, that I was accepting that part of it.  I had already indicated my intention of so doing.  I presume he is not going to repudiate it because that was done on Committee Stage, that part of it which substituted the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; for the word &ldquo;may&rdquo;.</P>

There is one other concern on which I would like to get a response from the Minister.  The Minister is entitled under section 2 to appoint a date for the establishment of the Act.  Bearing in mind the progress made here today and without over anticipating what may happen in the other House can the Minister, at this stage, give an indication as to the likely establishment date in the context of what remains to be done to complete the legislative process?

      <P>As I said last night, the purpose of Deputy Bruton's Bill is to improve the responsiveness of BTE and An Post to their customer needs and complaints and to extend the public accountability of both these companies. Obviously we can all agree on these aims but what must matter here is whether the proposals outlined in Deputy Bruton's Bill will achieve both these aims or bring about an improvement at all in the service to the customer.  My contention is that the mechanisms outlined in the Bill will not bring about such an improvement and will in no way add to the overall effectiveness and efficient operation of customer relations within both these companies.  Rather they will encompass both companies in the bureaucratic system that this Government have been meticulous in removing from every other area of public responsibility.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>In order to prove that point it is absolutely essential that we look at the performance of An Post and BTE.  Since the establishment of An Post the company have shown continuous improvement.  Obviously there were going to be losses in the first two years of operation, but that trend has now fortunately been reversed and profits were recorded in 1986 and 1987.  Last year the profit margin was something like £2.77 million.  The volume of mail handled by An Post has grown at a steady rate and it is now 16 per cent higher than when the company took over four years ago. There is also growth in the express mail and the business reply area and the number of countries to which express mail services of An Post operate has increased from 36 to 75.  As the Minister outlined last night, it is likely to be in excess of 100 in 1988.</P>
      <P>There has been no increase in postal charges; they remain at the 1986 levels. In real terms this means that there has been a reduction of 8 per cent in the charges in the last four years.  Because of a rationalisation programme that has taken place within An Post we can be happy in the knowledge that our postal charges compare very favourably at this time with those of other EC states.  We are fourth in the EC league compared with the figure in 1985 when we were the second highest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During this period I saw a reduction of 500 in staffing levels in An Post, and in order to increase productivity within the company a self-financing productivity agreement has been introduced.  To improve consumer acceptability, the company have established a customer panel where an opportunity is provided to inform the company of the consumers' views of the service, and the company are open to suggestions that anybody out there might have to offer.  Therefore, it is now generally accepted that An Post are totally committed to the concept of much closer relations with their customers. Nowhere can the professionalism of An Post be seen to better effect than under the national lottery scheme which they operate under licence from the Minister <Col N="201" /> for Finance.  They have improved the collection on TV licence fees and now 100,000 more licences are held than we held in 1984.</P>
    <P>Staff were naturally concerned about the standards of working accommodation, and An Post are doing everything possible within their capacity to provide quality staff accommodation. The company have engaged in a major building programme including the provision of new delivery vans and sorting offices and extension and refurbishment of existing post offices around the country. An outlay of something like £7.67 million was made on building works and 18 company offices were refurbished in the 1977-88 period.</P>
    <P>An Post do not earn all their revenue from mail services alone; some 25 per cent of it is earned from agency services provided for a number of Government Departments and other bodies.  An Post see a need to develop an area of their agency activities and have submitted proposals for the development of their banking business based on a revitalised and restructured Post Office savings bank.</P>
    <P>The parcel service of An Post is perhaps the one black spot in the copybook with a £1.6 million loss last year.  Last night the Minister indicated the need for remedial action and I am pleased that a plan has been drawn up to solve that problem.</P>
    <P>Since the setting up of An Post all one can do really is sing in praise of the transformation that has taken place within that sector.  Surely it begs the question, why should we now want to introduce changes to one of the success stories of recent times?  I find it beyond me.</P>
    <P>Under the present structure BTE are responsible for the operation of the service themselves.  The board in turn have to report and be responsible, as outlined in the Minister's speech, to the Minister on a quarterly basis.  Surely, again that begs the question we are hearing from the Fine Gael Party here in proposing this Bill.  Do they want to put another layer of bureaucracy on a company who are succeeding so well as a commercial entity?  Again there has been a dramatic improvement in the structure since 1984, <Col N="202" /> and I would like to outline some of the achievements within BTE.  The number of customers has increased from 600,000 to 800,000, yet while that increase has gone on, staff numbers have been reduced from something like 18,300 in 1984 to around 14,500 at present.  The telephone system has been completely automatic since last year.  The Postal Telegraph Services Review Group set targets for a success rate of 96 per cent on trunk calls.  Not only have those targets been achieved but they have been exceeded.  The service is now one of the most advanced in the world because of the high proportion of digital exchanges in operation.  The company have launched a number of new services which were outlined last night in the Minister's speech, the most notable of which is Eircell. The company's finances have been turned around completely from losing £100 million per year to showing a modest profit this year.</P>
    <P>BTE have decreased charges for international calls particularly to North America and to Europe.  Surely this is of major significance in the export business sector. Allied to all that is the fact that a further reduction in October to these areas will produce a 25 per reduction for North America calls, a 20 per cent reduction on Europe calls and 30 per cent on New Zealand and Australia calls.</P>
    <P>Provision is also made for a substantial £20 million investment in a computerised system to improve the speed of the service, the provision of bills and a capability to respond to customers' queries.  Plans are in train to have details available on truck calls if customers so wish and we would all like to see this happen.  One should look at this in context and ask if this type of service is available in any other country.  This investment will commence in the third quarter of 1988 and will be completed, generally speaking, within an 18-month period.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton referred to the Ombudsman and it is important to state categorically that the Ombudsman has agreed that Bord Telecom fully co-operatred with him in terms of queries presented to them and he acknowledged that in last year's report.  In terms of the <Col N="203" /> misconceptions about major discrepancies in the metering system, I should like to put in context the number of situations where recomendations were made by the Ombudsman and agreed by Bord Telecom for rebates over the past two years.  They make striking reading.</P>
    <P>For instance, in 1986 there were 300 such recommendations made out of a total of three million bills.  In 1987 there were 160 recommendations in regard to the same three million bills.  The Minister referred to the fact that there was a low percentage of mistakes, the figure was 0.3 per cent.  In the 1986 report, the metering system which has often been held up to ridicule here &mdash; although it is used internationally &mdash; was upheld in a court case brought against the company because the company decided that they would not accept that inaccurancies existed within their service.  The result was that a Swedish consultancy firm was brought in to assess the reliability of the metering operation and the accurancy of the metering system used by Bord Telecom was upheld.</P>
    <P>There is also a proposal in the Bill that the Ombudsman's Office should be paid by the companies sums equal to one half of the office's audited costs in executing their duties in relation to the company. Does Deputy Bruton think it should be a function of either of these companies &mdash; and would it be appropriate &mdash; to fund a group or organisation that has been basically set up to investigate them?  That would not be the function of either company and that aspect is not appropriate in the circumstances.  Indeed, the whole concept is ludicrous.  Both these companies were set up to operate efficiently and effectively and to jog them out of their humdrum existence under which they operated in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  From a business point of view, does Deputy Bruton think it is fair to either of these companies who are operating so well that somebody like the Ombudsman should be imposed on them, interfere with their operations, look for reports day after day while, at the same time, a person who has overall responsibility <Col N="204" />&mdash; the Minister &mdash; has charged a board in each of these companies to operate them profitably and efficiently and to report to him on a quarterly basis?</P>

      <P>There is a duplication that is totally unnecessary.  Its smacks of undue interference.  If the shoe were on the other foot would Deputy Bruton be making the same claims, that undue interference in these two companies operating well beyond our expectations is totally out of the question?</P>
      <P>Deputy Bruton also called for information that would include a comparison with similar countries in the EC.  Key management performance indicators, including productivity, manning, efficiency and the use of equipment were part and parcel of that.  In fairness to the companies Deputy Bruton is not comparing like with like in terms of population distribution because we have the most dispersed rural population in Europe and obviously that is more expensive to service than the urban population.</P>
      <P>I wish to stress that both these companies have performed extremely well and we accept that this is the case.  Surely it is not in the interests of both companies to have information revealed which would place them at a commercial disadvantage relative to other companies in such areas?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>It is an expensive exercise to collate the information relating to international comparisons of performance. Because of the underlying factors, one must ask if it adds anything to the improved performance of both companies to have them included in the annual report.  Will Deputy Bruton agree that a publication of revenue cost summaries could be harmful economically to An Post?  It would be an impossible task for Bord Telecom Éireann to try to distinguish between residential and business <Col N="205" /> users.  Will Deputy Bruton agree that the publication of advance borrowing requirements and major investment proposals would constitute undue interference with the day-to-day running of these companies?  Will he also agree that it would be commercially imprudent, and indeed would represent a vote of no confidence in the boards charged with the responsibility of making both operations viable, to bring them back closer to ministerial operational control, a position from which they evolved only five years ago?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act, 1980, the inland mail register service provides the type of protection required under the Act.  If, as proposed in Deputy Bruton's Bill, it was extended, to the service as a whole it would mean increased costs to the consumer instead of decreasing costs.  It would bring about further delays and would surely defeat one of the purposes for which the Bill was produced, that the service should be kept at minimal rates. I should like to ask Deputy Bruton if he considered, for example, the serious and contentious litigation problems for Bord Telecom by the application of section 39 of the Act to internal communications services.  Is the Deputy seriously suggesting that it would be logical and feasible for Bord Telecom Éireann to enter into 750,000 individual contracts?  If he is, would he propose the same procedure for ESB customers?  Deputy Bruton said that the Bill was an attempt to improve the responsiveness of both companies to the needs and complaints of their customers and to extend the public accountability of both companies.  In my view the Bill fails on both counts.  I appreciate the Deputy's sincerity but in my view it is the old story of the ideal being far removed from the reality.  As a new appointment to the front bench Deputy Bruton is seeking to make an impact.  I can appreciate why he is doing that because he must face a very able Minister.  The introduction of the Bill provides him with a golden opportunity, as he sees it, to put forward his views but it is my opinion that the ramifications of his proposals have not <Col N="206" /> been seriously thought out.  I suggest that he gives serious consideration to withdrawing it in view of the adverse impact it would have on these excellent public utilities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the last speaker is not suggesting that there is no room for improvement in the services of the companies under discussion.  I welcome the Bill and I am sure all consumers welcome it.  I do not know how any person on reading the Bill can come to the conclusion that it is lacking in clarity.  I suggest that Deputy O'Keeffe carry out a <i>vox pop</i> to get the views of the public on An Post and Telecom Éireann.  We all admire the investment and the work of the boards in their efforts to give us modern communications systems but I do not think anybody would suggest that there is not room for improvement.  I have no doubt there are many people who would occupy the Deputy for many hours listing the difficulties and injustices they have suffered at the hands of those companies.  It is because of them that we consider this legislation important.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt that there is a lack of confidence in the effectiveness and efficiency of the companies.  There is a widespread belief &mdash; it is damaging for Bord Telecom &mdash; that telephone accounts are not accurate.  What is worse is that many people believe they do not have any redress except through the Office of the Ombudsman.  In fact, some people do not pursue their complaints and hope that between the swings and the roundabouts an overcharge on one bill will be offset by an undercharge in the following billing period.  I am not condemning the board but I must highlight the public view.  It is important that consumers believe they are getting a fair deal from these companies.  For that reason we cannot adopt the laid back attitude of Deputy O'Keeffe.  It is wrong to suggest that if we adopt Deputy Bruton's Bill we will be undermining the confidence of the public in the services provided by those companies.  The reverse is true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why is the Bill so important?  It is important because its provisions will have <Col N="207" /> an impact on the entire population.  I do not think there is any person who does not receive postal communications, friendly or unfriendly.  We are all involved in a great communication network. We all delight in the fact that more people can afford to have telephones installed.  If knowledge is power then communication is critical.  On the economic side it is important that the cost of our communications systems is competitive. For that reason I welcome section 2 which states:</P>
    <P>Section 13 of the Postal and Telecommunications Services Act, 1983 (hereafter referred to as the Principal Act) is hereby amended by the addition in subsection (1) of the following paragraph:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(c) charges and quality of service are continually reviewed in order that they consistently move towards and ultimately surpass the best standards prevailing among members of the European Community.&rdquo;. </P>
    <P>There is a similar provision intended to apply to our telecommunications.  We all agree that as a member of the EC it is essential for our competitiveness, if not our survival, that we should be able to compete on an equal basis with our EC partners.  We must remember that we are on the periphery of the Community and for that reason it is important that we should aim to surpass our competitors.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton is being reasonable and practical.  His suggestions are important as we approach harmonisation in 1992. Bearing in mind the extent of the competition we will meet by 1992, it is important that our telecommunications and postal systems should be better than those of other member states.  I am sure the Minister accepts that.  I do not think there is anything outlandish or unreasonable about Deputy Bruton's suggestions.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton also provides for accountability in relation to planning and programming.  If this had been a feature of our business practice in the past we would not now find ourselves in such an <Col N="208" /> economic mess.  This Bill lays out the path we must follow in the future.  Section 4 (4) states:</P>
    <P>Each company shall, before the start of the financial year, publish the borrowing limits that have been agreed with the Minister, and an appraisal of any major investment proposed to be undertaken during the year.</P>
    <P>This is the procedure used by every well-run company which wants to survive. Any company which did not adopt this practice would go under or survive only by some fluke of good luck.  At the end of the year the accounts must be drawn up but it is also necessary to investigate borrowing limits for the next financial year.  A farmer would not invest in a baler or an extra milking machine without appraising its profitability and the long-term rewards.  This is simply good accounting practice.</P>
    <P>It is particularly important that companies providing a service to the public should be accountable.  What member of the public would not agree that at the end of each accounting quarter An Bord Telecom should make a report to the Minister on its performance during that period and that the Minister should cause copies of the report to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas?  Is it extraordinary that they should be asked to state the number of new telephone applications and the speed of connection; the number of telephone lines which went out of order and the speed at which they were repaired; the speed of reply to operator-assisted calls and directory inquiries; the average call failure rate for local and trunk calls; and the number of public telephone boxes surveyed and the proportion found to be in order?  I suspect that 99.9 per cent of people would welcome accountability on the final score in particular.  What citizen has not on occasion restrained himself or herself from either kicking or lashing a public telephone to death when pieces were found to be missing or the money was devoured while no service was returned? When one looks at the state of public telephone boxes, one must wonder <Col N="209" /> whether everybody actually succeeds in exercising restraint.</P>
    <P>Public telephone boxes are used mainly by two groups of people whom we must respect.  There are people who have not yet been able to afford a telephone or who are waiting to have one installed. People living in unfinished estates may have to run down the street in an emergency to reach a public telephone.  It could be a matter of life and death.  The service is needed by people who have not yet the privilege of a private service in the comfort of their home.  The second group to whom I refer are visitors to this country who may wish to use public telephones and may judge Ireland, at least in part, on the service provided by the public telephone system, as well as the state of repair and appearance of telephone boxes.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton also asks that An Post should make a report to the Minister on the performance of its service during the preceding quarter and that the Minister should cause copies of the report to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas. This is eminently reasonable and it is a means of identifying and rectifying problems such as postal delays.  They would provide the results of a survey of speed of delivery for different categories of post to different destinations; the expected delivery speed for items posted at major postal points during the coming 12 months; the result of surveys of waiting periods at peak times at post offices; a comparison of charges for internal and external post of different categories in Ireland and in each EC member state; and the number of complaints direct from customers and from the Ombudsman, the speed at which they have been resolved and the outcome.</P>
    <P>There should be no difficulty in fulfilling these requirements if we have a well-run postal system.  I should like to think that An Post would have great pride in delivering this information to the Minister and the House.  I would hope to see a constant improvement.  If grave delays are found to be occurring, the problem should be rectified within six months.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="210" /> Every well-run company has a monitoring system and carries out quarterly reviews.  Deputy Bruton is attempting to bring good accounting and management systems to our most important public service companies.</P>
    <P>All of us welcome the improvement in the maintenance of post offices.  Some of them were so out of date, dilapidated and so &ldquo;user unfriendly&rdquo; that delays were created which were not the fault of the staff.  In some of those post offices staff had to work in very difficult conditions. Until our postal system is up to the desired level, it should be one of our main investments.  We must take into consideration the demands we are making on the workers in these important services. We should give them the important resources and back-up to enable them to provide the services at the level of efficiency that we want.  I look forward to hearing the Minister's response to that. Deputy Bruton wants to ensure that, with all the monitoring and reviewing that will take place, there would be good management and good working conditions. That is something that the staff in our postal and telecommunications service would welcome.  We have much to do yet with regard to bringing working conditions up to a satisfactory level.  We should ensure that when people depend on communications, particularly on the post, it will deliver on time.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to a matter which may not be probable and which may, if it ever existed, have been attended to now.  A few days ago on a radio programme I heard a consumer say that her mother had a post office savings book but, like some elderly people, she had hidden it and did not divulge its whereabouts to anybody.  After her death it could not be found.  Her family could not supply the number of the book and therefore the post office could not help.  Some years later when the people were moving house they found the post office book and they received a great deal of interest on the money that had been saved.</P>

      <P>I do not know if that could happen today.  With modern technology and computerisation perhaps a post office might not find itself in such a situation today.  That is something which may damage the credibility of people who would wish to invest their savings in a very immediate and dependable manner.</P>
      <P>I welcome section 10 of Deputy Bruton's Bill.  In paragraph (b) of that section Deputy Bruton recommended that the Minister should have regard to the performance of the company's services before agreeing to an increase in charge. This is of the utmost importance.  If the companies accept, as the Minister will, the recommendations of this Bill then the good management, planning and programming that would result, which would help us to reach the quality of the service provided in the European Community, would ensure that by the time either company asked for a raise of charges the Minister would feel that it was justified. It would be wise for the Minister to have regard to the performance of the companies' services before agreeing to an increase.  Such an increase would have to be seen to be totally justified before it was sanctioned.  Deputy Bruton also asks that section 90 of the Principal Act would include a measure so that every such contract shall be provided in writing to the customer.  It is very important that people have a right of reply and a right of service. There is nothing extraordinary in that request but good service and good consumer consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a measure in this Bill which is of the utmost importance.  If the good planning, management, expertise and efficient services that we all wish for are provided it should not cost too much.  I support his request that the company pay to the Ombudsman's office a sum equal to one-half of that office's audited costs in executing its duties in relation to the company.  This is necessary and urgent considering the drastic cutback in staff in the Ombudsman's office.  The Ombudsman, in his report, has confirmed to us <Col N="212" /> two areas which support the need for Deputy Bruton's Bill.  In the 1987 <i>Annual Report of the Ombudsman</i> he stated:</P>
    <P>I did not uphold 1,679 complaints.  As in 1986 a substantial portion of this figure is accounted for by complaints against Telecom Éireann.  I pointed out last year that, unlike most other complaints, it is often not possible to prove positively in the case of telephone accounts whether or not a mistake has been made.  I can only rely on the evidence available and make a decision on the balance of probability.  Usually when I do not uphold a complaint I explain to subscribers that I am not necessarily rejecting the case which they have put forward but simply that I do not have sufficient evidence to make a recommendation to Telecom Éireann in their favour.  This has caused a certain amount of disappointment to complainants but unfortunately cannot be avoided&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>I would stress the last part of that sentence which reads:</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;given the billing system as it exists at present.</P>
    <P>The Ombudsman deals directly with a staff on a day to day basis and there is no one better who could give us the relevant recommendation.  It is a very serious statement that as in 1986 a substantial portion of the complaints that could not be substantiated, where people felt they were not getting the justice that they felt they deserved, came about not because they did not have a case but because there was not sufficient evidence to sustain it, given the billing system as it exists at present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that Telecom Éireann are investing £20 million in equipment to bring in a complete new billing system of itemised billing at the request of each customer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome very much the Minister's information on this and indeed I am sure Telecom Éireann and the Ombudsman in particular will appreciate <Col N="213" /> it as will the consumer and telephone subscriber.  As I have said, there is a total lack of credibility and confidence in the present system.  I would say to the Minister that if we are going to have such a workable system, and we all hope that we will have such a system, if and when a situation occurs where there is justifiable cause for a consumer to feel that there has been undue delay or overcharging, there should be some method of compensation. If we are investing £20 million in technology the least we can do if a mistake is made with all this marvellous welcome technology is ensure that the consumer is not alone protected but that they will get compensation.  The least these cases deserve is compensation.</P>
      <P>The Ombudsman's report shows that the number of complaints about telephones and telephone accounts has increased significantly once again.  There is room for improvement, the Minister will agree.  I welcome this Bill which goes so far to build in safeguards and justice for the consumer.  Above all, I appeal to the Government, as long as there is this sense of injustice, and as long as there are so many complaints about telephone accounts, that the Ombudsman be given the staff and the financial resources to carry out the job which all parties in this House entrusted to him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>It is obvious that Deputy Bruton and Deputy Barnes are very concerned about the performance of An Post and Telecom Éireann.  I share that concern, and so does the Minister.  We would all like to see the consumer protected. We all want the companies to be efficient. I would like to see charges reduced, to see an end to the many complaints from customers, as has been mentioned by a number of speakers, in particular in relation to the billing system of Telecom Éireann, but as the Minister pointed out, something is being done about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am convinced that last night Deputy Bruton in proposing that the Dáil take a &ldquo;special approach&rdquo; to oversee the affairs of State commercial companies, has gone way over the top on this occasion.  While he raised many worthy issues last night <Col N="214" /> that must be addressed by the companies in question, I cannot support this Bill. Having listened carefully to what he had to say, I believe that this Bill, if introduced, would have a very stifling effect on the companies in question and would seriously hinder their development in the commercial world.</P>
    <P>I had been convinced over the past 12 months that there was a consensus among the three larger parties in the Dáil about the need for this Government to create the correct climate for the commercial sector &mdash; I would apply the same principles to the commercial sector as the private sector &mdash; to operate efficiently in the commercial world.  I was convinced that this Government must continue to ensure that appropriate conditions exist to allow companies the freedom to develop and grow.</P>
    <P>In introducing this Bill, Deputy Bruton appears to have departed dramatically from what I would have thought to be common ground.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I fail to understand why the Deputy has decided to pick on what are two fledgling companies that have been operating for a mere five years.  He is attempting to place a straitjacket on An Post and Telecom Éireann at a crucial stage of their development.  The Bill, if introduced, would greatly hinder these companies in their efforts to compete in the marketplace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>In the European field.  The Deputy will have to accept that we are entering a new era of telecommunications, with a worldwide communications system, and we will be competing in the internal market in 1992. It is important that we tread very carefully in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reality is that great technological and commercial advances have been made in our postal and telecommunication services in recent years, <Col N="215" /> and this has been accepted by all Deputies. We should be encouraging and nurturing these companies to operate as freely as possible rather than advocating the placing of a harness on them.  If this Bill were to find its way onto the Statute Book, it would simply wipe out all the developmental advances and improvements made in recent times.</P>
    <P>The Bill proposes that quarterly reports, which up to now have been prepared for management purposes, be prepared pursuant to a statutory provision. I believe Deputy Bruton is proposing that the day-to-day operations of these companies would come right back into the political arena.  This is a very regressive step and surely is at variance with the Fine Gael Party's attitude to the commercial sector in this country.</P>
    <P>An Post and Telecom Éireann may have their faults &mdash; and they certainly have &mdash; but they should be allowed get on with the business of providing a service and expanding and developing commercially. There have been many problems with An Post and Telecom Éireann. The fact that the Ombudsman was snowed under with complaints about Telecom Éireann's billing system is most disturbing.  It is not so long ago that the business community and householders were screaming about the lengthy delay in the installation of telephones &mdash; some were waiting for years.  This is no longer the case.  The waiting list for telephones is 17,000 compared with 60,000 in January 1984 and 58 per cent of the 75,500 connections made this year were completed within three months of application.  This is some achievement.  When Deputy Barnes was speaking the Minister told us what was going to happen in relation to the billing system.  I believe the same progress can be made in this area as was made in the provision of telephone services.</P>
    <P>I welcome the decision of Telecom Éireann to invest £20 million in new equipment which will enable them to provide itemised billing for those customers who require it.  This will be available in Dublin this year and at a later stage at <Col N="216" /> national level.  It has to be pointed out that this facility is not available in Britain &mdash; we generally follow the trend there. We should be willing to wait and see how this new system operates.  If the new itemised billing system does not prove to be successful, then the Government could consider extending the Ombudsman's powers in the adjudication of disputes with customers.  However, I am convinced this will not be necessary.</P>
    <P>I hope the companies in question would take serious note of this very worthwhile debate and take on board some of the suggestions made.  For example, in sections 7 and 9 of the Bill it is suggested that the companies draw up a code of practice for consumers whereby they could set out standards of service which a customer would hope to enjoy. They would clearly identify procedures for handling complaints.  It is also suggested that there be a role for the Director of Consumer Affairs and the Ombudsman's Office.  I believe there is a lot of merit in this proposal.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt it has not gone unnoticed, especially in Telecom Éireann, that over 40 per cent of complaints made to the Ombudsman related to the telecommunications services. When the itemised billing facility is in place, it will be imperative that the awkward procedures at present in place in relation to complaints be updated and rationalised.  Telecom Éireann will have to put a lot of effort into winning the full confidence of their customers.  It is in their own interest that they tackle this issue comprehensively, and I would like to see them respond to Deputy Bruton's proposals in sections 7 and 9.</P>
    <P>Many speakers rightly referred to the sound performances of An Post and Bord Telecom Éireann since they were set up in 1984.  I have been even more impressed with their plans for the future than their performance to date.  An Post recorded profits in 1986 and 1987 and the volume of mail handled by the company has been growing steadily, as was pointed out by the Minister.  In the EC table of postal charges we are now fourth, which shows a steady improvement, and we have been <Col N="217" /> assured that postal charges will be maintained at existing levels to the end of 1988.  Whereas the company have succeeded in reaching their target of delivery of 90 per cent of letters on the working day after posting, I share Deputy Bruton's and the Minister's concern about the disimprovement in the standard of service in recent times.  I welcome the fact that the Minister will have the results of independent surveys on the standard of mail deliveries carried out by An Post made available to his Department.</P>
    <P>A number of innovative initiatives have been taken, such as the special St. Patrick's Day cards postal rate, and the ongoing introduction of new postal stamps.  It is obvious that much thought and planning have gone into the production of these most meaningful and artistic stamps.  Long may this continue. Like other Deputies, I have been very impressed with the copies of the first day issues we have been receiving.</P>
    <P>The establishment of the customer panel so that the customer will have the opportunity to inform the company of his or her views on the quality of service, and make suggestions, is also a step in the right direction.  It is no accident, I am sure, that the chairman, Fergal Quinn, has tried this type of consumer service commercially elsewhere with great success. The performance of the National Lottery Company, a subsidiary of An Post, has also been exceptional.</P>
    <P>There has been no funding from the Exchequer for the company's capital development programme. This is a very significant point.  The replacement of motor vehicles and provision of equipment are funded totally from their own resources and borrowing &mdash; something that we must acknowledge as being very desirable.  They are obviously striving to continue to be self-financing and to achieve growth.  The introduction of a self-financing productivity agreement and the reduction of some 500 in the staffing level in what is a very labour-intensive company is proof that they mean business.  I am convinced that they will continue to provide new services for their customers <Col N="218" /> and will increase their cost-effectiveness and productivity in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>The story of Telecom Éireann to date is even more impressive.  I believe that there are very exciting and challenging times ahead for this company.  In 1984 they were losing £70 million a year and in 1987-88 we are expected to see a profit. We should all bring our minds back to the early eighties when, as I mentioned earlier, we had a long waiting list for telephones.  I was not then a Member of this Chamber but in my regular advice centre I was dealing constantly with constituents who were seeking intervention in speeding up the installation of telephones, in particular with regard to the business community who were crying out for telephones at the time.  In January 1984 there were 60,000 people on the waiting list and now that list has been practically wiped out.  The waiting list today is 17,000 &mdash; still a lot, but it is a remarkable success story.  The business community in particular would have welcomed this development and it has been a tremendous boost to the IDA in attracting foreign companies into this country.</P>
    <P>The range and quality of services have been improved dramatically.  Full credit must go to Telecom Éireann and, indeed to the Government of the day back in 1979 that decided to establish a semi-State organisation covering telecommunication services and to invest heavily in providing the necessary infrastructure. Had the Fianna Fáil Government of the day not had the foresight to do this, we would not be proceeding with a project of the magnitude of the Custom House Docks site financial services development which will be so dependent on an efficient and modern international communications network.  Telecom Éireann must now take advantage of the rapidly changing new technology and, having made many of the changes that I have mentioned in their network in recent years, they are perfectly placed to do so, to become competitive and, in fact, to lead.  It is quite startling that the main trunk centres are digital and that we have a high quality and speedy service due to the network of digital transmission <Col N="219" /> systems on microwave radio systems, optical fibres and co-axial cables.  This is a new language being used in a new technology.</P>
    <P>These developments will bring us into a new age of new markets and with 1992 just over the horizon we will be well fitted to take advantage of our most advanced network.  The new Ireland-UK fibre optic cable that will be in place this summer will bring many benefits to this country. Some prices have been cut and there are plans to make further reductions.  International charges to the US, as mentioned by Deputy O'Keeffe, and the European Community and some other countries, were cut in 1986 and later this year we will see reductions of 20 per cent on calls to countries within the EC and 25 per cent on calls to North America.  These are only some examples of the reductions in charges and it is all most encouraging.</P>
    <P>New services are constantly being introduced by this company.  The Eircell mobile cellular radio telephone system has been a tremendous success and benefits the business community, in particular. Their plans for the future are mind-boggling.  By 1993 we will have an integrated services digital network in place which will mean that fax, telephone, telex and data services will be carried out on a single network.  The company are investing about £130 million annually in the network, just to keep up with technological developments.  In less than ten years' time we will more than likely be operating the broadband communications service &mdash; a service carrying voice, text and video (TV) &mdash; another great challenge for Broadcom Éireann Research Limited, an associate company of Telecom Éireann.</P>
    <P>The introduction of Deputy Bruton's Bill at this point of Telecom Éireann's growth would be detrimental to their growth internationally.  I have referred to these new technological developments to put the Bill in context.  It could not have come at a worse time, in view of the rapid changes in technology.  We should not cut across Telecom Éireann's commercial mandate.  It is going too far to make it <Col N="220" /> mandatory by law for them to publish commercial information.  That would be a tremendous commercial disadvantage in relation to their competitors, in particular the European partners.  We are competing internationally &mdash; Deputy Bruton interrupted me earlier on this point &mdash; more so in the future.  Deputy Bruton calls for the publication of appraisal of major investment proposals. I think that that would be commercially suicidal again with, in particular, our European competitors.  The Bill is asking these companies to show their hand. Anybody who appreciates the difficulty of those operating in the commercial world would understand that that would be most damaging.</P>
    <P>Under the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act, 1980, protection is provided for the customer under the registered service for inland mail.  There would be very serious implications for the consumer in imposing the same system on non-registered items.  It would increase the costs of posting and would cause delays.  To conclude, because I do not intent to work over ground which has already been covered, Deputy Bruton has obviously initiated a very worthwhile debate.  We would all like to see an improvement of services and greater efficiency and we would also like to see the consumer continue to be protected. This Bill, in effect, will put up costs and will cause further delays.  The interference suggested in the Bill with, in particular, Telecom Éireann at their critical point in development would be very damaging. I would ask Deputy Bruton to withdraw the Bill and allow these companies to expand.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I find it very difficult to accept the comments of the previous speaker.  That a Bill enabling the consumer to make complaints about various aspects of the postal or telephone services is seen as inhibiting the commercial viability of these companies is most regrettable.  The previous speaker has identified the kernel of the problem, as indeed the Minister did on the last evening, when he felt that the commercial <Col N="221" /> viability and commercial success of both of these companies were not to be inhibited.  What we are seeing is a clear conflict between the commercial mandate on the one hand and accountability towards subscribers on the other.</P>
      <P>Since the setting up of these bodies and the taking out of the direct line of political interference in the postal and the telecommunications services we have seen matters move 360 degrees, to such an extent that An Post and Telecom Éireann have now basically no accountability towards members of the public.  There is a feeling throughout the length and breadth of the country that the level of complaints against Telecom Éireann and An Post is such as to demand the type of accountability called for in this Bill proposed by Deputy Bruton.  I am surprised at the manner in which this Bill and its proposals are being opposed by Fianna Fáil, a party that have prided themselves since the foundation of the State on being in touch with the grassroots.  On this occasion the Minister and his party are caught offside.  They do not realise the amount of dissatisfaction which exists among consumers so far as Telecom Éireann are concerned.  There does not appear to be a wish on the part of either An Post or Bord Telecom to be accountable any longer to members of the public, and regrettably the profit motive appears to have taken precedence over the provision of a public service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If one looks back at the manner in which the postal service has developed during the years one finds there has been a certain reluctance on the part of An Post to provide the service which they were initially set up to provide, that is the delivery of mail both nationally and internationally.  At every opportunity An Post have been anxious to move away from providing this service.  Recently they managed to take control of the national lottery.  At present they issue television and dog licences and deal with social welfare payments.  They flew a kite some time ago to show they had an interest in the issuing of motor taxation discs and they succeeded in being allowed <Col N="222" /> to provide loans in association with banking companies.  They are now also in the business of developing photographs.  The primary function of An Post is to deliver post as speedily and as efficiently as possible and when they have reached a certain level of efficiency they can then embark on the activities they appear to prefer.</P>
    <P>In the past I have brought to the attention of the House that the powers that be in An Post appear to have a policy of closing down rural post offices once the opportunity arises.  My understanding is that once a postmaster or postmistress retires, resigns or dies, consideration is given to the closing down of a rural post office &mdash; to coin the phrase which the Minister used last night &mdash; in the interests of commercial viability.  It is regrettable that services are being withdrawn up and down the country in the interests of commercial viability.</P>
    <P>The Minister indicated that there has been a marked improvement in the speed at which post is delivered.  It was pointed out in a letter to one of our daily newspapers last week that a letter posted in New Zealand on a Friday evening was delivered at its destination in Donegal on the following Tuesday morning.  Any improvements are welcome but I believe that internal postal deliveries can always be improved upon.  The Minister mentioned that either 96 per cent or 98 per cent of letters posted arrive at their destination the following day.  With the advent of the express mail service I would like to see An Post improving on this rate.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable that the concept of the second post seems to be on the way out. In many provincial towns many businesses rely on the postal services but the second post now tends to be held in the post office until the following day and it is regrettable that the postal authorities now charge those business people who make arrangements to collect their own mail.  This is curious to say the least considering that the postman no longer has to call at a particular premises.</P>
    <P>The question of postal charges was dealt with at considerable length by a number of previous speakers.  The <Col N="223" /> Government seem to feel a certain sense of pride that our postal charges are only the fourth highest in the EC.  I caution people against resting on their laurels and believing this is a success.  We can certainly improve on this and it is regrettable, being one of the smallest countries in the EC, that our postal charges are the fourth highest in the Community.  I do not think this is something of which we can be proud.  The Minister also stressed that our postal charges are still at 1986 levels and assured us this would remain the case until the end of the year.  I hope he was not forewarning us of an increase early next year which would go a long way towards putting us back at the top of the EC league in terms of postal charges.</P>
    <P>Let me refer back to the point I made on the lack of accountability.  In recent times we have seen the advent of the letter box in rural communities, in the process turning the rural postman into some sort of a dummy.  In many cases these letterboxes were foisted upon the community and are a departure which we could well do without, particularly given the relationship between the rural postman and the community down through the years.  An Post have said that these letter boxes will not be erected in any area against the wishes of the community. However, a certain amount of skilled marketing is involved in introducing these letter boxes and very attractive rates of commission are paid to those who canvass in their favour.  Despite the number of complaints which have been received, An Post have not properly addressed the safety aspects of their letter boxes and there is a feeling there is much room for improvement in this regard if they are going to become the order of the day in rural Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully accept that and I can tell the Deputy they are being redesigned to ensure greater security.  I agree with the Deputy when he says that the present design is not adequate and because of this they are being redesigned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope with due haste. <Col N="224" /> That leads me on to the right of redress which is available to members of the community if they have a gripe against An Post or Telecom Éireann.  The Minister and other speakers mentioned the inception of the customers' panel, a body within An Post, providing people with an opportunity to make suggestions on how the service might be improved.  I would question whether this body would have much teeth or effectiveness since it will be inviting members of the public merely to make suggestions.  I should like to see some binding applications on them.  For example, that panel should be answerable to members of the community who take up the invitation to make such suggestions.  I have not heard much comment on that aspect.  If the panel will not be bound to implement some of those suggestions, or to make reports on complaints lodged, then it will be of very little use to the consumer and/or their complaints.  The word &ldquo;suggestion&rdquo; was used carefully by the Minister and by Deputy O'Keeffe here this evening.  It is my contention that invitations to make suggestions constitute little more than talking shops.  That is precisely why we are dealing with a Bill such as the one introduced by my colleague, Deputy R. Bruton.</P>
      <P>I do not intend to go into the monopoly aspect of Bord Telecom Éireann. However, in such a position of monopoly the need is all the greater for a vibrant consumer watchdog control, the type of which is envisaged under the provisions of this Bill.  We must remember that, once there is a monopoly position, there will be no competition.  Equally, where there is no competition, a consumer cannot switch from A to B or C as they can in the commercial marketplace.  As long as there is a monopoly position obtaining <i>vis-à-vis</i> Bord Telecom Éireann and An Post then there must be a case for having a watchdog committee equipped with the necessary teeth to have matters maintained firmly in the interest of the community at large.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was reference to the concept of the waiting list.  Here the Minister appeared to be lavishing considerable <Col N="225" /> kudos on Bord Telecom Éireann and the fact that their waiting list had been considerably reduced in recent years.  The reality is that there are 17,000 people awaiting telephone installation.  When one considers the great technological advances made over the past five or six years, that amounts to a lot of people and constitutes a large problem.  I regret there is still a waiting list.  I would not be prepared at all to say that 17,000 people awaiting installation is bordering on the acceptable.</P>
    <P>I refer now to the 1986 annual report of Bord Telecom Éireann in which there was reference to the fact that consumers were having telephones installed on demand from six to eight weeks from the date of order.  According to that report the on-demand service should be attainable in all districts by mid-1988.  The company still encounter a major problem meeting their installation targets, particularly in larger urban areas.  The fact that there are 17,000 people on the waiting list is confirmation that the telephone waiting list is alive and with us.</P>
    <P>I contend that the problems are of greater proportion than admitted in the annual report of Bord Telecom Éireann. It is significant to note also that the report did not mention problems encountered by consumers during and arising from installation.  How many cases are we aware of where a telephone apparatus has been installed but where there will be a delay of a number of months before it is actually operational?  There is very little in the report on the quality of the repair service to telephone users, where there is much room for improvement.</P>
    <P>Public telephones are another aspect in respect of which the consumer and members of the public generally have a just and valid grievance as far as Bord Telecom Éireann are concerned.  We are all aware of the problems occasioned by vandalism.  Bord Telecom Éireann readily acknowledge the poor public perception of the public telephone service which they perceive as arising largely on account of the difficulties of maintaining the service as a result of the high level of vandalism.  For example, in the year 1986 <Col N="226" /> vandalism cost £1 million in repairs, with the necessity to replace 4,800 handsets. The company's plan to combat the problem was to improve the service by improving the maintenance and cash collection procedures, by the provision of public pay telephones in semi-protected areas, by upgrading the quality of public telephone boxes through the use of high visibility aluminium structures and an education campaign against vandalism. All of that is to be commended and constitutes considerable effort on the part of Bord Telecom Éireann as far as public pay telephones are concerned.</P>
    <P>I am receiving replies from Bord Telecom Éireann to the effect that there is a shortage of public pay telephones in the country at present, that they are just not there, all of the other conditions having been met in terms of applications having been favourably considered.  I should like to hear the Minister comment on the present non-availability of public pay telephones.  Indeed, I should like to hear the comments of Bord Telecom Éireann on the present shortage of such public pay telephones.</P>
    <P>In regard to the question of accountability or consumer redress, as envisaged in the provisions of this Bill, it would be fair to say that most Members have had many complaints and queries about Bord Telecom Éireann at their constituency clinics.  The number of complaints and queries put to me were such as to warrant my writing to the Chairman of Bord Telecom Éireann, Mr. Smurfit, on 16 March last, informing him that I was doing so as a last resort on behalf of consumers.  I was very disappointed that whoever is responsible for dealing with complaints did not see fit to reply.  Indeed, to date, I have not received any acknowledgement or reply.  On 10 May I sent a reminder and have not had any acknowledgment or reply to that second letter.  If deputations with regard to An Post are being refused, if politicians and their representations are to be totally disregarded, what chance has the consumer of getting a response or reply to a query?  Again, it is a reason for debating this legislation here tonight.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="227" /> One of the greatest gripes the consumer has against Telecom Éireann and the telephone system is the question of billing and the manner in which the bills are presented.  In the past the Minister stated that by mid-1988 itemised billing would be the order of the day.  Now I suspect there is back pedalling in so far as it is now projected for the end of 1988 for Dublin with the rest of the country following on some time later.  The Ombudsman's report, the Director of Consumers Affairs' report and the ordinary telephone consumers demand itemised billing at the earliest opportunity. The billing system has been the bane of many subscribers' lives over the past few years.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 4 is also related.  In moving these amendments the purpose is essentially to recognise that we have before us a Bill dealing with the ESB. The ESB are a very large monopoly provider of service to consumers and industry here.  It has become well recognised in managing the affairs of large companies like this that it is important that the Dáil make alternatives to the normal market pressures obtaining in cases of monopoly.  The ESB have long had a monopoly.  Regrettably it has been found that in the period after the late seventies ESB costs got badly out of line.  We have learned to our disadvantage as an economy that where a company has a monopoly and is free from market pressures practices can build up that are to the disadvantage of the whole community <Col N="229" /> and the ability of the community to provide both employment and cheap power for its people.</P>
    <P>What I have put forward in these three amendments, Nos. 2, 3 and 4 are essentially the sort of proxies for market pressures that were advocated by the National Planning Board that reported in 1974. They are in the areas of pricing, investment and performance indicators generally. The ESB still has some way to go before they are competitive with European prices.  We badly need them to be more than just competitive with the average. We need them to provide us with cheaper electricity than the average.  It is only fair that we should request that they set annual targets and give us an indication of how they are proceeding on a regular basis in relation to the competition. This is what it is all about and what the Minister has, time and again, told us he wants to achieve.  It is only reasonable that the Minister should accept an amendment under which the ESB will publicly account to us for their achievement in this area.  That is the purpose of amendment No. 2.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 3 deals with pricing also and this arises directly out of the Jacobsen report where there was a proposal, as the Minister is aware, that ESB tariffs should be examined independently. To implement that we should have an energy tariff commission to look at the board's tariff policy.  The Jacobsen report instances numerous cases where it felt the tariff policy was not being fairly applied to different consumers and it also dealt with many other issues which we do not have the time to go into such as the amortization charge that is highly controversial and needs to be carefully examined.</P>
    <P>This amendment provides that there should be a small effective commission to look into these issues as the Jacobsen report suggested.  I have provided the Minister with the power to extend the work of that commission to other energy products should he feel that is warranted and I think it is warranted in the case of other products where we have been <Col N="230" /> labouring continually under high costs that are hardly justifiable.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 4 is also related in that it is asking that the ESB would be obliged to provide an appraisal of investments and also account for their performance in relation to investment.  The case is sometimes made that, for commercial reasons, it would be unfair to require that the company provide this sort of information publicly, but let it be said that at the end of the day the taxpayer guarantees the loans of the ESB. We account to the taxpayers and we have the right to know if the ESB are making investments that they stand up and that after the event they can stand over them and say that they performed in the way they told us they would.  When there is a monopoly that does not face commercial competition in the market it is not asking much to have that.</P>
    <P>The other element of this amendment No. 4 is that we should have performance indicators relating to their efficiency and to their consumer services relative to other countries.  That, again, is something the planning board felt was the only reasonable way in which to substitute for market pressures that are obviously weakened in the case of a State monopoly. It is important that State monopolies prove themselves to be of the highest quality of service, to provide the most effective service possible and to stand four square with any other country. Unless we provide, by way of statute, that this sort of information is forthcoming to the Dáil, the whole work of a committee like the Oireachtas Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies, which is a highly worthy committee, becomes something of a farce.  If there is not sufficient information to judge from year to year as to how a company is faring, the Oireachtas Committee will flounder around with masses of information that it is very hard to make sense of.  It is only by having fixed points where the company reports on an annual basis that that committee can really do its work effectively.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will recognise amendment Nos. 2, 3 and 4 as a reasonable approach to the Dáil exacting the <Col N="231" /> highest possible performance from the Electricity Supply Board.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I might as well say at the start, because it affects many of the other amendments that are down, that the purpose of this Bill is to allow the ESB to set up subsidiary companies.  It is important that the board should have commercial freedom of operation.  These amendments, together with other amendments to be proposed later, are designed to limit and restrict the operation of the company in various ways.  I am not prepared to accept these amendments.</P>
      <P>In relation to amendment No. 2, the latest material on electricity prices at 1 January 1988, published by the International Union of Producers and Distributors of Electricity Energy, reveal that on average Irish electricity prices compare favourably with those in other European countries.  Domestic electricity prices are among the lowest in Europe and electricity for larger industrial users is priced lower than the European average, while prices for small industries are somewhat above the average price. Present Irish prices must be viewed against the background that, unlike the majority of other competitors, we do not have the benefit of an inter-connection or large scale cheap hydro power.  Any significant price reductions would have to be based on production cost cuts.  The ESB have certainly made progress in this direction in recent years.  Since January 1985 Irish electricity prices have fallen on average by 19 per cent for industrial customers, 15 per cent for commercial users and 12 per cent for domestic users. In real terms the reductions are greater. In view of the above it is difficult to see any benefits arising from a statutory obligation on the ESB of having to set price targets.  I believe it would be interfering with their commercial operations and I am not prepared to accept that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have repeatedly stressed in the Dáil that every opportunity of reducing ESB prices would be availed of and that in this respect ESB costs are being continually <Col N="232" /> monitored by my Department.  In relation to amendment No. 2 also, the International Union of Producers and Distributors of Electricity Energy regularly publish comparisons, which the ESB make widely available.  That should deal with the question of publication.  Also in this context the ESB are currently circulating such a comparison to all Members of the Oireachtas.  On the question of a price control mechanism, which is now being proposed, I would remind the Deputy that it was the previous Administration which removed the price control mechanism.  I see no reason why it should be introduced at this stage, because there is continuous monitoring at all times.</P>
    <P>So far as amendment No. 4 is concerned, the ESB is a commercial organisation operating in a highly competitive market and it would not be appropriate to publish the specific details of these type of assessments of which the Deputy is speaking.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Minister in this case because the amendment put forward by Deputy Bruton would be very restrictive.  There is a continual reference to State monopolies.  The country is full of monopolies, but the competition in the fuel and energy area is enormous.  The ESB have to contend with that and that will keep their prices down.  In the natural gas area and in the solid fuel area the competition is exceptionally high and it is forcing them to keep their prices as low as possible.  If Deputy Bruton wants something specific in a Bill to ensure that they will set targets for the reduction of prices, he would need to specify also where his party stands in relation to what they are allowed to do in order to reduce prices.  Would Deputy Bruton agree to their shutting down all the turf burning stations, which would help to reduce prices but would destroy Bord na Móna, would destroy thousands of jobs and would destroy the midlands? Would Deputy Bruton do something to ensure that an inter-connector could be re-established, as we are the only country in Europe who cannot connect up to <Col N="233" /> another country's grid.  As a result we have to build overcapacity in our power stations.  These are the facts of the case. We must have at least a 35 per cent over-capacity in case of breakdown.  In a case of breakdown we cannot plug in to some other country's grid.  The same applies in the North; they have to have over-capacity as well.  So it would certainly suit both of us if we could have the inter-connector re-established with some security.  These are the things which Deputies must say they want to do if they are talking about bringing down the price of electricity and show precisely how far they are prepared to go to do that.  The ESB could do all of these and it could reduce the price of electricity.</P>
      <P>Natural gas would never have been brought ashore without the agreement of the ESB to establish a special power station to take the natural gas in Cork. That helped them to bring the gas ashore. When the gas was on shore they told the ESB that they did not want them to take any more gas because they wanted to distribute it to individual consumers.  The ESB had to phase out gas and bring in Moneypoint.  In other words, they are constantly subjected to political decisions of one kind or another which are essential for the running of the economy.  If we want Bord na Móna established and if we want natural gas brought ashore, all of these things must be done; but the ESB are continually subject to political decisions.  They do not know what political decisions they will be given next year, so how can they plan their prices for ten years on?  All of these matters would need to be addressed by anybody who is talking about compelling the ESB to reduce their prices.  There is sufficient incentive already to do that.  I agree with the Minister that, rather than put further restrictions on the ESB, they should be given more freedom to use the tremendous potential they have in the technology area and in the expertise which they have shown in their consultative work in many other countries, to use that for developing jobs in industries here at home.  I do not understand the reason for putting such restrictions on them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="234" /> Deputy Bruton was unable to say that the ESB were using taxpayers' money, because they are not.  The implication is always there that they are using taxpayers' money.  He made the point that the taxpayers are guaranteeing their loans.  That is also coming to an end.  He will not be able to say that in another year because the loans are not being guaranteed any more.  They have to fight for their own loans on the open market, and they are successfully doing so, and they are not putting the taxpayer at risk even in the area of guaranteeing their loans.  I do not see the need for any further restrictions on them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to speak against these amendments.  There is a common thread running through these amendments in relation to the amount of interference by the Oireachtas in the affairs of the semi-State bodies.  There are already mechanisms by which we supervise the running and the financial accounts of semi-State bodies and I do not believe that the Government should be encouraged to meddle any more in the internal affairs of a body like the ESB or indeed the other semi-State bodies.  We in the Oireachtas should decide the policy issues and let the managers get on with the running of the company.  There are a number of weaknesses in the amendments. The aspirations may be commendable in terms of a price reduction, which we all want.  There have been substantial price reductions in recent years and I believe that that pattern will continue and we will have a favourable economic pricing climate.  The first amendment makes no distinction between industrial and domestic tariffs, something which is very necessary in this context.  It seeks to set a target, but it makes no effort to show how a target can be achieved.  If we were to take it in the spirit in which it is proposed there is a possibility that it would lead to a large number of redundancies in the ESB. There is no reference to the sizeable contribution which is made to the Exchequer annually by the ESB.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that amendment No. 3 would <Col N="235" /> be piling bureaucracy on top of bureaucracy. The Minister and the Department of Energy are well in a position to monitor the situation.  I do not think it takes into account the state of competitiveness of Irish electricity charges and it does not take into account the different charges and tariffs that apply and the fact that ESB costs have a far greater impact in some areas &mdash; for example, in heavy industry &mdash; than in modern hi-tech industries, where it could have very little impact.  It is likely that it would have very little impact on electronic assembly, for instance.  These things would have to be specified in great detail.  For example, health costs are much more affected by ESB costs than costs in a great many industries.</P>
    <P>I do not believe this is the appropriate Bill for looking at the competitiveness of the ESB but we would have to look at it over a wide range of topics.  I do not believe this is a satisfactory way of doing it and for that reason we are opposing these amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed with the response of the parties who have spoken.  I cannot agree with the Minister when he suggests the ESB must be commercial and therefore the Oireachtas has not the right to demand reporting of their success.  There is an enormous difference between reporting and interference in the affairs of a company.  For any company who control the market on an exclusive basis &mdash; call it monopoly if you wish &mdash; any company who are not subject to commercial pressures of the sort the Minister seems to think, there must be control, as everyone recognises.  Deputy Spring says the existing controls are adequate, but we have learned to our cost in the last ten years that this was not the case.  Jacobsen listed numerous examples of cost penalties that emerged in Ireland that should not have happened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All these amendments are seeking is that the Oireachtas has the right to demand high performance from this company and I feel this is the mechanism through which it should be done.  Deputy <Col N="236" /> Mac Giolla says some of the burdens the company carry are political decisions and I agree with him wholeheartedly.  The sooner we have transparency about our political decisions the better.  We must not think we can sweep under the ESB carpet obligations they must carry that we as an Oireachtas are deciding.  We should decide and stand over these things and not by nods and winks tell the ESB they should pay for them.  That is the thrust of reports like those from the National Planning Board.  Where we decide social interests demand certain things we should have the courage as an Oireachtas to stand over that and not expect the ESB, who are supposed to behave commercially, to carry the can for us.  Deputy Mac Giolla is right.  We should seek from the ESB that they exploit the enormous potential of their manpower and skills.  We want to see that and we do not want to see them bogged down in political obligations for which they are not being compensated, which are only stifling their ability to get on with the job of their commercial mandate and dragging the State sector into disrepute. I feel these amendments are worthy but I recognise the opposition is enormous.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe everybody would like to have the ESB competitive and everybody is anxious that electricity prices should be competitive for both household consumers and industrial users of electricity.  Moneypoint is the basis of this Bill.  Its total estimated cost is in the region of £720 million, which has overrun the initial price considerably.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as I am aware &mdash; and I said this on Second Stage in the House and was not contradicted &mdash; when the ESB entered into contracts for the purchase of coal prior to 1982 a clause was included which allowed for an upward adjustment in the price of the coal, but I know of no provision for adjustment of the price downwards.  The price of energy reduced from 1985 onwards.  If we are to stand over decisions of the ESB we should be in a position to do so and we should not stand over unsatisfactory decisions.  If a contractual or business decision is made <Col N="237" /> it should be on a basis this House can justify.  The deals entered into by the ESB at that time for the purchase of coal were, I understand, not particularly good transactions.</P>
    <P>The ESB were involved in appliance sales, which in the 12 years to 1986 amounted to £86 million, and the ESB sustained a loss of £5.8 million on them. In regard to appliance repairs losses of £3 million on sales of £14 million were recorded over 12 years' trading.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>We are looking to see the price of electricity reduced and targets set for each year.  Bad deals entered into will affect the price of electricity.  Deputy Mac Giolla talked about the effects on Bord na Móna.  Deputy Spring was the Minister for Energy when we were in Government and the ESB produced a five year strategic plan then which would have had a dire effect on the midlands.  I pay tribute to Deputy Spring publicly in this House.  He was very helpful to the people in the midlands at that time, as were the then Minister for Finance and Taoiseach.  That plan if proceeded with would have had a major effect on the midlands.</P>
      <P>I recognise the benefit the ESB have been to the country and I pay tribute to them for the excellent work they have carried out in consultancy overseas.  We in this House and the people are justifiably proud of their work.</P>
      <P>We must stand over decisions that are correct.  The decision taken to direct the ESB to enter into contracts for the purchase of turf was wise at the time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already made my view known that I cannot accept amendments Nos. 2, 3 and 4.  I accept the good faith of the Deputy in proposing them and that he is anxious to see reductions at all times in ESB charges and all charges to consumers.  I accept that principle and assure him that ESB prices are being <Col N="238" /> continually monitored by me in the Department.  I have mentioned a list of reductions.  Since 1985 Irish electricity prices have fallen on average by 19 per cent for industrial consumers, 15 per cent for commercial users and 12 per cent for domestic users and in real terms the reductions are even greater when you take inflation into account.</P>
      <P>The ESB coal contract provides for a downward adjustment in price.  It is also important to remember that coal is the cheapest of all fuels, at 1.2p per unit, for the production of electricity.  I am sorry I cannot accept the amendments.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 3, before section 2, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;5.&mdash;(1)  The Minister may by order authorise any person to generate, distribute or supply, to the public generally or to particular members of the public, electricity for all purposes or for specified purposes subject to such conditions as may be specified in the order.</P>
      <P>(2)  The Minister shall consult with the Board before making such an order.</P>
      <P>(3)  Any person may apply to the Minister for such authorisation.</P>
      <P>(4)  Any order made under this section shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.  It shall only come into force if a motion seeking its annulment has not been tabled within 21 sittings days of it being laid or if tabled has been disposed of.</P>
      <P>(5)  The Board shall purchase electricity from an authorised person at a price representing its full avoided costs.&rdquo;. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is anomalous that at present the task of deciding whether someone should be <Col N="239" /> authorised to generate electricity should be a matter for the ESB.  The Minister should have the freedom to make such a decision.  There is potential for the economy to exploit, albeit on a small scale, private hydro-generation and there is also considerable potential to exploit combined heat and power.  The attitude of the ESB in refusing to purchase electricity from combined heat and power industries which install such systems handicaps our ability to use energy in the most effective way.  There should be an obligation on the ESB to pay a price to these very worthwhile providers of electricity at a very low cost to the economy. They should provide them with a reasonable outlet where they would be paid a sum representing the ESB's full avoided costs.  At present they are being paid only a fuel avoidance cost which handicaps the emergence of these cheap technologies in energy exploitation.  It would be very desirable to see a change in this area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be interested to hear the Minister's comments on this amendment.  A constituent of mine was involved in private hydro-electricity generation and, from discussions he had with the Minister and his advisers, the ESB seem to be abusing their monopoly in relation to letting these people operate commercially and buying electricity from them at an economic cost.  It is interesting to note that the EC recently decided to try to bring together, on a Community basis, various private hydro-producers to decide on a common policy as to how private hydro-electricity generating producers would be able to contribute to their respective national grids.  From what I can gather, the Irish delegate &mdash; the constituent to whom I referred &mdash; found that the state of the industry in Ireland and its potential is far in excess of anything he had seen in other countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The ESB seem to be over-estimating the possible level of competition from these small hydro-producers; it would be no more than a meagre 1 per cent, 2 per cent or 3 per cent of the total grid.  The price offered at present inhibits small <Col N="240" /> hydro-producers from expanding and contributing to the national grid.  The ESB are being a little over protective in relation to a small group of people who have a contribution to make.  It is important to diversify the source of supply because there is a niche for small producers and the ESB should be a little bit more sympathetic towards them instead of seeing them as a threat.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to sound a note of caution in regard to this amendment. It should be discussed in the context of our present supply of electricity, as we have an over-capacity and will have for a considerable time.  However, there is an obligation on the ESB and the Department of Energy to carry out research, particularly into alternative sources of energy, for the future.</P>
      <P>I will give two examples of hydro-electric generation.  The people involved meant well.  They thought they had a good project and good locations, one in County Donegal and the other in County Kerry.  They got planning permission and went ahead with the projects and they made a small contribution to the national grid.  However, the other costs of these projects far outweigh the benefits and the contributions which these suppliers make to the national supply.</P>
      <P>We should be very conscious of the protection of the environment.  Despite the good intentions of these individuals, the overall good and the preservation of our landscape must take precedence because it is far more important in the long term, particularly in the counties to which I referred because of their inherent value to tourism.  Even small schemes greatly interfere with the landscape, which can never be restored to its original splendour.  I am opposed to the amendment because it is unnecessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to encourage the long term alternative energy research which is already taking place, but we should be looking at it on a scale that would make a valuable and large contribution to our energy requirements in the next ten to 15 years.  Despite present over-capacity, we should be considering a major capital <Col N="241" /> programme.  I would be concerned, if this amendment was accepted, by the nature of political pressures, that far too many small projects would be allowed.  In this case the means do not justify the end.  I assume the Minister opposes the amendment but, in relation to a discussion we will have at a later stage in regard to alternative energy, we must attribute weight and priorities to these various possible schemes.  However, we have an over-supply at present and we should leave it at that.</P>

I listened carefully to Deputy Spring talking about the environmental problems in Kerry and Donegal and the effect on the landscape&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I accept that but we must consider the amount of electricity that was generated by hydro systems in the past.  There is no doubt that a hydro system is the cleanest way of generating electricity.  The Minister, who is very anxious to protect the environment, should bear that in mind when he examines my suggestions.  There is no doubt that we should be carrying out research into alternative sources of energy such as water, wind and sun.  As a small country we may not have sufficient resources to fund such research but we should support projects like those outlined by Deputy Cowen.  The people involved should be given every opportunity to tap into the <Col N="242" /> ESB grid.  It is important to remember that by using our natural resources we save on imports and create local employment. That should be taken into account.</P>

      <P>The sale of electricity from one private user to another is subject to the permission of the ESB under the Electricity Supply Act, 1927.  The purpose of that legislation was to ensure an orderly development of an electricity infrastructure.  In order to preserve the integrity of the ESB grid system, and for reasons of safety, it is appropriate and necessary that the sale of electricity from one private user to another should require ESB permission.  On the question of pricing I should like to state that in view of the fall in the cost of fuels used by the ESB in recent years the price paid to private producers currently exceeds the cost of the electricity generated by the ESB.  Any increase in price would, therefore, only serve to increase the cost to the consumer and not reduce cost, as suggested in the amendment.</P>
      <P>In relation to combined heat and power I should like to state that the ESB are at present opposed to purchasing power from such schemes in view of the present over-capacity.  The Bill will give the ESB power to get involved in joint ventures and subsidiaries.  I am aware that the company are looking at a hydro system because they are aware it would help to replace imports.  They are considering getting involved in small projects with landowners who have water on their holdings and buying the electricity produced by such small hydro units, as suggested by Deputy Cowen.  It is important to stress that there is an over-capacity in the grid and that the price being paid to private producers is greater than the cost to the ESB of generating electricity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to tell Deputy Spring, who raised a point about the capital programme looking ten or 15 years ahead, that a major decision that will affect that programme is the question of whether it will be necessary to go ahead with an inter-connector with further extensions in the next ten or 15 years.  At present there is an over-capacity of 30 per cent <Col N="243" /> which must be kept in the grid at all times because we do not have an inter-connector. I am not necessarily referring to a North-South inter-connector, which is the ideal one, but to an east-west inter-connector. A high level group in the Department have been investigating this matter.  They are about to report and when I have considered their findings I will be putting recommendations to the Government.  I will inform the House at a later stage of the decisions arrived at in regard to an inter-connector east-west or from Ireland to France.  The question of an inter-connector is a very important one when considering future capital requirements of the ESB.</P>

      <P>In page 3, between lines 27 and 28, to insert the following subsections:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(5)  The Board shall establish each of its ancillary activities as subsidiary companies.</P>
      <P>(6)  The Board shall publish separate accounts for each of its subsidiary companies, along with its Annual Report. Such Report shall include details of any long-term contracts entered into by a company.</P>
      <P>(7)  (a) All such subsidiary companies and each of its ancillary activities shall conduct their affairs in a commercial manner in order to earn profits for their shareholders.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <P> (i)  the return on capital achieved,</P>
    <P>(ii)  the dividend paid to shareholders, and</P>
    <P>(iii)  the desirability of the Board retaining its shareholding in the company.</P>
    <P>
    </P>
    <P>(8)  The Board shall treat its subsidiary companies as commercially independent entities.  In particular&mdash;</P>
    <P> (a)  the Board shall not make preferential loans to a company;</P>
    <P>(b)  the Board shall not provide any subsidies to a company;</P>
    <P>(c)  the Board shall not provide any loan guarantees to a company;</P>
    <P>(d)  the Board shall price any goods or services purchased from it by a company on the basis of full cost, and the prices charged shall be reported in the Annual Report of the company;</P>
    <P>(e)  the Board shall not become involved in personnel management or industrial relations of a company.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>
    </P>
    <P>The essence of these amendments is that when the board embarks on the project of setting up companies that they be set up in a way that is entirely at arm's length and transparent from the rest of the business. We have to recognise that the ESB have a captive audience of 1.5 million consumers.  It would be a terrible misfortune if any of the companies established by the ESB got into difficulties and the consumer found himself or herself forced to support their continued existence. It is important that we establish from the outset that the new companies the ESB are being given the power to establish in order to enable them to exploit the opportunities they have and the potential of their staff are seen to be stand-alone companies.</P>
    <P>In amendment No. 6 I am suggesting that the board should publish separate <Col N="245" /> accounts, should see themselves as being commercial in their operations, that the board would not be permitted to make preferential loans to the new companies, would not be permitted to pay them any subsidies, would not be permitted to offer loan guarantees and would not be permitted to sell any goods or services at a discount or knock-down price.  It is important that that is made clear from the outset.  If my amendment is not accepted, a company that gets into difficulties may affect consumers.  The Minister on Second Stage adverted to the fact that appliance trading was no longer a losing entity.  For a long time it was losing money and consumers were asked to prop it up.</P>
    <P>We are giving the ESB power to establish new companies and in my view it is only right that in order to protect consumers we should insist that the provisions outlined in the amendments are included in the Bill.  The amendment also contains a review clause under which the company would look from time to time at the operations of the new companies to see the sort of return they are achieving and whether it is desirable to retain them. I support the approach taken by the previous Government in connection with their proposals for a national development corporation.  The State needs to get involved in the establishment of businesses because in many cases if the State does not do so such businesses may not be established.  However, the State need not always remain involved in them if after their successful establishment it can make a substantial profit by selling off its share.  Such resources could be used to exploit a new opportunity.  That possibility should be open to the board in dealing with the companies it establishes. We should alert the board to the fact that we would be quite happy to see them behave in that way if their assessment showed it was justifiable.</P>
    <P>Another element I should like to advert to in the amendment is the suggestion that the board should not become involved in personnel management and industrial relations of the new companies. My fear is the natural one if the ESB <Col N="246" /> is involved in coal and electricity.  An industrial dispute in the docks handling the coal should not spill over to the extent that the electricity supply is interfered with.  Obviously legislation cannot prevent that, but an effort should be made by the board to keep these entities as distinct as possible in separate premises with separate industrial relations mechanisms and separate personnel management. As legislators we would be doing the sensible thing in preventing the electricity consumer suffering from the possible dangers of a dispute in coal trading which would not involve the electricity arm of the business.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOMalley" hpid="Mr. P. O'Malley Mr. P. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 7 seeks to delete from the Bill section 2 (5).  That subsection gives extraordinary powers to the ESB and if the Bill is passed in its present form it will enable them to set up what amounts to be a banking service.  They would be allowed to lend money to companies with whom they are associated on terms and conditions they considered to be proper.  There is no restraint as to the level of interest at which they would lend this money.  Obviously the companies in association with them would have an unfair advantage over other companies trading in that sector.  If the ESB are able to lend money to a company in the coal trading sector with which they are associated at a cost below that at which a competing company can borrow, then the ESB company has a major advantage.  The likely prospect is that there would be a detrimental effect on the trading prospects of the other company engaged in coal trading. Ultimately, existing coal trading companies could be determined to the extent that they would be forced out of the market and the monopoly the ESB currently enjoy in one sector of the energy market would be extended further to other areas of that market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another extraordinary provision in subsection (5) enables the ESB to guarantee the borrowings of these companies. The net effect is that the Irish taxpayer would actually guarantee the borrowings and would have to pick up the tab in <Col N="247" /> the event of the companies going into receivership.</P>
    <P>The definition of &ldquo;company&rdquo; as it relates to subsection (5) is a matter I want to raise with the Minister.  As I understand it, the company to which the ESB can lend money does not have to have any relationship with the ESB.  At the start of section 2 the word &ldquo;company&rdquo; is defined as a company within the meaning of the Companies Act, 1963.  There does not appear to be any necessity for the company to which the ESB lend money to have an association with the ESB.  It is not required that the ESB should have a shareholding in such a company. That company or any such company need not necessarily be an Irish company but could be located overseas. The ESB can literally lend money to a company with which they have no connection and which may be engaged in a business unconnected with that of the ESB.  This appears to be farcical.  Perhaps the Minister would indicate if this is not the case.</P>

The Minister has covered any concerns in this area by the provisions in section 2 (6).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Bruton has run amok in his amendment where he lists various <Col N="248" /> arrangements which the ESB cannot enter into.  This party could not agree with these proposals in his amendment.</P>
    <P>The intent of both these amendments is to prevent the ESB getting into the business which this Bill will allow and to maintain this whole area for the private sector.  Our attitude is that the ESB have a perfect right to be involved in this business. We oppose the amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>I oppose both these amendments.  Deputy O'Malley has no great cause for the concern he expressed because the following subsection clearly places the authority on the Minister. Section 2 (6) states:</P>
      <P>The exercise by the Board of any power conferred by this section shall be subject to the consent of the Minister and the Minister for Finance given after consultation with any other Minister of the Government who, in the opinion of the Minister, having regard to the functions of the Minister of the Government, ought to be consulted.</P>
      <P>It is totally subject to ministerial, Government and parliamentary control. Once the Minister has responsibility we can ask parliamentary questions.  I take it the purpose is to allow joint ventures or assistance to companies.</P>
      <P>Deputy Bruton's amendment is extraordinary. A change in the Companies Act would be required before he would be able to get agreement on all of this amendment.  There has been talk about changing the Companies Act for at least six years but nobody seems to be capable of making any changes with regard to the private sector and what can be done with companies and their subsidiaries regarding price fixing, liquidations and the setting up of new companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Bruton provides that the board can set up ancillary activities as subsidiary companies and that the board shall publish separate accounts for each subsidiary, along with its annual report.  All such subsidiaries are to conduct their affairs in a commercial manner.  I agree with all that.  The amendment then provides that the board shall be totally <Col N="249" /> responsible for all their subsidiary companies and their annual reports but shall have nothing whatever to do with them. They shall not make preferential loans or act as guarantors for a loan to their subsidiary company.  They shall not provide any subsidies and any goods or services purchased by a company must be on the basis of full cost.  Furthermore, they cannot have any involvement whatsoever in the personal management or industrial relations of the company.</P>
    <P>These are subsidiary companies.  I do not see what the purpose of the board would be or how they would effectively use the expertise that we have already talked about tonight &mdash; their expertise and their skills in order to establish new companies, provide jobs in new areas and so on.  How can they do that if they are not allowed to use their excellent skills even in the industrial relations sector or in the personnel management area.  They cannot in any way assist these companies with finance, even by guaranteeing their loans.  They cannot give them subsidies or give them any special pricing.  Anyone else could set up the companies just the same as the board if they cannot do anything for them.  How can they set up subsidiary companies?  The whole amendment is self-defeating.  The original portion of it is acceptable in that the board have total responsibility for the companies, but the second portion of it means that they cannot have any responsibility for them whatsoever.  They cannot assist them by their personnel, their money, their electricity, their skills or in any way that would get the companies up and moving.  The whole purpose of the Bill would be destroyed if any amendment such as that was accepted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. D. O'Malley Mr. D. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say a few words on these two amendments, particularly on amendment No. 7, in the name of Deputy Pat O'Malley, which I think is the more important one in the sense that it is more pertinent to the Bill before the House.  Amendment No. 6 proposes to insert a new section.  I agree with the sentiments in that amendment, <Col N="250" /> put down by Deputy Bruton.  It is perfectly right that he should suggest that the ESB should establish each of its ancillary activities as a subsidiary company, publish separate accounts for them, treat them as commercially independent entities and treat them at arm's length in commercial terms.  It is important and quite valid that Deputy Bruton should suggest that because the ESB over the years have treated much of their ancillary or subsidiary activities at anything but commercial arm's length.  They have heavily subsidised, at the cost of the power consumer, various activities in which they chose to involve themselves in competition with people who have to bear the full brunt of the market place; and they have done so in a way that has been grossly unfair, to say the least.</P>
      <P>It is particularly vital that subsection (5) should be taken out of section 2.  I do not agree with section 2 anyway, but I could perhaps live with it if subsection (5) were not there.  That is where the real problem will arise.  It gives the board power to lend money, on such terms and conditions as they may determine, to a company and to guarantee, in such form and manner and on such terms and conditions as they think fit, the due repayment by a company of the principal or any other moneys.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Mac Giolla was quite erroneous in his statement that this applies only to subsidiaries of the ESB. That is not so.  It applies to any and every company.  The ESB can act as bankers to anybody.  I presume that it is intended to apply to subsidiaries or other ancillary activities but that is not so.  It applies to any company formed under the Companies Act, 1963, or indeed to any company established under the laws of the State, other than the State, which is a company.  They can act as banker, at the expense of the electricity consumers, to any other company either in Ireland or abroad whether or not they have anything to do with electricity or any of its connected activities.  That is far too wide a power to give.  It is cut down somewhat by section 6 in the sense that they have to get the consent of the Minister for <Col N="251" /> Energy and the Minister for Finance.  I have some experience of knowing how that consent can be forced from a Minister in some circumstances.  The ESB are not the easiest people to deal with.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I have particular recollection of my efforts to change the extraordinary and unparalleled accountancy provisions in the Electricity Act, 1927, which allows the ESB a double write off.  I thought it would be possible to amend that section of the Act.  At that time the ESB threatened the Department of Finance with all kinds of consequences, in terms of looking to the public purse for capital which they very badly needed, if that change were made and ordinary accountancy rules were made to apply to the ESB.  As a result, the Department of Finance panicked and decided to leave the matter as it was rather than put themselves in that position. That is what I have in mind in saying what I have said.  I have said so very advisely on the basis of my own experience. It is wrong that, even with these consents being necessary, the ESB should be given that general power to act as banker to any company of any kind in Ireland or anywhere else in the world. They can lend them money at, say, ½ per cent.  They may have to borrow the money at 10 per cent, but the difference is made up by the electricity consumer, as it has been in so many of the commercial activities of the ESB.  That is wrong.  They should not be given that sort of power, because I could envisage a situation arising where they will put on pressure to claim the right to be allowed to exercise the rights they would have under subsection (5), whether it was justifiable or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are in a different situation to day from that eight, nine or ten years ago when the ESB were grossly, some might say negligently, short of generating capacity.  They are now grossly, some <Col N="252" /> might say almost negligently, overplanted in terms of their capacity.  They have gone from one extreme to the other. It is unsatisfactory that they should be given these extraordinarily wide powers to, more or less, do anything they like.</P>
    <P>The original purpose of this Bill and of its predecessor was to allow the ESB to deal in coal.  If the House looks at this section, which gives them the right to establish or acquire a company, in conjunction with the following section it will see that all the coal provisions will be operated through this section, plus almost anything else.  Section 3 does not confine itself to dealing with coal.  It gives the board power to deal with any other substance or product.  We should be slow to cede such extraordinarily wide powers. In particular it is wrong to give the powers that are proposed in subsection (5).  What is contained in amendment No. 6, in Deputy Bruton's name, is the ideal if it could be achieved; but I do not realistically see a great chance of that being agreed to.  For example, in a country where monopoly powers are fully and properly controlled &mdash; this is not one of them &mdash; the sort of powers that are proposed in amendment No. 6 would be written into appropriate legislation.</P>
    <P>I urge on the Minister and the House the acceptance, if not of amendment No. 6, certainly of amendment No. 7.  It is not necessary to give these general banking powers to the ESB.  It is undesirable to do so.  It is only an encouragement to act in a way that is quite unnecessary and could be extremely hazardous and costly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>May I at this juncture make a few comments on the amendments before us and perhaps you will allow me that latitude of incorporating the ideas behind sections 3 and 4, which give new powers to the ESB to get involved in the importation and distribution of coal and the power of the board to manufacture and sell certain products.  This ties in with the section under discussion which deals with financing of subsidiary companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What exactly is strategic planning in relation to our energy policy and where <Col N="253" /> will the fuels used in the generation of electricity fit in the new scheme which has developed over the last three or four years?  Energy prices have dropped by between 60 per cent and 75 per cent.  At the time of the oil crisis we were very glad of our turf-fired stations which averted a national catastrophe.</P>
    <P>This Bill allows the ESB to import coal at Moneypoint and to redistribute it at various harbours.  The idea behind it is that the reductions in the world price of coal have not been reflected sufficiently here and it is envisaged that we should be able to get a further reduction of 20 per cent in the price of coal as a result of these new measures.  If we have further reductions in the price of coal to that extent, what impact do the Department envisage this will have on other fuels, particularly indigenous fuels?  Bord na Móna products are what I have in mind. What share of the market does coal account for?  If we reduce the price of coal by a further 20 per cent, what will be their envisaged increased market share? Have the Department any idea what impact that will have on the sale of peat briquettes?  Sales of briquettes have gone very bad at the moment as a result of a mild winter and because of price, plus the fact that peat briquettes are not an acceptable fuel in the smokeless zones being designated by Dublin Corporation in the city of Dublin.</P>
    <P>The ESB have always had a competitive advantage <i>vis-à-vis</i> Bord na Móna.  The price fixing arrangements for milled peat, which are due for negotiation again next year, will find Bord na Móna in a very vulnerable position, because of over-capacity, 350 MW, at Moneypoint. An extra generating set in Moneypoint will be sufficient to do away with every turf-burning station in the midlands. Where do Bord na Móna fit in?  This is my concern and the concern of many people I represent.  I find it a little disconcerting that, while we are discussing the expansion of activities of the ESB and the possible introduction of the ESB into activities which would bring them into direct competition with Bord na Móna in relation to indigenous fuels and the <Col N="254" /> distribution of fuels, there is also a great air of uncertainty in my area as to where Bord na Móna are going in the immediate, mid-term and long-term future.  I accept that the Minister has sent in a team of consultants to see where Bord na Móna will fit in, but I am very concerned that while we are awaiting the report the ESB are getting increased powers and opportunities to come into direct competition with Bord na Móna.</P>
    <P>The proposed new power will allow the ESB to import coal.  I accept that, because coal is being imported anyway. I think the idea in the Department is that since the ESB are importing so much coal for the station at Moneypoint why not let them bring in coal which is of a sufficient quality for the consumer market?  That is fine as far as it goes; but not alone are we allowing them to do that but we are allowing them to get involved in the manufacture and sale of coal or by-products of coal and we are allowing the board to set up a subsidiary company and to finance them with preferential loans.  For example, they can get into the area of producing brown coal briquettes.  If that happens where will Bord na Móna fit in? We are already at a competitive disadvantage and we are now talking about the ESB manufacturing an alternative to our indigenous fuel product; and by reason of their economic strength <i>vis-à-vis</i> Bord na Móna, the ESB will be in a very easy position potentially to undermine the future level of sales of Bord na Móna peat briquettes.</P>
    <P>What strategic planning is exactly is evading me at present.  One has to be acutely conscious of the effects the proposed expansion for the ESB may have on existing semi-State companies like Bord na Móna.  Let it be remembered that the subsidiary companies envisaged here financed by the main board at preferential rates, will be set up.  But before Bord na Móna introduced their development programmes they had to go on the open market without any State assistance and borrow at very high interest rates to continue expansion and had to pay a dividend of 15 per cent &mdash; that was the rate of interest they were being charged. <Col N="255" /> The Michael Smurfits of this world cannot give effective dividends of 15 per cent annually.  That is precisely what happened; and, as a result of a couple of bad years and a mild winter, Bord na Móna have 100,000 tonnes of peat briquettes and are building makeshift stores to hold the briquettes they cannot sell.  At the same time we are envisaging setting up subsidiary companies to get into areas of activity producing products like brown coal briquettes which will be in direct competition with Bord na Móna products. These companies will be set up in such a way as to be more advantageous in terms of price than Bord na Móna can manage at the moment.</P>
    <P>These issues deeply concern my constituents. I would be very grateful if the Minister could give the House an idea of what the strategic planning will be, what impact it is envisaged these increased powers will have and where will Bord na Móna fit in.  That company has given a very good service, which was gratefully accepted by Irish people over many decades.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Before getting to the specific amendment may I refer to the points raised by Deputy Cowen?  I understand and appreciate the deep concern Deputy Cowen has for the future viability, strength and employment potential of Bord na Móna in his area of Laois-Offaly and throughout the country generally.</P>
      <P>Bord na Móna are a very important company in the national scheme of things and I want to assure the Deputy that this Government are totally committed to having a viable Bord na Móna operating and using the resources under their control &mdash; the bogs &mdash; into the next century. At the moment there is a very close relationship between Bord na Móna and the ESB in regard to the generation of electricity, and that will continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will appreciate that it is very important for the future of Bord na Móna, with the changing situation worldwide and the changing situation in their last 20 years of operation, that the whole <Col N="256" /> structure of the board should be reviewed, that there should be greater concentration on marketing their products rather than just on production which, unfortunately, has been the situation up to now.  There is a new chief executive in Bord na Móna who, with the co-operation of the board, the unions and the workforce, has been doing an excellent job in rationalising the operations of the company.  The Government in their commitment to the future of Bord na Móna are appointing consultants with a mandate to report before the end of the year, to review the operations of that company and to help, in co-operation with the board, the management and workers to ensure that after the consultancy we will have a viable company with secure jobs for the employees.</P>
    <P>The coal is already being imported. What is intended is that the coal that is being imported will be screened and made available by cargo vessel to ports in Ireland to try to break the existing monopoly in relation to the importation of Polish coal.  We estimate a reduction of about 20 per cent in price available to Irish consumers.  That is very important. At the moment the relationship between turf and coal in domestic use is that use of turf is about one-fifth that of coal for commercial sales.  Rather than the ESB being in direct competition with Bord na Móna, I would see a situation in the future of their working very closely together.</P>
    <P>As regards the amendments put down. the primary function of the Bill is to give commercial freedom to the ESB.  The amendments are, in my view, unduly restrictive and would erode the freedom the Bill purports to give them.</P>
    <P>In relation to amendment 6, paragraph (6) the main purpose of the Bill is to allow the ESB to set up subsidiary companies. It is important that the board of the ESB should have the commercial freedom to decide for themselves when and where it is appropriate to establish subsidiary companies.  It is the board's intention to set up such companies &mdash; this is for the information of the House &mdash; to handle <Col N="257" /> their external consultancy, their fisheries and their coal trading facilities.</P>
    <P>In relation to amendment No. 6 (6) the situation there is that the statutory framework, section 7 of the 1927 Act, is already in place to enable the Minister to direct the ESB as to the form of their accounts.  In addition, under section 2 (6) of this Bill the power of the ESB to set up subsidiary companies is subject to the approval of the Ministers for Energy and for Finance.</P>
    <P>In relation to amendment No. 6 (7) (a), the subsidiary companies will be established with a view, obviously, to making a profit and the electricity customer will be protected as these subsidiaries will be set up under the Companies Act with limited liability. There may be occasions &mdash; I want to admit this here &mdash; when a subsidiary company is established with little likelihood of making a profit.  For example, in the foreign consultancy areas the ESB may participate in the venture in order to break into a market.  There may be only a slight chance of that particular venture showing a profit but further opportunities that it could open up would justify the participation in the venture itself.</P>
    <P>In relation to amendment No. 6 (7) (b), as a commercial organisation the ESB would be expected to continually assess the performance of their subsidiary companies. However, I do not consider that the inclusion of this as a statutory requirement is warranted.</P>
    <P>On the question of the borrowing power which has been spoken about at length here, section 2 (5) of the Bill is an important provision which will greatly assist the ESB in the expansion of their anciliary activities.  Despite what was said, it is not unusual for private companies to lend money and it is desirable that the ESB should be given similar commercial freedom.  There are many situations in which they may wish to lend money to a subsidiary or other company. In the case of a subsidiary company there is an obvious need to allow the ESB to provide the necessary finance to establish the company in the first place.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="258" /> In the consultancy and external activities area it may be necessary to make loans to companies in which the board have an interest, in order to keep pace with the attitude, agreement and response of other shareholders.  Indeed, it is often a condition of entry into a consortium that the participants advance money to the company by way of loans.</P>
    <P>To refer back to a point mentioned by Deputy Cowen earlier, in developing small hydro schemes it may be necessary to help out the local developer who may have the necessary land, water and expertise but not the capital to invest in a limited company.  In other cases it might be good business to advance money to a company to help them in extension or improvement of their business.  The powers conferred by this section are, of course, subject to the consent of the Ministers for Energy and for Finance. Necessary safeguards will be attached to such consent, which will ensure that the ESB will not be allowed to make loans to or guarantee borrowings for all and sundry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I see a certain amount of merit in the amendments we are discussing here, with regard to returning capital, the dividend paid to shareholders and the desirability of the board retaining their shareholding in the company.  If the ESB are entering into very challenging enterprises in Ireland or outside Ireland, there should be some method of recompense or reimbursement to the staff of the ESB in the form of shareholdings in one form or another.  This is something that should be looked into.  If the workers employed by the ESB had some type of incentive they would be able to select a specific area, go in there and, as Deputy Bruton has said, there would be an arm's length company which would have to pay their way by showing particular initiative in an area.  It would be desirable and in the public interest that workers would be involved and have the opportunity of purchasing shares in the company and that they would have the benefit of participation in the profits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister made a point about the <Col N="259" /> overall purpose of the Bill being the setting up of these subsidiary companies. Let there be no doubt about it, this Bill really is about the importation of coal.</P>

      <P>The importation of coal is one of the major issues, but I do not want to enter into a specific argument about that.  I express a certain amount of concern with regard to this question.  The <i>Irish Independent</i> some time ago had an editorial which made the point that I made a special pleading because I was from the midlands and represented an area in which Bord na Móna and the ESB had a particular interest.  Let us be honest, I make no bones about it.  I am not just making a special pleading on a weak case.  I am making a special pleading on a very important national situation. We are bringing in a Tobacco Bill in order to combat air pollution but let there be no doubt about it, acid rain poses a very great threat to the health and wellbeing of many people in this country.  A report was published by a subcommittee of the House of Commons in Canada dealing with acid rain.  I quote from page 11 of that report:</P>
      <P>Canada is facing the greatest environmental threat in the 114 years of existence as a nation.  The cleansing rains and pristine snows that once fell on this land have become dangerously acidic and destructive.</P>
      <P>Acid rain, a term unknown a decade ago, has become the most pervasive and most feared environmental pollutant in North America.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Honourable John Roberts, who is Minister for the Environment in Canada, told an American audience that acid rain is the most serious air pollution problem facing their two countries today, that the situation is already intolerable and that unless they take swift action it is going to <Col N="260" /> get worse instead of better in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>In recent years serious problems have arisen in Dublin because of smog.  Earlier we spoke about different types of energy generation.  The burning of turf or peat is one way of generating electricity, but the burning of large amounts of coal imported through Moneypoint will have a serious effect on the environment, particularly our larger towns and cities.  I put it to the Minister that we should be seeking ways to avoid this.  The Minister has said that he is anxious to see Board na Móna retained as a viable unit.  That is important.  But let there be no doubt that the burning of large amounts of imported coal is going to have major damaging effect on the environment.</P>

      <P>I hope the points which the Deputy is making are pertinent to the section.  It strikes me that we have been straying too far from the section.  However, I am not privy to what happened earlier.  It seems that the provisions of section 2 would enable the ESB to establish subsidiary companies and that this is being used by the Deputy as a licence to discuss the environment, pollution and other matters to which passing references could be made.  These should not be developed considering that there is a time limit on this debate.</P>

      <P>Section 2 relates to the establishment and acquisition of companies and interests in companies by the board.  These companies are going to import coal from Australia, China and America the burning of which is going to have serious and detrimental effects on the environment.  In the long term the importation of this coal is also going to lead to job losses in my constituency.  We need to be very careful as by importing coal we would affect the balance of trade and cause job losses.  I have great reservations about the setting up of a subsidiary to import coal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The ESB have closed down the power station in Portarlington.  Let them set up a subsidiary if they so wish, but they should utilise and adapt the power station <Col N="262" /> in Portarlington and create jobs there.  I cannot say the particular value of this station but I suggest that the setting up of a subsidiary company in Portarlington would be of benefit to the area and I would urge the Minister to consider this.</P>
    <P>As I have said, I have great reservations about this matter.  I welcome the ESB diversifying into other areas as this will be of benefit to our people and economy.  I ask the Minister to refrain from importing coal because the burning of that coal is going to have damaging effects on our environment and, secondly, the importation of that coal is going to result in job losses.</P>

Can he tell us whether ministerial consent would be required in respect of the subsidies which the board may provide to subsidiary companies and whether ministerial consent would be required if the board decided to provide goods or services at something less than full cost?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I can tell the Deputy that the provisions of section 2 would enable me to attach conditions to the setting up of the companies.  While I am on my feet lest what Deputy Enright has said may be taken as factual, let me respond to some of the points which he made.  Listening to Deputy Enright one would think that coal has never been imported into this country before.  Let me point out that under the provisions of this Bill a valuable national asset &mdash; constructed with taxpayers' money at Moneypoint &mdash; which is already being used in the importation of coal will be used now for the benefit of our people and economy to replace coal at present being imported from other sources, at an estimated saving because of the bulk buying the ESB must engage in for their coal burning station at Moneypoint, of approximately 20 per cent to those who burn coal at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I deny the allegations which have been <Col N="263" /> made by the Deputy in that the burning of this coal will have serious effects on the environment and that importation of this coal will have serious effects for his constituents in Laois-Offaly.  The ESB have had a role in providing employment in Laois-Offaly in the past and will continue to do so.  As I have already mentioned, it is important that Bord na Móna be turned into a viable entity.  That is underway at present.  As far as the closure in Portarlington is concerned, the Deputy should not be the one to speak about the closure of Portarlington, because the decision to close the power station there was taken by the previous administration of which the Deputy was a loyal and true supporter.  It was postponed by them many times but was eventually targeted for its operational date and the Deputy was involved in it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. D. O'Malley Mr. D. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say a few brief words in reply to what the Minister has said on the question of the importation of coal and its sale by the ESB.  The jetty at Moneypoint was built, not for the purpose of importing coal for wholesale or retail distribution in this country but, at the request of the ESB, to the size that it is, for a totally different purpose altogether.  It was built when they had in mind the building of another coal-powered station in the area of Belmullet, County Mayo.  They came to me, I think in 1979, and asked me would I agree to the jetty at Moneypoint being extended outwards by some 60 or 70 metres to allow much larger ships to come in than they would need at Moneypoint because they would be bringing in much bigger cargoes, as they saw themselves setting up a second Moneypoint-type operation in the Belmullet area and there was not sufficient water in Belmullet to import the coal directly.  Having given it some thought I agreed because the additional marginal cost was relatively small by comparison with the original cost of the jetty.  They are now trying to use that argument to justify the sale of coal, which they say they will be able to sell at 20 per cent less than it costs in this <Col N="264" /> country at present.  Possibly they will be able to sell it at 20 per cent less.  I would rejoice in that fact if I felt it was necessarily fair trading.  But I have the gravest doubts as to whether it will be fair trading. I fear it will be somewhat similar to their practice of selling washing machines, fridges or other electrical goods cheaper than anyone else.  They do so at the expense of the ordinary consumers of electricity here who are paying higher than their counterparts, particularly if they are industrial consumers anywhere else in Europe.</P>

      <P>Might I seek Deputy O'Malley's indulgence.  As an experienced Member of the House he will note that section 3 refers to the power of the board to distribute and sell coal and any other substance or product and so on.  There are specific sections where the discussion we are now having would be appropriate.  We have here an example of what happens when a Deputy presumes to introduce matter on a certain section which is not relevant to it.  Everybody then seems to accept the licence to go in pursuit of that which <i>ab initio</i> is out of order.

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I was inspired to say what I have to say because of the Minister's remarks.  The matter is by no means as simple or as straightforward as he suggests.  It may well have serious long-term repercussions here.  It is a matter that should be thought out more fully.  I greatly regret that, at 10.14 p.m., we are only beginning the discussion of what is the central point of this Bill.  The Bill is guillotined to finish at 10.30 p.m., which is very unfortunate.  It means that a whole lot of major amendments in the Minister's name go through by default and a whole lot of significant and important amendments in the names of various other Deputies are not even discussed. That is a great pity.</P>
      <P>All I can do, in the very short time at my disposal, is to register my serious reservations about the provisions of this Bill.  I was opposed to it when it was introduced by the previous Government. There is one change of significance as between the previous Bill and this one, which relates simply to shipping out of Moneypoint.  The principle of what is involved is wrong.  It is very questionable whether we should put two important sources of energy, electricity and coal, effectively under the total control of the ESB.  We have encountered serious problems in the past with the supply of electricity. Are we going to compound those problems in the future by potentially tying up most of our coal supplies also if the ESB run into some of the industrial relations or other problems they have encountered in the past?  It is dangerous. The House would have been well advised to have given a great deal more time to it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot give the Deputy that assurance.  As far as Deputy O'Malley's contribution is concerned I might congratulate him on his foresight in 1979 in having allowed such a jetty to be built at Moneypoint.  It is a great natural amenity of importance to us, a national infrastructure, which can be used not only for coal but hopefully, with the deep water facility there, also for the transhipment of other products from around the world coming to Moneypoint and to the rest of Europe.  That potential is there under the provisions of the Bill also.</P>
      <P>As far as Deputy O'Malley's statement that coal will now be under the total control of the ESB, I should say that is not true.  The position is that the private sector will still exist but the monopoly of the private sector will be broken.  The Deputy will be well aware &mdash; since he referred back to 1979 &mdash; exactly the position in which we found ourselves then in relation to the importation of coal here, when we had to scrimp and scrape around the United States, to Australia to try to find sources of coal, when our only market was in Poland tied up with one monopoly group.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to widen the debate on this section or the amendments to it.  The Minister is talking about breaking a coal monopoly.  Certainly while I have been in the House he has not referred at all to the other monopoly, that is the monopoly of electricity that the ESB represents.  As I understand it, the law does not provide for any other company, private or otherwise, to generate electricity and offer it to any significant part of this country.  On the other <Col N="267" /> hand the law does not prohibit any private sector company providing competition against the present coal monopoly.  There would appear to be a little schizophrenia in the Minister's attitude: he is concerned to break a coal monopoly which could be broken by private enterprise anyway, but shows no concern at all about breaking the ESB monopoly which, I would submit, is a more worrying one and has led to great inefficiency, very high cost electricity&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am on my feet for two minutes.  The Minister talked about breaking up the coal monopoly.  If that is the purpose of the section, it is reasonable to ask him what is his attitude to breaking up the electricity monopoly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Schizophrenia is not confined to the Minister's side of the House.  There is, on all sides of the House, a schizophrenic attitude to the State sector.  We want the State sector to be profitable and we complain bitterly when it is not.  On the other hand, we frequently want to tie its hands behind its back.  Why is that?  In this case, and this is where my submission is very relevant, the ESB are a statutory corporation and can only do what they are specifically allowed by statute.  They are not a company and because of that they cannot have private participation.  I <Col N="268" /> submit that one of the things we might have expected from the Minister in this Bill would be to change the status of the ESB from a statutory corporation to a company so that at least there would be the prospect, at some time in the future, of having some private participation in the ESB to bring some sort of commercial criteria into their operations.  This is the purpose of the amendments before the House.  It is because there is a worry there is not any real commercial criteria that Deputies Bruton and O'Malley have tabled their amendments.  It is because of the concern that there is not fair trading, that there are not commercial practices in the ESB and that because it is a monopoly it is protected.</P>
    <P>I believe the next ESB Bill should be a Bill to break up the ESB monopoly.  It would be good for the country and for ESB consumers, and we would not then have to deal with amendments of the type that are now before us.</P>

      <P>The Minister talks about jobs.  The loading of coal off a ship will provide some jobs but far less than will be lost across the midlands.  I asked the Minister if the Department intended to provide some sort of subsidiary company in Portarlington power station and the Minister came back with an attack on the previous Government.  In fairness to that Government we kept those stations open.  What the Minister's colleagues were shouting during the last election sounds very hollow now; they did not keep Portarlington open.  Has the Minister something positive in mind in regard to Portarlington, apart from political points scoring?</P>

      <P>I was trying to avoid coming in, hoping that we would get to other sections.  Obviously we will not now.  Speakers have continually referred to the question of the ESB importing coal as if that was all that this Bill was about.  It refers to any product, including coal, so it is a wide power in relation to all products.  As we develop smokeless zones around the country I hope that the importation of coal will be reduced to such an extent that the ESB will probably cease importing coal and will import other products.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="270" /> The whole purpose of the Bill in regard to jobs is to allow the ESB to use their expertise.  I would hope that as they develop they would be in a position to go into a joint venture with some other company in the area of building, say, a lead and zinc smelter which would use the over-capacity which the ESB have for electricity and which would also be of tremendous benefit to the State in the use of our natural resources, in the provision of jobs and in creating a whole new industry. I hope nothing will be done by way of amendment to this Bill that will prevent the ESB from going into such a joint venture for the benefit of the State.  As has been pointed out, in subsection (6) of this section all is subject to ministerial control.  I fail to see the dangers.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Cowen was speaking I felt he was wrong in saying that there is a danger to Bord na Móna because the ESB had over-capacity before, but still under the law the ESB must use the Bord na Móna turf fuel so there is no problem with Bord na Móna.  As soon as the Minister got up to reassure Deputy Cowen about Bord na Móna I became very worried as I heard words about rationalisation, consultancy, viability.  With the Minister's reassurance I became very worried about Bord na Móna and I began to think that perhaps Deputy Cowen was right, that there is some problem there of which I was not aware.  That did concern me greatly but I do not think this Bill of itself is any danger to Bord na Móna.  It should not be.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is an excellent and dynamic Minister.  Deputy Mitchell spoke about not tying the hands of the State sector behind their back.  I agree with that.  My simple concern is that under this section it will be possible for the ESB to set up subsidiary companies and get involved in the manufacture of brown coal briquettes which will be in direct competition with peat briquettes and Bord na Móna.  I am all for the expansion of the ESB and for them getting into as many commercial areas as possible. The point I make is that at the moment Bord na Móna have to adjust.  They are <Col N="271" /> doing so at a considerable cost to themselves and the workers.  What I am saying is, having rationalised, could we then, as a result of this legislation, have ESB subsidiaries involved in direct competition in the indigenous fuel market with Bord na Móna and its products? That is what I am afraid of.  There are enough things the ESB can get into.</P>
      <P>The Department of Energy should be guarding against the possibility of the ESB getting into direct competition with another semi-State company which is in the process of rationalisation.  I have great respect for Deputy Mac Giolla but I find it amazing that a former leader of The Workers' Party would not know about it.  It is important that we make sure the ESB do not get into a position where they are in direct competition with another semi-State company which is in the process of rationalisation which we must make more market-orientated, more export-orientated, etc.  Having rationalised I do not want the possibility of a situation developing where an ESB subsidiary could come in, with the economic advantages the ESB have over Bord na Móna, with the preferential loans the board would be able to give that subsidiary company, and get involved in direct competition with the indigenous fuel market by the production of brown coal briquettes.  That is my simple concern.</P>

      <P>Deputy Peter Barry gave me notice of his intention to raise on the Adjournment the subject matter of the postponement of the inquest into the killings in Gibraltar.  Our time is limited.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I will be able to put my point of view and I hope it will be accepted by the Minister in the time allotted to me.</P>
      <P>I put down a Private Notice Question yesterday asking the Government if they would take up with the British Government the damage that would be done by the postponement of the inquest into the shootings that took place in Gibraltar in early March of this year.  You, Sir, ruled that Private Notice Question out of order because of the rules governing Private Notice Questions, so I asked for permission to raise it on the Adjournment because the next opportunity I would have of raising it at Question Time would be 21 June which is the next time the Minister for Foreign Affairs is due to answer questions here.  The inquest was due to take place on 27 June, so that would be right up against the deadline.  I am grateful to you for the permission you have given me to speak here tonight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to go back over the facts regarding the incident in Gibraltar last March when three people lost their lives. However, I wish to state clearly and bluntly that they were members of an organisation which has done more harm to democracy and been the cause of more deaths on this island than any other organisation. Almost 3,000 lives have been lost over the last 20 years and the Provisional IRA were responsible for well over two-thirds of them.  The three people shot in Gibraltar in March were members of that organisation and were there on what was termed an operation by the Provisional IRA.  We have seen the effects of their operations in the past in Brighton, Harrods in London and <Col N="276" /> Enniskillen, where countless innocent people lost their lives.  I have no doubt that if this operation had taken place the same would have occurred in Gibraltar if the bomb had been placed.  This organisation have no compunction about taking innocent lives in all parts of the world.  Indeed, last Sunday morning they made young people stand outside a church in Belfast with placards around their necks saying that they were car thieves. The idea of justice, as far as the IRA were concerned, was to make these misguided young people parade in front of the church because they had been joyriding in stolen cars.</P>
    <P>This House has no sympathy for the Provisional IRA.  All democratic Governments over the last 20 years have condemned their acts and have clearly condemned their means of achieving their goals.  When this incident occurred in March, I said that, even though these people were acknowledged members of the IRA and even though they were there with the intention of committing a most heinous crime, which would probably have taken many lives, we do not expect the security forces of a democratic, law abiding State to descend to the same level.  I said, and I repeat, that those people should have been apprehended, brought to trial and charged with the crime of attempted murder, attempted bombing or whatever was appropriate.</P>
    <P>Television programmes which have been shown since the incident make it clear that the three people could have been attempting to surrender when they were repeatedly shot and killed.  The SAS are one of the most highly trained bodies in the world and they are well capable of disarming people by shooting without killing them.  I also said at the time that the people who were responsible for the deaths should be brought before a court and tried.</P>
    <P>The coroner in Gibraltar said, a few days after the shooting occurred, that the most probable date for the inquest would be the month of June.  However, this inquest has now been postponed for transparent and spurious reasons.  The excuse is that an important festival of <Col N="277" /> music, drama and the arts is to take place on the day of the inquest was to have been held.  That would have been known many months ago and the excuse that the two events would stretch the security forces does not hold water because it would have been possible to fly in planeloads of policemen from Britain to supplement the security forces on Gibraltar.</P>
    <P>A suspicion must arise that the inquest is being postponed in the hope that it will be held when this House and the House of Commons are not sitting.  Indeed, there is as much concern in Britain about what happened in March as there is in this country.  If the House of Commons is not sitting, the Government will not be subject to public scrutiny in this matter. The hope may be that, given time, public interest in this matter will wane.  Perhaps the hope also is that the searchlight of public opinion will be switched off the incident and that there may be a verdict of shooting in the interest of the State, or something of that nature.</P>
    <P>It is disturbing that at the same time the postponement of the inquest is announced some British newspapers this morning announced that the Foreign Jurisdiction Act, 1890, updated in 1965 and 1967, may mean that the people responsible for the shooting in Gibraltar might not necessarily be brought to trial.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. Calleary)</NameTxt>
      <P>It may be useful to recall the events which gave rise to the matter the Deputy wishes to raise on the Adjournment tonight.  Mairéad Farrell, Danny McCann and Seán Savage were shot in Gibraltar on 6 March last. It emerged shortly after the shootings that these three people were not armed and that the vehicle in which it was suggested they had planted a bomb did not in fact contain explosives.  The IRA did say, however, in a public statement that the three were IRA volunteers who were in Gibraltar on active service.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach stated to the House on 8 March that the Government condemned all forms of violence and recognised the necessity for security forces to take all reasonable measures to combat terrorism.  The Taoiseach went on to say that the Government were gravely perturbed at the shooting dead of these people in circumstances where it appeared from the reports that they could have been arrested by the security forces involved.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach also told the House on 16 March in reply to a parliamentary question tabled by the Deputy that the next important step would be the holding of the inquest and that he did not wish to comment further until the inquest was held.</P>
      <P>The Government made it clear subsequently in their statement of 29 April that they expected that the fullest possible information would be provided at the inquest and that, if it should prove necessary thereafter, any further inquiry or legal action which might be needed to uphold the rule of law, without fear or favour, would be instituted.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will know from the Taoiseach's reply to a Parliamentary question he tabled for 17 May, there have been contacts with the British authorities on this whole question in the Anglo-Irish Conference, in the Conference Secretariat and through the diplomatic channel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It will be seen clearly, and accepted by Deputies from the statements already made, that there has been a pattern of <Col N="279" /> active Government concern about this matter since the news of the Gibraltar shootings first broke.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the concern expressed by the Deputy about the reported postponement of the inquest.  I understand, however, that the timing of the inquest is a matter for the coroner of Gibraltar and I do not think it would be useful to protest to the British Government immediately about any decision by the coroner on timing.  It is right and important that the British Government should <Col N="280" /> be aware of the Government's concern that the inquest should be held as soon as possible and that the fullest possible information should be provided to it.  I can assure the Deputy that that concern, which I know is shared by him and by all Members of the House, has been conveyed to the British Government and that they are fully aware of it.  Information has been sought on the new timing proposed for the inquest.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The main benefit to Irish agriculture will come from the increase in the FEOGA guidance fund, which finances such measures as on-farm investment, headage payments and aid for projects related to the marketing and processing of agricultural products.  As well as the increase in the actual amount of the fund, however, there is the fact that Ireland is included among the least prosperous areas of the Community (called &ldquo;Objective No. 1 Regions&rdquo;) for which a special effort will be undertaken.  In these regions the resources of the Regional Fund and Social Fund will be utilised in a cohesive way, as part of an operational programme, to promote the development of the region.  Agriculture will, of course, also benefit from increases in the Regional and Social Funds, albeit indirectly in many instances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy will be aware, I recently negotiated a 70 per cent reimbursement for most items under the revised Western Package.  This is an approach I will be <Col N="101" /> pursuing for integrated rural development and in the negotiations for income aids for farmers.</P>
    <P>We have been quite successful in obtaining increased funding for the processing and marketing of agricultural products.  The level of grants received from FEOGA has increased from £12 million in 1984 to over £20 million in 1987 and it is to be hoped that returns from this scheme will continue to increase.</P>
    <P>This country secured a special allocation of 20 million ECUs under this scheme over the period 1987 to 1989 to enable all Irish pigmeat projects qualify for a 50 per cent rate of grant from FEOGA.  This enhanced rate of grant should facilitate the rationalisation programme for the sector developed by my Department and the IDA.</P>

The review is part of a programme initiated by the Minister for Industry and Commerce <Col N="102" /> aimed at easing unnecessary legislative and administrative burdens on business and industry.  The review within my Department is still in progress.</P>
      <P>The scope for easing burdens on business and industry as far as this Department is concerned is not great.  The bulk of requirements derive from compliance with EC legislation which in many cases specify in detail the lay-out and content of forms and procedures to be observed. Non-compliance with regulations could result in the loss of revenue to industry and to the Exchequer.</P>

      <P>The pilot programme for integrated rural development will run for a period of two years.  In the light of the emerging experience from the pilot measure, a decision will be made as to the possibility of extending the programme to the entire country.</P>
      <P>I hope the Community will adopt a rural development policy in the near future.  The Commission has indicated its intention of producing a major policy document in this area.  We cannot, however, wait too long for this document. We have decided to press ahead ourselves with a pilot scheme so that when the financial flows arising out of the reform of the Structural Funds have reached sufficiently increased levels we will be in a position to maximise our own participation.  We are the first member state to undertake a broad national pilot scheme for rural development following the EC Summit decision on increased Structural Funds.</P>
      <P>Negotiations with the EC Commission on funding for the pilot schemes have already been initiated.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, most barriers to intra-Community trade in farm products of interest to Ireland have already been eliminated under the Common Agricultural Policy and the harmonisation measures adopted down through the years.  Nevertheless, the completion of the single market will have implications for the agriculture and food sectors in particular in regard to the re-establishment of common support price levels and the further harmonisation of veterinary, phytosanitary and foodstuffs regulations.  In addition, many of the horizontal proposals for completion of the single market and the cohesion measures will impact on these sectors.  I might add that the Commission <Col N="104" /> has not yet made detailed proposals in a significant number of areas affecting agriculture and food.</P>
      <P>The Government have decided to launch a campaign in the near future to alert the economic sectors to the implications of the 1992 deadline for completion of the single market.  The launch will be attended by business, agriculture and other leaders.  The Government envisage that the campaign will be conducted primarily through the representative and sectoral bodies in the commercial and other sectors and the relevant State agencies subject to co-ordination by a joint public-private sector committee established for that purpose.</P>
      <P>I will be arranging that the relevant State agencies will co-operate fully with the representative and vocational bodies in the agriculture and food sectors in order to ensure that they are made fully aware of relevant developments and that they are equipped both to face the challenges posed by the completion of the single market and to exploit the opportunities it will present.</P>

      <P>Under the provisions of EC Regulation 797/85, on which the farm improvement programme is based, grant-aid for dairy investment is payable only where an applicant's permanent milk quota is respected.  Each applicant for acceptance into the farm improvement programme undertakes to observe all the programme conditions one of which is that aid shall not be granted for investments related to milk production which would result in the permanent quota being exceeded.  Furthermore, in drawing up farm plans which include provision for dairy investment, ACOT ensures that each participant in the programme is made fully aware of the necessity not to exceed the allocated milk quota.  It is the responsibility of each dairy farmer who applies for grant-aid for dairy investment under the FIP to ensure that his milk production for each year of his farm plan is within the permanent milk quota allocated to him, thus safeguarding his eligibility for grant-aid for his dairy projects.</P>
      <P>Under EC rules it is not open to me to give grant-aid for storage facilities for silage effluent and slurry to dairy farmers who increase milk production beyond the quota limits.</P>

      <P>The position is that the Commission has made no proposals to devalue the Irish Green £ in this year's price proposals.  In the Council discussions to date, I have been pressing strongly for such devaluations, which are, in my view, fully justified.  I would hope that the discussions can be concluded at the next Council meeting beginning 13 June.  Current Irish MCAs are as follows:</P>

      <P>I consider that despite the <Col N="115" /> quota cuts 1987-88 was a good year for Irish milk producers and processors.  Co-ops were generally paying above five pence a gallon more than in the previous year, inflation was at a low level and interest rates were falling.  While some producers will be facing super-levy bills, these will be much less than was anticipated earlier in the year.</P>
      <P>As I announced recently, I have set up a working group comprised of representatives from the industry, AFT/ACOT and the Department to review the various operations of the quota system with a view to improvement where possible and to report their findings to me by the autumn.  I have already decided on one change for 1988-89 in accepting the recommendation of the group to introduce a scheme for the temporary leasing of quotas this milk year.</P>

      <P>The basis for the recent Government decision agreeing to the designation of certain counties for the higher rate of fixed asset grant was a report entitled <i>Designation of Areas for Industrial Policy</i> produced by the National Economic and Social Council in September 1985, which recommended objective criteria for determining the areas to be designated.  These criteria are based on labour market imbalance, which is a broadly defined measure of unemployment. The Economic and Social Research Institute was commissioned to determine the actual areas which merited designation under the NESC formula. The ESRI analysis has determined that the following non-designated counties merit the highest priority for designation i.e. Louth, Wexford, Wicklow, and Offaly.  It is on this basis that the Government decided to accord these counties designation status.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Health whether due to cutbacks in his Department, nursing homes throughout the country are being set up and as the Annual Conference of the Environmental Health Officers Association in Kilkenny were informed, many are exploiting the elderly; if there are any guidelines or conditions which have to be adhered to when setting up a nursing home; and if so, if there are any personnel in his Department employed to check that these conditions are being adhered to.</P>

      <P>I am not aware of any significant increase in the rate of establishment of nursing homes throughout the country.  While the State provides a wide range of services for the care of the elderly, the contribution of private nursing homes is essential.  The right of the elderly to make private arrangements for nursing care in their latter years is a matter for each individual.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The State has a statutory responsibility to ensure a minimum standard of care in private nursing homes under the Health <Col N="132" /> (Homes for Incapacitated Persons) Act, 1964 and the 1985 Regulations.  Under these regulations, health boards are charged with the responsibility for ensuring that standards are met.  The boards inspect these homes on a regular basis.</P>
    <P>I understand that one of the issues that the Working Party on Health and Welfare Services for the Elderly will be addressing, is the relationship between private nursing homes and health boards in their complementary role of caring for the elderly.  This report will be presented shortly and the Government will quickly examine the recommendations and implement those which it accepts in so far as resources allow as a matter of urgency. State support for private nursing homes means that prescribed standards must be enforced and met.  This particular area will be considered in conjunction with the report of the working party.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is referred to the relevant press releases of last November which detailed the extent and composition of the national lottery moneys allocated to my Department.

I would point out that the school currently has an ex-quota guidance and an ex-quota remedial teacher and that these ex-quota posts will remain in place for 1988-89.</P>

    <P>The organisation of the school's curriculum is a matter for decision by the board of management having regard to <Col N="136" /> the annual allocation of teaching staff authorised by my Department.
