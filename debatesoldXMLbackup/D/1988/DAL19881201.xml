      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise a matter of privilege.  This week I tabled Dáil questions to the Taoiseach and his Ministers seeking information on the amount of money provided in 1988 and 1989 for press and information activities and public relations and to whom payable. I now have evidence that instructions were issued in the Taoiseach's Department, which were communicated to all Departments, that the reply would include only one total for each category and that no reference should be made to whom the money was payable.  I regard this as a deliberate breach of parliamentary privilege and a deliberate attempt to conceal details&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I share the Deputy's concern and that of many other Deputies in respect of security matters <Col N="5" /> appertaining to entrances and exists from the Houses of the Oireachtas.  As the House is aware, the appropriate authorities in the House of the Oireachtas have already been in touch with the Garda authorities in regard to this matter.  A meeting has been arranged for tomorrow to discuss the problem and to enable the Garda to make the necessary arrangements.  The primary responsibility for crowd control in the streets in the vicinity of Leinster House rests with the Garda authorities.  I have instructed my officials to take a very strong line in this matter and see to it that the wishes of the Members are adhered to.  I appreciate the anxieties of Members in the matter in general terms.  I have conveyed the views of Members to the Garda Commissioner on a number of occasions, most recently on 12 September.  In the present case I am conveying their strongly held views again to the commissioner.  I hope the outcome will meet with the satisfaction of the Member and all concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I support what has been said.  You will recall that I brought this matter to your attention exactly one year ago.  I also wrote to the Taoiseach at the time setting out in detail the problems that had arisen.  On several occasions at that time and since some or all of the Progressive Democrats' Deputies have been denied access to this House for up to two hours at a time and that is extremely unsatisfactory.  Apart from the denial of access, on other occasions when we have had access to the House there was obviously a security problem involved in trying to exercise that right of access.  The Garda have indicated to me on several occasions that they are extremely concerned and unhappy that any Deputies should be housed outside the boundaries or perimeter of this House.  I would ask again that an effort be made to try to bring to an end the situation in which we, <Col N="6" /> in particular find ourselves, and in which Deputy FitzGerald finds himself, and that facilities would be made available within the overall perimeter of Leinster House.  Suggestions have been made with regard to other arrangements whereby civil servants who are not under any security risk could go outside the general perimeter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dennehy</NameTxt>
      <P>The mistake which you just made is a fairly regular one.  As a matter of fact I received a phone call at 7.30 a.m. this morning for Deputy Deenihan.  Many people make that mistake.</P>
      <P>On Tuesday evening last I was dealing with one issue in the context of comments made by Deputy Shatter in relation to local councils working in isolation when drawing up their development plans.  I would like to return to that topic because there is a relationship between the number of claims for compensation, the general hassle in the planning area and the number of section 4 proposals placed on council agendas and the care which goes into preparing any development plan on the other hand.  I want to stress the amount of care that I feel is necessary in this area.  A lot of hard work is called for from local councillors and there is a great responsibility on them.  They carry out one of the most important statutory jobs in the life of any council and they must do this in the best possible fashion. As I have emphasised previously, there is a particular need for great co-ordination of effort between the elected members of the various councils and the managerial and professional staff involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Shatter made a strong case for regional plans.  I take it he is suggesting that there is no need for local authority plans as such.  I accept that we will see more regional planning.  I would go against the argument that we should cease working at local authority level.  It is my belief that one cannot over-plan because each additional review affords <Col N="11" /> an insight into the problems faced by local authorities.  In general, as a nation, I would question whether we are good forward planners.  At times we are probably too impatient for action without taking account of the requisite research and examination of all the implications of any scheme mooted.  For example, in the carpentry, steel fabrication and some other trades there is an old, sensible motto: measure twice and cut once.  That motto could well be applied to forward planning because it constitutes something of a critical path analysis which, if properly utilised, will highlight any defects in proposals.  It should be remembered that very often such proposals are put forward in isolation when they will not appear defective.</P>
    <P>Rather than have five-year development plans for each local authority I suggest that there be greater flexibility.  As I said on Tuesday evening last, the local authorities in Cork have taken the initiative with regard to area plans in general covering parish-type development.  Probably planning in Dublin has suffered from the lack of similar type thinking, that is breaking planning proposals into the smallest possible units.  On the other hand, for obvious reasons more regional planning will be necessary within the newly developing scene in the EC.  That planning is already under way.  The responsible Minister has notified each local authority of what are the relevant regions, who should be involved and so on.</P>
    <P>I accept that issues arise, such as those raised on the Order of Business this morning with regard to contributions from and involvement of local authorities. The Minister of State, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, is moving in the right direction, putting these regional plans in place, getting action going in preparation for 1992.  There is need for co-ordination in that area.  Planning must evolve right from parish to regional level.</P>
    <P>Deputy Shatter based his argument on the fact that there can be overlapping, that people working in isolation will not <Col N="12" /> be aware of their neighbouring local authority's plans or possibly ignore their implications.  That is a very real danger. There can also be overlapping in regional development.  There would appear to be a need for the establishment of a national co-ordinating body, which I understand is being dealt with at present.  We need to examine our input into planning.  Too often we criticise speculators and others while we may not have done a very good job within the ambit of our own planning area, thus leading to much hassle.</P>
    <P>I hope the Ceann Comhairle will bear with me if I mention a topical problem which arose in the course of debates in the past week, that is the question of smog.  At least one contributor was critical of the Minister contending that the problem had obtained for several weeks and the Minister had done nothing about it.  Surely that type of criticism must reflect on the contributor because we should remember that smog is not a new phenomenon.  My father-in-law, who has lived out of Dublin for the past 50 years, can clearly recall the problem having obtained in this city 50 years ago.  It is unfortunate that such criticism is levelled at a Minister who, for the first time, proposes to do something about a very real problem.  It is inappropriate that people who held senior posts in former administrations should criticise his initiative.  It is my belief that the Minister is doing very well in that area.  Indeed, I will talk with him later in the day to inform him of the problem we are experiencing in Cork when, hopefully, he will take similar action there.</P>
    <P>Another problem which has been brought to our attention by the Construction Industry Federation and which has given rise to public disquiet, particularly on the part of members of the building construction industry, is the unsatisfactory delay occasioned in dealing with appeals by An Bord Pleanála.  It has been suggested to me that a statutory minimum period within which the board would have to take a decision on any appeal before them should be stipulated.  Initially I was tempted to think it was a good suggestion which sounded rather logical.  Having <Col N="13" /> checked with a number of sources, having carried out my own research, bearing in mind the present waiting period compared with what was regarded as normal, say two years ago, I do not believe we need to effect that change in local government legislation.  I have no wish to see valuable capital tied up in the course of planning appeals or potential jobs in the construction industry for the same reason.  I should not like to see some of the defects of existing legislation incorporated into newer legislation.  A minimum specific time clause could lead to planning permission being granted by default or, in many cases, to a threat of court action, leading to perhaps hasty, incorrect decisions.  Such decisions could lead to a serious erosion of the rights of appellants in planning appeals, whether they be first or third party.  We must endeavour to strike the correct balance between preserving their rights while ensuring an appropriate degree of expediency.</P>
    <P>Having examined the matter it is my belief that the Minister's approach of encouraging An Bord Pleanála to speed up their operations is the correct one.  I am aware that the Minister has sought greater co-operation in this area, he too being worried about the delays which are occurring.  If my information is correct, there has been approximately a 50 per cent decrease in that time lag since the present Minister assumed office.  I might congratulate him and the members of the board on having achieved that improvement and encourage them to maintain it.</P>
    <P>The opportunity should not be lost, particularly on the part of Members on this side of the House, to refer, however briefly, to a topical subject about which there have been many negative comments recently, that is, the availability of national lottery funding.  I want to say clearly and unequivocally that the local authorities for Cork city and county have been enabled to undertake an enormous amount of developmental work over the past 12 months or so in the environmental area as a result of having received such funding.  In the general slagging match that takes place in the Chamber we might <Col N="14" /> lose sight of that fact.  Deputy Quill who is in the Chamber will support my point that what we have seen is the icing on the cake.  The potential environmental schemes had been at a standstill because of our financial circumstances.  Now I see works such as recreational parks, game pitches, car parks, riverside walks and a whole range of amenities being developed.  These were included in our local development plans but they could never have been touched but for the availability of this money because works relating to sewerage, water and roads would have taken precedence.  We should recognise the good points about what we have done.  Members from all sides of the House can take credit for achieving things that up to now were pious platitudes.</P>
    <P>I have already asked the Minister to look at the problems that were created in the past by unfinished housing estates and so on. Deputy Quill highlighted another problem in the context of this Bill and that is the fact that local authorities or other State bodies do not require planning permission.  In Cork we have only had one major problem with this issue but it certainly is an area which can cause a lot of aggravation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dennehy</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that it was possibly one too many but that was seven years ago.  I accept that there is need for control in that area.  A balancing factor here, however, is the development works which do not require planning permission, for instance games pitches and so on.  These would need planning permission if private individuals were building them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I read many of the contributions that have already been made on the Bill and I found some inconsistency in the contributions from some of the spokespeople. Regarding the credentials of local planners, some speakers said these people would not have the ability, the expertise, to adjudicate on planning <Col N="15" /> applications, possible pollution results and so on.  Yet the submission from the Irish Planning Institute was quoted at length.  Deputy Keating practically read the full submission into the record relating to the basis for compensation.  Still, in his contribution, I think he suggested that these people would be incompetent when it comes to judging the merits of a planning application.  The Deputies cannot have it both ways.  I have confidence in the expertise and integrity of our planning officials and I take note of their submissions.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his opening speech on Second Stage indicated his willingness to take on board any meaningful amendments to close any loopholes that Members might highlight.  These loopholes might occur under section 13 and the Third Schedule, paragraph 9 of which has been most widely quoted.  The Minister has undertaken to consider all the arguments put up.  Paragraph 9 of the Third Schedule deals with the question of compensation being excluded where planning permission is refused because development would materially contravene an objective of a development plan which was in operation when the developer acquired his interest in the site.  This is probably the nub of the whole Bill.</P>
    <P>Behind that paragraph and others lies the whole question of the constitutionality of imposing too restrictive regulations relating to the amount of compensation.  It occurred to me that a test case should have been taken in the courts and it emerged during the debate that Dublin County Council are taking a test case.  They are appealing the £2 million award of last year.  That case which relates to section 55 of the 1963 Act is down for mention in February or March and it will go to the Supreme Court.  If the decision goes in favour of Dublin County Council the Minister can start rewriting this Bill and much of our other local government legislation.  All of the arguments against this Bill have been based on the fact that the Government have been advised that it would be unconstitutional to impose too rigid a regime <Col N="16" /> in this area.  The Government are prohibited from promoting legislation which is known to be unconstitutional.  On the advice given to them the Government have introduced this Bill, but if that case is found in favour of Dublin County Council we can all go back to the drawing board.  In the meantime I would stress that the Minister is quite willing to take on board any reasonable amendments. This is such a complex area that I am delighted the Minister has taken this attitude.</P>
    <P>Some people have written off all of the good aspects of the Bill.  Deputy Quill said that it went three-quarters of the way towards solving the problem.  Others have simply said they are voting against this Bill and that is it.  That would be a pity as there is need for legislation and need for changes here.  The pressure put on planners particularly in the Dublin area has been a disgrace.  I am not too worried about the claims awarded but about the pressure, regardless of whether that pressure relates back to the original development plans.  There are other parts of the Bill which ought to be welcomed, for instance, the whole question of tree preservation orders.  Last year I listened with great interest to weeks of rowing about Coolattin Woods and its problems and the lack of legislation to control activities there.  The Minister and everybody else found themselves spancelled in that area.  They could do nothing to deal with the problem.  Now, in this Bill, we have legislation to deal with that.  I welcome this and all parties should welcome it too.  What the Minister is saying is that without paying compensation, which is the nub of the problem, portions of woodlands may need to be preserved for the felling of trees, perhaps for over 20 years. That move is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>In the past we had problems in the area of the preservation of buildings of artistic, architectural or historical interest, or the internal works or features of such buildings. Legislation was very weak in this area because there was the right to claim massive amounts in compensation for any restriction placed on a developer.  Under section 13 and the Fourth Schedule of the <Col N="17" /> Bill, paragraphs 15 and 16, the Minister is attaching conditions to the planning permissions to preserve these buildings without paying compensation.  It must be stressed that the Minister is taking the initiative in this area.</P>
    <P>Deputies mentioned &ldquo;undertakings&rdquo;&mdash; a term used by planners which means doing an under-the-table deal with developers, telling them that if they withdraw or do not proceed with one planning application they will be granted planning permission on another occasion.  That was a very cloudy area and the Minister is trying to deal with it as effectively as possible.  Hopefully he will strike the right balance.</P>
    <P>Some of the other issues raised will not be dealt with in this Bill because it relates almost totally to the compensation, but hopefully the debate will lead to some of these issues being addressed in future legislation.  The teasing out of the present problem of compensation will possibly be decided for us outside this House in the coming year.  One speaker mentioned that to date the courts had not been asked to tease out what is meant by the public and the common good, for example, in linking Article 43 with the third part of Article 40 of the Constitution.  That has been raised in the Grange Development case and we will have a decision on it next year.</P>
    <P>A problem for people in the planning area of local authorities has been the scattering of legislation and trying to put legislation together when you want to examine the implications of any planning submission.  As I mentioned last Tuesday, I am the chairman of the planning committee of Cork Corporation and I am aware of the difficulties in trying to relate one piece of legislation to another.  The Minister is to be congratulated for bringing together under the one Bill all aspects of the planning law relative to compensation claims.  We have been depending on the planning officers to explain what was covered in different Acts, but there have been many amendments to the planning legislation since 1963 and it is difficult to follow them.  Just when you think you have covered all points of a <Col N="18" /> particular application, you suddenly find there is amending legislation and you must read up on that.  Now all this is covered in the one Bill and the Minister is to be congratulated for this.</P>
    <P>In the past, the scattering of legislation as well as vagueness in the legislation have allowed some very clever groups of speculators, who employed teams, to take advantage of loopholes in the law. We need to differentiate between the speculators, the make a killing individual, and the legitimate developer and builder. Just as I do not like to see politicians tarred with the one brush, I would not like to see all developers tarred with the one brush.  We need legislation which will protect the honest, legitimate developer but which will halt the get-rich-quickly merchant who has the legal back-up to exploit the situation.</P>
    <P>The fears experienced by planning authorities have been dealt with and the fears of local authority managers may not even be known to council members.  This is one area which could never be quantified, unlike the way compensation claims and payments have been quantified since 1982.  There was a very real need to tighten up this area so that the rules will prohibit any undue pressure being applied to anyone.</P>
    <P>Deputy Keating told us he was trying to assist a developer but found difficulty getting detailed advice for the applicant as to what development should take place or what might be acceptable.  I do not think this difficulty should ever arise.  I would like to refer to the Cork scene <i>versus</i> the Dublin scene.  In our local authority there is an open door to the city manager's office and, if necessary, to the city council.  This is the way it should be rather than have somebody submit a detailed planning application which may cost many thousands of pounds and which could lead to conflict.  There should be as much dialogue as possible between the public representatives, the professional staff and the management.  I do not know if that happens in Dublin, but I take it from Deputy Keating's remarks that it <Col N="19" /> does not.  This is one area where Dublin might learn from our own humble city.</P>

      <P>Humility is one of our biggest handicaps, but we do the best we can.  Last Monday week we had an application for a major development and we teased out many of the problems which could arise.  If there was more of that kind of dialogue some of the problems which arise could be eliminated.  It is bad enough to have obscure legislation, but if dialogue is not possible, then we are really in trouble.  This is an area where things are happening.</P>
      <P>Another matter which needs to be tackled in the Bill is the splitting up of the compulsory purchase of land for local authorities and compensation for normal development outside that area.  Up to now they were both under the same heading. The objectives should be totally different in the two areas.  The CPO would be for the common good; compensation for normal developments would be seen to be for the good of the individual making the application.  It was a necessary step to separate these and I welcome it.</P>
      <P>The Minister has not just suggested but spelt out strongly &mdash; and the meaning was questioned but I think it is quite clear &mdash; a consensus generally on the need to strengthen community bias in the area of planning compensation, that is to extend the range of non-compensatable circumstances and to provide a mechanism for avoiding compensation in the form of alternative development consents.  The Bill will go a long way towards doing that. It is quite easy to understand what is meant by strengthening the community bias in the area of planning compensation. It means simply that we do not believe the taxpaying public should be the victims of speculators; speculators should not be able to use the law in an underhand or other fashion to get the taxpayers' money.  That is what the Minister meant and that is what he is attempting to implement in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="20" /> The Minister stressed his objective when he suggested that we want to encourage as much development as the environment can reasonably accommodate. In that context there has been questioning about the other forms of pollution which could arise but which are not addressed in the Bill.  I ask the Minister of State to look at that area.  Changing technology brings possible pollution from radiation, to mention just one, but there are other areas such as noise.  If anybody needs examples of how we do not cope with the new circumstances, let us look at industrial legislation which provides that 90 rate dbs is the maximum allowable in industry and workers must be protected by signs posted warning them that within a certain area noise levels are above that and that ear protection must be worn.  It is very emphatic in the legislation, yet, as we have seen recently, one can go into a disco and encounter at least double the accepted level.  It is important to stress that measuring dbs is not simply a straightforward calculation, one and one making two and the noise just double at the higher figure.  There is a multiplying factor and we have seen that people can be rendered deaf in a short time in disco circumstances, and there is no legislation to cover that.  That is proof that we can legislate for one area and possibly skip others.</P>
    <P>To come back to the Bill, in that regard let me say that Cork county area is the centre for the pharmaceutical and chemical industry generally and we are aware of the possible hazards of pollution. That is why I have mentioned the credentials of planners.  I believe they have the expertise to deal with planning applications and where there is any weakness they are quite happy to employ people who have any extra knowledge that may be needed.  I ask that the Bill be extended to cover certain matters because I do not support the kind of activity I saw in my area last week where an industry was working within the legislation with a local authority licence and observing all the restrictions placed on it, while a group were committing an act of piracy against that company, trying to <Col N="21" /> hold up their production and generally be as awkward as possible.  Once we bring in legislation and give planning permission etc. that is the end of it.  There are bodies to monitor and to ensure that industry is staying within the parameters set for it.  From that point of view it is very easy to be overcritical if one is in a very nice, safe, secure, well paid position.</P>
    <P>We must also look at the attitude of unemployed persons in this regard.  They might be much more willing to compromise in regard to pollution controls because of their circumstances.  There is need for balance.  The extremists are not good in any area.  There is a need to protect the genuine investor, developer and industrialist and there is a need to protect jobs.  It is not a case of selling our soul or anything like that.  I am speaking as a representative from an area which, as I have said, is the centre for pharmaceutical and chemical processing and I am aware of possible dangers, but I am also aware of the massive unemployment in the country.  I ask for public acceptance of the decisions of the planning authority in that regard.  We are all aware of the need to protect the environment and of potential dangers to that environment. That is why I mention to the Minister of State the point raised by Deputy Farrelly about extending areas for pollution control. Noise and radiation are two obvious instances and others may be mentioned.</P>
    <P>We now have positive legislation for changing the area in regard to artistic buildings and I welcome that.  I am sure the term &ldquo;speculator's charter&rdquo; will be brought up again before the debate concludes. Such phrases are trotted out, but they are no great help.  I say to people who have worries about section 9 or any other portion of the Bill that if they put forward clear cut, specific amendments or raise issues the Minister of State and the Minister will be quite capable of taking them on board and incorporating into the Bill anything that will block the loopholes that have been described.  In my short time here I have tried to bring a little balance to issues where I think there is need to be critical of the Bill and to amend it.  When, on the other hand, <Col N="22" /> I see progressive legislation like this I commend it and, rather than anybody putting up the shutters at this stage and saying emphatically they will vote against it, I hope people will discuss it and that we will come back with a good, solid Bill which is badly needed and long overdue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to this question of land and land speculation and compensation, as a socialist I do not accept at all that land should be used as a commodity, that it should be bought and sold as one buys and sells a car or any other disposable commodity.  That would be true in the case of land used for agricultural purposes, industry, housing, leisure or infrastructure.  That is not to say that land should not be transferred from one community to another or from one person to another or that the use of the land should not be altered depending on the needs of the community, or, as has often been laid at our door, that we oppose the idea that a person should own his own home; that is not the case.  What we are saying is that land is an asset that belongs to the community as a whole and not to any one individual who may own it for the time being because of birth, inheritance or because he or she happens to have access to considerable wealth.</P>
      <P>I argue that no individual or private company has the right to dictate the use of land or to hoard land or to make vast fortunes out of it as a result of the decisions of a democratically elected local authority in relation to what use should be made of it or what services should be provided to it, and that nobody has the right to make fortunes out of land as a result of hoarding it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When a killing is made on land the money made is not conjured out of the air.  It comes from someone else.  In the case of compensation arising from planning applications it comes directly from the taxpayer.  In other cases it may not be so obvious where the money is coming from; but if it is land designated for industrial use the industrialist who buys it must recoup the price he pays for the land, and if it has been inflated by speculation then the products and the workers working <Col N="23" /> in the industry producing those products have to pay the cost of that land.  If it is used for agriculture the products produced by the land have to bear the cost that the farmer paid for the land.  Whatever way one looks at it the killings made by speculators come directly from the pockets of the taxpayers and the consumers, from the pockets of workers, through taxation or other pressures on their wage package.</P>
    <P>I have no sympathy at all with speculators who may be whinging that this Bill is too stringent.  I do not accept that it is.  I consider that it is riddled with loopholes. There are large tracts of land on the north side of Dublin city which are being held by two or three individuals in the hope that it will be rezoned.  If that land is rezoned for housing the people who own it will become millionaires overnight.  It may be that one or two of them are already millionaires.  I regard that as immoral.  I regard that kind of activity as parasitic.  It is robbing the community in their own personal interest.  People have to pay for it through low wages, high taxation, high mortgages etc.  At the end of the day the community pays for the killings made by the speculators.</P>
    <P>I am arguing that every person who holds land is a speculator.  There are people who legitimately buy land because they want to use it for building a factory or building a home and so on.  I am not attempting to paint every person who holds land with the same brush; but it has to be said that this Bill fails to do what it purports to do.  The explanatory memorandum says on page 1 at paragraph 4:</P>
    <P>the most important purpose of the Bill is to clarify and extend the reasons whereby planning authorities may refuse to attach conditions to a planning permission without incurring a liability to compensation.</P>
    <P>The Bill however fails this principal test which it has set for itself.  The Bill does not adequately protect local authorities against claims for compensation.  Land owners who are refused planning permission for zoning reasons will still be <Col N="24" /> able to extract large sums of money from the taxpayers' pocket.  In effect, I regard the Bill as it stands as a sham.  It is phoney legislation.  It purports to curb compensation and fails to do so.</P>
    <P>It has to be said, as other Deputies have already said, that there are some welcome features in the Bill.  The cutting out of compensation where water and sewerage facilities are provided is good. The provision relating to the refusal of planning permission where a development would require services or produce pollution in an area is a useful provision in the Bill.  So, too, is the change which will remove the automatic right to connection to public sewers and make this subject to the consent of the sanitary authority.</P>
    <P>The big, inescapable weakness in this Bill is paragraph 9 in the Third Schedule which excludes from the provisions relating to a development plan any land in ownership prior to 20 October 1988.  This weakness is compounded by the further exclusion of the same land passed on in a family settlement or by inheritance. Other Deputies have referred to this matter but I think it is worth repeating. This means that somebody who owned land prior to 20 October can still claim compensation if they are refused planning permission for the reason that it would materially contravene the objectives of a development plan at the time the developer acquired his interest in the land.  The Irish Planning Institute, in their commentary on the Bill, point out that this leaves a further loophole whereby a compensation claim may be valid even though the development plan may have been subsequently changed.  The Irish Planning Institute goes on to point out that those who stand to benefit from this loophole include not only individual landowners and their families, for generations to come let is be said, but also development companies holding land as part of their long term land banks and limited companies holding land where even if the shareholders change, the entitlement to compensation remains.  The Irish Planning Institute explain how the loophole can be exploited even if the land is being <Col N="25" /> sold; the existing owner can simply apply for planning permission prior to the sale and thereby become eligible for compensation. It would appear that it will be very difficult even to restrict these generous let-outs to the pre-20 October owners since the planning authority would first have to establish the date on which the applicant acquired his interest and would then have to show that the interest in the land did not arise due to inheritance or family settlement.  This Bill therefore, instead of closing the compensation loophole, opens a second and even more generous loophole.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies and parties in this House have said that they oppose the Bill for this reason and I am tempted to say the same thing at this stage.  The Minister, however, said on Second Stage, that he was willing to consider amendments. I propose to wait and see what the Minister says in response to the Second Stage debate, to see whether he has taken on board the points consistently raised by Deputies in this House in relation to loopholes in this Bill.  If he indicates that he intends to introduce his own amendments to close these loopholes, or to accept amendments from this side of the House, we will not oppose the Bill.  I will not delay the debate any further because most of the points I am concerned about have been dealt with by other Members. However, I should like to emphasise that if the Minister does not indicate when closing the debate his intention to close the loopholes in the Bill, The Workers' Party will oppose the passage of Second Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill, as other speakers have said, attempts to tackle a problem that has been with us for many years. Indeed, it is a problem that has caused dissension and controversy, particularly in the last 20 years.  Controversy and debate on this issue has flared up at various times, particularly following well publicised court decisions to award huge sums in compensation to builders and speculators arising out of planning decisions by local authorities or, in more recent times, by An Bord Pleanála.  The <Col N="26" /> debate on this issue has divided along lines of ideology with those of the Left contending that compensation should not be paid to speculators who exploit the system for their own advantage while those on the extreme Right express belief in the absolute right to property and a right to exploit it.  The Left believe that huge sums of money should not be paid from the public purse to speculators while those on the extreme Right hold that it is right to make maximum profits from whatever a person has.  The latter believe that there should not be any restrictions on the right to make money be it by developing land or by using, and abusing in some cases, the planning laws to extract huge sums of money from the public purse.  I have to say that both views are extreme.</P>
      <P>An attempt is being made in the Bill to secure a workable solution, a median between the two opposing and extreme views.  On the one hand our Constitution offers certain guarantees in regard to property rights and property ownership. Most people will agree that such provisions were included because of our history of dispossessions of the 17th and 18th centuries and the landlord and tenant system we had from the 18th century on. During that time tenants had no rights and the landlord was the master with life and death control over his tenants.  The land struggle by Michael Davitt and Charles Stewart Parnell led to an eventual solution but, more particularly, it left a deep commitment on the part of the Irish people to the right to hold on to their land and to use it in whatever way they wished.  That struggle left an indelible mark on the nation and it was reflected in our Constitution.  It was very much in the minds of those who drew up the Constitution.  I contend that the concept of landownership and right over land is one that must be respected and retained.  Being from a rural constituency I can say that there is nothing that causes greater controversy than land and the ownership of it.  I am not talking about ranches because even a very small area of land can cause major problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While recognising the property rights <Col N="27" /> in the Constitution I must point out that the Constitution was conceived as a means of protecting the rights of all citizens, an effort to ensure that the common good was served by the law and the institutions of the State.  Many contend &mdash; I do not agree that this is confined to people on the Left of the political spectrum &mdash; that the common good is not being served by the award of huge sums of money in compensation to speculators. In particular, it is not being served where it can be seen that the original intention of the speculator was simply to secure a court award.  It has happened that speculators have purchased land knowing that they would be unable to use it for building or other purposes and that they would stand a reasonably good chance of receiving compensation as a result of a decision of a planning authority.  I do not think the courts in the past have taken sufficient note of the common good in such cases. With the passage of the Bill I hope that will be rectified.</P>
    <P>In the tradition of the House the Opposition can afford the luxury of adopting one or other extreme in this argument, that compensation should not be paid or that everybody should be compensated, but the Government must be seen to be promoting legislation that is workable, fair and, above all constitutional.  As a relatively new Member I was astounded at the suggestion put forward by Deputy Quinn that the Minister should promote legislation and leave it to the courts to decide its constitutionality.  The function of the House is to promote workable legislation.  Too often in the past we have left the legislative function to our courts. Deputy Quinn's suggestion was outrageous particularly if the Government had been advised that such legislation was unconstitutional.  In my view the Bill is workable, fair and constitutional.  It goes as far as we can to ensure fairness and equity and stays within the bounds of the Constitution.  It should be noted that although Members of the Opposition are doing a lot of huffing and puffing about various aspects of the Bill, in their contributions they are sending out the <Col N="28" /> message that they are satisfied that the Bill is going in the right direction although it may need strengthening in certain areas.  The Minister has conceded that he is prepared to accept any reasonable amendments that are put forward.  I am sure Members will accept that the Bill represents a reasonable effort to deal with this problem.</P>
    <P>Deputy Shatter spoke about various aspects of planning.  In relation to the Bill he used words like &ldquo;might&rdquo; or this section &ldquo;may&rdquo; and suggested a few changes, a few words here and a few words there. He was very vague in his contribution towards improving the Bill.  Basically he was in broad agreement with the Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputy Quinn gave us a learned exposition on the history and difficulties of various Government Ministers in trying to tackle the problem of compensation in Governments of which &mdash; as he said &mdash; he had the honour to be a member.  I took this &mdash; though perhaps he did not mean it to be &mdash; as a backhanded compliment to the Minister because of the fact that this has been around for so long and has not actually come to the House before.  I took it that he was praising the Minister for his courage in preparing and presenting the Bill to the House. Although Deputy Quinn may have some ideological hang-ups about it, as a reasonable and fairminded man I think he sees this as reasonable legislation.  He made a suggestion at one time &mdash; not in the House &mdash; that the legislation should outlaw earlier awards of compensation granted by the courts and that the legislation should be amended to include that. I find it very hard to believe that a Deputy of his experience would be seriously making such a proposal because it would display a very cavalier attitude by this House to our courts and our systems of justice.  I did not hear him repeat it in the House so I presume it was something he said off the top of his head when he was caught at an interview.</P>
    <P>It is remarkable that in Deputy Keating's initial outburst he suddenly appears to believe that he has become an expert in planning and compensation claims.  He devoted a considerable part of his speech <Col N="29" /> decrying the fact that the Bill was not adequate and complaining about the fact that his own party's Bill &mdash; which was entirely different &mdash; was defeated earlier this year.  In the context of what we are discussing today, his party's Bill was totally inadequate and did not even address the major issue of compensation in any meaningful way.  It devoted two sections to planning and compensation and even those two sections were seriously flawed, because they did not address the legal point on which the recent award of £2 million was made against Dublin County Council.  Suddenly Deputy Keating believes he is an expert in planning and compensation and in that case I do not know how his own Bill did not even cover those particular points.</P>
    <P>However, despite those small criticisms by the Opposition parties there is broad agreement that some legislation in the area of compensation and planning is absolutely necessary.  Most people believe it is important to encourage as much development as we possibly can and every Member of this House would wish to ensure that councils and local authorities have as much power as possible to deal with planning matters, whether to allow or prohibit development in the common good.  Most people would also believe that there are cases where a landowner should be compensated for decisions made by a local authority to restrain the free use of his land.  The Bill has been drafted with these three principles in mind and as such it is a step in the right direction.  For that reason it deserves a speedy passage through the House.</P>
    <P>There are one or two points I would like to make in general terms about the Bill and then about planning in general. The Bill is to be welcomed from a technical point of view &mdash; most Deputies have recognised this &mdash; in that it draws together all the laws relating to compensation and planning cases.  We are all aware that this is a highly complicated area with a huge variety of Acts, Schedules and so on.  The fact that we will now have an Act where all the different aspects of compensation are brought <Col N="30" /> together will make things much easier from a technical sense.  On that point, the idea of consolidation in the planning area, as in a number of other areas, should be followed and we should try at this point in time to have a consolidated Planning Act.</P>
    <P>Since the original Act was passed in 1963 &mdash; the amendments followed in 1976 and later years &mdash; there has been a huge number of legal cases and a huge casework file has built up in relation to planning. Now is the time that we should have a serious look at trying to consolidate and set it all out in one single Act.  I am aware from my contacts with local authorities, and the planning staff of local authorities, of the huge volume of legal cases; the variety of Acts, Schedules and so on is a major headache for those in the planning section.  People who should spend a considerable amount of their time out doing field work, in relation to planning and trying to ensure proper planning and development in an area, spend most of their time in an office looking up various Acts and various court cases to ensure that when they do give a decision they will not find themselves in court over compensation claims or otherwise.  I hope this Bill is the first of a number of moves to try to get all the planning laws into one single Act.</P>
    <P>At this point it would be fair to say that the view of planners is that all planning should be channelled into towns and villages. It certainly seems to be the policy that is most often quoted in our county. The concept of controlling physical planning had its origins in the 1934 Planning Act.  That Act was introduced to regulate and control planning for the common good and to ensure that there would be some kind of orderly development.  That was the basis of the original Planning Act; the basis of that in turn was that planning was about people and ensuring that development took place to facilitate individuals and communities.  It was designed to protect the rights and property of people already living in a particular area, but also it was there to facilitate further development as far as possible.  For that reason I am a strong <Col N="31" /> believer that planning should be about people and geared towards protecting their rights and reflecting their interests.</P>
    <P>Deputy Quinn referred to increasing urbanisation in Irish society and the change that has occurred over the past 50 years.  He said that at times it was startling &mdash; and, indeed, it has been &mdash; and probably over the next 20 years the increased urbanisation will accelerate.  The conventional wisdom among planners now is to channel all development into towns and villages.  There are very obvious reasons for this type of a general planning approach because it is much easier and cheaper to provide local authority services such as water and sewerage in towns and villages.  It is also much more economic for Telecom Éireann, An Post and so on to provide services in those built-up areas.  From a local authority point of view there is less need to provide infrastructure, such as roads in rural areas. Also, community facilities are available be they schools, churches, shops, etc. There are very obvious, sound economic reasons for following that general policy.</P>
    <P>In relation to planning being for people, if this policy is pursued to its extreme I wonder what the long-term social effects will be?  There may not be major problems in the near future in, say, five, ten or 15 years, but from then on this policy can have serious social implications for sons and daughters from rural families who are being forced into towns and villages.  One aspect to the social dimension is that in 15 to 20 years time we will have a very elderly rural population, a considerable number of whom will be living on their own.  The question which will arise at that stage is who is going to take care of these elderly people living alone in rural areas.  Questions about the cost of providing institutional care and of providing community services, such as public health nurses, will also arise.  I am not saying that families will abandon their parents but problems will arise particularly if sons and daughters are forced to live some distance away from their parents.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="32" /> Another aspect of the social dimension is that many rural communities are being denuded of their best young people. When we talk about emigration it is stated very often that we are losing our best young people.  Equally, rural communities are being denuded of their best young people, which leads to the breakup of families and community spirit.  This is as a result of pursuing a policy to the extreme, and I emphasise the word &ldquo;extreme&rdquo;.  Another effect of this policy is that huge built-up areas have been created with a consequent increase in crime and vandalism and the loss of identity, which we in Ireland cherish.</P>
    <P>As I said, the effect of depopulation in the countryside can and will have severe, serious and broader economic repercussions in the years ahead.  The famous Mansholt Plan was put forward in Europe 25 years ago but the emphasis is now being put on integrated rural development and this is a signal to us in Ireland that denuding our rural communities is not the answer to our problems.  As I say, I am not condemning the general theory of channelling people into towns and villages but I urge a cautious implementation of this type of approach.  A reasoned and balanced approach should be maintained in the implementation of this policy.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, there are those who would argue against restricting development in rural areas.  They favour a <i>laissezfaire</i> approach and very often cite a person's right to choose where he wants to live or his right to dispose or use his land in whatever way he sees fit.  To adopt this approach, which is at the other extreme, is to abrogate our responsibility towards future generations.  It is very important that a balance be maintained.  I say this because the results of the latter approach I mentioned would be disastrous and if anyone needs any proof of this all he need do is travel the short distance to see what has happened in the portion of County Meath nearest to Dublin.  I suspect that possibly the same is true of the portions of County Wicklow and County Kildare adjacent to Dublin.  During the seventies these areas experienced a population <Col N="33" /> boom as more and more people moved from the Dublin area to live in the countryside and to commute to work from there.  Meath County Council at that time recognised the problems which could result and they attempted to restrict the granting of planning permission for single houses in rural areas and to try to restrict the granting of permission to those living on the land.</P>
    <P>I regret to say that this policy was thwarted by the planning appeals system which was only changed after 1977. About 98 per cent of all appeals against planning refusals during that period in County Meath were upheld.  We are still experiencing the legacy of that era.  In 1984 the county council decided they had to take action.  The services in this area in County Meath were not able to cope with the huge increase in population with the result that there were inadequate water supplies, sewerage facilities and a road network which was crumbling.  The area has been declared overdeveloped even though some would contend that it is underdeveloped in that the services are not able to meet demand.  Strict planning regulations now apply in County Meath.</P>
    <P>The random development of single houses in rural areas has led to problems such as the loss of agricultural land in an unplanned way.  In some cases brought to my attention, planning permission was granted under the old system.  This is not a criticism of the county council for allowing developments along the side of roads with the result that people had no access to the land at the back of those developments.  We have now reached the stage where if there is any further development there will be a potential risk to health because of the danger of pollution in the water table as a result of seepages from septic tanks.</P>
    <P>Another major problem is that rural dwellers expect urban conditions, for example, they expect a water supply, lighting, footpaths and so on to be available out in the middle of the countryside when the money is not there to provide these services.  Some of those who have moved out to live in the countryside &mdash; and let me say that they are exemplary <Col N="34" /> citizens and good members of the community &mdash; do not understand the ways of country life.  They do not appreciate that if one lives in the countryside there are certain drawbacks at certain times of the year, such as having to put up with the smell of silage and other smells which one would not have to put up with in O'Connell Street, although on reflection when one considers the conditions of the past three or four weeks I would think that the smells which one has to put up with in the countryside are lesser evils. That <i>laissez-faire</i> approach to planning is at the other extreme of what I referred to earlier and it cannot be allowed as we have to try to maintain a balance.</P>
    <P>I think all of us welcome the sections of the Bill dealing with trees and woodlands, in particular section 21 which reduces the number of grounds for the granting of compensation where a licence for tree felling is refused or in cases where restrictions are imposed.  A natural follow-on from this would be for the local authorities, in conjunction with the Forestry Division of the Department, to increase the number of tree preservation orders in each county.  At this stage there is also a need for the local authorities and the Department of the Environment to come together with the Forestry Division of the Department to try to produce a workable agreement.  At present if an application for a tree felling licence is received in the Forestry Division of the Department they ask the local authority for their observations.  I presume the Forestry Division take their observations into account and issue whatever licences they believe are required.  I should like to see a little more co-operation in this area between the local authorities and the Forestry Division.  Perhaps the Forestry Division could initially do what I suggested earlier on and provide an inventory of trees and woodlands in each county so that the county councils could follow that up by putting tree preservation orders not on every tree but on every cluster of trees which they regarded as significant.</P>
    <P>My experience with regard to tree felling licences is that the Forestry Division <Col N="35" /> have granted these licences in County Meath and various other areas but I have not noticed any great follow on from that. We often get representations about tree felling licences but once they are granted there seems to be little or no control over the people who have the licences.  There does not seem to be any supervision carried out and I suggest that some structures should be set up so that either the Forestry Division or the local authority would have the power to monitor the terms of the licence.  In the case of a tree felling licence, the Forestry Division should make the conditions of the licence known to the local authority and they should have the power to monitor the tree felling operation.  In addition, the local authority should be paid for this monitoring facility carried out on behalf of the Forestry Division.</P>
    <P>With regard to the requirement in the Bill to replant, I should like that requirement to be strengthened somewhat.  Perhaps this is not necessary but I should like the Minister to address section 21 (b) in Part IV.  Perhaps we could insert a phrase in that section saying that the local authority should have the power to state the species of trees to be replanted.  At present there is only a requirement to replant and it does not state what species of trees must be planted.  I believe it is important that the local authority should have the power to state the species of trees that should be replanted.  If that provision is included in the Bill I hope local authorities will emphasise the necessity to replant native species of trees.  If we continue the way we are going at present I believe that in 20 or 25 years time we will be like the Scandinavian countries which have only coniferous trees and so on.  The Minister took a step in the right direction when he said that there should be a 20 per cent retention of trees in a particular group.  That is a welcome provision.  I am sure some people would not agree with it and believe that it should be more but it is an initial step and it can be looked at again.</P>
    <P>There are a number of brief points I <Col N="36" /> should like to make with regard to planning. I want to make a general comment in relation to complaints by builders.  Generally builders tend to say that the planning system is very slow, they want to spend money, create employment and build beautiful houses and beautiful estates but that they are hampered by red tape and bureaucracy.  They would almost convince you that there should be no restrictions on them or that there should be no planning laws, that they are very responsible people and they would not do anything which would upset anybody. I do not think there is a Deputy or a member of a local authority anywhere who has not at some time or other had complaints about unfinished estates.</P>
    <P>We had debates in this House earlier in the year about this problem and the Minister is compiling a report on the situation. Builders put forward the notion that they are being tied up in red tape but I believe and I have made quite a few representations on behalf of builders and individuals &mdash; that the slowness in the system of planning, whether at local authority level or higher up than that, is generally the fault of the builders themselves.  They put in planning applications which are very general, provide very skimpy information and will try to get away with whatever they can.  It is only then that the local authorities can ask for further information and in many cases even the further information is not sufficient and they have to look for additional information.  I have had representations from builders and I arranged for my local authority to meet with the north-east branch of the Construction Industry Federation.  Two officers would be put at the disposal of the CIF for a half day or full day meeting so that they could explain exactly what is needed in relation to planning applications.  I did this by way of trying to be helpful to builders and their representative bodies. This offer was made six or eight months ago but I am still awaiting a response from them.  Therefore, I take complaints from builders about the slowness of local authorities in dealing with planning applications with a grain of salt.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="37" /> Undoubtedly there will be delays in local authorities and apart from the fact that they do not get adequate information from the builders, the other problem which arises relates to the serious legal situation a local authority are in when a planning application is submitted to them.  Planning is now a quasi-judicial function and, as I said earlier, this is a very complicated function and local authorities have to be very careful every step of the way in processing a planning application.  The delays caused at An Bord Pleanála level should be kept to a minimum but &mdash; and I think Deputy Dennehy referred to this &mdash; the board have to be careful because the threat of compensation and the possibility of a claim is always there if people in An Bord Pleanála do not dot the &ldquo;i&rdquo; or cross the &ldquo;t&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>There is certainly a case to be made in relation to compensation, which is what the Bill is about, and for the Department to meet compensation claims which arise from decisions made by An Bord Pleanála, particularly if a decision they make overturns a local authority decision.  If a local authority make a decision and An Bord Pleanála decide to change that afterwards it is unfair that the local authority can be hit for compensation. I believe local authorities have enough financial problems without having these threats for compensation hanging over their heads.  I should like the Minister to address this matter.</P>
    <P>There are two other aspects in relation to An Bord Pleanála which I think should be mentioned, one of which relates to oral appeals.  At present An Bord Pleanála can spend a considerable time considering planning applications.  There were two major appeals in County Meath during the past two years, each of which went on for two or three days.  People went to a lot of trouble and spent a lot of time and money preparing their cases, submitting them, attending the appeals and getting various experts in to support their cases.  The board then take all this evidence and in time make a decision.  As a result of all their deliberations, they produce two pages, one which gives the <Col N="38" /> decision and the other which gives the reason for it.  That is not adequate.  An Bord Pleanála, particularly after oral appeals where much time and money has been spent by concerned members of the community or local authorities in putting forward a case, should be asked to outline clearly the reasons for the decision as well as the reasons that they give for the individual conditions that they might pose.  The basic underlying reason for granting or refusing an application should be laid out clearly.</P>
    <P>To a certain extent An Bord Pleanála are hamstrung, which probably goes back to the legal situation.  They seem able only to take very strict planning considerations into account when deciding appeals.  While I realise the possible danger in allowing them to take other matters into consideration, the framework is unduly rigid.  An important matter that should be taken into account, going back to the earlier point that I made about planning being about people, is that the views of the local people should be taken into consideration to a greater extent.</P>
    <P>Two recent decisions of An Bord Pleanála in Meath, to which I referred following appeals, give rise to serious concern on my part and that of a number of people in the county.  One decision was in relation to a quarry in a place called Donore not too far from Drogheda. Application was made to have a quarry on a historic site, that of the Battle of the Boyne.  With the exception of Newgrange in the same area, I doubt if you could have any more significant site.  That site is significant for many reasons and probably it will become even more significant in three years' time.  There was very strong local opposition to the development, not only from local people because of the obvious effects of quarrying but also from archaeologists, historians and even Bord Fáilte.  Despite that opposition, the board decided to grant planning permission.  It is a little ironic that the county council, in an area about half a mile either side of the Boyne in what is termed the Boyne Valley Amenity Area, will not allow even a single house to be <Col N="39" /> built because it would spoil the view of the Boyne and yet An Bord Pleanála could give that decision.</P>
    <P>A more recent case, which has been referred to earlier by myself and by Deputy Farrelly, refers to the Radio Tara application which was opposed by the entire community.  It was opposed very reasonably, very democratically.  It was refused by the majority of Meath County Council under a Section 4 motion.  The voting was 21 to 1.  It went to the Planning Appeals Board.  A very strong and reasonable case was made by the people in the area at great expense to themselves. Again, the decision went in favour of the developer.  It causes me great concern that the views and attitudes of people would seem to have been ignored in both of these cases.  I am responsible enough to know that no matter what anybody tries to do now, there will always be somebody objecting on some ground, but there are particular cases, and those were two, in which the views of the local people should have been taken more into account.</P>
    <P>I want to touch very briefly on one or two areas in relation to the planning laws, which perhaps could be included in this Bill.  One refers to the area of agricultural structures.  Quite a number of these are now excluded from the terms of the planning laws.  The reasons for that exclusion would have been fairly obvious in times past, but it is time now to have a look into the matter.  With the present consciousness of pollution threats, practically all agricultural structures should be included under the Planning Acts. Only very minor structures and ones which will clearly not give rise to any form of pollution or effluent should be exempt.  I appreciate that this may cause problems for farm development and financial problems but there are ways and means around such problems.  We can no longer talk of being serious about tackling pollution if we allow exemption from the planning laws to any type of structure or building that would be likely to give rise to pollution.</P>
    <P>In relation to the fees regulations, <Col N="40" /> Statutory Instrument No. 358 of 1984 contains definitions &mdash; and again this appertains to agriculture &mdash; which are very vague.  They should be more clearly expressed, particularly the definition of agriculture.  Under exemptions, the term &ldquo;voluntary organisations&rdquo; should be a little more clearly defined.  I know that it is causing problems.  As somebody who would be involved in many voluntary and community organisations, I would like to see a clear definition in a broader sense rather than a narrower one.  I would not like the definition to become too restrictive. At the moment there are organsations that I feel would, or should, qualify for exemption and do not.</P>
    <P>In the case of refunds in connection with planning applications, the situation is that a planning application is accompanied by a fee and there is no provision at all for a refund if the application is withdrawn.  If it is withdrawn, at whatever stage, a <i>pro rata</i> refund should be allowed by local authorities.  There is some provision, but I understand that most local authorities are reluctant to use the particular article, I think it is No. 11, in this context.</P>
    <P>I wish to make two final points.  Section 4 motions have been mentioned here by a number of speakers and one or two have condemned their use.  I do not mind any Member of this House, whether he be a member of a local authority or not, condemning the abuse of Section 4 motions in relation to planning, but I would have strong objections to people condemning their use.  I feel strongly that Section 4 motions should not be abused, but I have equally strong views that Section 4 motions should not be interfered with in any way, in relation to planning or anything else.  At present, enough decisions are being made by faceless civil servants, by public servants who are not answerable to the public, who are answerable basically to nobody except themselves.  I will resist and fight any attempt to interfere with the rights of public representatives to reflect the views of the electorate because it is the one section that gives councillors powers to override the decision of a paid public <Col N="41" /> official who is answerable to nobody.  It should not be interfered with, if anything it should be strengthened.  I condemn the abuse of Section 4 motions but I would not be in favour &mdash; as some Deputies have advocated &mdash; of the removal of that power from county councils.</P>
    <P>I am not sure if this is the proper Bill to deal with unauthorised development. Some people are riding roughshod over our planning laws and are involved in unauthorised development.  They knock buildings and erect new structures without applying for planning permission. When this is brought to their attention, by way of an enforcement notice or something else, they are all apologies and apply for retention of the building.  They put the gun to the heads of local authorities by saying that the building is there and that they might as well grant planning permission.  The law should be amended so that a person could be brought to court and fined for unauthorised development. The fact that he is applying for planning permission should have no bearing on the matter because if a person flouts the law he should be made to suffer for it.</P>
    <P>I may have strayed a little from the central theme of the Bill but I am not alone in that.  As I said at the outset, while this Bill may not answer all our problems in relation to planning and compensation it certainly goes a long way towards achieving it and deserves the support of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened with great interest to the last speaker and, from his dissertation, I assume that the problems affecting Meath County Council and their functional area probably similarly affect County Kildare and County Offaly.  I am glad that the Minister of State is here to get first hand knowledge of the problems we face.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can only give the Bill a half welcome because it is only half a Bill.  The whole purpose of its introduction was to eliminate the abuses where, through greed, selfishness or avarice, people in the past sought to use the loophole in the Act to get extraordinary compensation in <Col N="42" /> respect of what were otherwise legitimately refused planning permissions and, as a result, brought the Planning Act into disrepute.</P>
    <P>If the purpose of the Bill is to eliminate abuse and the burden that such compensations placed on a couple of local authorities, obviously the inclusion of &ldquo;20th October&rdquo; completely undermines and negatives the purpose of the introduction of the Bill in the first place because, as far as I am aware, the greatest majority of contentious cases &mdash; and which are likely to be contentious for the next four or five or maybe ten years &mdash; are those where the property has been owned or held in trust for the last ten years.  I refer to the kind of cases which Deputy De Rossa mentioned a few moments ago.  The Bill will not eliminate those abuses.  When you consider that quite an amount of land has been zoned in various towns and villages &mdash; and adjacent to them &mdash; as potential development land but has not yet been developed because of lack of services, it is obvious that it opens up the whole question again and turns the Bill into a sham.  I ask the Minister of State, if possible, to use his influence with his colleague to introduce &mdash; or to be allowed introduce &mdash; amendments which would ensure that the Bill will be effective.</P>
    <P>Local authorities adjacent to the capital city and those within County Dublin have had ample experience of going into court to defend their case in relation to the kind of problem envisaged in the Bill. In a couple of cases a very high price was paid.  Fortunately, so far, in the local authority which I represent, Kildare County Council, we have not had that experience.  We have had battles and jousts but, in almost all cases, the local authority emerged victorious.  How long can that continue?  The inclusion of the clause &ldquo;20th October&rdquo; is a signal to those people who are waiting and hoping that they may be able to secure compensation. This olive branch has been extended to them, it gives them another loophole to go through the system again to make a killing.  It is absolutely disgraceful and <Col N="43" /> brings the whole purpose for the introduction of the Bill into dispute.  It will not resolve the problem it purports to resolve.  The phrase &ldquo;20th October&rdquo; will be quoted again and again and there will be a series of cases where it will be alleged that family settlements were made or legal arrangements entered into prior to 20 October which would allow a developer to make a case that he owned this land.</P>
    <P>If a person or developer is seeking compensation in respect of land which he purchased or acquired after 20 October, what logical case can be made by the planning authorities or by An Bord Pleanála if this case is refused?  The person making the claim will be able to point to someone who owned property two or three days earlier, two or three hours earlier or even one hour earlier, and ask why he cannot get the same kind of compensation. I do not agree with the point of view, but in theory he can make such a legitimate claim.</P>
    <P>If the Minister is serious about addressing the problem, surely the obvious thing was to make it applicable to all development? Forget about 20 October.  I know of a number of cases that have received public attention whereby the inclusion of 20 October is going to be a lifeline.  The repeated assertions by the local authority or by An Bord Pleanála that a particular development is not acceptable for one reason or another, by virtue of prematurity or lack of services, will not be accepted by the developer.  He can see this clause in the Act as a beacon, like a lighthouse in a fog, on which he can home in and be able to quote in subsequent court cases.  I would have to seriously ask the Minister to plead with his colleague to try to have that provision looked at again.  It will serve no useful purpose but it will bring the whole matter into disrepute.  After looking at the Bill a couple of times, it is doubtful as to whether it is even half a Bill.</P>
    <P>Another matter I want to refer to in relation to planning laws and legislation &mdash; those of us who are members of local authorities, as the Minister of State has <Col N="44" /> been, will know this &mdash; is the obvious need to pay great care and attention to every line of every section in minute detail.  Because of the nature of the business, there are and there will be people who can afford to call on the sophisticated and expensive expertise that is available in such cases in order to work their way around the system and the various sections, paragraphs and sentences in the Planning Act.  The history of planning, of which we are all aware as members of local authorities, must have thought us that much.</P>
    <P>The Bill is good in the sense that it gives us an opportunity to bring up matters which have been brought to our attention time and again, to reiterate them and concentrate somebody's mind on what is happening on the ground.  I have said on countless occasions in the past that since I became a Member of this House, had the good fortune to be able to take part in the passing of legislation and see how it is operated, I have seen that very often by the time legislation percolates right down to the people whom it ultimately affects it has not always worked in the letter and the spirit in which it was intended.  That is unfortunate but that is the way the system works.  It underlines the importance of carefully studying the individual lines and phrases of an Act.</P>
    <P>I mentioned earlier, and I have no hesitation in saying again, that this Bill was introduced because in a number of cases extraordinary and disgraceful compensation had to be paid for no obvious reasons that we could see, even as members of local authorities.  I do not think the Bill will solve that problem.  It probably would not have been necessary to introduce it in the first place had it not been for greed.  People get an inch and they want a mile.  The original Act was introduced in order to ensure that fair play existed, for example where some individual who made a legitimate planning application, maybe someone who wanted to extend his property &mdash; I am not talking about a large scale development &mdash; was refused.  Perhaps due to a death in the family a person wanted to <Col N="45" /> sell part of a garden site or a site that was on the fringes of a development area but was refused and that person may have felt it was his constitutional right to get compensation.  If the Planning Acts had been left alone and if there had not been close scrutiny by people who wanted to make a killing it would have been quite all right.  People who have a genuine case should always be catered for but those are the people who will be affected most by this legislation and there is nothing we can do about that.  Unfortunately, the public good is not always, if ever, recognised by those who want to make a financial killing.</P>
    <P>The reason I mention that type of case is that I am sure that, not so much in the country areas but certainly in cities and towns, where a road reservation line is laid &mdash; it could be there for ten, 12 or 14 years &mdash; people experiencing hardship have been unable to dispose of their property or to get anyone to buy it simply because nobody wants to buy property that has a line running across the garden. As a result those people have had to live in penury for years.  Those are isolated cases but the fact that they are isolated does not mean they are not genuine. Because they are isolated it often means that nothing will be done for them.  Planners readily admit that such cases exist and that the planning laws have to be used in order to protect reservation lines and so on.  Little is done by way of compensating people who find themselves in those circumstances.  I can think of quite a number of such genuine cases, not in my own constituency but in this capital city.  I am not talking about large scale developments but about individual cases.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to a point that was made by Deputy Dempsey, that is the whole question of discussion as to what should prevail in terms of the type of planning and development that is taking place at present.  Modern planners believe strongly in the theory that all development should take place in so far as possible in urban areas, thereby making the provision of services more economical. On the other hand, sociologists decry that idea on the basis that by crushing people <Col N="46" /> into box-like houses, living close to their neighbours and having comparatively little access to open space is wrong.  In terms of the quality of life I would have to agree with the sociologists.  It is unfortunate that we do not always get the balance right.  It is true to say that it is more economical to provide services in an urban community.  It is much more efficient to have everybody, as it were, in a conurbation whereby there will be no urban sprawl or ribbon developments.  It is also true to say that from the point of view of access to services of such communities it is much more efficient and economical for those providing the services and those to whom the services are to be provided.  Having said that, there always has been a tradition of rural community life and that is in danger of being overlooked.</P>
    <P>I am not for one moment suggesting extensive or intensive development in rural areas.  Generally there is incorporated in most county development plans a provision whereby, development within reason can take place in rural areas.  It goes wrong when those who go to live in rural areas expect the kind of service normally provided for an urban community.  It cannot work and it would be totally uneconomic to provide such services.  A typical example is that of a person who is fortunate, or unfortunate, to receive planning permission &mdash; perhaps a relative of a landowner or some such person &mdash; in a rural area having, perhaps, lived in a town or city all their lives.  Such people may want to get into the countryside, have privacy and so on, all of which is to be commended.  They may decide that the drain which has been there for the past 400 years, the water course needs to be piped.  No longer do we have drains running along the main streets of our towns and cities.  Such people may approach their local public representative, local authority officials and engineers, advancing all the good reasons for that drain being piped which when done may lead to a flooding problem. As we all know, the whole purpose of having water courses is to have drainage. Indeed, in agricultural or open space <Col N="47" /> areas the best way of achieving that is through open drainage.  That is the only way it was ever meant to be done; otherwise it does not work efficiently.  One can pipe drains as often as one likes but it will not have the same effect.  It will be effective for the conveyance of water from one area to another but not from the point of view of absorbing the water which naturally converges on an area. There may also be demands for public lighting.  If we were to be expected to provide public lighting all over rural communities, outside every house in such areas, we might as well forget about it because we could not even attempt to pay for it.</P>
    <P>Then there may be the odd case where it is taken a step further when, perhaps in some rural area, somebody decides he would like a footpath laid down.  At that stage we have gone from the sublime to the ridiculous.  There has to be a demarcation line drawn up.  In the granting of planning permissions in rural areas one thing that must be kept to the fore at all times is the realisation that somebody going to live in a rural area cannot expect or demand the types of services normally associated with an urban area.</P>
    <P>I read Frank McDonald's articles in <i>The Irish Times</i> from time to time, his dissertations on planning and development generally.  I do not agree with many of the things he says.  Nonetheless I would have to agree with many of the sentiments he expresses about our capital city.  There are so many examples of absolutely blatant planning deviations, for want of a better description, within this city and many others.  They are abominations to the eye which apparently did not receive a great deal of attention at the time they were planned or commenced. Whether they received permission before, during or after some such development remains to be seen or may be in question.</P>
    <P>I was reminded of an example some time ago of an American being brought on a tour of the capital city by a relative. They happened to travel down along the <Col N="48" /> quays.  The American looked at the Central Bank building against the skyline and remarked that it would be a wonderful building if it were roofed.  That is a typical example of the type of architecture to which there is no rhyme or reason.  That is what is seen by visitors when they travel around this city.  Of course they see many derelict sites as well.  Here I am not blaming the public representatives at local or national levels but somebody somewhere should begin to take note of some of the planning atrocities or monstrosities which adorn the horizon.  I could cite countless instances of architecturally and aesthetically acceptable buildings having been demolished to be replaced by absolute monstrosities.  I am sure other Members could cite similar examples.</P>
    <P>It appears to me that Frank McDonald appears to have something of a blind spot once he leaves Newlands' Cross, Clondalkin, and travels down the country. The impression given is that he goes along with the general theory I mentioned in relation to planning, that it should take place in urban areas only, but that nothing should take place in rural areas. That is to go to the other extreme which is unacceptable.  People have the right to have a good standard of housing in rural areas as well.  They have absolutely every right to the same quality of life in their households and communities as anybody else in the country.  The general theory that houses in rural areas should consist of two gables, a hip roof, four walls, a door back and front, perhaps four windows to the front and three to the back, went out with the dark ages.  People are entitled to indulge in some little bit of architectural flair other than the basic design some people and many planners regard &mdash; and I am not now referring to Frank McDonald &mdash; as the norm or acceptable in a rural area.  That is not necessarily the case.  When I mention architectural flair I am not talking about architectural madness; I am talking about something within reason which blends aesthetically with other buildings in an area, something that is visually acceptable and does not cause offence to anybody, at the same time allowing a person <Col N="49" /> who may live in that house, or its designer, some feeling of its being part of them.  That is the way is should be.</P>
    <P>I do not go along with the idea of absolute architectural madness when some architect may have flicked over the pages of a book of plans from colonial days and decided to site some building on the top of a hill overlooking a valley, hopefully within sight of a river and possibly the sea as well, so that he or she can design something which will stand out literally and metaphorically on the horizon, to such an extent that anybody coming within ten miles of it for the next 50 years &mdash; unless trees are grown there very quickly &mdash; will say: &ldquo;In heaven's name, how did that ever get there?&rdquo;  That is a type of architectural madness which should not be encouraged.</P>
    <P>I might revert to what I said at the outset, that a balance has to be struck. Generally speaking, it is my belief that planners are reasonable people.  There will be the odd extreme examples of planners when determining planning applications; the odd one who will have a hangup about some particular aspect, some type of house or development, or who, perhaps, is just experiencing a bad day. Generally speaking I have found them to be reasonable, fair and prepared to listen to reasonable suggestions put to them. Likewise, architects are fairly consistent; it is on occasion only that they go off at a tangent.  However, the problem is occasioned by the fact that the remainder of the community has to live with it thereafter. We must remember that, once planning permission has been granted and a building put in place, we cannot change it, we cannot erase it as can the planner on a map.  It will be there for future generations to decide whether the people who presided over the planning decision were of sound mind.</P>
    <P>The question of how planning has evolved has often been referred to in this House.  Quite often major developments that have taken place, took place because somebody decided that it would be a good idea to lay a water main or a sewer along a certain road with access <Col N="50" /> to other services.  As a result planning permission was applied for and granted. Because of that an urban community would build up around a service.  Surely that is the worst possible way to plan for development.  An overall government body should decide as to where it is advisable for development to take place having regard to the provision of and access to services.  Development should take place where it is needed and for no other reason, and then zoning would follow for the right reasons.  We would meet the needs of the community rather than the need of an individual who happened to avail of an opportunity to buy up a few hundred acres of land in order to be in the right place at the right time.</P>
    <P>I totally agree with Deputy De Rossa in the points he made.  I fully support the right to own land and property and to sell it.  The problem arises when an unfortunate person must dispose of property for financial or family reasons to a person who can hold on to it until he can make a killing.  I object to that sort of speculation most strenuously.  This has happened on countless occasions.  If this Bill is passed as it stands hopefully in 20 years time it will deal with that sort of abuse but it will not eliminate those abuses now because of the 20 October cut off date.  However, that is something we will deal with on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The Government in their wisdom abolished the RDOs which dealt with planning development.  Then it transpired that they had to reintroduce a whole system of new regions in order to accommodate the European inspired regional development plans.  It was a retrograde step to abolish the RDOs.  They had made quite a considerable input in relation to planning and development requirements, they had amassed quite an amount of information on computer and the local authorities involved could co-ordinate their views as to what was required.  All that work was scrapped because the Minister abolished the RDOs.  The Minister also said that he would abolish potholes but he has not got around to that yet. Because of the depth of some of the potholes in the roads at the moment the <Col N="51" /> Minister could almost step in to one and not be seen over the top.</P>
    <P>It was a retrograde step to abolish the RDOs and to then have to introduce a new scheme.  At this stage we do not know if there will be any co-ordination or reference to the information previously gleaned by the RDOs in relation to what is required.  Planning and development should be governed by a general agency either at regional level or at national level in such a way as to bring about an equitable balance in the community.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dempsey mentioned the role of the councillors and the use of section 4 orders.  I agree that there should always be a role for councillors to play whether it be by way of veto in the processing of a section 4 order or whether it be in relation to implementing the power of section 4 to impress on the system that a certain person was being unfairly treated or that a community was being unfairly treated.  Many councillors do not seem to understand the important role they have to play.  The councillors in a local authority are the planning authority. They can chart a course and impress it on the staff and the manager in the council.  Of course, they must be prepared to stand over their decision afterwards.  If something goes wrong they cannot hide and say it was the officials who are to blame.  We should all take our responsibilities seriously in that matter, and where necessary we should be prepared to put our imprimatur in a real way on the development that takes place within our respective local authorities.</P>
    <P>There have been unfortunate abuses of section 4 orders, some worse than others. I am glad that so far in County Kildare we have never yet had to use a section 4 order and hopefully we never will.  I hope that the planners will never become so complacent as to think we will never use it and on the other hand I hope our councillors will never do something irresponsible by way of a section 4 order which would trigger off a lot of other irresponsible actions.</P>
    <P>The problem with section 4 is that a genuine case can often be made and there <Col N="52" /> can be a hundred and one good reasons why a permission should be granted but political life being what it is, at what stage do we determine what is a valid application?  We could have a situation where the councillors would have to overlook every single application.  That simply is not on.  It could not and it should not be.  There have been abuses of section 4, but I would hope that public representatives would be responsible enough not to go down that road indefinitely because if they do, the power of section 4 will be taken from them.  Then another problem will arise.</P>
    <P>Another thing which worries me slightly is that there is a tendency in some local authorities for planners, in virtually all cases, to refuse a planning permission if there is an objector.  That has become more prevalent in recent years.  It may arise from claims for compensation or simply from a fear on the part of the local authorities of being involved, being too close to the action, knowing too many of the personalities involved, and not wishing to get involved or to make a decision, and so they decide to refuse rather than do anything wrong and pass the decision over to somebody else.  That is fair enough, but it is not acceptable and it is not what the Planning Act meant to do. The Planning Act allowed a planning permission to be evaluated on merit and to have regard to objectors, but it was never understood that the existence of an objector automatically validated the objection.  It never did, it never should and it never will.</P>
    <P>I have had experience of a couple of cases &mdash; and I am sure other public representatives have dealt with similar cases &mdash; where an individual looking for an extension to a house, building a wall out in the country or something like that, nothing dramatic like building a fly over and where suddenly an objector came forward.  Immediately the planning authorities adopted a defensive position.  The chances are that such an application will be refused and the board will uphold the decision of the council in about seven cases out of ten.</P>
    <P>A case comes to mind where a person <Col N="53" /> applied for planning permission to provide a childcare or baby minding service in a housing estate.  This is a service for housewives, a place where a mother can leave the baby while she is going to work, by virtue of necessity, and she wants to leave the baby with somebody nearby, somebody in the neighbourhood.  There are countless such cases throughout the country where a woman whose husband is unemployed, or a widow, can eke out an existence by looking after a few children in the mornings or afternoons.  I came across such as case and somebody decided to object.  As soon as the objection was mooted, fear could be seen in the eyes of the planners and they backed off, they ran for cover and the application was subsequently refused by An Bord Pleanála.</P>
    <P>Why not refuse all such applications? Why not tell everybody they cannot provide this service in a residential area, despite the fact that it is most acceptable, useful and helpful and that it is provided in residential areas throughout the country? That is why I said the existence of an objector does not always mean that the objection is valid or that it should be taken as a guideline for either granting or refusing the planning permission.  That may be an isolated case, but I would not like that trend to become the norm.</P>
    <P>This would not be bringing the planning laws within the ambit of what I would regard as fair play.  Consequently I hope the planners do not take the easy way out.  I am not suggesting they should grant permission in all cases, and I accept that in this case there were traffic reasons, but there must be traffic reasons in similar cases.  All movement of people generates traffic of one kind or another.  Therefore, it is not right to say that we will allow this development at A, B and C but not at D and E.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dempsey referred to the damage done to roads as a result of rural development.  I disagree with him.  The roads are not damaged by rural development but because nobody looks after them or has money to spend on them.  The local authorities have scarcely touched main and county roads for the past ten <Col N="54" /> or 15 years and in the last five, three, two or even one year, virtually nothing has been done in terms of what is needed for today's traffic on our main and county roads.  We are dealing with a situation which is completely different from that which existed ten or 15 years ago and we are not providing enough money to solve the problem that now exists, and will continue to exist, unless something is done about it.</P>
    <P>The future life of Kildare County Council hangs in the balance because we have failed to adopt a book of estimates. We failed to adopt a book of estimates because our main and county roads are neglected to such an extent that school buses no longer collect children, milk deliveries and collections are being stopped and other utility services are being cut off simply as a result of the roads being impassable.  Only last week a schoolgirl who had to cycle to school because the school bus was no longer prepared to travel the road had an accident and ended up in hospital.  The accident was caused by the condition of the road.  Something will be done about this only when a serious successful claim is made against the council.</P>
    <P>I do not want to abuse the privileges of this House by digressing, but the planning and development question was raised by Deputy Dempsey.  This is the responsibility of the local authorities, through the Department of the Environment who are providing virtually all the funds for the local authorities to ensure that the roads are kept in a reasonable condition.</P>
    <P>I do not accept the excuse trotted out by planners that they refuse applications on the basis that they would be an unnecessary charge on the local authorities now or at some stage in the future, or that it would mean extra traffic on the roads.  A planning application should be dealt with on its planning merits. Whether they are in a rural or urban area, roads are a requirement, not a luxury. There are services which can be identified as being rural and or urban, but roads are universal.  They either exist or they do not exist.</P>
    <P>The last point I want to make relates <Col N="55" /> to the question of oral hearings.  Deputy Dempsey mentioned the long period that elapses prior to a decision being made following an oral hearing.  I would be quite happy with that provided it could be shown afterwards that careful consideration had been given and that we could stand over the decision.  I would be far happier to see an applicant or an appellant having the opportunity to stand before an inspector to state his case with questions and supplementaries asked on both sides to ensure that the case is heard fairly on the basis of all the information being available, than to simply have the application referred to the board and getting a reply that, in seven cases out of ten, sustains the decision already taken by the local authority.  I fully realise that we cannot have a situation whereby everybody who makes an application to have a bathroom or bedroom extended would get an oral hearing, but I know from experience that there are circumstances where decisions are more acceptable when there is an oral hearing, no matter who the decision favours.</P>
    <P>I would like to thank the Chair for allowing me to ramble on for so long. Planning matters affect every member of a local authority.  When we get an opportunity to talk about these matters in the House we should do so and hopefully our thoughts, meandering though they may be at times, will trigger off mechanisms in some quarter which will alert people to some of the problems we have to deal with.  I would ask the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, who is present, to use his influence with his colleagues to try to bring about an amendment to this Bill which will deal with the whole question of 20 October, because if this is not dealt with now the purpose of the Bill will be negatived. I implore the Minister to allow amendments to be introduced on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I found the rambling of Deputy Durkan very interesting.  It is significant that many of the contributors to this debate are, like myself, members of <Col N="56" /> local authorities.  They have a lot to say and a great deal of personal experience in the whole local authority process.  I hope that as a result of this debate we will have an improved Bill.</P>
      <P>The Minister is to be congratulated on introducing this Bill to the House.  Over the last ten years or so the public, planning experts and politicians have been demanding legislation to deal with the issue of planning compensation.  It has to be said &mdash; and I do not like to repeat political points &mdash; that members of the last Coalition Government had been most vocal on the need for legislation prior to taking up office, but sadly they were remarkably quiet over their four years in Government and no legislation was introduced.</P>
      <P>It was always going to be difficult to introduce a Bill that was well balanced as between the common good and the constitutional property rights of the individual.  This has always been the dilemma and that is why it has been so difficult.  The Minister has faced up to this difficulty and we have a very valuable Bill before the House.</P>
      <P>The Minister has recognised that the Town and Regional Planning Act, 1934 is outdated and inadequate to cope with the needs for the proper, orderly growth of our cities and towns and the need to preserve so many valuable amenities in the country.  The Minister has also recognised that local authorities have found themselves in most vulnerable circumstances in the face of opportunistic speculators seeking massive compensation, particularly in the greater Dublin area.  He is arming them with new controls and powers in this Bill.  The public interest is being well served by this Bill.  Planning authorities will be able to prevent undesirable developments and this is well overdue.  In the County Dublin area, with which I am very familiar, having been a member of Dublin County Council for the last nine years, I must admit that damage has been done to our orderly planning process.  Mistakes have been made.  It is time for us to get our act together and we will be able to do so with this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="57" /> The Bill will give new protective powers to our local authorities.  We know all too well how in the past speculators have managed legally to take advantage of loopholes, but the Bill has updated and, in some cases, rewritten and consolidated all of the laws on planning compensation in one document.  It has been done as clearly and as simply as possible so that it is not cumbersome with legal jargon.  This is something that the 1963 Act failed to do.  Those of us who are involved in local government are very aware of the need to protect the individual where restraint is being placed on his or her property rights.  This is a very important element in this legislation.  The individual who finds, for example, that the routing of a motorway through his or her front garden has been planned must be compensated and this legislation recognises that fact.  It recognises equally the public demand and the urgent need for our planning laws to be tightened up so that local authorities and the taxpayer will be protected against huge compensation claims.</P>
    <P>Section 13 and the Third Schedule contain some important new provisions. The fact that the local authority can refuse planning permission without fear of a compensation claim where water and sewerage services are inadequate is a positive development, as is the reference to the protective clause that the services could be required for other prospective developments.  A submission which I received from my own local authority, Dublin County Council, in relation to this section of the Bill should be seriously considered by the Minister.  They have suggested that in paragraph 1 the word &ldquo;premature&rdquo; and the words &ldquo;a period within which the constraints involved may reasonably be expected to cease&rdquo; should be omitted.  The effect would be to omit the concept of prematurity which if retained is likely to give rise to further litigation in the future.  It should be sufficient to establish that there is an existing deficiency in services and the word &ldquo;premature&rdquo; could be retained in paragraphs 2 and 3.</P>
    <P>I believe that some improvements can <Col N="58" /> be made to this section.  I welcome the fact that the Minister has proposed that conditions may be attached to a planning permission without compensation in relation to the preservation of buildings of artistic, architectural or historical interest.  I am convinced that there should be a paragraph in the Third Schedule to provide that a refusal of permission for the reason that the development would prejudice the preservation of historical buildings, or would prejudice the preservation of plaster work, staircases, woodwork or other fixtures or features of artistic, architectural or historical interest forming part of the interior structures, should not attract compensation.  I am sure the Minister of State at the Department of Finance would be interested in that feature.  It is provided in the Bill that the attachment of conditions relating to such matters is non-compensatable and it would be reasonable that refusal of permission for the same reasons should also be non-compensatable.</P>
    <P>This Government have rightly placed strong emphasis on the development of our tourism industry.  A key feature of that industry is the growing interest of our tourists in our historic castles and other buildings.  Great progress has been made recently, in protecting and refurbishing many of our castles and national monuments and I give credit to the Minister of State who is present with us in that regard.  On a recent visit to County Clare I saw at first hand the tremendous improvements in that area.  Unfortunately, many of our national monuments are still being spoiled by unscrupulous developers, and the planning laws have been inadequate in stopping this sabotage.  This Bill presents us with a unique opportunity to comprehensively protect this aspect of our culture and heritage, this great national asset, and the relatively minor amendments I have proposed will strengthen our hand legally in this regard.  A paragraph should also be added to provide that compensation shall not be payable if a reason for refusal was that the proposed development contravened the provisions <Col N="59" /> of any other enactments, for example, the National Monuments Act.</P>
    <P>This Bill has responded to the urgent need for adequate protection of our woodlands.  Section 21 refers to tree preservation orders.  We have not seen the implementation of many of these orders and the number I have seen do not seem to have been very effective.  Mention has been made of Coolattin and there was another very prominent case regarding tree preservation in the Shankill area of County Dublin only a couple of years ago.  Basically at issue was the power of the local authority to vary as part of a grant of planning permission a tree preservation order covering trees in the locality, and then who or which body really had the power to make sure trees are not felled without proper permission. It seems that the tree preservation orders should not be variable or amendable in the granting of a planning permission unless the specific approval of the elected councillors is agreed.  Secondly, I believe complete control over trees, including felling licences, etc., should be vested in the local authority.  Rather than the Garda issuing a felling licence the county council should consider trees that should be protected or felled, and the Forestry Department are there all the time on the fringes.  It is said too many cooks spoil the broth.  We must put the full responsibility in the hands of only one of these bodies.</P>
    <P>I welcome warmly a number of features in the Bill, particularly the provision in section 14 whereby a planning authority can issue a notice preventing compensation. This is an eminently sensible and practical approach.  It is not all that unusual for a prospective developer to submit a planning application to a local authority for permission for development that may be utterly out of character for the area or vastly excessive in scale.  Such a developer would often be well aware of these factors but he decides to have a go, to chance it, especially as he is aware of just how sensitive planning officials may be about the prospect of having a compensation claim lodged against them. <Col N="60" /> Unfortunately this has been the case and local authorities have been arriving at decisions out of fear.  Dublin County Council have literally had to sit down with developers and do a deal.  It is important in debating this issue that we give them credit for working and living within the system because it has been difficult. This new provision will make such developers think twice before using such a tactic.  It will also strengthen the power of the local authority in regulating the good and orderly planning for the areas rather than leaving all that to the dictates of market forces.  I feel it would ease the potential concerns of local authorities to know they have the facility to offer some alternative type of permission for the lands concerned rather than be simply faced with the prospect of a compensation claim.  This is an important factor which has not been referred to often enough in this debate.  This aspect of the Bill ensures that we will not have a repeat of what took place in the Grange Developments case.  Now the local authority can issue a notice that the land in question should attract an alternative development.  This issue was not adequately addressed by the Progressive Democrats' Bill.  The Minister has responded and is to be commended for doing so.</P>
    <P>The Bill is to be welcomed because it does a number of other things.  First, it rationalises in a more coherent way than heretofore the whole issue of compensation for refusal of planning permission. Compensation has been an issue of serious concern to residents in County Dublin in recent years and I have no doubt that many of the people contributing to this debate will be from that area.  We have seen decisions of Dublin County Council reversed by An Bord Pleanála, decisions which the council had carefully couched in terms that would not allow for a compensation claim.  What happens then?  In a number of cases that have been highly publicised An Bord Pleanála on appeal endorsed the council's decision without using non-compensatable terms.  As a result Dublin County Council and the residents of <Col N="61" /> Dublin county are then faced with a compensation claim for non-grant of planning permission because An Bord Pleanála, the ultimate planning authority, failed to make the decision using non-compensatable reasons.  Dublin county ends up paying the price for An Bord Pleanála's sins.  It is bad enough to have to pay a price for your own sins but to have to pay the price for somebody else's sins is a bit much.  This Bill rationalises the issue of compensation.</P>
    <P>Secondly, an interesting feature the Bill specifically provides for is that an arbitrator can make a nil award.  This is a significant and useful feature which should caution prospective compensation seekers, claimants, that they could, if successful in their claim, end up with a nil award.  This should make them think twice if they set their mind on using some loophole to get in a claim which they would not be morally entitled to.  In other words, throughout the Bill it is being made much more difficult for people who are very expert in this area, particularly in the legal area.</P>
    <P>Another encouraging feature is that which sets a six month limit on the lodging of the compensation claim, though I would prefer to see this significantly reduced.  With all the time involved in an appeals procedure I would have thought anyone would have enough time to be quite clear on his or her compensation claim grounds without having to delay for up to six months after a planning decision has been made.  In Dublin county attempts by the county council to come to a reasonable understanding for an alternative development permission instead of facing claims have foundered because, first, the council did not expressly have the kind of power this section gives them, second, the courts in a couple of cases could not see their way to support the council's approach to have a claim settled in a pragmatic way without the residents of Dublin having to pay up for a claim for compensation, the fault for which lay with An Bord Pleanála, not Dublin County Council, and, third, some developers simply found themselves with <Col N="62" /> an easy way of making money with no outlay on their part.</P>
    <P>It is very timely that we are debating this Bill while the future of a very famous football ground is being decided outside this House by others.  I am talking about the future of Shamrock Rovers' football ground in Milltown.  I am convinced that these grounds must be saved and I have already put my view on record in this House when we debated the Progressive Democrat Bill.  Glenmalure Park has rightly been described as more than a football ground.  It is a meeting place for all social classes on Dublin's south side. There professional people, tradesmen and all others would rub shoulders in the terraces and enjoy a common interest. Again we hear the argument that nothing can be done, that commercial interests will prevail and so the bulldozers must go in, the apartment blocks must go up and as many units as possible built because property values are soaring, especially on the south side and a quick kill can be made.</P>
    <P>There is a difference in this instance. Not all people in the construction industry and the property market are as uncaring and insensitive to the mood of Dublin people with regard to this matter.  I have heard that many in the property and construction business would not touch this property, first, because they understand it is not just a green field but part of Dublin's history and heritage and, secondly, it would be too controversial and might not be in the interests of a company to become involved.  I would like to acknowledge at this stage the moral support given to KRAM, the support group, Keep Rovers at Milltown.  I acknowledge the moral support given by the Minister for Sport and, indeed, the Minister for Education in this case.  Their position on the possibility of lottery assistance is understandable, that such funding could not be provided unless the grounds were in the ownership of the club and the development programme was in place.</P>
    <P>The facts are that John McNamara, the new Chairman and owner of the club, had offered almost £500,000 for the site. He was willing to negotiate upwards, yet <Col N="63" /> his proposal was not entertained.  I read a brief statement from the auctioneer and selling agent, Sherry FitzGerald which I quote: &ldquo;Selling agents Sherry FitzGerald announce this evening that they have successfully sold Glenmalure Park, former home of Shamrock Rovers.&rdquo;  It sounds so much like an epitaph that I believe it should have been placed in a &ldquo;death column&rdquo;.  I refuse to accept that we have lost Shamrock Rovers' football grounds. The new owners of the club have put forward a viable commercial proposal for the future of the club, a sound marketing strategy to bring families on the southside back to the grounds.  The proposal is to establish health and leisure facilities for the local community within the Glenmalure complex to be available throughout the week.  We are all aware of the growth of the health and leisure market within the country, and worldwide, and I am convinced that the proposal to open a club to the community would be a rewarding one financially.  I am convinced that a marketing drive to bring people back to Milltown would work.</P>
    <P>The events at Shamrock Rovers' grounds are very relevant to the debate, as I will point out.  In fact, an element of the Bill deals specifically with cases such as that at Glenmalure.  Under a provision in the Bill persons acquiring lands after 20 October 1988 will have no claim for compensation if they are subsequently refused planning permission on the basis that development would materially contravene an objective of the development plan which related to the land at the time of its acquisition.  It is important to stress that point.  The land I have referred to has been zoned &ldquo;amenity&rdquo;.  I can only presume, and hope, that Dublin Corporation will refuse planning permission. There is a growing awareness that the planning process, and those involved in it, should put people before buildings. The deep and sincere feelings of the people who have devoted so much of their time and energy into saving this famous football ground must be noted by politicians, planners and, in particular, by the business community.  The many <Col N="64" /> supporters who have held all-night vigils outside those grounds deserve our support.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Government to take note of what is happening at Glenmalure Park.  I do not think that valuable amenity has been lost.  When a planning application is lodged with Dublin Corporation the amenity will still not be lost. In fact, the campaign will be starting in earnest.  The Government should monitor developments closely and if all other options fail they should intervene to ensure that this valuable amenity is not wiped off the map.  Future generations will not thank us if we allow that to happen on the 1,000th birthday of the city of Dublin.  As has been said, &ldquo;people look at things and ask, why; Irish people look at things and ask, why not&rdquo;?  Rather than accept that these grounds must go to commercial interests, we must look at every possible means at our disposal to save them.  We must ask ourselves, &ldquo;why not?&rdquo; and follow through on that principle.</P>
    <P>In the debate reference was made to the problems that have arisen in regard to taking charge of estates.  I am aware of a number of cases in County Dublin of serious breaches of the planning laws by developers who refused to finish housing estates properly before moving on to another development.  I accept that there has been a dramatic improvement in the last two years.  Housing developments are smaller and more compact.  The design of estates has improved enormously and we have more cul-de-sac type developments and, thankfully, we no longer have large sprawling estates of hundreds of houses.  The majority of builders comply with the planning laws but there are still a number who do not.  Existing planning legislation does not check the record of the builder.  Each application is looked at separately and I do not think that is correct.  For example, a builder after erecting a number of houses may move on to another development leaving the roads and open spaces in a mess and the residents without street lighting.  The planning legislation does not connect the <Col N="65" /> two developments in any way.  In fact, a builder could trade under a new name.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister to consider linking developments carried out by a builder.  A builder should not be granted planning permission for a new development until he has completed an estate under construction to the satisfaction of the local authority.  In other words, we should give local authorities power to investigate the record of builders. I appreciate that the issue is not directly related to the question of compensation but I should like to ask the Minister to take advantage of this golden opportunity to deal with the problem.</P>
    <P>I should now like to deal with the question of local authority development plans.  Members will be aware that local authorities review their development plans from time to time.  In Dublin the review is carried out approximately every five years.  The full council &mdash; in the case of Dublin council that amounts to 78 members &mdash; meet to decide on the proper zoning for the different parts of the county.  Inevitably, the zoning of land is changed, some from agricultural zoning to residential.  We have all read extensive reports of the proceedings of such meetings. Decisions reached at those meetings have been criticised although in my view most of them were based on sound planning rules.  The demand for houses in County Dublin has grown and we have to deal with the plans for three satellite towns.  I accept that mistakes have been made and one way of ensuring that no more mistakes are made would be to make the members of the council accountable for their own areas.</P>
    <P>Members will be aware that Dublin County Council is divided into three sections, Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown in the south, Belgard in the west and Fingal in the north.  Those areas form the basis for three new councils.  With a membership of 78, which is larger than the Seanad, one can appreciate how difficult it is for the county council to conduct their business.  While I appreciate that there will be huge financial implications involved in the change to three new councils, I appeal to the Minister to establish <Col N="66" /> them as a matter of urgency.  Council members in the three areas could adopt their own development plan.  They know their area and are in touch with the community. If they were responsible for the development plan I have no doubt that they would make the right decisions in regard to zoning objectives.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  It has taken a long time for it to surface and I am pleased that the Minister for the Environment has made an effort to deal with the problems members of local authorities have had to face over the years.  Officials in the planning office have had difficulty trying to cope with existing legislation.  Planning experts and politicians have been calling for this legislation for a long time and I am pleased that the Minister has brought it forward.  I look forward to the day when the legislation is on the Statute Book, because I am convinced it will improve the planning process.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimKemmy" hpid="Mr. Kemmy Mr. Kemmy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kemmy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the debate.  In fact, the House should hold an annual debate on our planning laws to see if we can improve them or limit the abuses of them.  The debate is timely.  Every civilised society has a need for good and orderly planning and we are no different from that general premise.  Indeed, as a society and public representatives we should go further and insist on good planning at all times.  If necessary we should impose good planning on reluctant parties. In recent years we have had planning by default, by fear, by cowardice and under the threat of powerful influential people who were out to exploit loopholes in our planning laws.  They were not doing that in the interest of the common good or good planning but in the interest of greed and profit.  Our cities and towns must, therefore, be protected.  They need or good planning.  In the past we have suffered from bad planning.  Anybody who travels throughout the country will see far too many blots on our landscape, regardless of Deputy Durkan's charitable attitude towards architects and so on. Some architects would do well to leave their drawing boards alone and take up some other pursuit because many of them <Col N="67" /> are not good architects and merely copy developers in other countries.  This does not in any way enhance our environment. Perhaps that has been changing in recent times.  After some of the abuses and excesses in the sixties and seventies we need more originality, more imagination, more initiative in our designs and anybody who disagrees with me should open their eyes when travelling throughout the country and they will see differently.</P>
      <P>Some cities are attempting to undo some of the bad design.  Kilkenny, for instance, has done much to undo the damage of past decades and I applaud that.  There is no reason whatsoever that we cannot have good functional buildings and good design.  It is a myth to say that architects are in the hands of their clients, that they cannot do very much themselves and are more or less prisoners of captives.  There is no reason we cannot have good design, good building, good materials and good workmanship combined in any building.</P>
      <P>We should have seminars and symposia throughout the country, not only for planning officers but for public representatives as well.  We all need to be made aware of what is good planning. While some of us have learned the hard way in local authorities through trial and error, we can always benefit from people in other countries who have done better than us and who have gone through some of the excesses we have gone through and have learned from them.  Through that process we can increase public awareness and public consciousness of what good planning and good building is all about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not in favour of a cranks' charter and we have cranks at loose in our society, some preverse, eccentric nuisances and sometimes journalists who pursue their own ends indefinitely and are not out for the general good.  I am not talking about cranks as in a cranks' charter.  I am talking about raising the level of awareness and consciousness of ordinary people because that is something from which we could all benefit. The community will benefit, our environment will benefit and the character of <Col N="68" /> our buildings and cities will benefit also. We have a long way to go.  Any dispassionate and objective observer travelling throughout our cities and towns will see ruins, derelict buildings, that have been left there for decades.  These ruined buildings disfigure and disgrace our cities and towns and our environment. We have a long way to go in trying to rid our communities of these blots and blights.</P>
    <P>Recently the Minister of State, Deputy Connolly and the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Flynn have spoken a good deal about the need for urban renewal.  As a building craftsman I am all in favour of that.  I know what urban renewal is all about in terms of building programmes.  Unless we have people to flesh out &mdash; in every sense of the word &mdash; urban renewal those programmes will be no good.  We must have co-ordinated integrated policies of urban renewal.  Private development of shops, of commercial development, of industries, are all very welcome in our cities and towns but we must have housing as well, especially housing for old people.  Too often in the past, in many of our larger urban areas, we have banished old people to bungalows far outside our cities, to the hinterland of those cities.  In those areas they are prey to vandalism and crime. Life is difficult enough for them at any time but it is made more difficult by sending them to these outer areas.  We have a good case to make for urban renewal programmes for housing development &mdash; bungalows and housing units &mdash; in our centre city areas.  We have not done enough of that.  The phrase &ldquo;urban renewal&rdquo; is meaningless unless we can get people back to live in the centre city areas.</P>
    <P>As somebody who has come up through the ranks in local government I can say that much of our compulsory purchase order legislation is far too convoluted and complicated, that it is wasteful and time-consuming.  Some people would say it is democratic but it is shameful and wrong that people who have property lying dormant in our centre city areas can hold out for payment much higher <Col N="69" /> than the going rate if a local authority attempt to buy the property, by way of a compulsory purchase order.  I am in favour of paying compensation to people. I would not be brutal or undemocratic in my attitude to that but it is wrong that some person because of greed or profit motive, because they are stubborn, would hold up the development of a city, town or street because they are anxious to enrich themselves.  That happens often and it is most unfair.</P>
    <P>We hear much in this House and in our community at large about the rights of property owners but we do not hear much about responsibility for property and the common good.  There is no way that the interests of one individual, in those circumstances, should predominate over the interests of a community, particularly at present.  We must have changes in our legislation to take account of that and to give more authority to the Government or local authorities to acquire property in order to develop our cities and towns and improve the character of them and of the environment.  A small bit of encouragement is useful.  How many times have we seen in an area that was run down somebody new coming in, giving one or two buildings a face lift or rebuilding them and then other people following suit.  The old Irish phrase, mol an óige agus tiocfaidh sí, is important to keep in mind in this context.  Some encouragement can bring along other developments in the wake of initial starts even if this start is made by the local authority or by an individual.  A headline is often very useful in a city or town to lift the whole environment.</P>
    <P>We have had too much ribbon building in the past.  That has been dealt with to some degree by Deputy Durkan.  The concept of having a country estate appeals to many people.  I do not mind rural people living in the country.  That is where they came from and they are entitled to live there.  Many people have aims and ambitions to live in the country, almost like a feudal law, reversing the trend we had in the past.  I have no ambition to have any kind of country estate, I am very happy living in a city. <Col N="70" /> Many people who go to the country go for the wrong reasons.  This ribbon building disgraces and disfigures our environment and our countryside.  It also spreads our resources too thinly on the ground. People have to get used to the habit of living together in urban environments. There is nothing wrong with that in a country that is under-populated, not over-populated.  There is no reason with a little commonsense and a little give and take that people cannot live together in urban environments.  The concept of going out to the country from the city and having your own house is a kind of grandiose nineteenth century concept.  I do not think it has any place in our modern society and the sooner we in this House disabuse people's minds the better.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately we are going through a recession in the building industry.  The industry is in the doldrums.  This has led to many social ills.  Building workers, tradesmen, apprentices, carpenters, masons, plasterers, plumbers, painters and general operatives have gone to Britain, to America &mdash; illegally &mdash; to Australia and New Zealand and some have gone to Germany and the Continent. I know many of them personally because they will be coming home at Christmas to see their families and friends.  As a building tradesman it is sad for me to have to stand up in this House and talk about this emigration because I was once an emigrant.  That was about 30 years ago.  I benefited to some degree from going away.  It broadened my horizons and perhaps gave me a different view of the world than if I had stayed at home.  The point is that some people are fitted for emigration but others are not.</P>
    <P>We cannot turn our backs on the heritage of these building tradesmen because they have given a good account of their stewardship in this country.  We cannot turn our backs on the skills of these workers who have worked hard here. Building workers are the most productive workers in this land.  We can see that around us.  Productivity is on the increase every year in the building industry.  Buildings are now built in half, sometimes <Col N="71" /> quarter of the time it took ten, 20, 30 or 40 years ago.  Unfortunately, we are back to the old stop-go, the boom and slump in the building industry.  That is no good because expediency has prevailed in relation to the Government's attitude to the industry.</P>
    <P>The building industry can be turned on and off like a tap and unfortunately that has happened again.  Building workers are expendable, they are used as fodder. That is not good enough.  We should use this period of recession to update the skills of our building tradesmen.  The modern restoration work that has taken place in our country was mentioned earlier in the debate.  It is good that many old buildings are being restored in order to give them character and bring distinction to our society.  When one thinks of Ireland one thinks predominantly of stone buildings, stone castles and so on. There is no reason why in the present recession we cannot upgrade our skills and train more people in finer and higher quality building work.  In my earlier remarks I was critical of some architects.</P>
    <P>We should use more of our natural materials in building work, such as stone which is a most natural material and which has been used for hundreds of thousands of years.  It can be used in an imaginative and flexible way through modern methods of working, machines and so on.  It has a long and honourable history in our society and we should not turn our backs on that material.  We should use and incorporate it more in modern day building and there is no reason why it should be so costly.  Stone work is now cost effective and stone is readily available.  Skills have been updated, machines are being used and stone can beautify and improve buildings in our cities and towns.  Let us hope that some of the architects I have spoken about will learn how to use those skills, and their intelligence in using more stone not merely as a cladding material but rather as part and parcel of the fabric of building as it does lend character to our buildings.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="72" /> I have said previously in this House that half the number of bricks we use are imported, mainly from Britain and Belgium.  I accept that for some specialist work we have to import certain materials but there is no reason why we cannot manufacture our own bricks.  It is sad that I, as a mason and bricklayer, have to say these things in this House.  At a time of recession we are creating jobs elsewhere, when we should be able to manufacture our own bricks.  One would not have to be an Einstein to learn how to make bricks.  Let us hope we can do something about this problem and turn the tide.  As I say, more than half the bricks we use are imported, mainly from Britain.</P>
    <P>We should also use more brick in building so as to beautify buildings.  I mentioned earlier that the Department of the Environment should try to influence planning officers towards better buildings. The planning officer is a very important person in the planning process.  He can help, guide, nudge and push developers towards good designs for developments. Unfortunately this does not happen.</P>
    <P>The loopholes in the planning laws have been referred to in this debate.  I will not rehash the points that have been made or cover the ground which has been covered already by other speakers, but let me say, with all due respect to the Minister, that I do not think all the loopholes have been closed in the Bill.  We should try as hard as we can, using whatever expertise is available in the House, to close any loopholes which may be used by unscrupulous people.  There are too many greedy and selfish vultures waiting in the wings to exploit the planning process. They have done so in the past playing on planning officers who feared what would happen if these cases ever reached the courts.  In many cases the planning applications were bogus and spurious.</P>
    <P>Another loophole exploited in the past is where a so-called developer, who says that he wishes to develop a site, presents various forms of applications for the one scheme so that a planning officer would not know which application he is dealing with at any given time.  This is done to <Col N="73" /> cause confusion and mislead the planning officer or the local authority concerned. Because of this loophole most local authorities do not like the idea of getting involved in a court case and as a result these cases are settled out of court or else they try to placate the developer in some way.  This is no good as one cannot operate in that manner.  The planning officer must act independently as he cannot operate under fear or duress.  I would like the Minister to take on board some of my ideas and close that loophole.</P>
    <P>Our Constitution has also been abused by those people.  Those people have no interest in our Constitution and they have no interest in the common good, but yet they use the Constitution in a callous way to enrich themselves.  Our Constitution was written with different objectives in mind.  I hope this abuse will be ended as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>In any debate on planning and land I always hear the name of Michael Davitt invoked and the more I hear his name used the more sorrowful and sadder I get. Michael Davitt was a very decent man but I happen to think he was misguided. In founding the Land League and adopting the slogan &ldquo;The land of Ireland for the people of Ireland&rdquo; he was genuine in what he was doing but 66 years after obtaining self-rule we have only half the number of land owners that we had then. The number has been halved in 66 years. While the expression &ldquo;The land of Ireland for the people of Ireland&rdquo; may have been useful as a slogan it was also a misnomer because as time goes by fewer and fewer people own land; they may own their homes which in many cases have been paid for with mortgages from banks and building societies.  I often think that Michael Davitt would have been far better off if he had spent his time helping the urban poor and the working class rather than the peasant landowners whom, it must be said, were not the most enlightened breed in the history of the world.  As I have said, the number of landowners has been cut by half since 1922.</P>
    <P>Good planning standards should be <Col N="74" /> laid down.  As a member of a local authority I often find that there is a great disparity between the decisions of An Bord Pleanála and those of the local authorities.  This should not be the case and there should be greater co-ordination.</P>
    <P>One issue which has been referred to quite often in this debate is the re-zoning of land.  Unfortunately there have been too many abuses, with many people enriching themselves in the process. Another abuse at local level is where one developer obtains planning permission to develop a housing estate in a certain part of a city and then farms out the work to subcontractors who put down the bonds. The main developer does not put down any bond and evades his responsibilities. In the process, he places the onus on some of the subcontractors.  In one recent case in Limerick one such subcontractor went into liquidation and this led to many problems which have still not been sorted out.  In future we should try to ensure that the developer who obtains planning permission is held responsible for the completion of the estate.</P>
    <P>I would now like to refer to the designated areas within our cities, with which the Minister is very familiar.  At times I find developers will make applications for a number of sites at the one time and then will do nothing about them. They wait to see what trend emerges and to see if other people will move in.  They keep track of their options and are able to pull out at a certain time without any expense.  By doing this they prevent the development of a site and there is no reason why local authorities should not pull the plug on a would-be developer after a certain time or say that unless he starts the project by a certain date the local authority will offer the site to somebody else.  This abuse should be ended. A person should be given a time limit within which to develop a site in a designated area and if he fails to do so permission should be withdrawn.  By not developing the site he is preventing other, people from going in and carrying out the <Col N="75" /> work, and he does so for all the wrong reasons.</P>
    <P>There are others who do not bother to seek planning permission in the first instance, instead they go ahead illegally and start a project and seek permission later.  This is a scandal and it is an abuse which we should attempt to end.  At times An Bord Pleanála have been too generous in granting permission to people such as those who are cynical and who wish to find ways around the planning laws.  We should also endeavour to close this loophole.  One could talk perhaps till the cows come home, to use a colloquial expression, on other aspects of the Bill but I regard these as the salient points in the Bill and I hope the Minister will take some of them on board when he is replying.</P>

      <P>This is very welcome legislation.  The only substantive complaint I would have about the legislation is that it comes five or six years too late but that blame can hardly be laid at the feet of the present Minister for the Environment; he brought forward the legislation.  There can be little doubt that the good intentions of the Planning Act, 1963, have in recent years been insufficient in themselves to achieve all that the Act wishes to achieve.</P>
      <P>The vexed issue of compensation which is at the core of this Bill has been the Achilles' heel of planning laws.  The statistics on planning compensation given by the Minister at the outset of the debate were very illuminating.  Compensation really only became an issue of grave public disquiet in the eighties.  Given that fact it was amusing to hear some of the protestations from Fine Gael and Labour during the course of this debate.  They believe that compensation has become an issue of public scandal.  I believe that compensation has become an issue of public scandal; the Minister believes that compensation has become an issue of public scandal and the dogs in the street are in accord with all of us on that particular issue.  However, while the gentlemen opposite have talked for a long time about the issue of compensation they have done nothing but talk while we have talked and acted.</P>

I suggest that he is also to be praised for indicating at the outset of the debate that he is prepared to listen to any reasonable argument put forward which he believes would help to improve the Bill and to further its intentions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Minister said in his Second Stage speech, there is a remarkable contrast between the aggregate amount of compensation claims made and the actual amount of compensation paid in planning cases.  During the past six years compensation claims totalling the extraordinary sum of £79 million have been lodged but payments in compensation amount to only £90,000.  It is not the amount of compensation paid that is the important point here: the fact of compensation and, more to the point, the fear of compensation is the issue.  Planning authorities all over the country cower at the merest mention of compensation. During my short time as a councillor in County Wicklow the threat of compensation has been used twice to ram through quite disgraceful developments. In the case of one development &mdash; the controversial Arklow to Carrickmines power line &mdash; the compensation threat was used in a most extraordinary manner by a State corporation, the Electricity Supply Board, to, in the words of one of their officials, on the one hand, tame the wild men in the statutory planning authority, among which I count myself, <Col N="78" /> and on the other to intimidate, browbeat and deny the rights of home owners, land owners and the boards of two schools in County Wicklow &mdash; a group of people who were described in writing by one of the most senior officials of the ESB as an &ldquo;undemocratic group&rdquo;, as if that gentleman or his board represented democracy.</P>
    <P>The irony about the Arklow-Carrickmines power line &mdash; and this will help to illustrate some of the ludicrous aspects of the compensation issue &mdash; is that while the ESB were abusing or threatening to abuse the law in an effort to still valid criticism and to ruthlessly remove what the State owned company saw as obstacles to its passage, the ESB were proceeding to build a controversial power line under a 1980 planning permission which suffered from the same constitutional infirmity as did the ESB's planning permission in the O'Gorman case which was contested in Wexford some years ago.  In the O'Gorman case the abuse by the ESB of their might, their monopoly and their spurious claims to compensation did not succeed in frightening off a courageous citizen who took the giant to court and in that case David conquered Goliath.</P>
    <P>The problem for the ESB in the Wicklow case was that while the company knew that their 1980 planning permissions were unconstitutional, the second string to their bow &mdash; the 1986 planning permission &mdash; was also open to constitutional challenge.  The question of the constitutional infirmity in the case of the 1986 planning permission lay in the means applied by An Bord Pleanála to process the planning application on appeal.  From material discovered in a High Court action between a landowner in Wicklow and the ESB in which the ESB were joined in their defence by An Bord Pleanála, the actions of An Bord Pleanála are certainly open to constitutional challenge.  While the infirmities in both permissions were well known in Wicklow, nobody had either sufficient confidence or, more to the point, sufficient resources to take the ESB on and to fight the matter through the courts to finality.  On each and every occasion <Col N="79" /> when the ESB were challenged, they abused the notion of compensation to browbeat people, to deny them their rights and to press ahead with a development which is unwanted, unwarranted, unsightly, despotic, destructive in the extreme.  More to the point, that development of a power line in the 220 kv range is now open to serious question on health grounds.</P>
    <P>When the issue of compensation comes to be discussed for those who have been affected by that power line, it is hoped that the ESB would be as generous as they have been in other cases where, surreptiously, they bought property in order to keep people quiet and to get their way.  If it were justice in those cases for the ESB to pay over the market odds for property to people in Clare and elsewhere, I would expect the ESB, who are so conscious of compensation for themselves, to be conscious of the compensation issue when it comes to settling with the people of Wicklow.  That is an issue that I will be raising at another time.</P>
    <P>Of course, with regard to the Arklow to Carrickmines line, that issue should not have gone to the point where proper planning depended on third party objectors. The issue should have been resolved by the planning authority, to wit, the county council.  When the matter came up for review by the planning authority, it was not resolved.  It was not resolved because the county manager &mdash; and he had no choice in this matter &mdash; had to point out to those of us who were members of that planning authority that if we proceeded in a certain direction we would undoubtedly face substantial, massive, crippling claims for compensation from the ESB.  If we as an elected authority representing the people of Wicklow could not have the courage collectively to oppose the ESB because we feared compensation claims, how can a private individual be expected to vindicate his own rights in the face of such claims from the ESB?  That case is not yet closed.  As I have said, the issue of compensation continues but the boot is now on the other foot.  We will be looking <Col N="80" /> for compensation for the people who have been affected.  The ESB have in recent times stilled some criticisms by coming to some side arrangements but they still will not silence all criticism.</P>
    <P>The second case that I mentioned, which well illustrates the ludicrous nature of compensation, has been the absolutely disgraceful behaviour of a developer &mdash; I use the term lightly &mdash; in the case of Coolattin Woods and the threat which that same developer now holds, like a sword, over Ireland's last piece of native self-rejuvenating oak forest in Tomnafinnoge. Coolattin is another planning disaster and one where we can never reverse the clock.  In that planning disaster the bludgeon of compensation was used to push ahead with the most wanton and wholesale destruction of something which was unique, which was part of our heritage, which merited preservation, which would have had endless commercial possibilities in its preserved state if Messrs.  Bridge Farm Limited, the people behind the destruction, had had the sense and the wit to look for an alternative way of using their resources.  But no, compensation was again used in the case of Coolattin and it is now being used in the case of Tomnafinnoge to produce the most extraordinary and bizarre twist of events.</P>
    <P>This case has adopted a peculiarly sinister twist in that the fear of compensation has at this very moment forced the county council, who have made an amenity order to protect Tomnafinnoge, into the courts against third party objectors who have taken a case to An Bord Pleanála.  In this case, the third party objectors, including myself, are objecting to a consent granted by the planning authorities, again granted in the fear of compensation to the so-called developers.  It is my belief that the developers &mdash; and I have said this before in this House &mdash; who have devastated Coolattin and who have plundered the magnificent oak woods, should not be let within five miles of any tree with a buzz saw in their hands. <Col N="81" /> I am sure that Members on all sides of this House share in that concern.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to note that members of this Government at a very senior level share that concern.  The vandalism and destruction, the extraordinarily perverse behaviour that we can witness in that case are surely a monument to the ludicrous situation in which we find ourselves.  It is surely a clear indication, a clear sign of the need for a Bill such as this.</P>
      <P>The irony in the case of Tomnafinnoge and of Coolattin is that the elected representatives of the people of Wicklow who are entrusted with the defence of our resources in that county, the county council, while being charged with the task of establishing planning for the county and while we oppose the activities of the company in question in Tomnafinnoge and while we have made an amenity order to witness our opposition to this, in spite of all these facts and the public feelings on the issue in County Wicklow and throughout the country and the fact that the Leader of the Government took the time and trouble to come to Coolattin to express his solidarity and personal concern, the very county council which should be defending these woods now find themselves, by a perverse twist of fate, in the courts assisting the very dirty work which the elected representatives in Wicklow wish to resist.  Such is the ridiculous level to which the compensation issue has reduced the local authority.  We are not the only council that find ourselves in a difficulty on the compensation issue.  Every planning authority find themselves in that situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problem of planning compensation has given rise to a ludicrous genre of individual, the speculative non-developer, the compensation broker.  It is my belief that this Bill goes a long way towards calling a halt to such people. Section 13 of the Bill and the Third Schedule codify for the first time the law on compensation.  Many of the aspects <Col N="82" /> of this codification have been dealt with already and some have been questioned. It is not my intention or wish to cover ground which has already been covered. There are, however, aspects of this section and of the accompanying schedule which have been ignored or not adequately covered.  The listing and classification of the full range of non-compensation activities is the most welcome part of the Act.  I am sure that this listing codification can be improved during the passage of the Bill through the House.</P>
    <P>I would draw Members' attention to a number of items in this section and in the accompanying schedules which have not been adequately covered.  Section 13 and Part III of the Third Schedule have been largely ignored.  This, I would suggest, is a particularly wise piece of drafting allowing the prioritisation of land to avoid compensation.  A Cheann Comhairle, at this stage do you wish me to conclude?  I have one minute.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I have often had to fit much wisdom into one minute.  Section 13, in particular the Third Schedule, is extremely important.  It allows us to prioritise land to avoid compensation.  I would also draw attention to section 13 and Part VI of the schedule where pollution is an issue.  Again, this has been largely ignored.  There is an aspect there which I shall deal with on the next occasion &mdash; that is noise pollution.  I notice that various types of pollution are covered in this section but noise pollution is not.  I would ask the Minister, while the Bill is passing through the House, to consider this omission.  I think that it is an omission which was not intended.  Noise pollution can be extremely damaging.  It can certainly destroy the use of the amenities of a person's home, particularly if a certain type of development goes on in the vicinity.  I would ask that the Minister include that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>In October when, in consultation with my colleague, the Minister for Education, I launched the Youthreach programme, I said that it would be phased in from January 1989.  That is still the position.</P>
      <P>Under the new programme, young people who leave the educational system without qualifications and who fail to find employment, will be offered up to two years' education and training on a combination of programmes to suit their particular needs.  During the programme they will be paid weekly allowances on the same basis as FÁS trainees.</P>
      <P>In 1989, 3,000 first year places on foundation programmes will be required. Education agencies will cater for 600 participants and the manpower agencies for 2,400.  FÁS are now planning the provision of the required number of places and I understand that the vocational education committees are doing the same at the request of the Department of Education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to certification, work on this <Col N="86" /> area is continuing.  I consider it to be important that every young person who completes the programme will be given meaningful certification which will assist him or her in his or her subsequent search for employment.  I hope to be in a position to make further announcements in the near future.</P>
    <P>I have no proposals to re-establish the Social Guarantee Advisory Board.  The Youthreach programme will be managed locally by education and manpower agencies and nationally by a committee representative of the Departments of Labour and Education and their agencies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>It is estimated that about 6,000 young people are involved, about 10 per cent of the total leaving the educational system each year.  They leave without qualifications and, from the survey, 3,000 of these have not found employment and continue to seek it or training.  We will be including these 3,000 young people and, although there is a backlog, we hope to be able to cope with the numbers each year.  The question of the Social Guarantee Advisory Board was discussed at length and it was agreed that the best functions of the board should be maintained.  In the old system FÁS, the Youth Employment Agency, AnCO, Manpower, the VECs and the Departments of Education and Labour were involved.  Three of those agencies have been incorporated in FÁS and the VECs are working with the Department of Education.  Nationally, the Departments of Education and Labour will look after these young people and locally the Department of Education will be involved, including the VECs and FÁS. The Social Guarantee Advisory Board <Col N="87" /> was unwieldy and, therefore, we have integrated the best of the board in the new set up.  While we are abolishing the name the principles remain the same.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3, 4, 12, 15, 18 and 33 together.</P>
      <P>Two hundred and fifty thousand pounds has been allocated in my Department's Vote for 1989 for assisting voluntary organisations providing emergency services for emigrants to Britain.  The grant has been maintained at the 1988 level.  Since I became Minister for Labour the allocation in respect of emigrants has been increased by approximately 60 per cent despite the critical Exchequer situation resulting in cutbacks in many other areas.  DÍON, the advisory committee on emigrant welfare, advise me on the disbursement of these funds to voluntary bodies, based mainly in Britain.  I hope to be able to announce the 1988 DÍON grants shortly.</P>
      <P>I have received no recommendation from the DÍON Committee in relation to the provision of advice and welfare services for our emigrants in Britain in the context of funding from the national lottery.  However, following an approach by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, I understand that DÍON are considering making a recommendation in the matter to both the Tánaiste and myself.</P>
      <P>In addition, FÁS, through their nationwide network of local offices provide a pre-departure counselling and advisory service for intending emigrants which includes the discouragement of unplanned and precipitate emigration and the offer of information on training schemes and employment programmes available locally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>FÁS also have responsibility for the day-to-day administration of SEDOC, the European Community-wide placement system, which provides an information exchange mechanism about job vacancies in the Community.  This includes the provision of information on working and living conditions in other <Col N="89" /> member states.  These services are constantly under review by FÁS in the context of their priorities and budgetary allocation.</P>
    <P>The relevant section in my Department has a staff of eight.  They arrange the payment of grants on the recommendation of DÍON to voluntary organisations who provide welfare services for emigrants and they also liaise with FÁS in relation to the provision of their information and advice services for intending emigrants.</P>
    <P>The section also deal with a range of other related activities such as the free movement of workers within the European Community, SEDOC, the network of European Placement Services, the granting of work permits to non-nationals for employment within the State and a variety of other issues.  The Labour Attaché at the London Embassy, who acts as chairman of the DÍON committee, is also seconded from my Department. Staff from other sections of the Department and at various levels may also be involved from time to time.  Since FÁS are responsible for providing pre-departure advisory services a greater number of their staff would be involved.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will be aware, the Government's priority is the creation of jobs at home in order to ensure that no-one feels that they are forced to emigrate because of lack of employment.  In this connection I am glad to say that the recent labour force survey indicated that employment had increased between April 1987 and April 1988.  Independent research agencies have predicted that there will be a further increase in employment in 1989.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Despite what the Minister said in the latter part of his reply in relation to the Government's aspirations for job creation, the facts are that emigration is taking place on a large scale and some of the young people from this country are living in what can only be described as deplorable and tragic conditions in London.  I would ask the Minister if he is aware of the tragic conditions in which these people are living and if he <Col N="90" /> can, as a matter of urgency, seek extra funding from the Government?  Can he clarify whether or not funding can be made available for these people from the national lottery?  I believe that one application has been received from the Kerrymen's Association who are spending about £500,000 on a hostel which is very badly needed in London.  Can funds be provided if Government approval is given?</P>

      <P>On a number of occasions I have visited welfare centres and chaplaincies.  I have also visited excellent houses provided by the Kerrymen's Association.  The money provided for DÍON goes towards frontline services on welfare.  I understand the Minister for Foreign Affairs has spoken to the DÍON committee who are in fairly regular consultation with members of the Government. When they discussed the matter with him he invited them to make a submission to him and to me on the aspect to which the Deputy has referred.  No decision has been made on that matter. The Minister for Foreign Affairs answered a question on it in the House last week in which he said he awaits the submission.</P>
      <P>It is sometimes dangerous to mention one organisation because all the organisations are doing very good work, but CARA which helps the Irish homeless are a very fine organisation.  They use the resources that are available through the authorities to great advantage.  I would very much like to assist them in their efforts in whatever way possible because the work they are doing is exceptional.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>My question to the Minister deals very specifically with the response that might or might not have been available from a group that advises him.  In the opinion that the Minister has expressed to this House, has he taken into account either the conference in London or the conference in Dublin who involve such groups as the Action Group for Irish Youth and their equivalent in London who make specific proposals <Col N="92" /> about the day-to-day needs of young people in London, including 16 to 18 year olds from Dublin who are spending time in hostels?  Is it his intention to implement any or all of the proposals of these two conferences of reputable organisations on emigrant welfare?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The group that advise me as Minister for Labour is an excellent group who look after people of all ages, from the youngest of Irish emigrants to quite elderly people.  Needless to say I get submissions from all kinds of organisations. I work through the Federation of Irish Societies, the umbrella organisation for several hundred groups.  The proposals from DÍON to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and myself cover the various Irish groups who are working in the field.  I have met these groups and attended the federation's annual general meeting in the summer.  I have met them since then and I am due to meet them again shortly after Christmas.  It is dangerous to start dealing with every individual group.  I would rather deal through the group which has been set up to deal with emigration matters, DÍON, and, when necessary, through the Federation of Irish Societies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to clarify a matter which relates to my Question No. 18.  I am not asking the Minister to deal with any specific group or individuals.  I am asking him to give an undertaking to take into account the recommendations of two conferences, one in London and one in Dublin, at which all the groups were represented.  They made very specific proposals and encompassed the work of DÍON.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I will certainly look at those proposals.  Some of them involved work on the part of FÁS in various centres which is already taking place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister consider it reasonable of the organisations in London to hope for funding from the national lottery?  Have the Government considered that question?  Will funds be <Col N="93" /> made available to groups outside the country, in this case needy, worthwhile groups?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot give a straight answer to that question because the Minister for Foreign Affairs has said that the question of allocating national lottery funds to provide advice and welfare services for our emigrants in Britain is under consideration.  He has asked DÍON to submit recommendations to him in that context.  As soon as those recommendations &mdash; of which I am aware because I have taken part in some informal discussions &mdash; reach him they will be discussed by the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that there is need to consider a more co-ordinated policy toward our emigrant question?  Would he consider the establishment of more Irish hostels, not alone in the United Kingdom but on the Continent and in North America? Would he also consider following the Greek example, of perhaps establishing FÁS centres on the Continent for the purpose of finding jobs for intending emigrants? Furthermore would he say whether the Government would consider appointing social welfare attachés in critical places abroad where there are groups of Irish immigrants living in appalling conditions?  Finally, have the Government any policy of substituting emigrant workers by commuting workers?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Foreign Affairs is responsible for them and <Col N="94" /> has answered questions as recently as last week.  On the question of homelessness, CARA is the organisation involved in providing hostel services, the organisation recognised by and working with the Government in the provision of such facilities.  With regard to the question of providing services and jobs for intending emigrants I should say that the SEDOC system is now operative under which FÁS have undertaken much work in the course of this year.  The computerised Manpower agencies now have comprehensive data in relation to jobs readily available through their nationwide network.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that, despite emigration having increased since 1987 by 60,000 and inflation in England having increased considerably more than here, the figure of £250,000 is derisory when one considers the demands being made for advisory services in England?  Would the Minister consider extending the remit of DÍON to include the provision of hostel accommodation because that constitutes the major problem obtaining in England? Is the Minister not aware of the problem developing in, for example, Birmingham where in the past three weeks five families arrived with no money or without having made any provision for accommodation and where upwards of ten youths arrived, four of whom were under 15 years of age, who had made no preparation whatsoever for emigrating? Would the Minister consider extending the remit of DÍON to include provision of moneys for the establishment of advice centres in New York and Boston where the problem is more acute than in London?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I should repeat that DÍON is the committee dealing with our immigrants into the United Kingdom and <Col N="95" /> they have their hands full with that problem. I should say that CARA is strongly represented on the DÍON committee, the former dealing with the homeless.  I know the Deputy was in Birmingham recently and in London during the summer. However, he would have to agree that people representing the welfare services there are contending that there is a reduced number of young Irish immigrants, for whatever reason, arriving at their doors.  The relevant statistics for the second half of this year will show that to be the case.  The Deputy can have those statistics as soon as they come to hand. It is my policy &mdash; rather than endeavouring to solve the problem of 15 and 16 year olds arriving at the doors of welfare centres in Birmingham, Slough or elsewhere &mdash; to deal with it here under the Youthreach programme rather than deal with an impossible position once they have emigrated.  The Youthreach programme will help in preventing young people emigrating, young people who have nothing to do here, who have left the formal education system, with no future. From January they will be offered six months training under that programme. It is my belief that that is the way the problem should be dealt with here.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Labour if he will change the Social Employment Scheme regulations which require applicants to be in receipt of unemployment assistance payments in order to qualify, as they discriminate against married women seeking to return to the workforce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Social Employment Scheme was designed specifically to assist older recipients of social welfare payments who were long-term unemployed and on the basis that it would be part-funded out of the savings arising on social welfare payments.  To admit persons not in receipt of unemployment compensation would increase the net Exchequer cost of the scheme and lead to a reduction in the number of participants.</P>
      <P>Therefore, I have no proposals to make the change suggested by the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will be aware that I raised this question previously. I intend to continue to do so until I receive a more positive response. Would the Minister confirm that there is in the region of 14,000 people who are signing on, who are not in receipt of unemployment assistance of any kind? Furthermore, would he agree that excluding them from participation in the social employment scheme shows, at the very least, indirect discrimination against them?  In addition, is he aware that 9,000 of those 14,000 are women who are effectively precluded from any possibility of re-entering the workforce through the provisions of the Social Employment Scheme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's figure is correct.  On the establishment of the Social Employment Scheme it was decided to use the social welfare criteria <Col N="97" />&mdash; that is registration on the live register and those in receipt of UA or UB in order to identify those most in need. There also arises compensatory savings <i>vis-à-vis</i> the social welfare budget. Deputies will be aware from questions tabled in recent months that there are more than sufficient people to fill the quota in that category.  Of course I admit that it is unfortunate that not all of these people can avail of the provisions of the scheme.  There are limited resources. Therefore, the arrangement is that, if a person avails of the provisions of the social employment scheme, compensatory savings must be achieved on the social welfare budget.  That has been the criterion applied to the operations of the scheme from the beginning and continues to be so.  We and the previous Government endeavoured on several previous occasions to obtain European social funding on a higher ratio for employment schemes.  The view of the Commission and of other EC countries is that this is not strictly a job-orientated scheme in the strict sense of the term.  Therefore, they are unwilling to pay any compensatory amounts in respect of such a scheme.  Deputies will see that it presents a financial difficulty.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that it poses a financial difficulty.  The reality of how it affects people is that they are automatically excluded from participating in the social employment scheme because they are not in receipt of any money at all in the form of unemployment assistance.  I contend that that constitutes an unfair discrimination against such people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>They are excluded, but the effect of doing what the Deputy wishes would mean that there would be fewer people in the scheme.  The average in the scheme at any one time for the first six months of this year was in the region of 11,300.  If less money was available there would be fewer people in the scheme, and that is the difficulty.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6, 9 and 11 together.</P>
      <P>Proposals to extend a particular FÁS programme have to be looked at in the context of the total budget available to FÁS and the priorities between programmes. In the present difficult financial situation, I have no plans to provide funds to allow FÁS extend any of the training and placement programmes directed at graduates.  In fact there has been a reduction in the Exchequer allocation for such programmes in 1989 over that provided for this year.</P>
      <P>The number of persons who participated in the marketplace programme was 491 in 1986 and 578 in 1987.</P>
      <P>The number of persons who participated in the European Orientation Programme in 1987 was 165 and 71 participated in the first half of 1988.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>In the light of the Minister's reply does he agree that this scheme totally discriminates against young people and that his attitude is an indictment of the Government's attitude to people who are under 30 years of age? Would the Minister look again and ensure that these people are not automatically excluded by virtue of their age from any Government programme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not age that precludes these people, it is their qualification. In implementing cutbacks in these schemes FÁS are looking to the graduates because all the people involved are not graduates.  The intention is that people who might have a diploma or no qualification at all will be able to do some of these courses.  The present position is that a person who has gone though the educational system and has been very heavily subsidised in university is getting a further £3,500 by working with some employer on these programmes.  That is a very heavy subsidy.  The Deputy's <Col N="100" /> request that other people should be considered for these schemes is being looked at.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister accept that the youth orientation programme is important in the context of our entry into the single market, that this is the most important stage of this programme and experience should be given to people who are under 30 years of age?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly agree that particularly in the lead up to 1992 these courses are important.  Private enterprise should, however, fund these schemes. These people have been already highly subsidised.  Up until 1 January people who have left school early are not entitled to any allowances whatsoever.  While I believe Youthreach is a good scheme I am still providing fairly mediocre allowances of £30 per week for many of these children whereas people who have gone through the educational system are being granted £70 a week while working in private enterprise.  Private enterprise should carry this burden.  If we had unlimited resources I would be glad to fund these schemes, but we do not.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that the principles of the Unfair Dismissals Act are as valid and desirable today as they ever were?  Has the Minister given any consideration to the impact they might have on recruitment to employment?  Can the Minister say to what extent does the Act act as a disincentive to recruitment to employment?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The question asked by Deputy Mitchell is probably the major issue in the review because it has been stated over a number of years by employer organisations that the Act is a disincentive.  A survey was carried out by the ERSI last year and employers were interviewed in detail on this.  They stated that the difficulty is that an employer cannot now tell a person to leave at a moment's notice without justification or because of one isolated incident.  An employer must follow what the Act sets down.  The Act is needed now as much as it ever was because, for instance, in the area of part-time work there is considerable abuse in the area of unfair dismissals. That is why we are reviewing the legislation and why we agree that there is a need for it.  In some regards it makes lazy employers do a bit of work in order to get rid of lazy workers.  There is nothing wrong with that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>To what extent does this Act encourage black economy employment or encourage employers to resort to things like contract work or consultancy work?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The employer organisations and the trade unions will say that those things occur for reasons other than <Col N="104" /> unfair dismissals legislation.  Looking at the number of part time workers one can see that there has been a shift to contract or consultancy work, but it is not just because of unfair dismissals.</P>

      <P>The agreements on pay negotiated in conjunction with the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> provided that in October 1988 discussions would take place at national level between the Government, the FUE, the CIF and the ICTU on a general framework to allow for the implementation of a one hour per week reduction in working hours over the three year period of the national programme in cases where the normal working week is at or above 40 hours.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>A 3 per cent quota for disabled persons employed in the public service was introduced some years ago and responsibility for overseeing its implementation was placed with the Minister for Labour.</P>
      <P>Significant progress was made until the introduction of the various embargos on recruitment to the public service with recruitment eventually suspended to grades to which disabled people were likely to be recruited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The total number of disabled persons <Col N="108" /> employed in the Government Departments, semi-State Bodies and local authorities at 31 December, 1987 was approximately 1,866 which represented a quota of 1.59 per cent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that a quota of 1.59 per cent, or 1,866 people, employed in the public service as against the statutory regulation of 3 per cent represents a very poor success rate?  Would he also not agree that those figures reflect very poorly on our social commitment to the handicapped and the disadvantaged?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1977 a target was set, not a statutory regulation, for the employment of disabled persons in the public service &mdash; the Civil Service vocational education committees, public authorities and the health boards.  All categories of disabled persons, including physically and mentally ill, come within the ambit of the quota provided they were substantially handicapped or obtaining or holding employment, and they had to be capable of actually doing the job for which they would be employed.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Labour of the day was given responsibility for the quota and he asked that this be done by persuasion and co-operation within the public service.  For the first three or four years that went fairly well because there was recruitment of public service employees, particularly to the grade which suited the handicapped. Unfortunately, because of the embargo they are in grades which have been affected since 1981.</P>
      <P>I hold the same view as the Deputy that persuasion and co-operation are the only way we can do this.  I suppose it is because the Department of Labour were responsible that they have managed to employ more than the required 3 per cent.  It was felt that if we tried to implement the system under a statutory basis it would not work and we appealed to people to make the system work.  It is true the embargo has created difficulties and that the numbers have contracted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Allowing for the fact that there has been a contraction of recruitment to the public service, the ratio of 3 per cent should be maintained across the board.  This confirms the age old belief that at times of severe cutbacks, the first to go to the wall and to be victimised are the minority groups and those who are most disadvantaged.  I ask the Minister to ensure that those targets are met and that the type of success rate which operated in the Department of Labour is translated across the other 14 Government Departments.  What measure does he propose to take to ensure that this is effected?</P>
      <P>A few months ago the House said we should try to encourage various sectors of the public service when recruiting staff to show a bias in favour of the handicapped. That is what happened in 1977. I do not want to give the impression that the number of handicapped employed in the public service has been reduced; what happened was that there was a five year programme to reach the quota of 3 per cent.  That figure was never achieved. Most of the people recruited at that time are still in employment but because of the embargo the figure has not exceeded 1.5 per cent, except in one or two areas where the 3 per cent target was exceeded and this was probably because some Departments worked harder towards reaching that goal.</P>

I take it 3 per cent is still the objective.

The responsibility I have is to try by a policy of persuasion and co-operation &mdash; a policy never written into any formal orders &mdash; to get the public service to recruit more handicapped people.  The only way I can do that under the guidelines set down is to try to get State organisations to consider employing people on the training, but FÁS deal directly with the NRB.  I do not believe there is difficulty with training.  The workshops in which we are partly involved but which are mainly under the Department of Health and the NRB train people very well.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Labour if his attention has been drawn to the fact that workers on mainland Europe have wider protection under labour law than workers in Ireland; and if he has plans to harmonise labour law in Ireland with aspects of labour law in other major European states before 1992.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 19 and 41 together.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, we have our own code of labour legislation in this country which reflects our own industrial relations and employment environment. In general, our labour legislation lays down minimum standards and has been enacted after consultation with both the FUE and the ICTU.  I am reviewing and updating this legislation as appropriate in consultation with both the FUE and ICTU.  I would mention specifically industrial relations and trade union law, health and safety, payment of wages, unfair dismissals, employment equality as well as the situation of part-time workers and conditions of employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department keep in constant touch with labour law developments in other European countries.  In my view the complete harmonisation of labour law at European level is not a realistic proposition given the diversity of arrangements in the various countries.  A uniform <Col N="112" /> code of labour law does not exist throughout European states as the Deputy's question seems to imply.</P>
    <P>So far as the European Community is concerned, directives already exist in various areas such as health and safety and equality of employment, and Ireland of course adheres to the terms of these directives.  In the context of 1992, further measures are being proposed by the Commission and these will be examined in the Council of Ministers in the normal way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to register my disapproval of the manner in which my priority question has been taken as a composite with Question No. 19.  If it is deemed to be a priority question it should be treated as such.  That was your ruling on a previous occasion when I had some questions down to the Minister for Labour and they were treated in a similar fashion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister is using poetic licence.  Question No. 19 concerns availability of information and the other question is about conditions of employment.  The Minister says there is no harmonisation in Europe.  We have in Europe the Beretta report which is an attempt by the EC Social Committee to come to grips with harmonisation of labour law.  Regarding Question No. 19, <Col N="113" /> in the Minister's Department no information is available whereby somebody can make a comparison between labour law in this country and what applies on mainland Europe.  It is not in the trade unions.  It is very difficult to obtain from any trade union sources.  Likewise, in the various Government Departments and in the EC itself it is difficult to make a comparison of the type of conditions which apply in the various countries.  I will accept what the Minister has said in that regard, but I do not think he has taken sufficient steps in this area.</P>
      <P>Regarding Question No. 41, there are problems arising from multinational companies operating in this country especially those which are non-European based, whose place of origin is not Europe.  They have introduced a contract system which at times is to the disadvantage of the employee.  In Europe when it is deemed that a contract is not to the advantage of an employee it is deemed to be null and void.  There is a mechanism&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the points the Deputy is making.  Some of them are fair points.  There is no comparative analysis of labour law throughout the EC and such is not envisaged.  In any of the legislation of any EC directives the Department of Labour, or the Department of Industry, as the case may be, are actively involved in these discussions.  This very week both Departments are involved in safety, health and welfare legislation and in legislation concerning worker participation at European level.  Although we do not have the same legislation in each of the <Col N="114" /> member states we keep up to line with whatever directives are best suited to us. We work with the European employer organisations and the trade unions' inter-European organisation in any of these directives.  The Employment Committee which the Minister for Labour attends, deals with these as does the Social Affairs Council.  There are a number of Acts that cover this.  The traditional conditions of employment legislation which we are reviewing, part-time workers, occupational safety and health, the impact on legislation and the burden of proof in the area of equal pay and equal treatment, are all being discussed in Europe and they affect the issue the Deputy raised. Others which President Delors has raised are also being discussed.  The right to leave for training, worker participation, contracts of employment and parental leave are at various stages in Europe. However, to get a comparative analysis you would have to take the good with the bad.  A great deal of legislation which would not be to the benefit of workers and employers is floating around in various committees in Europe at the moment.  The system in this country works very well.  We are involved in any discussions on directives which we have to implement and we keep in touch with any other progressive clauses that are there and build them into our legislation as we review them one by one.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ToddyOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that we have had problems with multinationals in particular regarding various definitions as to what is shift work and what is not shift work and various practices regarding a four shift rota and a five shift rota?  These have presented problems to trade unionists employed in these firms.  The non-European ones in particular have scant regard to what applies in Europe and have demonstrated this in the past much to the detriment of working conditions which already apply here. We cannot apply these conditions because there is no clear definition.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I will send the Deputy information on that point because we will <Col N="115" /> be reviewing exactly those points.  There is legislation which is very different to European legislation and I would not like to get involved in comparative analysis, but I am quite prepared to look at certain aspects.  In regard to the multinationals I am aware of many contentious issues and have been directly involved in some issues relating to multinationals in Waterford recently.  I appreciate the point that non-Europeans would not be governed by EC law and we would have to be conscious of that.  I would be glad if there were something we could do although I am not too sure as to what we could do. However I will be very glad to look into it.</P>

      <P>In 1987 the Labour Court received a total of 103 complaints in relation to the Construction Industry (Pensions Assurance and Sick Pay) Registered Employment Agreement.  Of these 34 related to arrears of contributions to pension schemes.  A total of 334 complaints in relation to the agreement has been received by the court to date in 1988 and of these 55 relate to arrears of pension contributions.  The large increase in complaints in 1988 as compared to 1987 is mainly attributable to the establishment by the Construction Industry Federation and the Building Unions Group of a new enforcement agency financed by employer and employee contributions.</P>

      <P>I have raised this matter on a number of occasions in the hope that some positive Government action would be taken to eliminate this appalling abuse by cowboy builders throughout the country. Would the Minister agree that it is a sad reflection on our labour laws that a man who worked hard all his life is informed, on retirement, that his pension contributions had not been paid and little or nothing can be done about it?  Is the Minister further aware that a number of those cowboy builders, when the pressure is on, go into voluntary liquidation to avoid their commitment to their workers and to our institutions and, at a later stage, go into business again and carry on the same abuse?  Is the Minister further aware that a number of those builders are now going to Great Britain and victimising Irish workers there in the same way and returning again to Ireland and are getting away scot-free?  It is an appalling state of affairs when workers can be abused by such cowboy builders.  When we are talking about those people, as I am sure the Minister is fully aware, we are talking about the real black economy, people who are getting rich overnight on the sweat of Irish workers.  I would like the Minister to give me more positive information.</P>

      <P>The Deputy has made his point and made it effectively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I know Deputy Wyse has raised this on a number of occasions. I have done a fairly extensive examination of the position he highlighted.  My reply may be a bit long but the Deputy has asked for more information so I will give the position as quickly as possible because there are some things which have happened since the Deputy put down his question.  The Construction Industry (Pensions Insurance and Sick Pay) Agreement was first registered in 1969 and this September it was registered for the fifteenth time.  Every employer in the construction industry is, therefore, obliged to provide these benefits either <Col N="117" /> under the construction federation operatives pension scheme run by the Construction Industry Federation or under some other scheme.</P>
      <P>The agreement is legally binding on all employers in the construction industry regardless of whether they are parties to the agreement.  The enforcement of the agreement is a matter for the parties in the first instance.  The Labour Court can only act on the basis of a complaint made by a trade union, an employer's association or an individual employer.  If the court is satisfied that an employer who is in breach of the agreement fails to rectify the situation it can by order direct him to comply with the agreement.  If the employer fails to comply with the order he is guilty of an offence and renders himself liable on summary conviction to a fine of up to £100 with a further fine of up to £100 for every day during which the offence is continued.</P>
      <P>The court made 25 orders under section 10 of the Industrial Relations Act, 1969 in relation to breaches of this agreement. Of these 13 related to arrears of pension contributions while the remaining 12 concerned employers who had not made any pension provision for their employees.</P>
      <P>This year to date the court has received 334 complaints in relation to the REA and these are being followed through. Where an employer fails to comply with an order of the Labour Court in relation to a breach of an REA the Minister may prosecute.  In 1987 the Department obtained convictions against two employers who failed to comply with such orders in relation to the Construction Industry (Pensions) REA.  This year convictions have been obtained against four employers and prosecutions are pending against a further nine employers.</P>
      <P>I agree totally with the Deputy that those are the people in the black economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Construction Industry Federation and the Building Unions Group of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions have recently established an enforcement agency which is being financed by contributions from both employers and <Col N="118" /> employees.  The role of the agency is to ensure that employers comply with negotiated terms and conditions of employment, various statutory regulations and other matters.  The agency has been given specific responsibility for ensuring that employers are complying with the Construction Industry (Pension Assurance and Sick Pay) Registered Employment Agreement.  This measure combined with the existing safeguards and the vigilance of the workers themselves should help eliminate abuses.</P>
    <P>That covers all the points except the one in regard to insolvency.  The Deputy is right in saying that a substantial number of companies are involved in this abuse. Under the Protection of Employees (Employers' Insolvency) Act, 1984 an employer can claim back any shortfall in his payments up to 12 months.  The CIF and the Congress of Trade Unions have informed me, following the Deputy's earlier question this year, that they have launched a publicity campaign aimed at current employees urging them to check their position while they are in employment. That campaign will highlight some of the things the Deputy is now highlighting and will help to stop these fly-by-night contractors abusing the system. Much of this has happened since the Deputy's earlier questions and will go some way to stopping the abuses.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Labour if he has undertaken any review of redundancy laws and practices with a view to reducing the attractiveness of redundancy to employers and employees; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not undertaken any review of the redundancy payments Acts of the nature indicated in the question, which I consider to be based on a false premise that the Acts operate to make redundancies attractive to employers or to employees.  I do not accept that to be the case.</P>
      <P>So far as employers are concerned, the position is that the provisions of the Acts require employers who declare employees redundant to meet a substantial portion of the statutory lump sum payments themselves.  Such employers are, of course, also obliged to comply with the provisions of the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act, 1977, and the Holidays (Employees) Acts, which may involve them in other payments to the employees.</P>
      <P>So far as employees are concerned, the position is that the redundancy payments Acts provide that they will receive basic payments in compensation for their loss of jobs and in recognition of their periods of service with their employers.  The amounts of statutory redundancy lump sums are not set at levels which would make it worthwhile for workers to trade their jobs in a situation where the prospects of finding other employment are uncertain to say the least.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy may have in mind cases where workers are induced to accept redundancy by offers of substantial amounts of extra-statutory lump sums. Such payments are, of course, a matter entirely for negotiation between employers and workers, in which I have <Col N="120" /> no function.  I am sure the Deputy would agree that it would not be appropriate for the Minister for Labour to interfere in the free collective bargaining process in relation to this or any other matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that though this problem can arise out of collective bargaining we should discuss with the trade unions the possible contribution of the present redundancy regime to our acute unemployment problem? Will the Minister, in trying to create a better environment for maintaining and creating employment, undertake to have discussions with the trade unions to see if there is any element exacerbating unemployment as a result of the redundancy regime?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I can answer &ldquo;yes&rdquo; to those questions but I should like to make it clear that there is a distinction between the redundancy Acts.  I am not too sure if I have a role to play.  The redundancy Acts are there to provide employees who lose their jobs, often at short notice, with a minimum of basic rights.  That amounts to a half week's pay for each year of service between the ages of 16 and 41 years and one week's pay between the ages of 41 and 66 years, which is the old age pension age, plus one week's pay in every case.  They are basic minimum rights.  I do not propose to amend the Acts or consider reviewing them but I accept that in regard to extra-statutory lump sums some of them are so large that workers would rather accept them than hold their jobs.  That is outside the ambit of the redundancy Acts but there is an argument that perhaps it causes the loss of jobs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am encouraged by what the Minister has said.  Is he aware of the many instances in recent years where viable jobs have been done away with because of the dangling of a tax free lump sum in front of workers who within 15 months or two years are living in poverty? Is the Minister aware that many workers who accept such substantial lump sums are advised to spend the <Col N="121" /> money fast and before their 15 months unemployment benefit runs out so as to qualify for unemployment assistance? Will the Minister accept that there are huge incentives for people to be spendthrift with such money in order to qualify for unemployment assistance?  Has the Minister any reform in mind to overcome this problem?</P>

      <P>I accept that we should look at some points in regard to this matter.  Without naming the companies, I have been publicly and controversially involved with two major companies in the last 12 months because I felt that the attractiveness of the large lump sums froze and lost jobs for ever more.  I am against that practice and agree that it is an issue I could usefully pursue with the social partners.  I do not know if I would have any success but I will be glad to pursue it.</P>

This does not relate to statutory redundancies but relates to the terrible temptations put in the way of workers.  They may grab for short-term gain but at a significant long-term loss.</P>

      <P>In response to this information the salmonella monitoring programme operated by my Department in the eggs sector has recently been intensified.  No evidence has emerged which links egg consumption to outbreaks of salmonella poisoning in Ireland.  There have been a number of outbreaks of salmonella in the Munster area in recent months which may be linked with the consumption of poultry meat.</P>
      <P>My Department are endeavouring, with the co-operation of the Department of Health and the industry, to establish the source of infection.  Our investigations are ongoing and further discussions with both the Department of Health and the industry are taking place. Consumers should, of course, adhere to basic hygienic practice in the treatment of poultry and egg products.  In particular they should ensure that products are fully cooked.</P>
      <P>To date the Minister of Health has issued instructions to the health services, that is the health boards, hospital and community personnel, voluntary hospitals and other health institutions such as nursing homes and homes for the mentally handicapped, outlining the potential risk to vulnerable groups such as infants, the elderly and pregnant mothers of salmonella infection from eggs.  The Minister's advice indicates that vulnerable persons should not eat raw eggs or uncooked food such as home made mayonnaise or mousse and that eggs should be thoroughly cooked in any event.</P>

      <P>There are many varieties or strains of salmonella, more than 1,000, and to identify the particular strain at this point is not possible.  I should like to assure the Deputy, the House and the public that my Department have been active in trying to trace the source of the contamination.  It may come from a variety of sources, such as foodstuffs, and it may be that it will be traceable to sources outside the country.  Until the source is traced, which it has not been up to now, we are in constant consultation with the Department of Health, who have responsibility in the health area, as to the precautions to be taken and the advice to be given.</P>
      <P>We have communicated with them on the basis of what we feel would be suitable and adequate precautions to be issued, not just to institutions but to the public in certain areas, if there was any risk of outbreak.  I can assure the Deputy that we are in constant contact with the industry concerned &mdash; even this very day &mdash; with a view to ensuring that the source could be isolated if possible and that the standards which would minimise the risk of infection are applied.  I should like to say, a Cheann Comhairle, lest people might be unduly apprehensive, that the occurrence of salmonella in poultry meat is not unusual.  There is an element of it all the time.  It is a question of a particular strain at a particular stage and that is the reason we want to isolate it.  People need not be totally and utterly concerned that it has actually emerged in certain areas.</P>

      <P>I have no such information. In relation to any issue of that kind I can assure the House that there is no indication that there is any linkage. As we have always done, we are taking the most stringent precautions.  We are known to be a country that has the most stringent regulations to such an extent that some of our colleagues in the European Community sometimes think we use these stringent regulations to minimise the level of importation of products from their countries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully accept the Minister's intentions in the matter.  Despite the stringency of the regulations it would appear that outbreaks are spreading in Munster, for instance, right across the province.  Following on that, would he be able to contain the possible infection in that area or does he expect the infection to spread.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that so far as the actual outbreak of samonella infection or poisoning is concerned that is a matter in the first instance, for health authorities.  I do not have that immediate responsibility.  In co-ordination with my colleague I want to assure the Deputy that we are doing everything possible to trace the source. We have been in constant and vigilant contact with the industry.  Until such time as we can trace the source, such actions as I can take as Minister in conjunction with my colleague the Minister for Health can be effectively put in place.  While any outbreak, of course, is a matter of particular concern to us in terms of human health and otherwise, what we are witnessing by contrast with what happens <Col N="125" /> elsewhere from time to time is not a matter of similar seriousness.  I do not want to understate the significance of it at the same time either from a human health point of view or from the point of view of control and regulation of the disease.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the break I illustrated by reference to two planning scandals in County Wicklow, the abuse by the Electricity Supply Board in the case of the Arklow-Carrickmines power line of the board's very considerable powers and devastation of oak woods at Coolattin by a private company, how the mere threat of compensation could be used to haunt objectors to bad and spurious development and how the same threat could render the planning authorities in a county impotent.  I also mentioned how the compensation arrangements had given rise to the arrival on the scene of a whole new genre of undesirable individuals, the speck non-developer and the compensation broker.</P>
      <P>Before the debate adjourned I was saying that codification of compensation provisions was particularly welcome, indeed, it was an improvement which was long overdue.  Not wishing to dwell on areas already covered in earlier contributions I intend to limit my comments to aspects of the Bill which either have not been fully covered or have not been adequately covered or aspects which have been subject to a degree of misrepresentation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One aspect of the Bill which has been largely overlooked is the provision which will allow a planning authority to prioritise a development.  Under section 13 of the Bill and in conjunction with paragraph 3 of the Third Schedule a developer may be refused permission to <Col N="167" /> develop if the development is regarded as premature.  Prematurity will be judged by reference to any order of priority for development indicated in the development plan.  This is a particularly worth-while provision.  It will enable planning authorities to give direction to development. If an area is being ignored for whatever reason, while other areas have become the focus of intensive and excessive development, it will allow the planning authority to focus attention on the otherwise underdeveloped or ignored area.</P>
    <P>This provision can be dependent by a local authority which wishes to direct development without that local authority fearing for compensation.  The potential benefit of this provision in some of our towns and cities is very considerable. More considerable still is the potential of the provision in filling gaps by encouraging infill developments.  In every small town and village of Ireland there are areas which for one reason or another have fallen out of fashion.  By using these provisions, a planning authority could create an area of priority and could direct meaningful and homogeneous development within its planning area.</P>
    <P>It strikes me that much of the criticism of section 13 in conjunction with paragraph 9 of the Third Schedule, though probably well intentioned, has been misdirected. The cut-off date of 20 October seems, on balance, to be a wise one.  This has been the focus of much comment.  By specifying the date of the Bill's publication as opposed to some future date it meant that the Bill has been finally brought in.  The Minister has introduced a degree of certainty and he has eliminated the potential and the possibility of speculation and, indeed, unwarranted speculative development.  A point was made in a contribution earlier regarding the Shamrock Rover's ground.  That particular ground is currently zoned for amenity.  It was zoned for amenity on 20 October 1988.  If Dublin Corporation were to oppose giving a potential developer permission because the application would contravene the development plan <Col N="168" />&mdash; or an objective of the development plan &mdash; at the time of the lands acquisition, the Bill when enacted would protect the corporation from a compensation claim.  That seems to be a very worth-while provision.</P>
    <P>While I have been attentive to the arguments on the issue of the cut-off date I feel that, on balance, such a clear date is desirable in that it creates a degree of certainty for everybody.  Nobody acquiring land at this moment can be under any illusions as to their rights of compensation at a future date.  That is an entirely worth-while provision.</P>
    <P>The inheritance issue which arises here has also been the subject of a degree of misrepresentation.  By and large the inheritors of land are not the type of speculators that we wish to curb.  Speculative development or unwarranted speculative development and inheritance are two separate things.  There is no doubt that inheritors of land can be encouraged to speculate.  The Minister could beef up the Bill's provisions on this particular point in order to take account of some of the more valid submissions that have been made during the debate, but by and large, the provisions on inheritance are good.</P>
    <P>The question of companies also arises here.  An issue has been made out of the fact that the shareholders of a company may change after the due date and this would allow individuals who have no interest in land as of 20 October to acquire an interest which existed at the cut-off date and to gain from that interest.  The point which is either missed or ignored is that it is the company who own the land and that any profit from any development would fall to the company. The company are a separate legal entity from the shareholders and it is very difficult to see how there can be any resolution on this point without making some major change in company law. Some of the arguments which have been made are valid but addressing those arguments would be well nigh impossible.</P>

      <P>It would be interesting to see how we rise to it.

As I mentioned earlier, there is one other form of pollution which should be added to this list and that is noise pollution.  I submit that the Minister should add noise pollution to the list on Committee Stage and I think there would be agreement on all sides of the House for this.</P>

      <P>The provisions in section 14 of the Bill have largely gone unmentioned. There are important provisions in that they deal with the so-called area of undertaking, which lie at the core of the Grange Developments case.  The provisions being proposed here are much more precise than those contained in the present law.  Particularly welcome is the clarification on the rights of third party objectors where undertakings exist.  If the critics read this particular section carefully they will, as I do, welcome it.  These are particularly wise changes.</P>
      <P>I would like to refer to section 21 which deals with the issue of woodlands and tree preservation in depth.  The provisions contained in this section are very important.  Earlier I referred to the destruction of Coolattin Woods and the proposed rape of Tomnafinnoge forest which is Ireland's one remaining oak forest.  Anyone who has travelled on the road towards Shillelagh and noticed that beautiful panoramic view could not be but appalled at the proposals which are being made by a private company to rip that absolutely irreplaceable part of this nation's heritage apart.  I was very pleased, and I referred to this earlier, that the Taoiseach's intervention early last year, an intervention which was approved on all sides of the House helped stem this destruction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="170" /> Section 21 considerably extends the provisions of section 45 of the 1963 Act and provides far greater protection to planning authorities in the context of tree preservation orders and the payment of compensation.  The section contains two highly important provisions.  The first is that the planning authority may from now on, without any fear of compensation, attach conditions to the felling consent requiring the preservation of 20 per cent of trees in woodlands.  There is one point I would like to make here and that is that the law appears to be defective, as we learned to our cost in respect of Coolattin Woods, in the definition of what is a tree. The developer who destroyed Coolattin Woods could claim that he had left a significant proportion of trees standing. If we were to take it that a tree can be a seedling of one and a half inches or the odd sceach bush or a bit of holly here and there it is probably true that up to 80 per cent of the trees in that woodland were preserved but they were not trees in the normal sense of the word.  They were not majestic oaks which is what the planning authority there intended.</P>
    <P>It would be wise to examine this issue and come up with some clear definition as to what is a tree.  When does a sapling become a tree?  We learned to our cost what can happen when clever people attend the law with evil intent.  We should learn from our mistakes because the woodlands at Coolattin can never be replaced.  We have only one oak forest remaining at Tomnafinnoge.  That has rejuvenated itself.  We really should take care on this issue.  The roof of King Henry's chapel at Windsor is held up with oak from Coolattin Woods and, probably, Tomnafinnoge Forest.  The roof of the Stadthaus in Amsterdam is made from oak from that same area.  It is arguable that the masts of some of the great ships in history were made from oak from that area.  It would be a tragedy if a company could wilfully destroy without any thought of anything other than profit that part of this nation's heritage.  It is incumbent on us to protect it.</P>
    <P>The second main provision in section 21 is that in certain circumstances felling <Col N="171" /> consents may require, without compensation, the felling of trees in woodlands phased over a period of up to 20 years.  I would like to see this provision strengthened and a very clearcut policy being pursued.  The present owners of Coolattin Woods would like to fell trees based on strips across the landscape.  That would destroy the canopy of the forest.  I accept that there has to be some harvesting but we need to incorporate in our law very strict regulations which would allow a local authority to ensure that developers are careful and mindful of their responsibilities not just to this generation but to generations to come.  The provisions in section 21 are new and should allow the planning authorities to defend us all against the loss of woodlands.</P>
    <P>In conclusion let me say, and I have said this previously in the House that any Bill introduced in the House can be improved and as I said during the course of another debate no one has a monopoly on wisdom although occasionally that attitude enters into discussions.  I was very pleased that the Minister indicated he would listen attentively to what would be said and if there is any one thing which unites us on this issue it is our wish to finally address the vexed question of compensation and our wish to put our planning authorities in a position where they can plan reasonable development and protect that which we all cherish, without any fear of compensation.  This Bill is a good one, as I have said on several occasions.  I feel it can be improved and I have indicated one or two areas where it can and should be improved.  I am both convinced and confident that the Minister will be mindful of all the suggestions which have been made.</P>
    <P>Before resuming my seat I would like to point out that earlier on some comments were picked up by the microphone which I understand were hurtful to Deputy Begley.  It was not my intention to cast any hurtful reflection on him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>In April of this year the Progressive Democrats introduced their <Col N="172" /> own Planning and Development Bill in this House.  That Bill put forward a series of sincere and serious proposals aimed at eradicating the defects and repairing the deficiencies which had surfaced under the 1963 Planning and Development Act. That Bill won the support of all the Opposition parties and Deputies in this House but it was voted down by the Government. The reason given for this was that the Minister would bring forward a more comprehensive Bill and that that Bill would be before the House before long. On that occasion the Minister said that, acutely aware of the urgency of the issue, they had spent seven months in waiting and that in the meantime the mountain had gone into labour and brought forth a mouse.</P>
      <P>By any standards the Bill before this House on this the first day of December 1988 is nothing more than a pale and timid version of what was proposed in the Progressive Democrats' Bill last April. However, that being said I do not intend to describe this Bill as a Mickey Mouse Bill, even though others have said that about it, because I have far too much regard for Mickey Mouse who takes his job seriously, but I do say that this Bill is not a serious document.  That is becoming patently obvious from the comments made by Members on every side of the House here today, and I have been sitting here since this morning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill is not a serious response to all or any of the issues raised by the Progressive Democrats, raised repeatedly during the course of the debate on that voted down Bill and raised here again this morning and even a moment ago by Deputy Roche.  It is not a serious response to all those issues.  For example, there is no evidence of a serious attempt to deal definitively with the issue of compensation. That was the key issue in our Bill.  It is an issue which has hung like an albatross round the neck of an otherwise highly enlightened Act, the 1963 Act, which by any standards and in terms of the time in which it was enacted can only be described as a radical and most enlightened piece of legislation.  The issue of compensation has been the central <Col N="173" /> issue which has bedevilled the application of that Act during the past 25 years and it is incumbent on all of us to come to terms finally and fully with that issue. The most fundamental weakness in this Bill is that it fails to do that.  Indeed in this respect the most charitable thing which can be said is that the Minister has &ldquo;scotched the snake, not killed it.&rdquo; I am quoting on this occasion from Shakespeare's Macbeth.</P>
    <P>Additionally the crucial problem of unfinished estates has been ignored.  This was a major element in the Progressive Democrats' Bill.  During the course of the debate on that Bill, and again during the debate in this House this morning, speaker after speaker stood up and described in detail the plight and predicament of new home purchasers who have suffered as a result of a small bunch of unprincipled builders who take their money and move out of estates leaving urgent outstanding works undone and leaving helpless mortgage holders with their life long investments devalued.  We in the Progressive Democrats hammered home the need to put in place legislation that would give better protection to future home buyers.  What we argued for was a consumers' charter but our argument fell on deaf ears.  I must ask the Minister why he was afraid to address this issue.  Surely it must be acknowledged that a carefully designed provision incorporated into the law aimed to eliminate the scourge of unfinished estates would protect the honest builder as well as protect the rights of home purchasers. The only people who would suffer as a result would be the small handful of rogue builders who are as much a scourge to the good reputation of the building industry as to the house purchaser.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, this Bill fails to tackle the matter of planning exemption for Government Departments.  The Progressive Democrats recently issued a Bill, the purpose of which is to apply permission and planning law to the State in any development where the State proposes to carry out that development. Under our Bill the State would be obliged to seek planning permission from the <Col N="174" /> local authority to comply with the local development plan and to be amenable to the objections by the local community in exactly the same way as any other private individual or corporation would be.</P>
    <P>The 1963 Local Government (Planning and Development) Act provided that the State should be immune from planning controls.  In this respect our law then became similar to British law.  The reason British law made that provision is that in English law at that time the sovereignty of the Crown and its immunity from local control and local laws was considered to be a cornerstone of the British Constitution. But we live in a democratic Republic with a written Constitution and the State's rights in Ireland have been circumscribed by the Constitution and are regulated by law.  The State cannot arrogate to itself total sovereignty and override community rights, just in the same way as it cannot override individual rights.  The old English Constitution maxim which says &ldquo;The King can do no wrong&rdquo; should have no place in Irish law or in Irish planning law.</P>
    <P>We believe that this Bill offers this House an opportunity to change that state of affairs.  We believe it is high time the Dáil said to the Government and to the various Departments of State: &ldquo;You are just as much subject to the planning laws as any private individual or company&rdquo;. Planning law is very much a matter of protecting community rights. There is no logical or moral force in a law which protects community rights from individuals but allows the executive power in the State or the bureaucracy of the State to be totally exempt.  It matters not to a community who builds a building which destroys the environment or who pollutes their rivers or their foreshores. A strong case was made today by the Members of the Government side of the House against the ESB for the many works they carried out in contravention of what would be deemed good planning. Surely this is the time and place to put that right.  The principle of planning control is to protect the built environment; the identity of the developer is irrelevant <Col N="175" />&mdash; the nature of the development ought to be the only issue.</P>
    <P>In this respect we deplore the failure of this Bill to confront the issue and to remedy it in a satisfactory way.  We believe that there would be nothing but benefit for the community at large if the State was obliged to make a planning application for any development it wishes to carry out; to make that application to the local development authority; to comply with the local development plan and to meet, accommodate and, where necessary, overcome the legitimate objections of others on the same basis as any other person or company.  In short the principle underlining State immunity from planning control is wrong.  Its practice is destructive and the proper occasion on which to remedy that wrong is here and now in this Bill.</P>
    <P>To give an example of what I am saying I can refer to my local authority area in the city of Cork where in recent years the local corporation, conscious of the need for urban renewal, in a street called Grand Parade put together a package which breathed new life into that street. In conjunction with the Cork 800 celebrations they developed from a derlict site a most delightful little park on the side of the street.  This park was beautifully designed, well developed and was put there with a great deal more creativity than just cash.  All of this work was carried out under the unique inspiration of a most enlightened city manager who is no longer with Cork Corporation, Mr. Joe McHugh, and his staff.  This work was carried out to the great pride and satisfaction of the people of Cork.  In conjunction with the provision of this park the whole Grand Parade got a new appearance and we in Cork were beginning to say that some former grandeur had at last been restored to a Grand Parade that had become very tatty and run down over the years.</P>
    <P>Just when we were all beginning to be very pleased with ourselves, central Government decided to locate Government offices in Cork.  In any circumstance Cork city would have been delighted with <Col N="176" /> such development which was long overdue and warmly welcomed.  The only quarrel we had with central Government was that the office block was built exactly across a channel of the river from the Grand Parade.  Into this lovely, newly created, renewed atmosphere was put this great ugly office block, out of scale, out of tune, out of texture and totally out of character and out of harmony with what had been carried out very painstakingly and very tastefully by the local authorities.  Here there is this conflict. The reason for that happening in that place and in that way was that the Department were not compelled to apply to the local planning department for planning permission.  Assuredly, had that been done that office block would have been located elsewhere.  That has happened in my own city.  It has happened only once but that is too often.  In terms of its impact, it is altogether out of scale in every respect.  That should not and must not be allowed to recur, in Cork city or any other city.</P>
    <P>The time has come for us to come to terms with what has been done by State bodies like the ESB.  We are all aware of the manner in which they can run telephone lines through our most beautiful landscape, thereby scarring the face of that landscape.  It is time to put an end to that.  It is also time to face up to the issue that in very many instances local authorities can be the worst polluters, of rivers, of foreshores.  That is something which has been tolerated over a number of years.  Within the provisions of this Bill it is time to put in place legislation that will not allow that to continue any longer and insist on its enforcement.  All we have, facing into the end of this century and looking to the next, is a country which is unique and the envy of a number of European countries.  By universal standards, we have clean air, relatively clean water and a relatively unspoilt landscape. Let us, for God's sake, hold on to that and let us legislators and those who are entrusted to become legislators put in place a package of measures that will protect that gift.  It is the least that we can offer to the next generation.  The duty <Col N="177" /> is ours; the opportunity is ours.  Let us do it now.  Now is the time for us to bring the State, State bodies and semi-State bodies within the ambit of the planning laws, within the ambit of local authority development plans and local plans.  If we do that we will have done a great favour to the physical fabric of our country for the next generation.</P>
    <P>That brings me to the issue of compensation. On reading the memorandum to this Bill, one would have believed that the Minister had met all the demands made, and coped finally and fully with the issue of compensation.  Unfortunately, in the Bill there is a contradiction, a glaring paradox &mdash; a classic example that one should not judge the book by the cover. In relation to this Bill one should not judge the text by the Memorandum.  The issue of compensation is a critical one which must be put right now if we are serious about giving to the next 25 years what the framers of the 1963 Act gave to the last 25 years.  In terms of their time, they did their best.  We, with hindsight, have an obligation to put in place all-embracing legislation which will deal fully, finally and definitely with the issue of compensation.</P>
    <P>When the Progressive Democrats introduced a Bill last April into Dáil Éireann to deal with a planning compensation scandal, among other issues, we provided that one of the reasons for which compensation would be excluded in the case of a refusal of planning permission would be where the proposed development would materially contravene a development objective of the county, or borough development plan. That has been echoed in the memorandum to this Bill.  However, at the time the Progressive Democrats issued their own explanatory memorandum which set out their arguments in detail. We believe these arguments to be sound and a fair resumé of the law for the time being, to the effect that the Constitution does not require compensation in the case of refusal of planning permission where the development of the subject matter of the application is, in fact, a breach of the development plan.  It is our view that <Col N="178" /> the Constitution recognises explicitly the right of the State and the community at large to regulate private property rights in the interests of the common good.</P>
    <P>In the case of real property including land and buildings, the permissible regulation of property rights takes the form of a set of property and planning laws which apply for the time being.  The State, under the Constitution, is obliged to protect property rights against unjust attack.  It is not obliged to compensate every person whose property rights are affected by legitimate legislation introduced for furthering the common good. The nature of the attack in respect of which the State owes an obligation to a property owner is that it must be unjust in law.  The State is not obliged to provide any system of protection or compensation in the case of legitimate curtailment of property rights.  How can it be argued that the implementation of a development plan which is carefully arrived at under the complex procedures of the Planning Acts amount to an unjust attack on property rights?  Indeed, it has long been accepted that property has its duties as well as it rights.</P>
    <P>In a complex modern society the fact that one owns, say, agricultural land does not carry with it an unqualified right to build a city, a town, a factory or a chemical plant on that land.  The environment is the property of all citizens.  Individual rights to exploit or develop small holdings of land can come into conflict with the general community right to have an orderly, pleasant and humane environment in which to live.  The resolution of that conflict is a matter for law and a law which is designed bona fide to resolve that conflict in the interests of the common good and with due regard for the property rights of the individual is a fair law and cannot amount to an unjust attack on property.  For these reasons, the Progressive Democrats propose to amend the law of planning compensation so as to exclude compensation where the application was for a development which would materially contravene the development plan.</P>
    <P>At the time when we introduced this <Col N="179" /> Bill, the Minister indicated that he accepted the principle of our arguments. He did not raise any constitutional argument against the principal features of our Bill which were to make the development plan work and give it legal superiority over development rights of the individual. Now, in the Third Schedule of this Bill which the Minister has introduced, it is provided at paragraph (9) that compensation will not be payable where the refusal of permission concerns a development which would amount to a contravention of a development plan. However, hidden away in the third paragraph in the Third Schedule in this Bill is a time bomb which completely invalidates the merits of the Bill, undoes its purpose and contradicts what is said in the memorandum.  It provides that the exclusion of compensation for the refusal of planning permission will apply only to a development which contravenes a development plan and only where the land has changed hands subsequent to 20 October 1988.  The Bill therefore specifically preserves for the present owners the right to claim compensation.  There are a great many present owners out there in the wings waiting to claim compensation. They had good reason to be worried during the past few months when this Bill was in the course of preparation but they will now have relaxed, knowing full well that they have nothing to fear.  The Bill specifically preserves for present owners the right to claim compensation.  More extraordinarily, it preserves the right to claim compensation for the heirs of all present owners or persons who are given lands by present owners under family settlements.  That is the nub of our disagreement with the Bill.  As Hamlet would have put it, there is the rub.  This is the fatal flaw in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Even worse than that, the effect of Article 9 of the Third Schedule is effectively to provide that where land is now held by a company as long as it remains the property of that company the right to compensation will continue in perpetuity. That is because the company will be the applicant and will have acquired its <Col N="180" /> interest in the land prior to 20 October 1988.  The shares in the company, which really show who are beneficial owners of the company as opposed to the artificial corporate ownership of the land by the company, can change hands at any time after 20 October 1988 perhaps for greatly inflated values because of the entitlement to claim compensation.  But that will not amount to an acquisition by the company of the land after 20 October 1988.  It will merely amount to a change in the ownership of the shares of the company. That will not affect the right to compensation. That is the second major weakness in this part of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The effect of Article 9 of the Third Schedule is that while it appears to concede what was asked for by the Progressive Democrats and others, that is the superiority of the county or city development plan over the right to claim compensation for planning permission refusals, the particular provision is comouflaging a deliberate retreat by this Government.  The effect of the Third Schedule, and in particular of Article 9, is to preserve the right of existing property owners, their sons, heirs and shareholders and the future shareholders of companies which own property in perpetuity.</P>
    <P>That is exactly the opposite of what has been stated to be the major objective of the Bill.  It is exactly the opposite to what was sought by the Progressive Democrats when they brought their draft Bill before the Dáil last April.  That is the major flaw in the Bill.  While there are a number of extremely good and welcome features in this Bill, this is the provision which will put us in the position where we have no option but to vote against it.  The taxpayers have paid out far too much already in compensation to clever speculators who know how to manipulate loopholes in the planning law.  There is no way we can saddle that obligation on another generation of taxpayers for the next 25 years.  I regret that a number of other very good features in the Bill stand to be eclipsed because of that fatal flaw and the other two I mentioned.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="181" /> I welcome the effort made by the Minister's Department to address the trees and woodlands issue.  I am particularly pleased by the manner in which that is being done.  A number of other very good features have been incorporated in the Bill as well, but taking it overall as a comprehensive piece of legislation, it certainly is no charter to take the people of this country, private individuals and house developers, into the 21st century. By any standard it is not a people's charter. It is wide open to become a speculator's charter, a developer's charter.  The Fianna Fáil Party have left themselves wide open to the charge that they are still in some way afraid to take on the developers, the rogue builders, the cute and clever speculators.  It will be said that the captain's lady and Judy O'Grady are sisters under the skin.  That is a pity.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamLawlor" hpid="Mr. Lawlor Mr. Lawlor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lawlor</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to speak on this Bill as an elected member of Dublin County Council, who have been faced with the brunt of the problems this House has been addressing.  All previous speakers have referred to the difficulties which have arisen because of the very serious compensation claims with which local authorities have had to contend.  Dublin County Council have had to contend with the bulk of spurious and totally unacceptable compensation claims.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is some concern that the Minister has not adequately covered many of the difficulties with which we as a local authority have been faced.  In hindsight wisdom is always available in abundance. We had to face the brunt of the Nora Shortt case which was referred to by Deputy Shatter.  The lessons to be learned from that and from work currently in hand in County Dublin highlight some of the own goals we have been scoring in allowing some of these claims to come forward by virtue of our intentions with regard to long-term planning. We in County Dublin are at a very advanced stage in reviewing the county development plan.  When one reads the documentation about the satellite towns and the difficulties that have arisen, the disappointments and the lack of progress <Col N="182" /> in some respects, one discovers that at the heart of many of the compensation problems is the failure to provide for services underground well in advance of development, such as in the Nora Shortt case.  The satellite town of Tallaght was to be serviced by main drainage which was going through the Dodder Valley, the line of least resistance.  We had correctly and properly designated such a scenic and high amenity area of passive recreational use, but because the availability of services was an integral part of the potential linear parkland along the river a detailed legal argument arose in court.</P>
    <P>One must be very critical of decisions which have been handed down on this subject by various justices.  Mr. Justice McCarthy of the Supreme Court made very worthwhile speeches at summer seminars, away from the practical reality of the court, about what should and should not be done.  The reason we have this crunch problem is that some right-wing decisions have been handed down in the courts, completely overriding the wording of the Constitution which provides that the common good should prevail over personal or individual rights.  It is frustrating and infuriating that this has happened.  For the past ten or 15 years the whole debate on this subject has been brought back to the question of whether this or that is constitutional.  Legislation has been queried on the basis of case law, which I believe is very suspect <i>vis-à-vis</i> the common good.  Decisions handed down have rewritten the rules and guidelines. We have a view on this matter.</P>
    <P>This House can be criticised by all and sundry for its decisions and it is rightly open to public scrutiny.  These decisions cannot be rescinded.  Barristers use them to justify the payment of compensation claims.  Some legal people have donned a mantle of expertise in this area and are much in demand to deal with cases of this kind.  The Judiciary accept the arguments of these experts while 500,000 people in County Dublin lack elementary facilities and Dublin County Council are faced with compensation claims running into millions of pounds.  How, in the name of <Col N="183" /> God, can a judge accept that this is in the common good?  We cannot finish what we started in 1972.  The position defies reason and logic but it is fact.</P>
    <P>We are now nit-picking about whether the legislation is constitutional and the Minister and the parliamentary draftsmen have tried to frame the Bill based on decisions of the court.  Perhaps decisions in the future may be more enlightened.  A case involving a compensation claim for £2 million will come up before the Supreme Court and the local authority will incur substantial legal costs to argue the various points.  We will argue that the &ldquo;common good&rdquo; clause should override the claim for the £2 million compensation which cannot be justified.</P>
    <P>To be fair, the amount of compensation paid to date has been very small although the impression is given from time to time, particularly in newspaper articles, that millions have been paid out.  A case for compensation that is lost does not merit the same attention. In this Bill, the Minister has tried to help local authorities who are confronted with compensation claims.  This particularly applies to Dublin County Council in relation to services.  The vast amount of compensation claims are built around the availability of sanitary and water services. The provision for surplus capacity in future years and for connections are also taken into account.</P>
    <P>I should like to see a number of issues considered on Committee Stage although it is not the function of this side of the House to put down amendments.  Section 14 should apply to all current claims and notice should be given within two months of the signing of the Bill into law.  The county manager should be empowered to specify a development which would contravene the plan.  I fully accept the points the Minister made that zoning terminology did not arise in the Planning Act, 1963, and that it is a much maligned word.  The Department, in consultation with local authorities, should consider in detail the request for the statutory five year review of development plans and <Col N="184" /> maybe curtail the intent of the longer term planning.  Times have changed so dramatically that some of the problems over the past ten or 15 years will not arise in future because, as Seán Lemass said when he spoke on this subject, the way to control the price of building land is to service more than you need.  We have now reached that stage in County Dublin. Exorbitant values were put on land in the past ten or 15 years, mainly because of scarcity and, if you could prove that connections could be made to limited drainage facilities, you were in a unique position.</P>
    <P>The question of zoning land and development is too broad to enact into detailed legislation because very often, in a co-operative way, we change our minds.  Dublin County Council first introduced the 1972 development plan, we reviewed it in 1979 and it was not completed until 1983.  We still have problems in this area.  We have a very large Dublin Corporation housing land bank which is serviced, with roads laid.  Unfortunately, the weeds are growing all over them. That was not the case ten years ago when there was a great shortage of serviced land.</P>
    <P>The planning manager, who was confronted with compensation claims, in written documentation to the county council, highlighted dramatic changes and emphasised different areas from those in 1972.  This is because of changing circumstances in Dublin city where we have to accommodate the substantial population growth.  There are in the region of 8,000 to 10,000 young couples on the housing list and County Dublin has had to bear the brunt of development although the Minister's Department provided resources for facilities.</P>
    <P>As elected members of the council we may now consider changing some of the corporation designated residential land to amenity land.  I know they love to hear that in City Hall but that may be our decision because it is now a wilderness, not in use and will not be built on.  There is a substantial drainage system in the Tallaght area and the bulk of the land involved is owned by the local authority. <Col N="185" /> There is no likelihood of it being built on.  What do we do?  Do we sit on the resource indefinitely or do we try to utilise it by changing strategy?  These are some of the issues the Minister's Department should be addressing because in time the problem could be solved.  If there is a repeat of compensation claims in the satellite town areas, if surplus capacity is available and if connections can be made, the Minister will be faced with a dilemma in trying to deal with sanitary services.  I appeal to the Minister to try to embrace all current claims and to improve the legislation on Committee Stage to deal with that situation.  It would certainly take a large financial threat away from Dublin County Council and would avoid having to provide certain sums in our Estimates for these claims and for very high level costs associated with them.</P>
    <P>Section 14 of the Bill states that the rules of arbitration should be amended to include a requirement that the arbitrator is not empowered to assume that services are available to a site if there is no permission in regard to that land. Neither should he be allowed to value the land for any development other than zoned use.  I know the Minister, in his Second Stage speech, has dealt in some detail with the problems of land for zoned use.  Perhaps some formula can be found and the current five year plan could then be reviewed.  Pressure is put on planning authorities to be much more specific in their development plans.  The planning department can be criticised for certain zonings and for attempting to control developments while at the same time they do not deliver on what they have committed themselves to.  There is a need for improvement in that area.</P>
    <P>We should amend paragraph 12 by inserting the words: &ldquo;Regard should be had to any permission under the Principal Act to develop the land existing at the date of claim for compensation or at the time compensation is agreed or determined.&rdquo; It is stated in the Second Schedule that in certain instances permissions have expired during the duration of the claims.  If this Bill is passed into law, <Col N="186" /> hopefully claims will be dealt with promptly. In paragraph 9 it is suggested that the date should be omitted or that if any date is to be inserted it should be 1 October 1984 when zoning becomes compulsory under the 1963 Act.  In that Act we should try to tighten up the definition of zoning.  That would improve the legislation.  As the Minister said, the definition of zoning is far too broad and it is very difficult to specify it in detail in legislation.</P>
    <P>The Bill does not deal with national monument sites or lands within the red alert areas of airports and runways.  I know there is no major airport in Deputy Connolly's area and he might not recognise the urgency of this matter.  Difficulties arise consistently regarding the international airport in Dublin.  Planning discussions have taken place at council level <i>vis-à-vis</i> the flight path.  A major extension is well under way at the airport and as a result there will be further requirements regarding the safety of the flight path and so on.  Perhaps a provision could be inserted in the Bill to deal with that matter.</P>
    <P>Many claims for compensation have been made due to the lack of flexibility in the planning department.  There has been constructive criticism from legitimate representatives in the construction sector.  In County Dublin we embarked on a colossal undertaking in 1972.  We endeavoured to develop three satellite towns.  We put forward projections and said we would populate Tallaght to 100,000 and would do the same with Clondalkin, Lucan and Blanchardstown. We hoped to complete the development of the satellite towns by 1991.  That theoretical planning concept was put forward at the time.  Now some time later much positive progress has been made.  It is very frustrating for one who represents two of those satellite towns to hear negative criticisms from those who do not know enough about them.</P>
    <P>In Deputy Quinn's contribution he referred to Tallaght.  I can understand why somebody would criticise Tallaght and the lack of resources there.  That is not the fault of the planning system but <Col N="187" /> rather the lack of co-ordinated development. We did not have people with responsibility to finish the job they started.  Deputy Quinn's party leader, when he was in office, made a very encouraging decision to appoint a development co-ordinator.  I can only assume that the appointment was prevented by inner managerial arguments. The position was never filled and therefore there was no co-ordination of development in County Dublin.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I can confirm that the Deputy is absolutely right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamLawlor" hpid="Mr. Lawlor Mr. Lawlor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lawlor</NameTxt>
      <P>I found that very frustrating and annoying.  The Departments of Justice, Health and Education would have been involved in providing the facilities so badly needed for these satellite towns.  The question of land ownership then arose and as a result the local authority owned a percentage of the proposed town centre development area in Tallaght. There were haggles about funds, disposal of land and so on.  It has been a very frustrating experience to see these large populated satellite towns at various stages of development when much more could be achieved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We now have a great opportunity to do something about this matter.  While we are critical of the position regarding the satellite towns it should be a constructive criticism.  About £400 million or £500 million of taxpayers money has gone into local authority and private housing. There has been vast investment in the provision of recreational facilities.  Some Government Departments have done very little in this area, for example, the Department of Health as regards the provision of a hospital.  Then there was the disgraceful decision of the Department of Education not to proceed with at least one third level college in a catchment area of about 500,000 people.  More recently the Department of Education instructed the corporation to allow them <Col N="188" /> to dispose of, for other uses, the reserved site for the third level college.  This lack of progress and dynamic planning has created many arguments about land use and so on and has led to compensation claims being made.</P>
    <P>While the Minister has gone as far as his advice allows him to go, there is a lot more that could be done particularly regarding the implementation of the development plans.  It is absolutely unacceptable &mdash; I blame the local authority for this &mdash; that we should start reviewing the 1972 plan in 1979 and not conclude it until 1983.  Land usage might change. There may be much greater potential for recreational use even on a temporary basis.  For example, there are vast areas of residentially-zoned tracts of land in parts of County Dublin which could be put to temporary use, on a five-year basis, for amenity or park development.</P>
    <P>There will be many interesting amendments tabled for Committee Stage.  It would be my hope that the ridiculous conditions confronting local authorities would be redressed in the forthcoming legislation.</P>

      <P>Deputy Quinn has given me notice of his intention to raise on the Adjournment matters appertaining to the preparation of programmes for submission to Brussels and the exclusion of public representatives at local level from participation in their formulation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, I must first thank you for having facilitated me in this matter.  I realise there are many demands made on you for matters to be raised on the Adjournment.  Therefore, it is with appreciation that I want to place on the record of the House a concern of mine which has obtained for some time past, effectively over the past year.  I <Col N="189" /> appreciate also that the Minister for Finance is here in his new capacity and with his new portfolio.</P>
      <P>My submission is that, for whatever reason, perhaps a variety &mdash; on which I can speculate only &mdash; we are in danger of shooting ourselves severely in the foot in relation to maximising what we would otherwise be entitled to obtain from the EC and that the whole process of the preparation and presentation of the integrated programmes within the EC has been clouded in secrecy, compounded by incompetency and extraordinary amateurism.</P>
      <P>It has to be remembered that we are talking about a unique, historic opportunity of a once-off investment spoken of by the Minister for Foreign Affairs according to <i>The Irish Times</i> reportage of his meeting with the Council of Europe &mdash; of some £4,000 million.  Were anybody else to suggest that we would have seven <i>ad hoc</i> regions lumped together or that the preparation of planning in relation to them would be entrusted to three military officers on secondment from the Army or that three planners from, say, Dublin Corporation were to be seconded to the Army, there would be public outcry. People would ask what planners know about the Army.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Neither should we be subjected to the tyranny of people who fail to get something raised on the Adjournment themselves.</P>
      <P>My argument is that this country at present seriously runs the risk of significantly losing out on funds to which it would otherwise be entitled.  One of the reasons for my so contending is that the Department of Finance, who are in control of this process, have chosen deliberately to exclude public participation in the preparation of these programmes at local level.  I shall cite evidence to back-up this claim as I progress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Everybody knows, and the proponents of the programme for 1992 freely admit, <Col N="190" /> that there will be winners and losers in the process of completion of the Internal Market but it was indicated at all stages that the losers would be compensated by the enlarged Structural Funds that would be applied in a new manner, under a new system of administration in the various regions affected.</P>
    <P>At national level we constitute a top priority.  The former Minister for Finance has announced already that the country will be divided into seven sub-regions each having working groups of representatives of Government Departments, State bodies, local authority managements, that these will prepare operational programmes for the seven regions and that the European Commission will work in close liaison with those working groups.  The advisory groups, in turn, will accept submissions from interested bodies and individuals and make recommendations on the content of the development programmes. While I do not agree with the sub-division of the country, the preparation of the integrated plan announced by the Minister of State with responsibility for European Affairs, Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn, on 12 October 1987 is proceeding at a snail's pace and, in some cases, is outrageously behind any kind of a serious timescale.</P>
    <P>Effectively the problem is that, because the Department of Finance want to ensure there will be no extra public expenditure incurred by the Exchequer, they are dampening down specific programmes and refusing to allow others to surface in some of the draft programmes at present being prepared.</P>
    <P>My second contention is that public representatives or local authorities at local level, deliberately or otherwise &mdash; and it is for the Minister to state otherwise &mdash; are being excluded from this process. In some cases the advisory groups who are supposed to meet with the working parties have had absolutely desultory or nominal encounters.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>It should be remembered <Col N="191" /> that we are talking about millions of pounds of taxpayers' money that would be spent in this country.  I have spoken separately to county managers around the country who regard the entire process as a total farce.</P>
      <P>While having regard to the rules of parliamentary language and procedure I would have to say that, for whatever reason, the present Government are engaged in one of the greatest political scams of all time.  I feel confident putting my case to the incoming Minister because it will be his task to re-examine this whole process.</P>
      <P>To cite another example to back up my argument, I might add that the consultants preparing the programme for the greater Dublin area have earned up to £300,000 while there remains a group of public planners in Dublin city and county who have nothing to do because there is little or no development going on in their areas while, for the remainder of Leinster, a consultancy group was appointed for a fraction of that cost.  I might add, neither is there any apparent procedure for tendering in relation to these consultancy reports.</P>
      <P>There is absolute chaos in the administration of the process.  While I do not have anything against the competency of the three military gentlemen who have been assigned this task, it seems to me to be absolutely extraordinary that there should be under-utilised local authority administrators or planners in one area twiddling their thumbs while there are others who must learn on the job and prepare a plan to be ready by 31 March next.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot understand the reason for the secrecy.  I sought to have the matter raised in this House.  I issued a number of statements before and after August this year, for example, on one occasion on 18 November 1988 in the <i>Labour Councillor</i> newsletter for members of local authorities about what I regard as the real scandal about EC funds and likewise, in another of those newsletters on 17 September, 1987.  I issued a press statement on 31 August 1988 in which I described the role of the Department of Finance having been put in charge of this <Col N="192" /> entire matter as, effectively, &ldquo;putting the fox in charge of the chickens&rdquo;.  Let me explain why.  The only area in which this Government have succeeded in substantially cutting public expenditure has been on the capital account.</P>
    <P>I hesitate to use the word &ldquo;lying&rdquo;, but misinformation has been furnished by the Minister for Foreign Affairs to the effect that we could qualify for 75 per cent intervention.  We will get 75 per cent intervention from the EC if we can prove additionality.  Jim Curry, who is a personal friend of mine, with whom I have had meetings in Brussels, has told me that he has told officials in this city to their face that it is ridiculous what the Department of Finance are endeavouring to do at present, suggesting that existing programmes will qualify for 75 per cent funding when they will not be eligible because the requirement of net additional activity will not be met.</P>
    <P>The Minister knows quite well that officials in Brussels are not idiots.  They know what are the public capital programmes of our semi-State companies and local authorities.  For example, they know what the Department of Finance have done in relation to the roads programme. For example, they know the Department of Finance have consistently refused to tell the chairman of the National Roads Authority how much net money will be put into the roads programme for the next three years.  On that basis we will not qualify for the 75 per cent intervention; we shall be lucky if we get 55 per cent.</P>
    <P>The Minister should not treat the rest of this House with contempt.  We are not idiots.  We have been around.  We have been in Brussels.  We know the local authorities. We are talking to the people and we know what is going on.  Because the Government want to keep the books straight, they cannot run away with the ball and pretend that everything is happening. It is not happening.</P>
    <P>This situation has caused the anger with which I am animated this evening. This is about something which is much bigger than balancing the books for the next year and a half to keep interest rates to a certain level.  We will never again in this century get the opportunity to get <Col N="193" /> this massive transfer of resources from the European Community.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>We have hundreds of qualified people, some with degrees and some without degrees, but all with expertise.  I am thinking of county managers who know precisely what needs to be done in terms of infrastructure which is the obvious area of disparity in competition between ourselves and the rest of the Community in terms of access to markets.  These people with their wisdom, knowledge and experience are being deliberately excluded at one level and are being effectively insulted at another by the perfunctory process of consultation that is going on.  That is happening because a group of people in the Department of Finance who would not know their way to the Naas Road are trying to decide what is good for the rest of the country in terms of regional development.  It is absolutely scandalous.</P>
      <P>The very presence of the Minister for Finance here and not that of the Minister for the Environment who is supposed to have responsibility for the co-ordination of these programmes is proof positive, if it were needed, that the sop given to the unfortunate man who cannot dispel the smog from Dublin city was nothing more than a sop.  This is part and parcel of the scam.  The Department of Finance are running this show.  Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn who has nominal responsibility in the Taoiseach's Department is the acceptable face of this scam.  The real people are the Department of Finance who are simultaneously a department for the budget and a department for enconomic expansion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Department for the budget they are doing a very good job.  They have taken very many painful decisions many of which I disagree with but they have to be complimented for making those decisions with courage.  However, the Department cannot simultaneously adopt that role and look after economic expansion.  A specific example is that the Department of Finance, who know so much about transportation, wrote into the terms of reference for the consultants <Col N="194" /> for the greater Dublin area that the DART in any shape, size or form was not to feature as a recommendation in the conclusions.  The Department are nobbling the conclusions of independent consultants who are being paid something like £300,000, before they report because the Department of Finance bitterly opposed the DART from its very outset.</P>
    <P>The only way that many of the people in Tallaght, who were referred to by Deputy Lawlor will get any access to the part-time jobs available in the city centre is by having a cheap reliable and safe system of transport.  The DART is that system.  We are now committed to diesel-related projects which on top of everything else will compound the smog problems of the Minister's colleague.</P>
    <P>I am so angry about the effective robbery that is going on that I am convoluted in the presentation of my argument.  I could go on for an hour citing chapter and verse as to specific instances where the Department of Finance, in trying to protect their position as the department of the budget, are preventing people from actually spending money that would benefit this country.  Another instance is that Wexford County Council had a letter which the Department of Finance sent to all local authorities basically telling them that under no circumstances were they to go to Brussels and that if they were to go to Brussels they were to tell the Department of Finance in advance who they were going to talk to and meet and they were to undertake no commitments of any kind.  That is financial terrorism. Elsewhere in the Community the County Council of Kent which is on the receiving end of the Channel Tunnel between France and Britain, and the department of Pas du Calais Nord, have formed a joint group which are regularly being feted in Brussels because the Commission in Brussels want to do business with local authorities.  Brussels recognise that in the past the Regional Fund was ripped off by national Departments of Finance in all 12 member states.</P>

    <P>We have a new Minister for Finance whom I wish every success in what is undoubtedly a very unenviable task.  As a consequence of the completion of the internal market we will have losers in 1992.  Everybody accepts that.  The only way the Community at large will compensate us is by providing the possibility of an even field with the rest of the Community. I know from my contacts that other parts of Europe such as Portugal, Spain and parts of Greece have got their act together in terms of applying for limited funds under priority objective No. 1 and, unlike the operation of the funds previously, we are not guaranteed any <Col N="196" /> quota.  We will simply be treated on the same basis as any other region.  There is no automatic guarantee that we will get the money simply because we come from this area unless we have the proper programmes prepared.  Brussels has repeatedly said they want to have local participation in the formulation of these programmes.  Brussels knows this debate is taking place this afternoon and know there is no such thing as local participation.</P>

      <P>I congratulate Deputy Quinn on his persistence in raising this matter.  I have two concerns.  First, I think a mistake has been made in the way the regions have been drawn up.  Louth should have been included in the Border region and Dublin should not have been cut off from Meath, Kildare and Wicklow, which are part of its natural hinterland. That is bad for both.  One of the regions, namely the mid-west, has a development authority &mdash; SFADCo &mdash; while the rest of the regions have no such authority and are simply <i>ad hoc</i> regions with no administrative structure to deliver the goods.</P>
      <P>Second there is not sufficient involvement of the business community.  A member representing the Commission at an address in Cork recently stated that the involvement of the private sector &mdash; by which he meant trade unions including private business &mdash; was fundamental to the acceptability of the plans and that the advisory capacity in which these people are working is not good enough so far as maximising our aid is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At governmental level there is confusion. There is an unholy trinity of responsibility &mdash; Minister Geoghegan-Quinn with some responsibility, Minister <Col N="197" /> Flynn with new responsibility and Minister Reynolds with primary responsibility. I do not think that division is sensible.  While I would not go along with all the criticisms levelled against the Department of Finance by Deputy Quinn, it is important that somebody should have clear and accountable responsibility for this area.</P>
    <P>I am very glad that I have been afforded the opportunity to make this contribution, thanks to Deputy Quinn. My last point is that there is a danger, because of the accent on local authorities, that this will be another project related plan for the economy.  We do not need another shopping list of projects.  We need current and capital expenditure to be examined to see what makes our economy grow rather than another list of projects drawn up by engineers.  I hope this plan does not have an overdominance of engineering considerations but has much more emphasis on the software of the economy and what actually makes people invest and prosper.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Reynolds) Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to assure Deputy Quinn and Deputy Bruton that there is no confusion on this side of the House as to how we are proceeding in this regard.  If there is any confusion, it is in the minds of members of other parties.  We have no intention of shooting ourselves in the foot, and I can assure the House we will maximise the funds we hope to get out of Brussels.</P>
      <P>The EC Regulations which have been agreed at Council level envisage a new set of procedures for the operation of the Structural Funds.  I hope what I am about to say will help to enlighten Deputy Quinn, although maybe I will not assuage his fears.  He is entitled to his own views on this but I hope what I have to say will go some way towards doing away with some of the confusion that exists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The use of the funds is to be planned on a multi-annual basis.  The first stage is for each region to draw up a development plan.  Since Ireland is one region for Structural Funds purposes, this development plan will be at national level.  It is likely to cover the period 1989-1993.  It will set out our priorities for expenditure in the areas which can be assisted by <Col N="198" /> the Structural Funds' resources.  The EC Commission will consider this plan and determine the extent to which it is willing to provide assistance from the Structural Funds.  This will be set out in what is to be called a Community Support Framework.</P>
    <P>The final stage is the programmes, which will set out in detail how the objectives set out in the plan will be implemented.  These will be submitted by the national authorities and will have to be approved by the Commission.</P>
    <P>The administrative arrangements which have been adopted for the preparation and co-ordination of the sub-regional programmes are as follows. First, a Committee of Ministers and departmental secretaries, chaired by the Taoiseach, will have responsibility for overseeing the implementation of new structural fund arrangements.</P>
    <P>Second, a working group representative of the relevant Government Departments, assisted as appropriate by the relevant State bodies, together with the management of all county councils and county borough corporations in the subregion and the EC Commission will be responsible for the preparation of the operational programme for each of the subregions.  Third, each working group will prepare their operational programme in close liaison with a separate advisory group for the subregion which will be composed of all the main representative bodies with an interest in development &mdash; CII, CIF, chambers of commerce, one to represent all in the subregion, ICTU, FUE, IFA, ICMSA, ICOS and Macra na Feirme &mdash; as well as the county councils, county borough corporations, borough corporations and urban district councils over 15,000 population in the subregion which will be represented by the chairman in each case.  These advisory groups will accept submissions from interested persons and groups and, on the basis of such submissions and their own thinking, will make recommendations to the working group on the content of the programmes. They will also have an opportunity to comment on the programmes as they are being prepared by the working groups.</P>
    <P>Final responsibility for the content of <Col N="199" /> these programmes will rest with the Government in order to ensure consistency between them and they will be submitted to Brussels by my Department. There will be scope for feed-back from the subnational programmes to the national development plan and the national programmes and <i>vice versa.</i></P>
    <P>The chairpersons and secretariat of the working groups are being provided by my Department.  Deputy Quinn raised a question about three members of the Army.  Those three members will be acting as secretaries to the working groups, and they are very efficient people and well qualified to act in that capacity. It is expected that the advisory groups will select their own chairpersons.</P>
    <P>It will be evident from these arrangements that locally elected representatives will be fully involved in the preparation of the programmes.  Apart from the direct participation in the advisory groups by the various local authority chairmen I have mentioned, other local representatives will have an opportunity to influence the preparation of programmes by making their own submissions to the groups.  They are also in a position to convey their views to the relevant city or county manager as appropriate.</P>
    <P>I would also like to draw Deputies' attention to the time constraints under which these programmes are being prepared. It is intended that the national development plan will be submitted to the Commission as early as possible in 1989 and by 31 March 1989 at the latest &mdash; which is the date specified in the relevant EC Regulation.  The EC Commission will complete the Community Support Framework, which will set out the extent to which the Commission is willing to provide assistance from Structural Funds in respect of the national development plan, within six months of receipt of the plan, though it is to be hoped that less time will be needed.  It is hoped that the operational programmes can be submitted at the same time as, or <Col N="200" /> as soon as possible after, the National Development Plan.</P>
    <P>This is the first time that local interests will be directly involved in preparing programmes to be assisted by the EC Structural Funds.  Indeed, it is the first time that Ireland has involved itself in subnational programmes.  These innovations should produce worthwhile benefits.  The involvement of local interests will not only give people a voice in the formulation of the programme for their region, but should also generate a momentum of enthusiasm and enterprise which are essential ingredients in the development process.</P>
    <P>Deputy Quinn mentioned the intervention rate.  The maximum intervention rate is 75 per cent.  He seems to suggest that unless the Government put up a lot more money we will not get the higher funds.  He seems to ignore the fact that private sector money as well as local community money can be very heavily involved.  The rate of intervention is not set where there are revenue bearing projects, and it is open to the Commission to decide on the basis of each project what the intervention rate will be.</P>
    <P>I had discussions with senior officials from Brussels yesterday and I have to say quite honestly that I do not share the real concerns Deputy Quinn espoused here this evening.  There is regular to-ing and fro-ing between the officials from my Department and the officials in Brussels and there is a special liaison committee set up between the Commission and the Irish Government to ensure that everything goes smoothly and that we are in a position to maximise the funds.  I do not have the terms of reference mentioned in front of me but I will look at them when I go back.  I hope what I have said will go some way to alleviate the fears expressed here this evening.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5.30 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 6 December 1988.</P>

      <P>Statistical records of tax payments by vocational category or by range of tax paid are not maintained to enable the precise information requested by the Deputy to be given.  However, from the <Col N="132" /> latest relevant statistics which are available it is estimated that the number of farmers who paid income tax up to 7 June 1988 in respect of 1985-86 was 22,200. The corresponding estimate for 1986-87 at the same date is 20,000.  Both of these numbers are likely to increase over time as final liability is settled in cases still under appeal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. R. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 54 and 56 together.</P>
      <P>I am advised by the registrar that the report referred to by the Deputy was not made public because it was a confidential document commissioned by the then registrar to assist him in performing his supervisory and regulatory functions pursuant to the Industrial and Provident Societies (Amendment) Act, 1978.</P>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to a very recent decision in the High Court on 21 November 1988 in the matter of a discovery application by the official liquidator of the PMPS.  It was ordered, <i>inter alia,</i> that the liquidator give an undertaking that he would use the report for the purposes of the liquidation, and the litigation, only and that he would not disclose it to anyone unless it were necessary to do so for the purposes of the liquidation and the litigation.  It was also ordered that on the conclusion of the liquidation the material provided should be destroyed.</P>
      <P>In 1974 when the problem of unsupervised deposit taking societies first came to notice the question of dealing with the problems by making appropriate amendments to the Central Bank Act, 1971, was considered, i.e. bringing deposit taking societies within the scope of that Act. However as the societies in question had developed outside the Central Bank's control they could not have lived up to its technical licensing requirements if brought in immediately under its control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government's concern about the activities of these societies was demonstrated by the enactment of the Industrial and Provident Societies Act, 1978, the main aim of which was to wind down the activities of deposit taking societies. The constitutionality of the 1978 Act was <Col N="139" /> immediately challenged by PMPS and another person.  In 1981, the High Court found in favour of the Minister and the Act.  The Supreme Court confirmed the decision on appeal in May 1983.  The dangers associated with this type of society were spelt out in the course of the court cases as they had been when the legislation was being promoted.</P>
    <P>The Supreme Court in its judgement drew attention to the High Court finding in 1981 that the reason for the prohibition in the 1978 Act was that the societies were operating a substantial banking business outside the control of the Central Bank without regard to the principle of sound banking practice and because the general public who placed money on deposit with them was at risk.  These statements were made in the Oireachtas and the courts; depositors in PMPS and other societies, and would-be depositors, should have noted them.</P>
    <P>The legislation to deal with unsupervised deposit-taking sought to have such activity terminated within five years and to deal with a variety of problem societies engaged in such activity.  For that reason, the 1978 Act gave the Registrar of Friendly Societies various discretionary powers, to be exercised according to the circumstances of each society as the registrar considered appropriate.</P>
    <P>In the case of the PMPS, apart from ceasing to advertise as a result of pressure by the registrar, the management of the society sought to continue its activities undiminished throughout the period of its constitutional challenge to the legislation. The existence of this challenge, which was finally decided in May 1983, and the desirability of achieving an orderly winding down of the society's activities over a period were among the factors which the registrar had to take into account in his dealings with the society.</P>
    <P>Regarding the allegation of the registrar failing to take action against the PMPS I would refer the Deputy to the case of Monica McMahon, otherwise Paschal McMahon &mdash; Plaintiff, and <Col N="140" /> Ireland, The Attorney General and the Registrar of Friendly Societies &mdash; Defendants, which was tried in full in the District Court and again in the High Court.  In the High Court the decision of the District Court in dismissing the Plaintiff's case was upheld.  The judgment said, <i>inter alia,</i>&ldquo;....that at all material times the Registrar was acting <i>intra vires</i> and within the limit of his powers and was doing everything practicable to keep the matter under control&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>On the question of the relationship between the PMPA and the PMPS as this matter is <i>sub judice</i> because of a pending court action I am not in a position to comment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. R. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 55 and 57 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Insurance (No. 2) Act, 1983, provides that an administrator appointed to <Col N="141" /> an insurer shall have all the powers (including the power to sell the real and personal property and things in action of the insurer concerned) that he would have if he were a liquidator appointed by the court in respect of the insurer.  To further clarify the matter, a section is included in the Insurance Bill, 1987, to declare explicitly that an administrator has the power to sell all or any part of the business of the insurer concerned.</P>
    <P>In so far as the position of the PMPS depositors is concerned, the matter is now <i>sub judice</i> as the liquidator of the PMPS has initiated legal proceedings against the administrator of the PMPA with a view to having the insurance company's assets made available to the creditors of the society.  Accordingly, it would not be appropriate for me to comment on the matter.</P>
    <P>With regard to the PMPA's position <i>vis-à-vis</i> the statutory financial requirements, I would refer the Deputy to the reply given to Parliamentary Question No. 41 of 28 January 1986.  The published accounts and statutory returns to my Department, as certified by both the company's directors and auditors, showed that the liabilities of the PMPA did not at any stage exceed the value of its assets and that the company at all times met the statutory requirements for an insurance company.  There was no evidence to the contrary until the result of a specially commissioned consultancy study was received in August 1983 and confirmed by a second expert opinion received in October 1983.  This was followed immediately by the appointment of an administrator to the company.</P>

      <P>I will take this opportunity to repeat what I indicated to the House at Question Time on Tuesday, 29 November 1988, in relation to the disposal of dead fish viz, my Department requires fish farmers to notify it of suspected disease appearance or abnormal losses or mortalities within 48 hours; the dead fish must be disposed of in a lime pit or other manner advised by my Department.  Where local authority facilities are used, it must be by prior arrangement and with the approval of the local authority concerned.</P>
      <P>My Department has investigated the Galway incident on 23 November 1988 to which the Deputy refers and in this connection has been in touch with the Irish Salmon Growers Association, and officials of Galway County Council and Corporation.  I am determined to ensure that dead fish are disposed of in a proper manner at all times.</P>
      <P>I believe that the fish concerned had suffered from the pancreas disease outbreak which has affected a number of fish farms in the west of Ireland recently. there was no threat to the public or to the wild fishery.  In relation to other dumping incidents, I would refer the Deputy to my reply to Questions Nos. 30 and 56 in the House on 29 November last.  Monitoring and inspection will be adjusted as necessary on the basis of the professional advice available.</P>

      <P>In accordance with the provisions of the Local Government (Water Pollution) Act, 1977, it is primarily a matter for local authorities to determine and implement the water quality monitoring programmes necessary for the performance of any of their pollution control functions under the Act.  In the case of Dublin Bay, it is a matter for Dublin Corporation, Dublin County Council and Dún Laoghaire Corporation to draw up and implement appropriate monitoring arrangements.</P>
      <P>The European Communities (Quality of Bathing Water) Regulations, 1988, prescribe bathing water quality standards, the bathing areas to which they apply (which include Dollymount) and the sampling programmes to be used by local authorities to determine compliance with the standards.  Under these regulations, Dublin Corporation is responsible for monitoring at Dollymount and is required to conduct sampling from mid-May until the end of August.  The normal requirement in relation to frequency of sampling is that monitoring should be conducted at fortnightly intervals during this period.</P>

There are approximately 900 places in such centres. The Government, since taking office have been concerned at the problem of disadvantaged youth and in particular the problem of young people out of home.  A sum of almost £4 million was set aside late last year out of the national lottery fund for major developments for those youth particularly at risk such as young homeless, young travellers and substance abusers.</P>

      <P>In the case of national schools, my Department operates a scheme by which grants are paid to schools towards the cost of books for necessitous pupils.  The scheme is administered by the principal teachers of the schools who, subject to the amount of money made available to them annually, have discretion in the selection of pupils to be assisted and in the extent of the assistance to be given.  No scheme of means-testing operates for this purpose &mdash; a necessitous pupil is defined as a child from a home where genuine hardship exists because of unemployment, the prolonged illness of a parent, a large family with inadequate means, a one-parent family or other circumstances of domestic financial hardship.</P>
      <P>A similar scheme exists in the case of necessitous pupils attending post-primary day schools providing free post-primary education.</P>
      <P>The position in relation to school fees in post-primary schools is that free education exists in the vast majority of secondary schools and in all vocational, community and comprehensive schools.  A special arrangement of the free education scheme exists in the case of Protestant pupils, however, whereby block grants are paid to an independent agency representing the main Protestant churches, which distributes the grants according to the needs of the pupils on the basis of criteria operated by the agency itself.</P>

    <P>*A network of teacher centres has been established throughout the country for the professional use of primary and post-primary teachers.  The major functions of a centre are to provide a meeting place for teachers to enable them to discuss problems relating to schoolwork, to act as a resource centre to enable teachers to prepare and construct equipment and materials for use in schools, to arrange courses on curriculum development, and to facilitate the display of pupils' and teachers' work and publishers' exhibitions of school textbooks.  Accordingly, the centres have a major role to play in the inservice training of teachers.</P>
    <P>A sum of approximately £300,000 is being provided for inservice courses for post-primary teachers in 1989.  The money will be provided under Vote 29 Second Level Education, Subhead J.</P>
    <P>The amounts provided for assistance towards the cost of schoolbooks in the Estimates for 1989 are as follows:</P>

      <P>In regard to items (i) Jobstown community college and (ii) Kilnamanagh second level school, I decided in January 1988 and June 1987 respectively that post-primary schools at these locations were not justified.  Consequently, it was not necessary to initiate the planning process in these cases.</P>
      <P>In regard to the proposed regional technical college, Tallaght, Stage 3 (developed sketch scheme) has been completed and the subject is currently at Stage 4 (working drawings).  However, architectural planning of the college has been deferred pending the submission of a report by an interdepartmental committee which was established this year to examine the provision of third level places, and the rationalisation (including funding) of third level departments and institutions.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Education, in light of the recognition of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> of the role of education in promoting racial equity, if she will give details of the specific measures for which spending has been earmarked in the 1989 Estimates, designed to be of benefit to the disadvantaged in education.</P>

      <P>It is presumed that &ldquo;racial equity&rdquo; should read &ldquo;social equity&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>As regards primary education the 1989 Estimates include a provision of £0.5 million for the continuation of a programme of special educational measures for disadvantaged areas which has been in operation since 1984.  To date a total of £2.75 million has been spent on the programme which currently benefits approximately 48,000 pupils and which is aimed at alleviating the difficulties encountered in schools serving deprived areas.</P>
      <P>The main benefits to the individual participating schools include special grants for the purchase of books and equipment, the promotion of home/school/ community liaison initiatives and the organisation of in-service training for the teachers concerned.  Other measures include the provision of finance for the relief of school debts, grants for the purchase of equipment for pre-schools for travellers and the provision of curricular and educational assessment materials.</P>
      <P>In the post-primary sector the Government's commitment to catering for the educational needs of the disadvantaged is borne out by the continuing provision in the 1989 Estimates for remedial and special class teacher posts in the sector generally and for prison and traveller education under the aegis of the VECs.</P>
      <P>Following discussions between the relevant parties under the aegis of the Central Review Committee of the <i>Programme for National Recovery,</i> the Government have allocated additional teaching posts for the 1988-89 school year with a view to ensuring that the burden of the changes in the pupil/teacher ratio did not fall on the disadvantaged.</P>

      <P>The most up to date information available indicates that there are approximately 125 national schools with an enrolment of between 300-350 pupils. One third of these do not have the services of a special additional assistant for remedial teaching.</P>
      <P>Available remedial teaching posts are allocated in accordance with a priority of educational need.  The number of additional remedial posts to be sanctioned in any school year would depend on the financial resources available to the Department.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 83, 86 and 96 together.</P>
      <P>The provisions relating to the amount of grant and local contribution in connection with national school building applications handled by my Department are set out in Chapter V of the Rules for National Schools, Rule 42.  I am not aware that there has been any recent demand that responsibility for the provision of the local contribution should be in the hands of committees, and I have no plans to initiate such a proposal.  The information sought by the Deputy as to the average local contribution in respect of national schools built during the period 1983 to 1988 is not readily available, and I am reluctant to divert staff from other urgent work for the purpose of providing it in advance of the publication of this data in the normal course.</P>
      <P>With regard to the proportion of total cost met by local or parish contribution in each national school project in the past year, the financial details of individual projects have always been considered to be confidential as between the school authorities and my Department, and it is not the practice to disclose them.  There have been circumstances in recent years in which the State grant exceeded 95 per cent, and where it was less than 70 per cent.</P>

      <P>This matter was discussed at some length in Dáil Éireann in November 1987.  As I explained at the time, I decided that the interim Curriculum and Examinations Board should be reconstituted as the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment mainly because I did not see how the main function of the council &mdash; advising the Minister of all matters relating to the school curriculum &mdash; would be enhanced in any way by <Col N="163" /> making them a statutory body.  I also considered that the council would be better able to fulfil their central role if they were not encumbered with responsibility for organising the certificate examinations.</P>

Based on data in the report &ldquo;Participation in Higher Education&rdquo;, commissioned by the Higher Education Authority and published in 1982, it is estimated that 34 per cent of secondary pupils in the final year of the leaving certificate course in 1979-80 transferred to Higher Education in 1980-81. The corresponding figure for vocational pupils was 23 per cent.  It is estimated that 35 per cent of secondary pupils in the final year of the leaving certificate course in 1985-86 transferred to higher education in 1986-87.

      <P>I do not propose to implement the proposals made in the Green Paper on Local Structures in Education. Rather, it is my intention to rationalise existing VEC structures.  This will involve the amalgamation of a number of VECs which will reduce their <Col N="166" /> number from 38 at present to approximately 20.  In the context of the rationalisation, it is also my intention to grant greater autonomy to the regional technical college while retaining them under the aegis of the VECs.  This, in my view, is a much more sensible approach than that proposed by the previous administration.</P>
