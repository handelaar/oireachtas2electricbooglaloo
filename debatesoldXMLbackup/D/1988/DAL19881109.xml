      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 6 and 7.  It is also proposed that No. 6 shall be taken without debate.  It is further proposed that Votes 13 and 14 shall be taken together for the purposes of debate, and the questions necessary to bring the proceedings, if not previously concluded, to a conclusion shall be put at 12.30 p.m. today and the following arrangements shall apply: first, the speech of each Member called on shall not exceed 15 minutes and, secondly, the Minister for Finance shall be called on to conclude the debate not later than 12.20 p.m.</P>
      <P>It is further proposed that No. 7 and Vote 3 shall be taken together for the purposes of debate; that the proceedings on all Stages of No. 7 and on the Vote, if not previously concluded, shall be brought to a conclusion at 7 p.m. by one question in each case, which shall be put from the Chair; and in the case of No. 7 the question shall, in relation to amendments, include only amendments set down by the Taoiseach.</P>

    <Title>Supplementary Estimates, 1988: Leave to Introduce.</Title>
    <P>Leave granted to introduce the following supplementary Estimates for the service of the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1988, namely:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Vote 3 &mdash; Department of the Taoiseach.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. MacSharry) Ray MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. MacSharry)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £1,263,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1988, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Attorney General including a grant-in-aid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Supplementary Estimates I am moving today for the office of the Attorney General and the office of the Dirctor of Public Prosecutions, arise principally from the level of litigation being handled by these offices.  This is obviously something which is extremely difficult to forecast.  In the case of the Attorney General's office, new cases are instituted against the State almost on a daily basis.  It is difficult to accurately <Col N="2177" /> forecast the requirements of these Votes and thus the need for these supplementaries today.</P>
    <P>As regards the Office of the Attorney General, it requires a total supplementary sum of £1,263,000.  This includes £9,000 for travelling and incidental expenses, and £29,000 for postal and telecommunications services, expenditure on which is ahead of the original budget provision and is in line with increased activity.  In relation to fees to counsel, the volume of expenditure to date reflects a high throughput of cases through the courts and a large amount of litigation involving the State.  An additional sum of £505,000 is considered necessary to meet the extra bills of costs coming for payment.</P>
    <P>A supplementary sum of £720,000 is required for the general law expenses subhead which provides mainly for costs awarded against the State, together with witnesses expenses and court fees.  There were in the course of the year some major cases in which costs were awarded against the State as a result of which the original moneys allocated on this subhead were exhausted.  Accordingly additional funds have to be provided to meet payments now due on other major cases.</P>
    <P>One such case is Crotty <i>v.</i> Ireland and the Attorney General, in which the plaintiff alleged that the ratification of the Single European Act by the Government was unconstitutional.  The case was first heard in the High Court and appealed by the plaintiff to the Supreme Court.  This was an important case from the State's point of view, and the plaintiff's costs were taxed at £344,000 to which must be added interest from the date of the judgment.  This sum is, of course, additional to the fees paid to the State's counsel which amounted to about £200,000.</P>
    <P>Webb-Webb <i>v.</i> Ireland and the Attorney General was the case relating to the Derrynaflan chalice and the right of the State to ownership and the fixing of compensation to the finders.  This case was also appealed to the Supreme Court. The plaintiffs' costs in that case were taxed at £189,000 of which £155,000 has <Col N="2178" /> been paid.  The balance is to be paid as soon as the plaintiffs' appeal against the findings of the Taxing Master is dealt with.</P>
    <P>McMeel <i>v.</i> the North Eastern Health Board and the Attorney General is a case in which the plaintiff challenged the Minister's right to transfer a section of Monaghan Hospital to the Cavan Hospital.  In this case a bill of costs, of the order of £205,000 has been presented and is in the process of taxation.  The eventual taxed sum is expected to come for payment this year.</P>
    <P>The Vote for the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions requires an additional total sum of £293,000.  Again, it is very difficult to forecast the requirements of the DPP.  The number and complexity of trials at the Central Criminal Court and the Special Criminal Court are very unpredictable.</P>
    <P>These can be followed by appeals to the superior courts.  Costs can be awarded to defendants in criminal prosecutions which are impossible to estimate.  We must now provide for the case of the prosecution in the Special Criminal Court arising out of the kidnapping of Mr. John O'Grady.  Similarly provision must be made for an increase in the number of hearings under judicial review in the High and Supreme Courts.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the uncertainties associated with these two Votes, the operations of both offices are kept under review with a view to effecting economies wherever possible, which approach is consistent with our resolute policy to develop a cost-efficient public service.</P>
    <P>With these comments I commend these two Supplementary Estimates to the House.  If Deputies wish to raise any points, I will be glad to address them in my reply at the end of this debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that the Minister saw fit to come into the House and offer a reasonable explanation for moving a Supplementary Estimate for both these offices.  It is of fundamental importance that the Office of the Attorney General and the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions are not <Col N="2179" /> impeded by lack of finance.  It is important that these offices should be seen by the community to be working efficiently and effectively for the benefit of all.  I accept, as the Minister has said that it is difficult to estimate 12 months in advance, the finances for both those offices.  Because of that we in Fine Gael welcome the provision of these Supplementary Estimates.</P>
      <P>The Minister said in relation to the Attorney General's Office that proceedings are instituted against the State on almost a daily basis.  These must be answered through the due process of the law in keeping with the fundamental democratic principles of our Constitution under which it is possible for a member of the public who feels aggrieved to take a case against th State and have the matter thrashed out in the courts.  Article 26 of the Constitution specifically provides for that and it enables the President to refer any legislation to the Supreme Court before final enactment.  It is very important that these rights are not interfered with because of a lack of funding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Attorney General's office must have sufficient funding to meet the increasing demands that the Minister has outlined.  It is not the function of the court to amend any legislation or any section in legislation.  It is their function to declare whether or not a Bill is repugnant to the Constitution.  Adequate funding must be made available for all these cases.  We have seen many such cases over the past number of years.  For instance, in relation to the Housing Act, 1981, the Rent Restrictions Act and more recently in relation to the Adoption Act. The Minister also referred to the Crotty case.  I agree that it is impossible to foresee the number of such cases that will be taken on an annual basis.  It was absolutely essential to the democratic principles to which we all adhere that somebody like Mr. Crotty could take a case to court against the State on the issue of the Single European Act.  The court ruled that the Act should be upheld but that ratification of it was ruled out until such time as a referendum took <Col N="2180" /> place.  Any bar on such proceedings would be in direct conflict with the democratic principles we uphold.</P>
    <P>I hope that the increased funding to the Attorney General's office has nothing to do with an incident that took place in Portlaoise District Court some time ago where there was a dispute among members of the legal profession with regard to funding which resulted in extradition proceedings not taking place on the appropriate day, with serious consequences on the economic front.  I hope that such scenes will not be repeated.  The case in question was not proceeded with and the state of siege for the town was postponed until another day.</P>
    <P>I wonder if the increase in funding for the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions signifies an increase in crime or in crime detection.  It is not possible for the Minister or for anybody else to answer these questions at present but we are seeing an increase in serious and vicious crime.  It is important that the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions has sufficient funds to combat this wave of serious and vicious crime. Full back-up services should be available to the office so that offenders are brought to justice at the earliest opportunity.  In this regard we should be concerned at the lengthy periods of remand being ordered by the courts in particular circumstances. I hope that the increased funding to the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions will mean that we will see shorter remand periods so that accused persons can be brought to court to answer charges at the earliest opportunity.  When lengthy remands are handed out everybody is left in limbo.  The Director of Public Prosecutions may in some ways be hampered by lack of resources in acting as speedily as he might otherwise do.</P>
    <P>I hope that the increase in funding for the Director of Public Prosecutions' office will enable them to act as efficiently as possible so that the due force of the law is brought to bear on the many criminals in society.  The Minister made specific reference to the O'Grady kidnap.  I agree that a shortage of funds should not <Col N="2181" /> hamper our fight against terrorism.  No cost cutting should be tolerated by us as legislators in the fight against crime.  The Minister's statement underlines the cost to society and to the Irish economy of terrorist activities over the past few years. Unfortunately, this cost is on the increase, a matter which should cause every right-thinking member of society to feel sad and aggrieved.  There should be no sparing of funds to the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, who acts on behalf of each member of society. He should not be restricted in any way in the course of his duties.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael welcome this Supplementary Estimate which will ensure that both the Attorney General and the Director of Public Prosecutions carry out their work on behalf of the people without any impeding or hampering in any circumstances, free of obstructions and restrictions.  We welcome the Estimate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnneMarieColley" hpid="Miss Colley Miss Colley">
      <NameTxt>Miss Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I share Fine Gael's view that, of course, there should be no restriction on the Offices of the Attorney General and Director of Public Prosecutions in pursuing those who have offended or in defending the interests of the State in cases taken against the State.  One must support the proposal for a Supplementary Estimate.</P>
      <P>I should like to touch upon a number of areas in the work of both offices.  The Director of Public Prosecutions is an extremely important personage in the justice system.  The independence of the Director of Public Prosecutions is essential and it is vital that it be maintained. It is vital that the Director should be enabled to carry out his duties in an independent way without having to have regard to economies which would, perhaps, cut back on the quality of the work he pursues.  He represents the victim in the criminal justice system.  He prosecutes the offender on behalf of society but first on behalf of the victim.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is worthwhile, given this opportunity, to refer to the fact that the present Director of Public Prosecutions, Mr. Eamon Barnes, in an address given at the <Col N="2182" /> annual conference of the Irish Association for Victim Support, delivered a very interesting paper on the position of the victim as witness in our criminal justice system.  That position has deteriorated over the past few years and the victim is now almost irrelevant to the whole proceedings except as witness.  As a result, the witness feels totally left out of the process and feels used or abused by the system.  It is no fault of the DPP because it is the structures which lead to this.  In many instances somebody who has been the victim of a crime may give evidence against an offender but between the time the charge is pressed and the case coming up for hearing there is almost no contact between the DPP and that person.  The victim can feel wholly aggrieved, not just because he or she has been injured or has suffered loss or damage but because of being left out of the process.  Such victims do not know what decisions are being taken.  A prime example is when a prosecution is initiated but not continued.  The witness or victim is given no explanation and feels very let down by the system.  The system which is supposed to represent them fails them.</P>
    <P>The Director of Public Prosecutions was reported in <i>The Irish Times</i> on 2 May this year as saying that crime victims feel a persistent sense of alienation from the criminal justice system and that in the first instance the rights of the victim to information and consultation on the progress of their case must be accepted. The DPP is calling for and attempting to initiate procedures whereby this can be carried through.  He is quoted in the same article as saying that the first step in tackling this dehumanising process must be the acceptance of the right of the victim to be given, as of right, information regarding the progress of the investigation and any prosecution and to be consulted regarding certain critical decisions.  That is the minimum required and it should be commonplace when dealing with victims of crime.  The director has attempted, by delivering a well thought out historical paper leading up to the present day, to start a process of widening the perception of his role.  He is <Col N="2183" /> still representing society in prosecutions, but his duty is not just to society at large but to the individual who has become the victim of crime.</P>
    <P>The victim of crime has almost lost respect for our system of criminal justice. There is a felling that the criminal is the one who has to be protected.  I say this without meaning to sound ultra rightwing. The most moderate people in Ireland today would express some reservations about the emphasis in the criminal justice system.  They feel that the victim, who is, after all, the innocent party in the whole debacle, has been made to feel like a runner-in who simply does not count in the proceedings.  It would be well worthwhile emphasising the role of the victim so as to restore faith in the criminal justice process.  Many other things are necessary to restore that faith, such as reform of the criminal law, reform of the penal system and reform of the Garda Síochána, but this is one step to which I can refer today because it concerns the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions.  It would not be difficult to incorporate structures within the Office of the DPP to allow that to happen, without holding up cases unnecessarily.</P>
    <P>The other Supplementary Estimate deals with the Office of the Attorney General.  There is an onerous responsibility on the Attorney General to advise a Government on their legal responsibilities and the directions they should take.  The Attorney General is a member of the Government and comes and goes with the Government.  His can, therefore, be seen as a political appointment. In general Governments are well advised by their Attorneys General.  The advice given to Governments is usually of the utmost competence and integrity, but I would like to refer again to one particular piece of advice about which I have some concern, and that relates to the Extradition (Amendment) Act, 1987.</P>
    <P>I referred to this Act in earlier debates and I reiterate that I believe there is inherent in that Act a quasi-judicial function given to the Attorney General which <Col N="2184" /> may turn out to be unconstitutional.  This is an instance where it is possible that the advice of the Attorney General in relation to his role under this Act may lead the State into incurring costs by litigation taken to test the constitutionality of this legislation.  When this Act was passed there was a great deal of pressure on the Government from their own benches to provide some face-saving exercise on extradition.  Unfortunately we will have a re-run of that in the next month or so because the Government put a clause into the Act which means it must be reviewed after one year.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Government to reconsider the role of the Attorney General in this legislation.  I think it is unhealthy, and there is definitely a question about whether the Attorney General is acting in a quasi-judicial capacity.  That will lead to some disrespect, or some confusion, about the role of the Attorney General. I am telling the Minister for Finance I believe the Government should look at this again.</P>
    <P>I do not know what cases the Minister referred to when he introduced this Supplementary Estimate.  He mentioned a number of cases which arose in previous years to illustrate the difficulties.  I understand unforeseen difficulties will arise each year.  However, one of the difficulties the Office of the Attorney General faced this year was the payment of barristers.  We almost had a situation where the courts would not operate properly because the barristers decided to withdraw services if some arrangement was not arrived at.  Happily, that situation has not arisen.  Perhaps the Minister would tell us if part of this Supplementary Estimate is being introduced because the Office of the Attorney General wishes to bring up to date and to put on a better footing payments to barristers.  Perhaps he could tell us if the payment procedures will be simplified so that the bureaucracy involved &mdash; I gather it includes four different stages and four different approvals before certain barristers can be paid through the Attorney General's Office &mdash; will be simplified, or has been simplified.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2185" /> I wish to refer briefly to the criminal injuries compensation fund.  I am not certain if that is relevant to this debate but it is relevant in general terms to claims against the State to which the Minister referred.  I know the rules have changed in relation to criminal injuries compensation so that general damages are not awarded, but there are hundreds of people awaiting receipt of compensation under this scheme.  That is not good enough.  People have been waiting 18 months or two years for payments on claims which are acknowledged, which are not in dispute.  Obviously there is a need to speed up this process because it is not fair to those who have been victims of crime.  I will come back to that later. This is another opportunity to recognise the fact that victims are innocent parties to the proceedings and should not be badly treated, as I believe they have been in this instance.</P>
    <P>While the Minister refers to the fact that efficiency in the running of both offices is at a premium and in keeping with Government policy, and I take him at his word, there are no bounds to the pursuit of efficiency.  While I agree that this Supplementary Estimate should be voted, it should be noted that value for money is paramount in all Estimates passed by this House.  I hope they are at this stage and the Progressive Democrats are pressing that idea and will continue to press it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. MacSharry)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Members who have spoken in a very positive way about these two Supplementary Estimates and the two offices concerned &mdash; the Office of the Attorney General and the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions.  I want to put on record &mdash; and I agree with what Deputy Flanagan and Deputy Colley said &mdash; that there is no question, nor has there been, of any restrictions being imposed on either office leaving them short of resources.  The difficulty has been, and still is, in estimating correctly the amounts that would be required.  Perhaps <Col N="2186" /> I might give some examples of the position in the Office of the Attorney General.</P>
      <P>In 1985 we had a shortfall of £424,000; in 1986 we had a shortfall of £709,000 and in 1987 we had a shortfall of £669,000.  In those years we underestimated.  On the other hand, in the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, we overestimated in two of the last three years.  In 1985 we had an additional £148,000; in 1986 we had an extra £187,000 but in 1987 an extra £81,000 was needed.  This has been an ongoing problem, and I think I have explained in detail why the additional resources are required in both offices this year.</P>
      <P>One could get into what might be described as a debate on Justice but that would not be appropriate.  I always tell Deputies that the points they have raised should be dealt with by the appropriate Ministers but I want to confirm my view, and the Government's view of the importance of the position and the role of the Director of Public Prosecutions.  I agree fully with what Deputy Colley said about the role of the victim in the criminal justice process.  We often meet people who tell us that at times the victim appears to be the criminal and the criminal appears to be protected under the law.  These accusations are made to all of us and I agree with the comments made by Deputy Colley in that regard.</P>
      <P>I want to make a brief comment on the points raised about the Attorney General's role and the Extradition Act, which will come up for review and the House will have an opportunity to debate in a number of weeks.  I was not sure if Deputy Colley was saying she was against the very important, necessary and genuine safeguards&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to quibble about words, but the Attorney General's role is paramount in that legislation.  As regards bringing payments up to date, some of those payments may not have been known but now they are known to us and they fall due for payment. I do not think that either office would deliberately set out to deprive anybody of a payment which was due to them.  As the House is aware, some of these bills can go back and span a number of years and every effort is made to have administrative procedures in place which do not leave anybody short and prevent a huge backlog of payments.  I am sure it can be said that there have been delays in the making of payments.  People are always inclined to complain that we like other major institutions, do not pay on time.</P>
      <P>That more or less covers all of the points that were made.  I am very grateful to the House for its acceptance of both these Supplementary Estimates.  As I said, some other points were made but they would be more appropriate to a justice debate or some other future debate and I am sure the Deputies concerned will take the opportunity to repeat those points again.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Energy and Minister for Communications (Mr. R. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Irish Sailors and Soldiers Land Trust was established after the First World War to provide houses for Irish ex-servicemen who had fought in that war.  Over 2,000 trust houses were built throughout Ireland at the time.  The trust was formally established under section 3 of the Irish Free State (Consequential Provisions) Act, 1922 but this section did not come into operation until the passage, the following year, of legislation to enable the trust to acquire and hold land in the State and to facilitate the transfer to the trust of houses already built.</P>
      <P>The trust comprises five members, one of whom is appointed by the Taoiseach. The others are appointed by the British Government.  Lord Killanin has been the Government nominee on the trust since 1955.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over the past 60 years, the number of beneficiaries of the trust has declined and there are fewer than 100 trust tenants throughout Ireland now, most of them in Northern Ireland.  With the consequent sale of property, the trust accumulated surplus funds.  These funds are held in London where the administrative headquarters of the trust are located.  In 1983, the trustees formulated proposals for the disposal of their surplus funds and put these to the Irish and British Governments. The proposals formed the basis <Col N="2189" /> for subsequent discussions and agreement was reached in 1986 for the repayment of the surplus funds in the ratio of 68 per cent to the British Government and 32 per cent to the Irish Government. These percentages were based on the original contributions whether in money or in kind of the two Governments.</P>
    <P>I would like to take this opportunity to record the Government's grateful appreciation to Lord Killanin for his efforts as a trustee to bring about a settlement of this issue.  It was largely through his work that agreement was reached.</P>
    <P>The settlement was regarded by all concerned as satisfactory and equitable and its terms were incorporated in legislation passed by the British Parliament in 1987.  As well as providing for the distribution of the surplus funds of the trust, the British legislation enables the trust to be wound up in due course.</P>
    <P>Following the enactment of the British legislation it is necessary to pass legislation here to facilitate the acceptance and disposal of the trust funds and to enable our legislation in this area to be repealed in due course.  This Bill will achieve these purposes.  It is, as the House will see, a very short measure with just five sections.  The rights of existing trust tenants will not be affected by the Bill.</P>
    <P>Sections 2 and 3 are the main sections. In section 2, there is provision for the acceptance by the Minister for Finance of any money payable to the Irish Government from the trust.  The sum of £1.6 million was in fact paid over by the trust last January and this was lodged at the Exchequer.  A further sum of £747,000 has recently been paid to the Government.  As the trust was anxious to pay over these funds as quickly as possible, it was considered sensible to accept them in anticipation of this legislation and legal advice concurred with this view.  It is expected that over the next few years, there will be further payments &mdash; of a smaller nature &mdash; by the trust as it continues to accumulate surplus funds.</P>
    <P>The Department of the Taoiseach have had a close involvement with the affairs of the trust down through the years and the Taoiseach has the function of <Col N="2190" /> appointing the Irish Government's representative to the trust.  During discussions with the British Government which led up to the agreement on the repayment of the surplus funds, there was an understanding that the Irish Government would endeavour to use their share for North-South or Anglo-Irish co-operation or for projects with an all-Ireland dimension.  Section 2 also provides for the disposal of the money paid into the Exchequer.  The Taoiseach has already announced the Government's intention, subject to the passing of this legislation, to allocate a portion of the funds received to the Royal National Lifeboat Institution, to enable it to purchase a relief lifeboat and expand its search and rescue facilities on the west and north west coast.  As the Taoiseach said at the time, the Government are confident that there will be widespread approval in the House for this proposal.  The RNLI is organised on an all-Ireland basis and is seemed to the Government to be a very appropriate recipient of funds from a trust which has been concerned with the welfare of sailors and soldiers.</P>
    <P>Consideration is also being given to a number of co-operation projects in the educational, cultural and social field.  The British Government, in accordance with their legislation, are allocating 40 per cent of their portion of the trust funds for the support of ex-servicemen's charities North and South.  The balance of the British Government's share will be lodged to their Exchequer.  A sum of £750,000 has already been provided in the Estimates this year to assist the type of project I have mentioned.  Pending decisions on the terms of the legislation and as a contingency arrangement, a new subhead for the trust funds was opened in the Vote for the Department of Foreign Affairs at the beginning of the year.  This subhead contains the provision of £750,00 and it will be necessary, in consequence of the provisions of the Bill, to transfer this to a new subhead in the Vote for the Taoiseach's Department, by way of Supplementary Estimate.  This will be moved at the conclusion of the debate on this Bill.  I expect that the funds from the <Col N="2191" /> trust will be allocated over a three to four year period and the provision will cease once the funds paid by the trust have been drawn down.</P>
    <P>The British legislation provides that the trust can be dissolved by order of the Foreign Secretary.  Section 3 of the Bill will enable trust legislation applicable in our jurisdiction to be repealed following the dissolution of the trust.  It is unlikely that this will happen for some time yet and, in the interim, the trust will ensure the rights of existing tenants.  At the winding up stage also there will be a further repayment of funds to both Governments but it is not possible to quantify this at present.</P>
    <P>The other provisions of the Bill are the standard ones relating to expenses, etc. and do not call for specific comment.  I recommend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset let me say that the Bill as presented is non-contentious in the sense that the trust has outlived its usefulness and the original objectives cannot be pursued any further. Let me give some of the history of the trust.  It was established after the First World War to provide houses for Irish ex-servicemen were scattered throughout the Republic, Northern Ireland and England. As the Minister pointed out, the trust was controlled by both the Irish and British Governments.  I, too, would like to pay tribute to Lord Killanin who, I understand, has been a member of the trust for the best part of 40 years.  I understand that his performance during the negotiations on the allocation of the surplus funds of the trust was sparkling, to say the least, and that, because of his negotiating skills, he ensured we got our due share.  Incidentally, I received half only of the memorandum accompanying this Bill from the Whips' office.  It did not indicate who were the main beneficiaries or to what purpose the money was to be put.  It was said it would go to the Taoiseach's office which was the agreement reached at the time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a number of questions I should like to pose to the Minister today. <Col N="2192" /> I should say that the main beneficiaries, the Royal National Lifeboat Institution, is a very fine organisation.  One would hope that the vast bulk of the funds representing our contribution &mdash; £2.3 million &mdash; would be given to that institution. Obviously what was uppermost in every-body's mind, indeed even a suspicion, was that the £2.3 million would be directed to the Taoiseach's office and would not be earmarked for a specific purpose.  I want to place on the record of the House that I would not want the funds about which we speak under the Irish Sailors and Soldiers Land Trust to have any connection whatsoever with the national lottery.  I want to make that abundantly clear.</P>
    <P>A number of questions arise with regard to the winding down of the trust and where the moneys will go thereafter. When replying, the Minister might state the exact amount of money that will be received by the Royal National Lifeboat Institution, how they will receive such funds and the timescale proposed.  This is timely particularly in the conditions prevailing along our north and west coasts.  Indeed, it arises at a time when my party are devoting much time and effort to the question of air and sea rescue through the relocation of Air Corps Dauphin helicoptors along our west coast. There is no doubt that that huge coastal area warrants much more investment than can be provided by this trust fund. I should be grateful if the Minister would let me know exactly how much money is being earmarked.</P>
    <P>I understand that there are approximately 100 houses &mdash; according to the information available to me &mdash; remaining at present.  Obviously their tenants will be very old or they will be members of their families who inhabit them.  Is it proposed to allow those tenants or their families to purchase those houses?  If so would the Minister say how that will square up with the winding down of the trust?  The trust had a large financial commitment. I understand that, when it began, something over 1,000 houses were involved which means that we are talking about several millions of pounds.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2193" /> There are two other aspects I should like to mention in passing.  I note that there has been talk about consideration being given to a number of co-operation projects in the educational, cultural and social fields.  I should be grateful if the Minister would outline for the House exactly what is in mind in that respect. For example, has such co-operation being negotiated with the other partners?  Furthermore, would he say who will be the beneficiaries at the end of the day.  It is not often that we have excess funds available.  It would be our hope that they would be put to the best possible use.</P>
    <P>Because this trust pertains to ex-soldiers and sailors, I should have thought that part of its funds could have been made available to help our hard pressed Army <i>vis-à-vis</i> their housing needs.  Perhaps the Minister would take that cause on board.  It should be remembered that certain sections of our Defence Forces live in terribly poor housing conditions. I should have hoped that part of these funds could have been siphoned off and made available for that purpose.  It is non-contentious if I can be convinced that the major portion of the funds available will be earmarked for the Royal National Lifeboat Institution.  I hazard a guess that very few people would quibble with that allocation.  However, perhaps the Minister would say whether they have received any funds already and what it is proposed to do with the remainder of the funds.  Furthermore, he might explain to the House those matters pertaining to the co-operation projects, informing the House whether he can take on board what might be described as a mini-windfall, informing us whether he could do so even as a gesture of goodwill by way of helping our Defence Forces in their deplorable housing conditions.</P>

If one compares the Bill before us with the British Bill passed in Westminster last year, we find that the British Act is much longer and more specific.  This is very <Col N="2194" /> short, the nub of which is contained in section 2 which says:</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance may accept on behalf of the Government any money payable to the Government from the Trust pursuant to an Act of the British Parliament entitled the Irish Sailors and Soldiers Land Trust Act 1987 and any such money accepted by him shall be paid into the Exchequer and shall be disposed of in such manner as the Taoiseach, with the consent of the Minister of Finance, directs.</P>
      <P>Curiously it says:</P>
      <P>...and shall be disposed of in such manner as the Taoiseach, with the consent of the Minister of Finance, directs.</P>
      <P>When I read the Bill this struck me as unusual to say the least.  It warrants some explanation as to why the normal procedures are not followed here; that the Taoiseach, not in a personal capacity, obviously in his capacity as Taoiseach but as an individual should distribute the funds.  I was immediately put in mind of the national lottery funds, that this represented merely a more high class form of distribution, that this would be done by a Taoiseach from his office in Merrion Street; it would not be reduced to the unseemly scenes we have witnessed in west County Limerick or in some other parts of the country.  It struck me as odd. The Bill should spell out exactly what will happen or at least it should be put here irrevocably on the record of the House exactly what will happen.  In my opinion it is entirely unsatisfactory to leave it as vague as it is here and just say that the funds shall be distributed as the Taoiseach may direct.  There is nothing binding him to distribute them to any particular cause, object, charity or anything else.  He would have total legal discretion to give them to anyone, any body that he wished, if this Bill is passed in its present form.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thoroughly approve the statement of the Minister for Energy and for Communications today, that it is proposed to give the bulk of these funds to the Royal <Col N="2195" /> National Lifeboat Institution.  I fully approve of that but we should be told exactly how much they will get out of the £2.3 million that has come to hand so far, which is at the disposal of our Exchequer, what will happen to the remainder of the funds and to any further funds that may come here.</P>
    <P>In this context it is worth referring to part of a speech made by Lord Killanin in the House of Lords in London on 28 April 1987 when the British Bill was being considered by that House.  With your permission, Sir, I should like to quote a paragraph of what he said from columns 1431 and 1432 of the <i>Lords Hansard</i> of the day as follows:</P>
    <P>Yesterday I saw the new Taoiseach and took a note.  Mr. Haughey promised me, as indeed did Dr. FitzGerald whom I had seen previously, that first of all the money would not be snapped up and put into the Treasury.  It would be spent wisely.  He even suggested that he would consult me as to how it should be spent.  I told him that I was not very keen on that.  I would probably want, as in my Olympic days, to go exdirectory because the telephone would be ringing to such an extent.  I have no doubt at all from speaking to him &mdash; and I wrote it down &mdash; that the money will not be snapped up centrally. It will be used for social, cultural, recreational and other purposes. It will be used for the best but it will not be used politically or to go into the central Treasury, whatever the finances of the country may require.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the assurances given to Lord Killanin, written down twice on his own statement in the Lords, the money has gone into the central treasury and perhaps only some of it may be paid out for some purpose which is not specified in the legislation.  The British Act specifies exactly what goes where and to whom; it specifies that the Exchequer in Britain is to get part of it, that the British Legion are to get the remainder and that they are to expend it for the benefit of ex-servicemen on the island of Ireland, <Col N="2196" /> which they now have a statutory obligation to do.  Therefore, we need much more specific information on what will happen than has been given here today. We are all perhaps more sensitive and more conscious of this nowadays than we might have been in pre-lottery days.  You cannot help comparing this with the national lottery.  These are funds which, fortuitously, have come into the hands of the Government, they are not taxes or revenue raised in the ordinary way and they should be applied, as best one can, in accordance with the charitable legal doctrine of what is called <i>cy-près</i>.  In other words they should be applied for an objective that is as close as is reasonable in present circumstances to their original objective.  The application of these funds, <i>cy-près</i>, would, I would have thought in this country, be the expenditure of the funds on ex-servicemen, Irish and British and indeed American or other armies, the ex-servicemen of which may be living here in retirement, perhaps in poor circumstances.</P>
    <P>It is interesting that in the House of Lords' debate Lord Denning who, in his day, was one of the leading judges in common law was also anxious that a <i>cyprès</i> scheme should be utilised to the greatest possible extent.  That is the normal way of applying charitable funds of this nature.  I do not think that the Royal National Lifeboat Institution is so far removed from that that they would be ineligible.  It is an excellent proposal but I should like to know exactly how much will go to them and what the balance &mdash; which will probably be quite considerable &mdash; will be expended on.</P>
    <P>The Supplementary Estimate which has been circulated this morning and which is taken in conjunction with this is, unfortunately, not very informative. Apparently there was provision in subhead J of the Foreign Affairs Vote 40 to expend £750,000 on what is described as the Irish Sailors and Soldiers Land Trust and it is simply taking it out of that and putting it into the Taoiseach's Vote. However, it is simply putting it in under the heading Irish Sailors and Soldiers Land Trust and it does not say what it <Col N="2197" /> will be spent on.  Normally, when some body or other objective is named in a subhead, that is the body to whom the money is paid but I cannot see how this money can be paid to the Irish Sailors and Soldiers Land Trust when the land trust is being wound up and when the purpose of this Bill is to facilitate its winding up and dissolution.  Therefore, to say that you will pay the money to the trust from which you got the money seems to be somewhat contradictory and does not make sense.  It underlines my sense of unease about what should happen.  It is in this Supplementary Estimate that the particular purpose for which the money will be expended should be specified and I would have thought that the Royal National Lifeboat Institution and other bodies should have been specified instead of simply putting down the name of the body from whom the money was received rather than the body to whom it should be paid.  I will be interested to hear the Minister's reply to these matters and, depending on the nature of the reply, I will obviously consider then whether to put down an amendment to cover the points I made, particularly in relation to section 2 which is the kernel of the Bill.  It should be more specific and not left open in the rather vague way in which it is at present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this legislation which is timely and right.  In so doing, the House should take the opportunity of recognising and paying tribute to the people who were originally the beneficiaries of this trust.  They are all too often forgotten by society, especially by the present party in office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Literally thousands of Irish people, from the manse to the gatelodge, fought in the First and Second World Wars on our behalf.  One cannot go into a Church of Ireland anywhere in the country without seeing a testimony to the deaths and the sacrifice made by that generation in two world wars.  This trust was set up as a joint effort by both Governments and it became the responsibility of both of them to administer it for the wounded and the dependants of the people injured <Col N="2198" /> or killed in those two struggles.  Those struggles were carried on on our behalf. I know that some history books attempt to deny it but the reality is quite different, and if we were to recognise and celebrate the differences that divide people on this island the differences might be reduced, if not eliminated.</P>
    <P>In passing this legislation, it would be inappropriate, if not dishonourable, not to recognise the contribution made by those who died and the continued dependency in some respects of people who have suffered &mdash; and who still suffer &mdash; from their disabilities as a result of their participation in the Second World War.  I presume that most of the combatants of the First World War are now, sadly, deceased.  The Labour Party appreciate Lord Killanin's contribution over the years in relation to this matter.  I am aware of this because there are some properties in Sandymount built as a result of this trust.  I now want to move to the point of concern which is the focus of our attention today, the proposed disbursal of the moneys.  I calculate that something in the order of £2.3 million has already been received by the Exchequer and there is a possibility of something in the order of £300,000 to £400,000 being due over the next couple of years.</P>
    <P>In total we are talking of the order of £3 million but specifically about a figure of £2.3 million.  I warmly support, on behalf of the Labour Party, the decision to allocate this money to the Royal National Lifeboat Institution.  I understand that this recommendation was made by the previous Taoiseach, Deputy FitzGerald.  I concur with Deputy O'Malley that it is a most worthy institution to receive the money and it is symbolic and representative of the kind of organisation that should be the recipient of this money.</P>
    <P>I note in the text of the Minister's rather brief speech &mdash; these matters are carefully written, rewritten and proofread before they become ministerial speeches &mdash; the following sentence: &ldquo;The Taoiseach has already announced the Government's intention, subject to the passing of this legislation, to allocate a <Col N="2199" /> portion of the funds received to the Royal National Lifeboat Institution.&rdquo;  I would be much happier with a phrase that would say: &ldquo;The Taoiseach has already announced the Government's decision.&rdquo; If a decision has been made and if it is recorded in a Cabinet meeting then I would be happy to be so assured by the Minister.  Intentions, as we all too well know, can be changed.  Therefore, like Deputy O'Malley and other speakers, I would ask the Minister in his Second Stage reply to avail of the opportunity to confirm that it is a decision subject to legislation and that the sum of money is £1.1 million.  I have information to that effect and that it is for purposes set out in the Minister's speech.</P>
    <P>The second point of concern is this shifting around with subheads from the Department of Foreign Affairs to the Department of the Taoiseach.  No satisfactory explanation for this has been given by the Minister in his brief opening speech.  Since at some stage clearly the decision was implicit in the fact that a subhead was opened in the Foreign Affairs Estimates to allocate moneys to the Department of Foreign Affairs for disbursal to organisations that would qualify, organisations of an Anglo-Irish, cross-Border, North-South dimension, with a suitable linkage presumably for purposes that would pick up some of the echoes of the original intention of the trust, I cannot understand why that subhead was opened in the first instance in the Department of Foreign Affairs and why it is now being transferred to the Department of the Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>Quite frankly, the Taoiseach's Department, with the present incumbent, has opened up a parallel arts fund, overturning decisions and becoming a court of appeal in some cases for disappointed suitors who apply to the Arts Council for funds in the first place.  If they do not get the funds in Merrion Square perhaps they might get them in Merrion Street.  All the complications and rivalries do no good to anybody.  That has been the experience. It is something that has happened in the last two years.  We are not speculating <Col N="2200" /> about the possibilities or the probabilities. We are talking about things that have been experienced in our society which, for these purposes, is a very small society indeed.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the idea that the Taoiseach would have moneys transferred to his Department without any clear indication as to what they might be spent upon, having regard to the Fianna Fáil Party's reluctance over many years to recognise or pay tribute to many of the North-South dimensions of our society, makes me nervous. That nervousness is shared by the Labour Party in its entirety &mdash; we discussed this matter at our parliamentary party meeting this morning before I came into the House.  Unless we get a satisfactory indication from the Minister, clearly putting on record the types of bodies and the organisations to whom this money will be allocated, we will have to consider our position in relation to any amendments that will be put down on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The last thing I would like to say &mdash; I do not wish to delay the time of the House because other speakers are offering &mdash; is to propose to the Taoiseach and to the Minister present that one thing that should be done, one thing that is sadly missing, is that a comprehensive and clear explanatory documentation, panel or some form of permanent information be erected and installed in the context of the war memorial at Islandbridge that was designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens.  It is one of the great scandals of our society that that monument was left semi-derelict for years.  Happily, it has been restored in recent years but yet many of the children and young families who go through that park during their leisure time have not the slightest idea for what purposes the memorial was erected or the extent to which hundreds, if not thousands of Dubliners, let alone people from the rest of the country, fought in the First and Second World Wars.  It would be appropriate and totally within the spirit of this legislation, and indeed the trust which was originally set up and which we are now proposing to dissolve, that some suitably designed and annotated document <Col N="2201" /> or communication be provided to inform the people, and future generations of people, what took place and why the city saw fit to erect a memorial and to get at that time the services of perhaps the greatest living British architect in the world to design it.  It would be a permanent explanation that would enable us to pay proper respect and gratitude to a generation of people who gave their lives and suffered for us.  On that point I will conclude and I would remind the Minister that we will be looking for specific information in this regard in his reply.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I thank the Whips for the appropriateness of the time at which this Bill is introduced, just before Remembrance Day.  Previous speakers have referred to the major defect in the Minister's proposals in the Bill and in his speech which is that the major proportion of the money from this trust fund is going into the huge maw of the Exchequer to be handed out by the Taoiseach, or the appropriate Minister, at his will, moneys which do not belong to the Taoiseach, the Minister or the Government.  The Taoiseach has already graciously announced how he is going to allocate the money.  It is his intention to give a certain undisclosed amount to the Royal National Lifeboat Institution, a very deserving cause, to assist them in purchasing a further lifeboat and providing better facilities.  There is no indication of how much will be allocated.  It seems that the Taoiseach is deciding how he will disburse these funds and that is the big weakness that has been pointed out by everybody.  The Taoiseach has no more right to decide in advance how these funds will be distributed than he has to decide how the lottery funds will be distributed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The British Government have made a very clear decision on what they are going to do but I totally disagree with it.  They set out that 40 per cent will go to support ex-servicemen's charities, North and South, and 60 per cent will go to the Exchequer.  I would totally oppose that if I was arguing the case on the British side. They have made a clear decision in regard <Col N="2202" /> to 40 per cent of their funds.  Everyone will know where 40 per cent of their funds are going because it is set down in a Bill in advance in the House of Parliament etc., that 40 per cent will go to support ex-servicemen's charities North and South.</P>
    <P>We have nothing like that here.  There is nothing in the Bill to tell us how much money there is at all.  We learn nothing from that. The Minister's speech tells us that £1.6 million was paid into the Exchequer last January already and £747,000 was paid in just recently.  That is a total of £2,347,000 paid over to the Exchequer already.  Further payments of a smaller nature will be coming over the next few years.  Now we know a very substantial £2.347 million is to be disbursed but the Minister gives no indication either percentagewise or in actual terms how much money is being given to anybody, how much is to remain in the Exchequer or how much is to be distributed in any way whatsoever except at the discretion of the Taoiseach through the appropriate Minister.  We have certainly almost returned to the monarchist system in this so-called republic of ours.</P>
    <P>A sum of £750,000 has been set aside in the Estimates this year, we are told by the Minister.  That is from taxpayers' money or wherever.  It does not say £750,000 of this money or any such thing, but £750,000 has been set aside in the Estimates this year to assist projects of this type; whatever &ldquo;of this type&rdquo; is we do not know.  It is very important in discussing this Bill, particularly on Committee Stage, that we decide where we feel the money should go and how much of it.  Everyone would agree absolutely that the Royal National Lifeboat Institution is an excellent area for allocation of funds.  How much?  One third?  A half? A million pounds is nothing for buying boats, modern technological equipment, facilities etc. for rescue services.  How much?</P>
    <P>Then we come to the remainder. Nobody has mentioned our ex-servicemen here.  Our ex-servicemen through the Organisation of National Ex-Servicemen have been pressing the case <Col N="2203" /> for assistance for housing for ex-servicemen. They have pointed out in the past year or 18 months that former soldiers, ex-servicemen of the Irish Army, are found sleeping rough on the streets and that one was found dead on the street.  They have asked for assistance in establishing a hostel or some type of accommodation for soldiers who after 21 years' service or whatever, totally institutionalised, unable to cope with society, need assistance in housing but there is nothing for them.  It would be appropriate, and we are putting down an amendment on Committee Stage to this effect, that funds be allocated for assistance to ex-servicemen and servicemen in their own housing.  This is a trust fund for housing, specifically housing for soldiers and sailors, housing for both ex-servicemen and soldiers in service, whose accommodation in some cases is absolutely appalling, and that is coming to light only now through this organisation of spouses who are bringing matters such as pay, conditions and accommodation to light.  Accommodation for soldiers and ex-soldiers should be assisted out of this fund.</P>
    <P>Therefore, while agreeing with the intention of the Taoiseach as disclosed in the Minister's speech with regard to the RNLI, I feel we need to decide what is to be done with the remainder of the fund, but the important thing we are discussing is this Bill.  This Bill says nothing about the RNLI.  This Bill simply means &ldquo;Give it to the Minister and we will decide how we will allocate it the same as we decide how the lottery funds will be allocated&rdquo;.  That is totally unacceptable. We must make a decision in this Bill to direct the Government how to allocate these funds.  That is the issue we must face on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. G. FitzGerald Dr. G. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. G. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like at the outset to join in the tributes paid to Lord Killanin in connection with this matter, a man who for 40 years has been a trustee of this fund.  When the question of its being wound up arose he undertook on his own initiative efforts to ensure that <Col N="2204" /> the money would not accrue to the British Exchequer solely but that there would be distribution beneficial to this State as well as to Britain.  The negotiations he undertook were difficult, and the British Treasury are no different from the Department of Finance in their concern to lay their hands on any money available.  It was not easy to secure an arrangement under which a large part of the money will go to purposes other than accruing simply to the Exchequer in the UK, and we owe a great debt to him for the manner in which he negotiated this matter.  As a result a significant proportion, 32 per cent, of the funds are accruing to us in this State.</P>
      <P>I would like to echo what Deputy Quinn has said about the ex-servicemen for whom the benefit of this trust was originally initiated.  We are inclined to forget that 130,000 Irishmen fought in the First World War and 49,000 died.  We are also very much inclined to forget that in the Second World War over 80,000 Irishmen fought of whom the majority came from this State, 43,000, with 38,000 from Northern Ireland.  Because myths have grown up around that period, myths that happened to suit both the British and Irish Governments, there is a tendency to ignore the reality of what happened at that time.  I do not want to dwell on this particularly now, but it has some relevance because the Government of the day under Deputy de Valera interpreted neutrality in a particular way which favoured Britian consistently in accordance with what he had told the German Minister at the eve of the outbreak of war.  He said consideration would be shown to Britain, and that consideration included taking no steps to discourage recruitment to the British Army at the time to assist in the allied victory which in the Irish Army.  Many other acts were taken secretly by the Government at that time to assist in the Allied victory which were never talked about either then or afterwards, as it suited Deputy de Valera to give an impression of great neutrality and it suited Mr. Churchill to concur in that myth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In any event, the fund derives from those events, and the fund related to <Col N="2205" /> 210,000 Irishmen who served in the two wars.  However, a number of questions arise in relation to the distribution of the funds.  When I discussed this with Lord Killanin when he told me first that the opportunity existed to secure some of the funds for this country, we agreed that they should be put to the purposes which have been mentioned in general terms in the Minister's speech, that is, they would be used for the benefit of North-South Anglo-Irish co-operation or projects of an all-Ireland dimension, and in that context I suggested the RNLI as something which served the whole of the island. Lord Killanin easily concurred with that suggestion.</P>
    <P>I am happy to say there are many such institutions still today.  I mentioned another institution, the Royal Irish Academy, which also is an all-Ireland institution, and indicated I thought that was also suitable for the allocation of part of the funds.  Let us hope the present Government will consider that when allocating the funds.  I am glad the commitment I entered into as to the purpose for which the funds would be used is being maintained by the Government.  I would prefer if the wording were a little stronger and, instead of saying the Government would endeavour to do their share for these purposes, that the Minister would say they would use their share for these purposes.  There are some curious points that have been raised and which need to be clarified further.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. G. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>First, it was made quite clear, as Deputy O'Malley has pointed out, by Lord Killanin in the House of Lords that what the present Taoiseach had said to him was that the money would not in fact be snapped up and put into the treasury.  I, indeed, used similar, if not identical, words to that effect.  I do not understand therefore, in view of the assurances given by two Taoisigh in this matter, how it is that the Bill provides that the money be paid into the Exchequer.  The Minister would need to clarify that.  It may be necessary to <Col N="2206" /> have an amendment to change that and to provide that the money be used in accordance with the arrangements which both myself and my successor agreed with Lord Killanin.</P>
      <P>Second, I am as puzzled as other Deputies are by the provision that it should be disposed of in such manner as the Taoiseach directs.  There exists in the Department of Foreign Affairs funds for the benefit of Anglo-Irish co-operation and funds for the benefit of North-South co-operation.  Certainly when I envisaged this money being put to these purposes it did not occur to me to set up a rival fund for the same purpose in my Department. It is the kind of duplication which I did my best to avoid if possible, and I am very glad that the decision was taken initially that that money should go to the Department of Foreign Affairs.  I do not understand why it is being diverted back. There is a fund there; there is a subhead in the Vote for this purpose and it is inexplicable that we would want to have rival projects assisting North-South or Anglo-Irish co-operation.  I cannot imagine why anybody would want to do that.  At least I cannot imagine any good reason for doing that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am well aware of the tendency of Departments to want to run things themselves and a certain rivalry exists between Departments.  Indeed a certain rivalry has always existed between the Taoiseach's Department and the Department of Foreign Affairs as I know from my own experience of both Departments, but it is carrying it rather far if the Department of the Taoiseach wishes to set up in competition with the Department of Foreign Affairs in distributing funds for these purposes.  This can only be harmful because these allocations need to be made in a co-ordinated way.  If there are two Departments distributing money for the same purpose one is almost bound to have duplication and gaps.  In some cases money will be provided through two channels for the same purpose and in other cases, for a good purpose, nothing will be provided.  There is no justification for that.  An amendment is required here to provide that the money <Col N="2207" /> shall be disposed of in such way as the Minister for Foreign Affairs, instead of the Minister for Finance, directs.  That is something we should look at.</P>
    <P>We should also endeavour to put into the Bill a provision to cover the commitment entered into by myself and my successor and referred to in the Minister's speech.  The exact wording of this is something to be considered but it should be provided at the end of section 2 that the objects to which it is applied shall be related to the island of Ireland as a whole or to co-operation between the State and Northern Ireland or the State and Great Britain.  Something like that would give effect to the intentions I had and my successor has also.  As it stands at present there is no commitment other than a ministerial speech that the Department will endeavour to use its share for those purposes which is really not what was understood and not indeed what the British Parliament was assured in relation to this matter by Lord Killanin following his discussions with myself and my successor. Some change is needed there.</P>
    <P>I am as mystified as Deputy O'Malley or Deputy Quinn were about the Supplementary Estimate providing for money to be given to the Irish Sailors and Soldiers Land Trust.  As I understand it, the Estimate says what the money is for, where it is to go.  That is where it has come from.  Is it seriously intended to channel it back into that trust for that trust to distribute it rather than the Royal National Lifeboat Institution.  If the trust is to do it what have the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance got to do with it in the Bill?  I cannot make sense of the Bill and the Supplementary Estimate together.  There may be some technical reason for this which is totally obscure to me.  We would really need, before we decide on the Supplementary Estimate, to know what it means.  Does it mean the money is to be paid, as it would appear on the surface of it, to this trust for which it is coming, and if so how does that mesh in with the provisions of the Act?  We cannot simultaneously endorse the <Col N="2208" /> Second Reading of a Bill and the Supplementary Estimate to put the same money to quite different purposes that are, on the face of it, mutually contradictory. That may be something that can be reconciled.  I will not dwell on it because the Minister may be able to clarify it; there may be some technical explanation for it.  If there is not an explanation we would certainly need to consider the phraseology of the Supplementary Estimate.</P>
    <P>These are some of the points that occurred to me in relation to a Bill which I very much welcome.  I particularly welcome the clear intention as regards the purposes for which the money will be spent.  We are not quarrelling about that. It is the manner in which the Bill and Supplementary Estimate fail to give effect to the stated intentions of the Minister in his speech that gives rise to concern.  I think therefore that we should wait to hear the Minister's reply and, in the light of that, we can all consider what amendments to this legislation may be required in order that it may fulfill the intentions of those who originally were involved, the present Taoiseach, myself, my predecessor and Lord Killanin.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to hold the House up with any observations about the main purposes of the Bill, which is to regularise the position in regard to the fund arising from the long history of shared responsibility for Irish sailors and soldiers in the First World War.</P>
      <P>I want to raise simply a couple of points which represent my feelings about the way this Bill seems to be joining a trend in the way this country is governed.  I notice that the Bill has in section 5 the following sentence:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;This may be cited as the Irish Sailors and Soldiers Land Trust Act, 1988&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I suggest there ought to be a further subsection there saying that this Act shall be cited, together with the National Lottery Act, as the windfall Acts because we are not developing a situation where we have finance on two levels in this State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2209" /> That would not matter so much were it not for what the party opposite might see as the trifling fact that the Constitution does not countenance running the State finances in that fashion.  Second, it appears to create two tiers of recipients, two tiers of beneficiary for the disbursement of State funds.</P>
    <P>I must point to the lottery without getting away from the subject of this Bill.  I want to observe that quite a number of the large range of objectives under that scheme, not perhaps golf clubs and tennis clubs &mdash; we have come a long way since the days when it was thought impossible that they should require a public subsidy &mdash; are objectives which once upon a time were provided for out of general taxation; in other words, they had to queue up and fight for their place at the Cabinet table the same as every other single thing.  I am all in favour of trying to give a leg up to things which have been cinderellas in the past, like cultural activities and both Departments of the National Museum which have been scandalously neglected for so long that they should be given a leg up, but that should be done by the Government in the discharge of its collective responsibility, and those objects, and ones like them, should not be downgraded to a second tier where they can be administered without any direct responsibility, item by item, to this House by a Minister.</P>
    <P>I am leaving aside all allegations about political intentions or political slush funding. I am not making any such allegation. Even if the thing were quite free of that, even if there was no such thing as a suspicious pattern emerging in where those parcels of manna fall as between Minister's constituencies and others, even if that were not in the picture, I would still object to the principle whereby certain objectives, once upon a time funded from general taxation, out of the general fund, now are demoted to a level which is expected to look to the lottery for sustenance or nowhere.  That is an abdication of collective ministerial responsibility and it is taking a step backwards on the part of the Government from one of the principles, not perhaps <Col N="2210" /> explicit, on which our constitution, and the constitution of other States like it, is founded.</P>
    <P>We now have an additional member of this club and that is why I suggested that they should be collectively cited as the windfall Acts.  This sum of money does not go very far into the seven figures, between what arrived last year and what is arriving now &mdash; certainly, it is a very humble little fund by comparison with the national lottery &mdash; but it is not being fed into the national Exchequer in the way that other produce, other taxes, the sales of thinnings from State forests, fines or other miscellaneous State revenue is to be disposed of in the general pool after the Government have thrashed out which objective is more entitled to the money than another.</P>
    <P>That is a pernicious principle, and it is doubly so when I see not only that the money, although going into the Central Fund as Article 11 of the Constitution requires, is going in with a label around its neck saying that that money, whatever about the rest of the money in the Central Fund, is not going to be at the free disposal of the Government in the construction of their budget for next year or in the construction of their Estimates. That money will be at the disposal of the Taoiseach.  I hope that the Minister, Deputy Ray Burke, who knows that I am not one of the Taoiseach's admirers, will give me credit for not unfairly going out of my way to find faults where there is no reason for them.  I hope he will believe that I would make that statement if I found that fault emerging under any Taoiseach.  However, I have noticed that under this Taoiseach there is a tendency to gather things into his own hands.  I am afraid I would have said that if I had noticed Deputy Garret FitzGerald behaving like that in his time as Taoiseach. Perhaps, I would not have said it in the Chamber with the same vigour but I would have said it in the party.</P>
    <P>There is a certain Caligula factor, if I may call it that, at work here in our legislature and in the Executive Departments of our Government.  More and more the Taoiseach is in the middle of <Col N="2211" /> the picture.  He is ordering an inquiry into something which is not his business at all departmentally.  He is, indeed, as the author of the principal text on this subject said, the captain of the ship and he must keep his finger on the pulse.  It is perfectly ordinary, right and natural that he should be a leader to his own Ministers but it is not right and natural that he should step in over their heads and take up the departmental responsibilities which belong to them under the Constitution individually as members of a Government.</P>
    <P>This relatively humble little fund is going into the Central Fund, as Article 11 requires, in a way that Article 11 does not envisage.  It is going in tied up in a parcel with a ticket attached saying that the money, although it is resting on a shelf in the room marked &ldquo;Central Fund&rdquo;, may not be disposed of in the same way that the rest of the money in the Central Fund is but is to be at the disposal of the Taoiseach, with the consent of the Minister for Finance.  It is possible that if the Minister for Finance, whose imminent departure has stiffened his spine in the last 18 months to the point where he is getting admiration from this side of the House, was to stay put we would not see so much of this.  Who imagines that Deputy Haughey's Minister for Finance, whoever he is, would withhold his consent for some objective which the Taoiseach had designated?</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the House to bear with what I hope will not be thought a pedantry.  I should like to direct the attention of the House to Article 17.2 of the Constitution which states:</P>
    <P>Dáil Éireann shall not pass any vote or resolution, and no law shall be enacted, for the appropriation of revenue or other public moneys unless the purpose of the appropriation shall have been recommended to Dáil Éireann by a message from the Government signed by the Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>The national lottery funds are not in the same category but this money is clearly, and unequivocally, going into the Central <Col N="2212" /> Fund because the Bill says so and Article 11 of the Constitution requires it.  This morning we are engaged in enacting a law for the appropriation of that public money and the way we are appropriating it is that we are saying it should be place freely at the disposal of the Taoiseach, with the consent of the Minister for Finance. I accept that the general political intention to devote it to a worthy cause has been disclosed openly in the House and I have no quarrel with that but it might just as easily, so far as what we are doing is concerned, not have been disclosed.  It is the principle underlying the mechanism which we are being required to operate this morning that I want to object to.</P>
    <P>There is no message from the Government, signed by the Taoiseach, telling the Dáil in the form which Article 17 requires, what the purpose of the appropriation is or where this money is going. It is perfectly true that this is not a very thoroughly explored part of the Constitution. It rarely comes under the notice of the courts and I may have misunderstood it.  I do not want to be set up as an authority on an Article which has not been kicked around so much that people know exactly what it means. However, on the letter and spirit of the Constitution I must seriously object to the principle which we appear to be swallowing, for the second time, that quite substantial sums of money coming into the State's hands are not being disposed of in a normal manner whereby the House requires an account from the Minister concerned about the objectives. The mere fact that in this instance we have been told where it is intended to spend the money does not change the principle I have tried to underline.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the fact that the fund is being regularised.  The Government are enacting legislation to coincide with British legislation which will allow this fund to be brought under the control of an Irish Government. However, I am concerned that the fund is to be administered by the Department of the Taoiseach.  Members will be aware <Col N="2213" /> of the debate that is taking place about the pay, conditions and allowances of the Defence Forces and surely it should have been possible to allocate those funds to those people.  We all recognise that the housing conditions of many members of the Defence Forces are not up to standard. In fact, they are such that at local authority housing allocation meetings we must consider how many and how often we can accommodate those unfortunate people.  It is a sad reflection on our society that we treat members of the Defence Forces in that fashion.  It is sad to think that in the last week members of the Defence Forces resorted to the only constitutional means available to them to highlight their plight by submitting to the Houses of the Oireachtas their legitimate claim for an urgent review of their pay, conditions and allowances.  That is a national disgrace and is tantamount to creating a security risk.  The spouses of members of the Defence Forces have been forced to lobby Members outside the House of Parliament in an effort to highlight the need to review pay and conditions.</P>
      <P>Last week the Minister did not give detailed replies to the many questions put to him about the pay, conditions and allowances of soldiers.  He told us that it was not his intention to bring forward any interim arrangements pending the outcome of the review by the interdepartmental committee.  The Minister said he did not intend to expedite that report.  Bearing that in mind it is a sad reflection on Members of the House that we should allow that to continue.  The logical way to dispose of the fund under discussion would be to allocate it to the Department of Defence.  I have no doubt that the Minister could put it to good use. He would be able to improve the housing conditions and allowances of soldiers and eliminate the discontent that exists in the Defence Forces.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister indicated in the House the other day that he was not aware of the low morale which exists in the Army. He indicated also that there appeared to be no urgency in the manner in which he should address that problem.  However, <Col N="2214" /> I think there is, and the Minister should have this fund at his disposal.  The fund, in so far as the money would go, should be used by the Minister to ensure that at least reasonable housing conditions would be available for our armed forces. A great opportunity will be lost if the Minister does not do this.  I cannot understand why at this time the fund should be made available to the office of the Taoiseach for disposal at their discretion when the obvious Minister to deal with the fund would and should be the Minister for Defence.</P>
    <P>While I welcome the proposal to regularise the situation and bring the matter within the control of this House, nonetheless an opportunity will be lost if the Minister for Defence has not first call on this small sum of money from the fund as it becomes available.  It is a sad and sorry reflection on our society that the spouses of our Defence Forces should have had to suffer the indignity of having to come before us and lobby us like beggars so that they could have their grievances about pay and conditions and their legitimate demands aired in a realistic fashion.  Naturally, they are entitled to a realistic response from the Government and the Minister had such an opportunity in this instance.</P>
    <P>The most unfortunate circumstances surrounding this Bill is that it should have come at a time when public attention is rightly directed at the valid grievances our Defence Forces have at present.  The Minister for Defence gave the impression in the House that there was no great problem or urgency about the situation. Anybody who has experience of visiting the quarters of many of the members of our Defence Forces and can honestly say that we do not have a problem or that there is no urgency about it would be treating the members of our Defence Forces very badly.</P>
    <P>We depend on the Defence Forces to resolve every emergency that arises whether it be transport, fire or ambulance services or in any other quarter.  Our Defence Force are called on to stand in line and do their duty and they do it without a grumble.  They repeatedly do <Col N="2215" /> so and very often they are in the field alongside people, who are, rightly, on a scale of better pay and allowances.  It must be a very sore point when they, their wives and families, compare what they get by way of recompense with what is given to other sectors, and I am talking about the entire public service.  The very people on whom we depend so much in times of emergency should be the first people we consider when we think of the disbursements of this fund.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to convey to his ministerial colleagues our concern at the current situation of Army pay and conditions and to ask them to take the first opportunity to do something realistic about it.  They should at least recognise the fact that a serious problem exists.  I have said before that it is tantamount to a security problem.  If the people on whom we depend ultimately for the security of the State have a legitimate grievance, and I fully accept that they have, we should do something about it. Otherwise, we are not living up to our responsibilities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The original purpose of this trust was to provide houses for ex-servicemen. That was done in many Irish towns and this served a great need at the time.  The needs of ex-servicemen have not disappeared and I am aware that a significant, although not a very large problem, facing the Defence Forces is to provide accommodation for retired servicemen from our Defence Forces who are single and have no family connections and who literally do not have a home to go to.  This problem exists.  I have come across it in my own constituency and I know it arises in other garrison towns as well.  It would be entirely apposite that some of the moneys coming from this trust would be spent on a scheme whereby accommodation could be provided in or near military barracks for ex-servicemen in that category.  It would also have the great advantage that it would be entirely in line with the original objectives of the trust.  These people are entitled to the consideration of the State <Col N="2216" /> because almost invariably these soldiers have come out after the maximum period of service with no other occupation and very often have no families &mdash; in fact very often they could have been orphan when they enlisted originally 30 odd years ago. Their plight is deserving of attention.  I make a plea to the Minister when considering the methods in which this money should be spent to consider that small deserving and unspoken for section of our community who have served the State loyally throughout their entire lives.  They are, as I say, homeless in many cases and have to end up in hostels far away from the community environment where all their friends remain.  I repeat that it would be entirely apposite that the money be spent in that way, having regard to the original objectives of the trust.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I shall deal with the last point, a point that was raised also by Deputies Durkan, Connaughton and Mac Giolla.  This is the matter of the use of the fund for Defence Force accommodation. There is an understanding with the British Government that the trust fund will be used for North-South or Anglo-Irish co-operation or for projects with an all-Ireland dimension That is the understanding in the division of the funds in the ratio of 32 per cent to 68 per cent.</P>
      <P>With regard to accommodation for the Defence Forces, there is a provision of £9.8 million for Army buildings, accommodation etc. in the 1989 Estimates.  This represents an 11 per cent increase on this year's provision.  I can assure the Deputies that the Government are fully conscious of the accommodation requirements of the Defence Forces and will take every possible measure to improve the position.  The increased allocation for 1989 is firm evidence of this.  However, in the light of the understandings that have been entered into for the division of this relatively small sum of money, it would be outside that agreement to use this money for the provision of accommodation for our Defence Force, either retired or otherwise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to re-echo the tribute I <Col N="2217" /> paid to Lord Killanin at the outset, and which has been voiced by most of the speakers, for his work on the trust since he was appointed to it in 1955.  In particular, I would like to pay tribute to him for his work in bringing the division of the funds to the stage they are at now. He, at all times protected the Irish interests while being on the trust and we are very grateful to him for that.</P>
    <P>The role played by Irish citizens from the Republic in the First World War and in the 1939-45 conflict, the fact that this was not recognised, was raised by Deputies FitzGerald and Quinn.  This was a matter of contention for many years.  We had the spectacle on the British National Day of Commemoration where some political parties were represented in the Cathedral and others were not.  To remove that contention and to move away from that spectacle a committee of this House were established and it was decided that we should have a National Day of Commemoration.  It is right and proper that we have such an event.  We have it in July every year and all the bodies mentioned by Deputy Quinn and others, including the British Legion, attend that national day of commemoration. I was surprised that that whole chestnut was raised again today as this is a matter that has been solved and as we now have a national day of commemoration with which all can be associated.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley, Deputy Quinn and other Deputies asked for categoric guarantees in relation to where the funds would be allocated and were seeking &mdash; while it is not in the legislation &mdash; irrevocable guarantees on the record.  I should like to say that the Royal National Lifeboat Institution grant is a decision, it is a commitment.  That decision was first mooted years ago, as Deputy FitzGerald rightly said.  The grant will be in the order of £1 million to £1.1 million &mdash; £500,000 this year and £500,000 to £600,000 next year.  The reason I cannot say whether it is £1 million or £1.1 million is that we do not know the full cost of the lifeboat and exactly how much will be spent on the upgrading of the facilities along the west <Col N="2218" /> coast.  The Royal National Lifeboat Institution will purchase a new lifeboat and expand the search and rescue facilities on the west and north-west coast.  We believe that is a very suitable project on which to spend this windfall fund.  It is not an indication of where it is going; a decision has been made and this has been referred to before by the former Taoiseach and he confirmed it here also.  The only question open for debate is the final costings and that depends on the Royal National Lifeboat Institution.  The funds cannot be paid over to them until this Bill is passed.  It will be paid in two stages &mdash; £500,000 this year and the balance next year.  The Department of the Marine will, of course, be consulted at all times and will be in co-operation with the Royal National Lifeboat Institution on this matter.</P>
    <P>The question was asked as to who else would benefit and what specific groups have been involved in making applications for funds.  I want to make it absolutely clear that the fund will be used &mdash; as was the understanding between ourselves and the British Government &mdash; for North-South or Anglo-Irish co-operation or for projects of an all-Ireland dimension.</P>
    <P>I would like to give the House an indication of the groups that have made application already and how those applications will be dealt with.  An interdepartmental committee will be set up consisting of representatives of the Departments of the Taoiseach, Finance and Foreign Affairs to meet the point made by Deputy FitzGerald in relation to the need for coordination an co-operation so that there cannot be a fall between the Departments of Foreign Affairs, the Taoiseach, Finance and other areas.  The applications will be examined by the interdepartmental committee before decisions are made.</P>
    <P>An application has been received from the Irish Association to help them with a difficulty in which they have found themselves in relation to a commitment which was entered into by particular patrons of jubilee celebrations who have now withdrawn. Applications have also been <Col N="2219" /> received from the curriculum schools project North South and a number of schools in Britain.  A new anthology of Irish literature is being considered for funding and that application comes from the Derry area.  Other projects for which funds are being sought are cross-Border sheltered accommodation for the elderly in the Derry area, this would include the Donegal and Derry side.  Those are the types of projects that are being considered for funding.</P>
    <P>Regarding the role of the Taoiseach, because of the nature of the Sailors and Soldiers Land Trust and the fact that the Taoiseach appoints the Government representative to the trust, it is entirely appropriate that he should have the powers given to him under the Bill.  It should also be noted that successive Taoisigh have exercised overall responsibility for the affairs of the trust of Ireland.</P>
    <P>There was considerable reference to the lottery and the lottery legislation.  We did not bring in the lottery legislation, it was brought in by the previous administration. However, there is a Private Members' Bill before the House at present and it would not be appropriate to get into a further debate on it now.</P>
    <P>The question of the rights of existing tenants was raised.  Tenants can remain in their homes.  They can purchase these houses but, in practice, many may not wish to do so at this advanced stage of their lives.  The Bill does not affect the tenants rights in any way.  For the information of the House there are only 15 tenants here at present and 70 in the North.</P>
    <P>Regarding the point made by Deputy O'Malley in relation to how the British Government handled their legislation: they are allocating 40 per cent of their portion of the trust fund for the support of ex-servicemen's charities North and South.  The balance of the British Government's share will be absorbed by their Exchequer.  We have not got a specific percentage written down but I have already given a figure for the Royal National Lifeboat Institution which will be about 40 per cent.  It is not intended <Col N="2220" /> that it would be absorbed into the general kitty because, to the use the phrase of Deputy Kelly, &ldquo;it is a relatively humble little sum&rdquo; that we are talking about.</P>
    <P>In relation to the title of the Supplementary Estimate and because it is a windfall-type sum &mdash; which was the phrase used earlier &mdash; we specifically want to identify the trust funds rather than absorb them into the overall Estimate. That fits in with our understanding with the British authorities on how we will spend the funds in co-operation projects on Anglo-Irish and North-South, east-west and overall island funds.  We have told the British this on a number of occasions.</P>
    <P>Deputy Quinn asked how much more money would come in.  Most of the money is in at this stage and it is about £2.3 million.  It is very difficult to put a figure on it but the expectation is that there cannot be any more than another £300,000 to come in.  Deputy Mac Giolla said that this money would be absorbed into the Exchequer; it will not, and that is why its identification is specifically mentioned in the Estimate.  The fund will be allocated for the co-operation projects we have mentioned.  Already in our allocations we have gone further than the British have gone with their specific 40 per cent guarantee.  I have answered most of the points that have been raised at this stage.  Deputy Kelly had a counterargument that the funds should go into the general pool.  We do not believe that and we have entered into agreements in relation to it.  Quite clearly the money will be of benefit and it is coming as a result of the winding up of the trust.</P>
    <P>It is money which will be used by the British Government to the extent of 40 per cent of their portion for the support of ex-servicemen's charities North and South.  They will take the balance and absorb it into their Exchequer.  We do not intend to do it that way.  We have entered into discussions with the British Government and the agreement we have reached will be fully honoured.  The funds will be spent on the North-South or Anglo-Irish co-operation or on projects with an all-Ireland dimension.  The first <Col N="2221" /> project we have allocated funds to is the Royal National Lifeboat Institution which will get between £1 million and £1.1 million.  The other groups I mentioned are the first groups who have applied for allocations out of the funds.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. G. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister to clarify a point which I found obscure?  The Minister said that the purpose of the wording of the Supplementary Estimate was to clarify that the fund is a separate fund from the Exchequer for the purposes of disbursement but, in fact, the name is the name of the trust from which the money has come.  If we pass the Supplementary Estimate will the money go into that trust again?  Will the Minister explain the wording of the Supplementary Estimate?</P>

It is well and good to talk about a small amount of funding &mdash; and the House agrees that the Royal National Lifeboat Institution should receive £1.1 million &mdash; but I am far from satisfied what will happen with the other £2.2 million.  I would prefer if my party had a chance to look at it in the cold light of day, as it were, and we would put down amendments to get information from the Minister as to where the rest of this funding will go.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In lines 20, 21 and 22 to delete all words after &ldquo;and shall be&rdquo; and substitute:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;allocated to the Royal National Lifeboat Institution, for the purposes of providing hostel accommodation for service and ex-servicemen and for other purposes which the Minister for Foreign Affairs, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, directs&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I propose to confirm in law the intention and now the decision of the Government <Col N="2227" /> to give money to the Royal National Lifeboat Institution.  I support the amendment in the name of Deputy O'Malley. I understand an amendment has been circulated on behalf of The Workers' Party in relation to ex-servicemen's accommodation.  I support the move by Deputy Mac Giolla that some money should be allocated for that purpose and that the balance of moneys should be allocated for purposes which the Minister for Foreign Affairs considers appropriate. That would maintain the spirit of the agreement arrived at in 1986 by the two Governments.  If this amendment is accepted it would not contravene the spirit of an agreement arrived at by the British and Irish Governments because in effect, a sum of £1 million, just about 40 per cent of the sum of money we can anticipate would come from this fund, is being given to an organisation which was considered by the participants to the agreement at that time as an eminently suitable body who would meet the all-Ireland dimension that North-South co-operation suggested.  That element can be accommodated in this amendment and we are not putting the Government into an embarrassing situation whereby an agreement entered into is now being reversed.  The provision for the Royal National Lifeboat Institute meets the spirit and the reality of that agreement.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cooney, Deputy Durkan and others referred to the plight of single ex-servicemen and to the problems of homelessness they face.  I overlooked this in my contribution on Second Stage but I agree that it is appropriate that some of the proceeds from this trust should be devoted to that purpose.  The balance of the moneys should be allocated by the Minister for Foreign Affairs.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Energy in his reply dealt with the question of subheads only partially to my satisfaction.  The Minister said that the subhead provided in the Taoiseach's Vote was entitled &ldquo;Irish Sailors and Soldiers Land Trust&rdquo;.  To meet the point raised by Deputy FitzGerald it should have been &ldquo;proceeds from the dissolution of that trust&rdquo;, but <Col N="2228" /> that is a minor matter.  I can understand the intention of the Taoiseach and the Government in clearly putting in this separate subhead so that this sum of money can be identified separately to meet the spirit of the agreement between the British and Irish Governments, but I do not understand why this is being transferred from the Department of Foreign Affairs to the Department of the Taoiseach.  I read the Minister's speech and listened to his closing remarks that because the Taoiseach's Department in the past have dealt with this matter, because the Taoiseach appointed the Irish representatives to the trust, it was appropriate that they should retain an interest in this and now, for the first time ever, have a direct role in allocating funds.  That is not appropriate. There is a tenuous logical connection but there is not an automatic presumption that the Taoiseach's Department should be involved in another interdepartmental committee allocating this kind of money and considering requests from publishing groups in Derry and from other bodies and so on.  That is not appropriate and it is second-guessing the Department of Foreign Affairs.  It should be done directly by the Department of Foreign Affairs without the Taoiseach's involvement other than in the normal Government process of consultation.  There should not be an interdepartmental committee.</P>
    <P>In my Second Stage contribution I referred to the considerable confusion that now exists in the artistic world in respect of the alternative Arts Council located in Upper Merrion Street.  This will be another potential area for confusion, because the cheques will be signed by the Taoiseach's nominees on that interdepartmental committee.  Will that parallel the various decision-making operations currently going on in the Department of Foreign Affairs in respect of North-South co-operation projects? The Minister speaking on this legislation today did not satisfy me on why the original decision to have these moneys disbursed by the Department of Foreign <Col N="2229" /> Affairs was changed to transfer the disbursement of this money to the Department of the Taoiseach.  I will not get into the question of lottery moneys and so on, but enough has happened to make us wary to begin with.  This is the business within the framework of the Anglo-Irish Agreement, of the Department of Foreign Affairs, and not of an interdepartmental committee.  Certainly, the Department of Finance, in an interDepartmental committee, should not have anything to do with this.  They should be far too busy minding their own business instead of second-guessing the appropriateness from a political point of view of cross-Border co-operation projects.</P>
    <P>My amendment attempts to stitch into the legislation the allocation to the Royal National Lifeboat Institute.  That allocation will meet the spirit of the agreement between the two Governments with regard to a substantial allocation going to an all-Ireland body.  The allocation is about 40 per cent and represents the same degree of allocation that the British authorities are making to organisations in the North.  My amendment also proposes that some moneys be provided for hostel accommodation for ex-servicemen. Deputy Mac Giolla has made a very good case for this and will no doubt add to it when he moves his amendment.  I agree with the points made by Deputy Mac Giolla.  The third point in my amendment is that other purposes within the broad framework of North-South co-operation would be the beneficiaries of the proceeds of this trust.  This should be decided upon by the Minister for Foreign Affairs in the conventional manner and the Taoiseach's Department should not be involved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>My amendment is the same in spirit as Deputy Quinn's.  I drafted it slightly differently to make it more precise.  Although I am not hung up on percentages I suggest that 50 per cent of this money should be given to the RNLI and that the other 50 per cent to such ex-servicemen's organisations as the Dáil should approve by motion.  Nobody has any objection to money being paid to <Col N="2230" /> the RNLI.  If we were to remain true to the spirit of the original trust, it is to ex-servicemen generally that perhaps the balance of the money should go.  It is well known that ex-servicemen of all armies living here tragically often have to live and die in the most deplorable circumstances. They are people to whom we owe a lot, irrespective of the army in which they fought.  I found the reply of the Minister for Energy unsatisfactory in that it was very vague, apart from what he said about the lifeboat.  There were references to some association having got into difficulties with their commitments because their patrons withdrew; another reference was to a publishing project in Northern Ireland on Irish literature.  We do not know very much about any of these.  They are somewhat removed from the original purpose of this trust.  There is no commitment by the Minister to expend the money for any particular purpose other than this lifeboat for County Mayo.  The rest of it is vague.  It is appropriate that it should be set out in a fairly precise way, otherwise there is a grave danger that the whole thing will be looked upon in the same way as the lottery funds, to be distributed in the same nod and wink fashion.</P>
      <P>Deputy Kelly referred to the Caligula factor and it is not something that should be overlooked in all circumstances.</P>

      <P>The main fault in section 2 is that it is not specific in any way in regard to the allocation of these funds which are regarded as a windfall but which were established for a specific purpose in regard to the Sailors and Soldiers Land Trust Fund.  Some vague references and suggestions about how it will be allocated have been made by the Minister but even the specific one, the allocation to the Royal National Lifeboat Institution, has not been put down in the legislation.  There is nothing to prevent the Minister or the Taoiseach from changing their minds in regard to the allocation of moneys.  I cannot understand why it can be put into a speech but not into the Bill.</P>
      <P>The main flaw of this Bill is that the moneys from the trust fund are simply being transferred to the Exchequer under section 2.  The Minister said it would be put into a special fund in the Exchequer not into the big maw of the Exchequer where it would be likely to be spent on anything.  The Bill simply provides that the moneys shall be paid into the Exchequer and disposed of as the Taoiseach chooses.  One hopes that the Minister will see the need for an amendment to that section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There seems to be a consensus developing among the Opposition parties &mdash; we have not heard from Fine Gael as yet &mdash; that they are in agreement with the Minister in regard to the RNLI as being an excellent organisation to which to contribute a proportion of the funds. It is an all-Ireland body but it also deals with sailors and soldiers and rescue services. It is an excellent idea.  The parties also agree that another proportion of the funds should be allocated to improving living conditions for serving soldiers or former members of the Defence Forces, ex-servicemen of the Irish Army.  I do not think any of us would argue with any <Col N="2232" /> of the amendments put down and with the various divisions suggested.  The Progressive Democrats wish to specify that 50 per cent should go to the RNLI and 50 per cent to ex-servicemen's organisations in Ireland.  The Labour Party amendment states that it should go to both but does not specify the percentages. Our amendment divides the money three ways, providing for 30 per cent, 30 per cent and 40 per cent.  We include all-Ireland projects of a social and cultural nature.</P>
    <P>This brings me to the main point of contention.  The Minister said that during discussions with the British Government which led up to the agreement on the repayment of the surplus funds there was an understanding that the Irish Government would endeavour to use their share for North-South or Anglo-Irish co-operation or for projects with an all-Ireland dimension.  When replying to the Second Stage debate the Minister repeated this statement and indicated that it would not be appropriate for that reason to provide funds for the ex-servicemen's organisations here because the funds would not be for an all-Ireland project.  He said the agreement did not provide for that.  We have not seen the agreement.  It is very important that we should see it.  What is the agreement?  The Minister simply said that in the discussions which led up to the agreement there was an understanding. We presume there is nothing in the agreement about this.  It did not prevent the British Government from giving it to their ex-servicemen.  They say it is given to ex-servicemen North and South, but we do not know how many are in the South.  How can the Minister say the Irish Army are not contributing to Anglo-Irish co-operation when they have been co-operating for years along the Border, day and night, living in absolutely brutal accommodation, under very bad conditions, with hopeless equipment, getting the lowest pay in the EC.  How can the Minister say they cannot come under North-South or Anglo-Irish co-operation when they have been co-operating for years along the Border?</P>
    <P>Irish servicemen and ex-servicemen fit <Col N="2233" /> in very well with the terms of the discussions which led up to the agreement, and presumably the agreement itself. There is nothing to prevent the Minister from showing his appreciation at this stage and using this little windfall to show this North-South co-operation, this Anglo-Irish co-operation, with ex-servicemen of both Forces benefiting from this trust fund which is appropriate for soldiers and sailors, British and Irish.  The British Government got 68 per cent of the money and decided to rip off 60 per cent of that.  They gave only 40 per cent to their ex-servicemen but that is their business.  We do not have to do that, and we should not do it.  We should give a proportion of this money to our ex-servicemen and our present servicemen, many of whom are living in very bad accommodation.</P>
    <P>As regards our amendment, we are prepared to move on the proportions but it is important that we specify the proportions in this Bill.  The Minister says 40 per cent will go to the RNLI but let us write that into the Bill, and let us say 30 per cent will be provided for our ex-servicemen and the balance of 30 per cent will go to all-Ireland projects of a social, cultural or educational nature, or whatever the Minister thinks.  It would be totally wrong to adopt the position that assistance to the ex-servicemen of the Irish Army does not fit into Anglo-Irish co-operation or North-South co-operation.</P>
    <P>I will be moving our amendment and hope the Minister will see that there is a consensus among the Opposition parties that some portion of the funds should be given to provide assistance for Irish ex-servicemen. In this section we should get down to the nitty gritty by specifying what proportions should go to various areas. If we do that, we will be tying down not just this Minister and this Taoiseach but other Ministers and Taoisigh to come because it may take four or five years for the balance of £300,000 to come here. As I said, section 2 should state what proportions should go to each area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. G. FitzGerald Dr. G. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. G. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to explain my <Col N="2234" /> amendment to say why I would have difficulty with the amendments already discussed. I can understand why Deputies should think this is an appropriate thing to do with the money and, in the absence of full information, it is understandable that they would not comprehend why this is not provided for in the agreement with the British Government.</P>
      <P>The position was that Lord Killanin had a very difficult task negotiating to secure any share of this fund because the British Treasury was concerned to keep it all and we had no clear legal right to any part of it.  It was therefore necessary to help him have a negotiating position that would enable him with the trustees, <i>vis-à-vis</i> the British Government and the British Treasury, to secure a positive outcome.</P>
      <P>One of the first thoughts I had in relation to the money was that it might be used to assist ex-servicemen in the Irish Army.  However, there would have been a difficulty in convincing the British trustees and the British Treasury that the money should be transferred from British ex-servicemen to Irish ex-servicemen. You may ask if it could not have been provided for both.  It could, and that might have been the answer, but at that time there were people agitating in an extremely unpleasant way against the commemoration of the dead of the two World Wars.  It was becoming a contentious issue in an areas where there should be no contention.  I had to consider what the impact would be if we made provision that the money would be used for British and Irish ex-servicemen, and what the reaction would be.  The last thing I wanted was to make this an area of contention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Faced with the invidious choice between proposing that it be provided, or a large part thereof &mdash; which would inhibit Lord Killanin's negotiations &mdash; or that it should be provided for both, arousing these ill-conditioned people who think the commemoration of the dead is something to make a political point about.  I felt the best course of action was to provide that the money be used in the way the Minister has indicated.  I take <Col N="2235" /> responsibility for that.  I can understand that Deputies feel I could have acted otherwise and my actions in that regard are obviously open to criticism, but, in fairness to the present Government, they cannot be blamed because they inherited the understanding that came from those discussions, and I have explained the rationale for them.</P>
    <P>It is on that basis that I submit my amendment which is designed to give legislative effect to the intentions set out in the Minister's speech.  The wording might need to be polished up between now and Report Stage, but the first word in the last line &ldquo;the&rdquo; should read &ldquo;to&rdquo;&mdash; my hasty handwriting is the reason for that error.  The purpose of my amendment is to give effect to the understanding between the two Governments which led to this not insignificant sum of money coming our way and to give effect to the intentions of our Government as set out in the Minister's speech.  I hope the Minister will accept this amendment, with whatever improvement in wording he feels may be necessary, possibly on Report Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I have only three minutes and the principle point I want to put before the House will take longer than that to explain.  However, I will use these three minutes to impress on the Minister, in regard to all the amendments before the House the desirability for him to seek between now and 3.45 p.m. some advice from the Attorney General or his office about the bearing of Article 11 and Article 17.2 of the Constitution on the Bill in front of us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is absurd for this House to spend the day chewing the rag over a piffling sum of money compared with our problems when the only point all Deputies are trying to make is that the beneficiaries from this distribution should be clearly shown in the Bill.  I have no preference. Obviously I take Deputy Garret FitzGerald's point in regard to the all-Ireland nature of the original group of beneficiaries being appropriately reflected in an all-Ireland distribution, and this is <Col N="2236" /> something Deputy Mac Giolla also wished, and I see a lot of merit in that, but I have no objection to the other amendments.  I do not want to take sides. I am certain any of these schemes would put a quick end to this matter.</P>
    <P>Unless the Government are passionately attached to establishing the precedent that a sum of money, perhaps in defiance of the Constitution, is passed through this House and lodged at the exclusive disposal of the Taoiseach, subject to the proper consent of the Minister for Finance, I ask the Minister &mdash; I know he is not the most flexible man in the world &mdash; to see if he could save a lot of time and agony for all concerned by getting the Attorney General to look at the points I am trying to make in as noncontentious a way as possible.  Any one of the amendments before the House would avoid the problem which I think I see in Article 11 which reads;</P>
    <P>All revenues of the State from whatever source arising shall, subject to such exception as may be provided by law, from one fund, and shall be appropriated for the purposes and in the manner and subject to the charges and liabilities determined and imposed by law.</P>
    <P>Provision is made in that Article for an exception but the exception provision relates to putting the money into one fund.  It is possible to make provision by law for money not to be put into that fund, but this Bill is not doing that.  This Bill is saying it is going into the Exchequer, into the Central Fund, but with an &ldquo;in áirithe&rdquo; ticket pinned to it. It is &ldquo;in áirithe&rdquo; for the disposal of the Taoiseach.  Maybe I am making a mountain out of a molehill but this is the sort of point which, if I were at the Bar, I could quite happily debate for three days at a high cost to someone.</P>

      <P>The Arts Council decided in March 1988 to terminate the funding of the Irish National Ballet Company. This was done some nine months after a two-year period of action and assessment had been agreed with the company.  The Arts Council indicated that they had earmarked £120,000 to meet the windingup costs of the company.  The Taoiseach decided that in the exceptional circumstances of this case, the £120,000 should be used to enable the company to continue pending a review of the situation by the incoming Arts Council.  The company are now using the £120,000 to mount a spring programme in 1989.  The consideration of the company's position thereafter will be a matter for the new Arts Council.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>The position in which the National Ballet Company find themselves is totally unsatisfactory.  Can the Minister not offer any statement in relation to their future funding so that the members of the company will have some security of tenure in regard to their artistic future and employment?  Is there <Col N="2238" /> any indication that the National Ballet Company will receive funding next year or do the Government intend to wind up the company?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will understand that it was the intention of the outgoing Arts Council to wind up the ballet company but, as a result of the intervention by the Taoiseach and having regard to the exceptional circumstances of the case, the company are still there, the matter will be reviewed by the incoming Arts Council and full consideration will then be given to their decision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Taoiseach's intervention &mdash; I had asked a question about this matter some weeks before he provided finance &mdash; but the situation, seven months later, is totally unsatisfactory. Has any indication been given by the Taoiseach's Department to the Arts Council regarding the future of the National Ballet Company?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should appreciate the situation as I outlined it, that the ballet company would have been put out of business but for the intervention of the Taoiseach, despite the fact that the two year assessment period was cut short by the outgoing Arts Councils after a period of nine months.  The ballet company are now going ahead and have their programme ready for 1989.  Consideration is being given to the question of whether the company will continue after the period.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I seek to impress upon the Minister the urgency of the situation because if the company wish to offer contracts of employment to prospective dancers, they need to be in a position to offer three year contracts.  Apparently this is the norm in this area.  Will the Minister impress on the new Arts Council that a decision is urgently required?  Will he also indicate &mdash; apart from the Taoiseach's intervention which I welcomed &mdash; whether the Government have a view as to whether the National Ballet Company have a future?</P>

The Taoiseach and the Government are fully aware of the importance of the National Ballet Company and a decision on the matter will be made as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>The staff in the CSO fluctuate from year to year depending on the activities taking place.  In 1988 there was a total staff of 500 which included 100 temporary staff who will not be required in 1989, the reason for that being that a household survey was taken in 1988 which will not be taken in 1989.  The Deputy will see from the information that the 100 persons who were temporarily employed coincide with the percentage figure quoted by him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Do I take it from that response that the 100 people who will not have jobs in the CSO next year are under subhead A.1 and that the reduction in the provision of subhead A.1 caters for 100 people fewer next year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VincentBrady" hpid="Mr. V. Brady Mr. V. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to that is that a large number of people are employed on a very temporary basis by the CSO from year to year depending on the activities.  Again from year to year, depending on the activities, a number of staff are employed on a temporary basis, <Col N="2246" /> which is the norm.  That has been the case for many years.  There is no change whatever in that policy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but if he feels reluctant to admit that 100 people fewer will be employed in that section, would he clarify for me that those 100 people's wages is the reduction in subhead A.1 in the Vote?  Secondly, will there be a reduction in numbers in the collection of statistics in the 15 per cent reduction under subhead D?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VincentBrady" hpid="Mr. V. Brady Mr. V. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>Under subhead A.1 the 100 people were employed in a temporary capacity and were taken on in 1988 for a specific purpose on the clear understanding that it was a temporary function that will not be required in 1989.  With regard to the second question, because of the changeover in the procedure there will not be the same requirement for temporary staff either as far as the agricultural sector are concerned.  We are talking purely about temporary staff who are employed on a very temporary basis to deal with a specific exercise.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East</i>): In recognising the importance of the information supplied by the CSO to the Government for the purpose of making decisions, can the Minister of State assure the House that the CSO will have enough funds to enable them to reconcile the contradictory reports which are coming from the office?  In the labour force survey the trend indicated for employment in industry is upward.  In the more recent survey the trend indicated for manufacturing industry is downward.  It will be impossible for the Government to form a policy on contradictory reports like that. Obviously, they have to be reconciled.  Is there sufficient funding in the office to do that?</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 and 29 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2252" /> Allegations of an alarming increase in the number of executions of political prisoners in Iran in the months since July of this year have been drawn to my attention. They are currently the subject of examination within my Department and are likely to have an impact on the forthcoming consideration of the question of human rights in Iran at the United Nations General Assembly.  We shall follow developments closely and make our concern known as appropriate. Regrettably it is not possible to obtain reliable figures for the categories requested by the Deputies.  Deputies are, of course, aware that infringements of human rights in Iran have been a matter of concern for several years and have been the subject of resolutions in the Commission on Human Rights and in the General Assembly which Ireland supported. Our views on this issue are clearly on the record.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister accepted that there are reports in the international press and elsewhere that the number of executions since 1981 in Iran total about 70,000, that there are 140,000 political prisoners there at the moment, that the number has been significantly increased in recent months. There are also very credible reports of mass executions taking place there in the last number of months.  In the light of those circumstances would the Minister accept that, as a country committed to human rights, there is a duty on us, both at the Human Rights Commission and at the United Nations to raise our own voice in protest against this total abuse of democracy and human rights?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the source of the information to which Deputy O'Keeffe has referred, the latest report on the situation of human rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran was prepared by the special representative of the Commission on Human Rights for the current session of the United Nations General Assembly.  This response sets out the allegations of violations of human rights, including violations of the right to life <Col N="2253" /> which have been brought to the attention of the special representative.  It invites the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran to provide any information or comments they wish with regard to those allegations.  While the special representative has, over time, made some progress in drawing the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran into a dialogue which could be conducive to improving the human rights situation in that country, he has to date failed to elicit detailed replies to specific allegations communicated to the Iranian authorities. The Commission on Human Rights and the General Assembly have explicitly shared the opinion expressed by the special representatives in previous reports that the denial by the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran of the allegations of violations of human rights as a whole without details is not sufficient for a sensible assessment of the situation of human rights in that country. I would like to assure the Deputy that our position with regard to human rights in Iran is that we have supported all the resolutions presented at the UN on the situation on human rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs the countries which are supplying arms and support to the protagonists in the armed conflicts in Sudan and Ethiopia, which are causing considerable human suffering; and the steps he intends to take at the United Nations to ensure that the offending nations are condemned for their actions.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret the kind of detailed information sought by Deputy Deasy is not readily available.</P>
      <P>The Government believe that the search for peaceful solutions to these conflicts is best pursued by urging the Governments concerned to take the necessary steps to bring them to an end. With our partners in the Twelve, we have called on a number of occasions on all parties to the conflicts in Sudan and Ethiopia to solve their problems by peaceful means and through negotiated political settlements.  In their most recent statement on 24 October 1988 on the Horn of Africa, the Foreign Ministers of the Twelve again urged the Governments of the countries concerned &ldquo;to take further steps to achieve the peaceful settlement of these conflicts, through a genuine process of national reconciliation&rdquo;.  These views of the Twelve are being conveyed directly to the Governments of Sudan and Ethiopia.</P>
      <P>Also, at the United Nations General Assembly in September 1988, the Greek Presidency, on behalf of the Twelve, appealed to all parties concerned to make serious efforts to achieve peaceful settlements to the conflicts of the region.  I take this opportunity to renew that appeal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised that the information is not available because in a recent radio interview I heard the Chairman of Concern, a clergyman, blaming western countries for providing the protagonists in the Sudanese civil war with a supply of arms.  How is it that the chairman of a voluntary body like Concern can identify who is involved and the Department of Foreign Affairs cannot <Col N="2257" /> do so?  I am putting the question because I want to know if his statement is true.  I suspect that it is not true.  The protagonists in the Ethopian war are not receiving supplies from one side.  The relief being provided comes almost entirely from western societies, of which we are part.  I would like people to name specifically who is to blame, if blame can be attached to any particular country, for the supply of arms.</P>

      <P>The amounts allocated for official development assistance in 1988 and 1989 are £32.76 million and £33.72 million respectively.  The percentage of GNP for both years is 0.18 per cent.</P>
      <P>The United Nations target figure of 0.7 per cent of GNP for official development assistance by developed countries has been accepted by successive Irish Governments but no date has been set for its attainment.</P>
      <P>In present economic circumstances it is not realistic to expect that we could come close to that target at an early date but we continue to accept the target figure in principle and it remains the intention of the Government to work towards it according as our economic circumstances permit us to do so.</P>

      <P>Surely the Minister does not expect the people of the Third World to live on a promise that we may reach the target of 0.7 per cent of our GNP some time in the future?  Will the Minister not agree that it is unacceptable <Col N="2259" /> to our people, who have been so generous on a personal level in supporting disasters of one kind or another and appeals from aid organisations, that we have not progressed from the 0.18 per cent of our gross national product?

Will he accept that the years of progress in regard to ODA have been eaten away by the Government in two years?  Will the Minister accept that the Government have protected certain areas from the cutbacks, such as benefits for the longterm unemployed?

      <P>The achievements and shortcomings in implementation of the agreement will be a matter for detailed discussion between the two Governments in the course of the forthcoming review.</P>
      <P>In the course of the review, the Irish Government will put forward a range of proposals designed to improve the operation of the agreement as a whole, and of a number of its component articles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The statement of 2 November indicates that each Government will take careful account of views expressed to it, both on the past experience of the Conference and on any changes which might be desirable in its scope and nature.  It is the intention to show flexibility and openness <Col N="2266" /> as to the manner in which views are conveyed. In this regard, we would hope that procedural consideration would not stand in the way of the widest possible dialogue. With regard to political parties in the Republic, the precise manner in which their views are conveyed will be a matter for discussion with party leaders.</P>
    <P>As indicated in the joint statement, both Governments anticipate that the review will be completed in the early part of 1989.</P>
    <P>With regard to Deputy Mac Giolla's question, I can confirm that the Government continue to favour the introduction of a Bill of Rights for Northern Ireland. As regards devolution, Article 4 of the Anglo-Irish Agreement speaks of devolution &ldquo;on a basis which would secure widespread acceptance throughout the community.&rdquo; Sub-paragraph (c) of that same article goes on to say that &ldquo;both Governments recognise that devolution can be achieved only with the co-operation of constitutional representatives within Northern Ireland of both traditions there&rdquo;.  On the basis of the stated positions of the parties in Northern Ireland I do not see that the prospects for this are very high at present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not agree that by taking this lengthy period to review the Agreement, which, in my view, is a totally unnecessary length of time, he is only encouraging the extreme parts of both traditions to be more intransigent and more destructive than they have been for the last three years and that the wisest thing that the Government could do is to quickly review the agreement on the basis of the report which they asked the civil servants to draw up in September and which issued last Tuesday?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Miss Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister if the Government have formulated any political initiative to get the Unionists and the other Northern Ireland parties involved in the review of the Agnlo-Irish Agreement outside of Article 11 which provides for a review of the nature and scope of the conference.  Has <Col N="2268" /> any political initiative been taken in this regard by this Government or by the two Governments collectively?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>First, with regard to any specific proposals our Government might have to put forward during the course of the review, I should like to say that our approach will be a comprehensive one involving all the relevant articles of the agreement.  We will deal with all the major areas of concern everywhere, if we are asked to.  In particular we will deal with the major areas of concern to the Nationalist community.  At this stage I do not think it would be proper or productive to engage in public discussion on the detailed work of the review.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister clarify the Government's attitude to devolved government as a policy.  The question specifically asks if devolved government is a policy option which this Government favour.  The Minister did not respond directly to that question. May I also ask him if he is aware, as I am aware, that the statement by the Minister for Foreign Affairs that devolved government was not an option being pursued at this time caused dismay among those in Northern Ireland who see devolved government as the only realistic way forward and that includes the major Unionist parties and the SDLP?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept that at all. I dealt specifically with the question of devolution in the course of my reply and I do not think it is necessary for me, having regard to the time strictures, to repeat it.  We are concentrating our energies in the areas that are most likely to be productive and that is the criterion we will continue to apply.  Obviously, we will keep under review the potential for progress under Article IV.</P>

      <P>We have now encroached on Priority Time proper by <Col N="2269" /> some two minutes.  I will allow Deputy Kennedy to put one further supplementary question and also Deputy Barry, if he chooses to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldineKennedy" hpid="Miss Kennedy Miss Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Miss Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister envisage that there would be a meeting with the other signatory to the Anglo-Irish Agreement, Mrs. Thatcher, as part of the extended review process?  When is it proposed to have discussions with other party leaders here on the review, given that the schedule date is next week, 15 November?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding the second part of Deputy Kennedy's question, I indicated in my reply that discussion between the party leaders would take place.  That is something to be got under way very quickly.  With regard to the first part of the Deputy's question, this is something that will be considered in due course.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a Priority Question and we are in Priority Time.  May I ask the Minister if he shared the optimism expressed by the Taoiseach when he was in Australia in July that talks were possible with the Unionist community in Northern Ireland and if that optimism is a basis for the extended review now?  Will the Minister confirm that the review will take place only on the workings of the agreement and not on the agreement itself?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the second part of Deputy Barry's question is, yes, as also is the answer to the first part of his question.  We would certainly like to see the Unionists being involved in this review and having an input into it.  We should hope so, bearing in mind the comments of Unionist leaders that I have heard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would emphasise what I have said in the reply, that this is a time of serious reflection on important issues.  We hope <Col N="2270" /> that the leadership of the majority community in Northern Ireland will avail of the opportunity to have an input.  We would not want narrow arguments about procedure to stand in the way of that input.  Our approach as to how views are conveyed is an open and flexible one.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will appreciate that the debate is coming up and we cannot discuss this issue because the Taoiseach&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister if there was any basis for the optimism expressed by the Taoiseach when he was in Australia that he was hopeful of getting the Unionists into talks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I would certainly like to be able to say to this House that not alone do I share the view expressed by the Taoiseach at that time but I would hope that every other Member of the House would have the same view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it based on fact or optimism?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Despite the comments we have read and heard by Unionist leaders, bearing in mind that this is a time of serious reflection on important issues and that the review is going ahead, I hope the Unionist Party will have another look at the situation and recognise the facts as they are, that is, that the review is going ahead and it is far better for them to have <Col N="2271" /> an input into it rather than not to have such input.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>

Perhaps I will ask another supplementary question which is this: will the Minister of State convey to the Government the political consensus that was indicated in this House on more than one occasion in favour of removing overseas development aid from general budgetary constraints and general budgetary planning in favour of an adequate level of funding?  Does the Minister accept that in the bilateral aid programme, part of our official development aid assistance, there are 600 jobs directly involved and 1,200 jobs indirectly involved?</P>

I wish to place on record my appreciation of the support I got from the Tánaiste and the Taoiseach when he was acting Minister for Foreign Affairs in relation to the problems in the ODA.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 31, 36 and 49 together.</P>
      <P>This Government has given a very high priority to helping to improve the situation of our newly arrived emigrants in the US, in particular those who are undocumented.  We have focused on two principal areas of action.</P>
      <P>In the first place we have actively supported proposals to amend US legislation to improve the situation for those who are in the US at the present time and also for those who might decide to emigrate legally to the US in the future.  I am happy to report that last month a Bill passed the US Congress, which should soon be signed into law by the President, which will considerably increase the possibilities for our citizens to emigrate legally to the US.  This Bill, the Immigration Amendments Bill, provides for</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2274" />&mdash;an extension of the &ldquo;Donnelly&rdquo; visa scheme under which 15,000 extra visas will be made available in each of the years 1989 and 1990.  These 30,000 additional visas will be allocated to those who applied under the original scheme in January of last year;</P>
    <P>&mdash;a new scheme under which 10,000 extra visas will be made available in each of the years 1990 and 1991 to applicants from countries, including Ireland, which receive a small share of immigrant visas under current legislation.</P>
    <P>We expect that these measures will provide significant new opportunities &mdash; perhaps as high as 25,000 extra visas &mdash; for Irish citizens in the coming two to three years.</P>
    <P>When the new Congress reconvenes in the New Year we will continue to explore further with our friends in Congress the question of long-term structural change to the immigration legislation.  I am sure that the House will join me in paying tribute to the efforts of Senators Ted Kennedy and Alan Simpson, Congressman Brian Donnelly and to our other friends in the US Congress for their important role in the success of this legislation.</P>
    <P>In addition to these legislative reforms the Government have taken steps to alleviate the immediate problems of out-of-status Irish citizens in the US by action in the welfare and advisory areas.  We have set up immigration working committees under the auspices of our Consulates General in New York, Boston and San Francisco, consisting of representatives of the main groups dealing with new Irish arrivals and of the city and church authorities, to co-ordinate activities in the immigration area.  We have appointed an immigration liaison officer to the consulate in New York.  We have extended the advisory services provided by our other consulates.  We have had discussions with city and church authorities in New York, Boston and San Francisco who have introduced and <Col N="2275" /> developed programmes for illegal emigrants in those cities.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that we now have in place a network of services which go a considerable distance towards alleviating the day-to-day problems encountered by our emigrants in the United States.  I can assure the House that the Government will continue to press for reform and to develop measures of real help to our young people overseas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a history of what has happened and it is familiar to most of us in the House.  Of course, we join with the Minister in thanking the Irish American politicians for helping to get the latest legislation through the House, but it does not answer the question.  The Taoiseach in March 1987 and the Tánaiste in September 1987 made specific promises to the undocumented Irish in New York and Boston that they would do everything in their power to help to change their status.  What have they done?  I know all about the consulates that have been set up and all about the Donnelly visas but that does not help to change their status.</P>

      <P>On 26 September, the Government issued a statement which expressed their concern about the decision not to prosecute Guardsman Holden.  The Government, <i>inter alia</i>, pointed to the effect that this decision would have on public confidence in the rule of law in Northern Ireland, coming as it did in the wake of the decision the previous January that certain members of the RUC would not be prosecuted for criminal offences in the public interest.</P>
      <P>The Government immediately instituted inquiries through the Anglo-Irish Secretariat as to the circumstances surrounding this decision.  The British Authorities subsequently indicated that the decision was taken by the Director of Public Prosecutions on the basis that in his judgment there was an insufficiency of evidence to sustain a charge of manslaughter against Guardsman Holden.</P>
      <P>The Government continue to be concerned about the circumstances which surrounded the killing of Mr. McAnespie and considers that public confidence in the administration of justice in Northern Ireland can only be developed if there is the fullest possible airing of the circumstances surrounding such controversial incidents involving the security forces.</P>

      <P>I would refer the Deputy to a reply I gave as Minister for Justice to a parliamentary question on 19 May last.  The Deputy will be aware that the Garda inquiry was conducted on the basis that the wishes of witnesses to have their statements and identity treated as confidential would be respected.  For that reason the report of the inquiry will not be made available to anybody other than the Government.  The question as to whether the main findings of the Garda report will be made public without disclosing the identity of any person who gave evidence, or the contents of any statement received, is a matter which is under consideration.  It is not as easy as one might imagine to convey the substance of sensitive information of the type involved in this case while at the same time fully protecting the identity of its authors.</P>

      <P>Before proceeding with a reply I wish to say that I take the reference to changes in the administration of justice in Deputy Spring's question to refer to the Draft Criminal Evidence (Northern Ireland) order which has been laid before the British Parliament.</P>
      <P>The Government are concerned about the implications of this draft order, some of the provisions of which appear to have far-reaching consequences for the administration of justice in Northern Ireland. The measures in the proposed order relate to inferences which can be drawn from a person's silence in certain circumstances. These circumstances are: where a person fails to account for certain matters, for example a stain on his clothing; where a person fails to account for his presence at a particular place; where a person raises in his defence in court a matter which he did not mention when being questioned by the police or before being charged and in the circumstances existing at the time that person could reasonably have been expected to have mentioned the matter; and where a person without good cause refuses to answer any question after having been called by the court to give evidence.  The Government's views on the matter have been made known to the British Government.</P>
      <P>As regards the broadcasting measures recently adopted by the British Government, the Deputy will be aware of a similar provision in this jurisdiction.  The Government do not propose to comment at the present time.  They will wish to see how the British measures are operated in practice before taking a view on the matter.</P>
      <P>The Government were advised of these measures in advancement of their announcement.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I was speaking earlier on the five amendments put forward by representatives of all four Opposition parties. I was saying that the acceptance of any of these amendments, not distinguishing between them, would remove in greater or lesser degree the objection I see to the form of section 2 as it stands. I will briefly trace the history of the legislative technique which we have been seeing in this House in the small number of years since the second last election. We have in front of us a Bill which proposes to place at the disposal of the Taoiseach not an amazing sum of money measured by the scale of the national budget but nevertheless a substantial enough sum.  I absolutely accept without question that the ministerial statement this morning indicating a destination for this money is sincere and genuine and that that is exactly where the money will go, but I have to protest, as other speakers have done, about the failure to put that in simple form in the Bill itself.  That seems to offend against both the letter and the spirit of Articles 11 and 17 of the Constitution.  I want to contrast that technique that has been seen here in recent years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Infamous though the results of the National Lottery Act seem to have turned out to be, at least that Act made some pathetic, rudimentary gesture towards indicating some general purposes for which the money would ultimately be applied.  The technique is <Col N="2336" /> that there is a lottery fund under the control of the Minister.  The lottery fund, at the end of a particular period when the payments have been established, can be paid into the central fund.  Section 5 of the National Lottery Act, 1986, states:</P>
    <P>Moneys paid into the Central Fund pursuant to section 8 of this Act shall be applied for&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  the purposes of such one or more of the following, and in such amounts, as the Government may determine from time to time, that is to say, sport and other recreation, national culture (including the Irish language), the arts (within the meaning of the Arts Act, 1951) and the health of the community, and</P>
    <P>(b)  such (if any) other purposes, and in such amounts, as the Government may determine from time to time.</P>
    <P>Of course, subsection (b) destroys the whole principle but at least lip service of some kind is being paid to the principle that the Dáil and Seanad should specify what this money, raised on their authority, is to be devoted to.</P>
    <P>That does not remove the objection I voiced this morning to the creation of two tiers of revenue and two tiers of destination.  It is scandalous that overseas development aid should have to lean on the national lottery.  I am sorry to say that this puts it to some extent in the same category as a lawn tennis club or a golf club.  It is depending on the same secondary source of funding.  It implicitly devalues it to the status of something which the State will find a few pence for if it can.  It puts it in the realm of State funding which is inferentially of the second rank compared with paying our salaries, for example.  No one suggested that our salaries should depend on the national lottery's product.  Nevertheless, with all those objections which can be made to it, the National Lottery Act as recently as two years ago still pointed out in some kind of way the sort of area to which the funds were to be devoted &mdash;<Col N="2337" /> sport, national culture and the health of the community.</P>
    <P>If we go back only another two years to 1984 we come to another windfall Act which should have been incorporated for collective citation purposes today.  I refer to the Funds of Suitors Act, 1984.  It is barely four years since it was enacted. The House knows what funds of suitors are.  Basically, large lumps of money accumulate in the High Court, paid in connection with this or that case, and they are never ultimately paid out.  Payments never keep up with the volume of money coming in.  When the first such distribution of surplus funds was made about 20 years ago, naturally accompanied by a State guarantee that if ever the funds should prove inadequate to meet claims upon them, they would be supplemented by the Exchequer, it was made from a fund which had been accumulating since the 1780s.  The first payment into the fund which was recognisable had been made in the reign of George III.  That little source of revenue having once been tapped, it quickly built up and has been tapped again.  As recently as 1984 we authorised the removal of money from the funds of suitors in the High Court and we directed in the most specific way what was to happen to those funds.  I will not quote the whole of section 3(2) of the Funds of Suitors Act, 1984, but I will summarise the heads.  It reads:</P>
    <P>(2)  The sums paid to the Exchequer pursuant to subsection (1) of this section may be applied by the Minister as follows:</P>
    <P>(a)  not more than £600,000 may be applied for such purpose or purposes in relation to culture and the arts...</P>
    <P>(b)  not more than £600,000 may be applied in or towards the defrayal of the cost of carrying out the works specified in section 4 of this Act,</P>
    <P>which largely consisted in renovating the Kings Inns buildings, Library and gardens,</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2338" /> (c)  not more than £300,000 may... be applied in or towards the defrayal of the cost of the extension ... of the premises of Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann at Monkstown ...</P>
    <P>carrying the curious name Cultúrlann na hÉireann and inviting the reflection that any culture which can think up a word like &ldquo;cultúrlann&rdquo; needs its credentials closely inspected,</P>
    <P>(d)  not more than £100,000 may, on the application of the Minister for Labour be applied in or towards the defrayal of the cost of the Community, Youth, Recreational and Employment Programme administered by the Minister for Labour,</P>
    <P>and paragraph (e) set the balance that was to be applied for the maintenance in proper order of court premises &mdash; the Dublin Metropolitan District Court and the Children's Court.</P>
    <P>We saw fit, admittedly under a very different kind of Government, wobblying and ineffective though it may have been in several respects, to maintain a certain standard in this kind of context.</P>

      <P>The Government of the day did not think it beneath them to ask the Dáil to approve every one of these heads &mdash; whether this or that Deputy would agree with them is a separate matter. They were specifically authorised here. The next step downhill was the National Lottery Act where only a token attempt was made to define the beneficiaries from this fund, the size of which was not even imagined at the time.  The third stage of this declension is the stage which is represented here by the Caligula factor, this is, typing up a purse and handing it to the Taoiseach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I unreservedly accept that the object he has in mind and which the Minister mentioned this morning is a good object and I do not quarrel with it but we have to insist on the principle being upheld <Col N="2339" /> that the Dáil builds into the legislation authority for the disposal of windfall money.</P>

      <P>In the course of my contribution this morning &mdash; and I am glad Deputy FitzGerald who was Taoiseach at the time of the agreement in 1986, confirmed the point I made &mdash; I clearly indicated that during the discussions with the British Government which led up to the agreement on the repayment of the surplus funds, there was an understanding that the Irish Government would endeavour to use their share for North-South or Anglo-Irish co-operation or for projects with an all-Ireland dimension.</P>
      <P>One project which has a clear all-Ireland dimension is the decision of the Government in regard to the Royal National Lifeboat Institution to purchase a new lifeboat for the western coastline, from Galway to Donegal, and to improve the facilities generally of their search and rescue facilities along the west and northwest coasts.  That clearly meets the terms of the agreement entered into between the then Government and the British Government in 1986, and to which we are giving legislative force today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have before me a number of amendments. One is from Deputy Mac Giolla who specifies 30 per cent for the Royal National Lifeboat Institution &mdash; the Government have already decided they will get more than 30 per cent &mdash; and 30 per cent for the provision or improvement of living accommodation for serving <Col N="2340" /> and former members of the Defence Forces.  I am grateful to the former Taoiseach for his clarification that that could not be encompassed within the terms of the agreement.  The provision of hostel accommodation and services for ex-servicemen comes under the point raised by Deputy Quinn in his amendment and, under Deputy O'Malley's amendment, &ldquo;the remaining 50 per cent of such moneys shall be paid to such ex-servicement's organisations as Dáil Éireann shall approve, by motion&rdquo;.  All those amendments are clearly outside the terms of the agreement between the Irish and British Governments.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies have raised the question of defining where this money will be spent.  I stated very clearly exactly what would happen.  I said it would be spent on North-South or Anglo-Irish co-operation or for projects with an all-Ireland dimension.  Deputy FitzGerald with Deputy Connaughton put down an amendment clarifying that and asking that the thrust of that principle be included in section 2.  During the sos I had an opportunity to look at this and I will be proposing the following wording because I will not be able to accept the wording proposed by Deputy FitzGerald. I will have this amendment circulated.  it will read:</P>
    <P>In page 2, lines 20 to 22, to delete &ldquo;in such manner as the Taoiseach, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, directs&rdquo; and substitute the following: &ldquo;for the purposes of such projects or undertakings including the Royal National Lifeboat Institution, involving co-operation between the State and Northern Ireland or the State and Great Britain, or relating to the island of Ireland as a whole, as the Taoiseach may, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, determine&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>That amendment will clarify section 2, but I want to make it clear that even without that amendment that is what has been agreed between the Irish and British Governments, and that is what would be happening anyway.  To remove any fear Members may have about this, and <Col N="2341" /> despite the fact that Deputy FitzGerald clarified that that was the basis of his agreement, that is how the money will be spent.  Therefore, I will be proposing this amendment.  I cannot accept Deputy FitzGerald's other amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps he would, but the average judge would not allow it. He would tell him straightaway it is not lawful for this House to pass a Bill saying certain portions of Exchequer funding shall be put into the hands of any Minister of State, or any combination of Ministers of State, to do with it what they will.  That infringes Article 11 of the Constitution and is something this House is not competent to do.  It would not take three minutes for a High Court Judge to arrive at that conclusion.  If the Attorney General went into court trying to defend such a text, he would not be given much longer than three minutes to make his case.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>He might do something like that and if the House brought in a law of this kind we would be doing violence to the wording and intent of the Constitution, there is no doubt about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Fund of Suitors Act, to which Deputy Kelly referred, said exactly what could be done with the money set aside by this House.  The important point is that <Col N="2342" /> there is accountability.  The Comptroller and Auditor General can look at what was done in the Kings Inns or in the Cultúrlann to see whether the money was spent on stocking the bar or some other project.  He can see if there was a misappropriation of funds and that is the essence of parliamentary democracy and control of disbursal.  The decline in standards in the House, to which Deputy Kelly also referred, is a disgrace.  It is happening more and more that Ministers are given funds on which they may make discretionary decisions.  I am not against discretion where it is needed but it must always be accompanied by accountability and when this House gets a fund of even a small kind relative to national figures, it must, to do justice to the people who originally brought these funds into being, apply them responsibly.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this all-Ireland expenditure was entered into bona fide and the looseness of the agreement entered into by Deputy FitzGerald with the British Government was one in which both sides acted in good faith and accepting each other's bona fides in the matter. However, that does not mean that our law can be equally vague.  When we sit down in the House to implement the substance of the agreement which Deputy FitzGerald arrived at, we should make sure that the money in question is applied exactly in accordance with the agreement.  We should specify each and every purpose for which this money should be spent.  Sometimes the Minister seems to think that Members of the House are feather-headed.  Of course there was an agreement of the kind specified by Deputy FitzGerald but the problem is that it is not good enough to embody in our law.  The House has a duty to say how all funds which form part of the Exchequer will be disbursed.  That could be an academic exercise except for the fact that this is part of a slightly squalid attempt to turn the charity of a bygone day into the patronage of today&mdash;&mdash;</P>

It is curious that a man of his political views should turn himself into a patron of culture on an all-Ireland basis using a fund which was established by the British Crown in the past to look after those who served with the British Forces and the forces of a United Kingdom of Britain and Ireland when the two countries were united.</P>
      <P>The Minister outlined the drift of departmental thinking as to how these moneys should be applied.  He said that there was a project contemplated that an anthology of Irish-Anglo literature being prepared in the city of Derry should get money from this fund.  I do not know if it is a good anthology but I know one thing &mdash; there will be a photograph of the Taoiseach in the papers opening a book, looking interested in the fly page and pretending that he has in some sense, at his own patronage and discretion, arranged for this great work of culture to be put in place.  I do not want to stray into the realm of the national lottery but the same wrong principle also applies there.  What is legally paid into the Exchequer and what should be legally controlled being paid out of the Exchequer is instead turned into a discretionary disbursement which is dressed up as patronage.  That is what is wrong with this proposal.  In essence, the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance &mdash; which effectively means the Taoiseach, especially in this Government &mdash; will determine projects relating to the island of Ireland as a whole.  What could that possibly mean?  Is a video of &ldquo;My Ireland&rdquo; a project which relates to the entirety of Ireland?  How many more anthologies from Mercier Press of speeches relating to a United Ireland could come under that?  It is so loose as to be virtually meaningless.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that but <Col N="2344" /> we would be far better advised to say that if projects of this kind are to be funded &mdash; Deputy O'Malley's amendment had the great virtue of ensuring that the House had to be informed and give consent of the kind of project which was to be funded &mdash; we should not have the nonsense of apparent patronage being conducted out of a fund which is, in reality, nothing to do with patronage but with a surplus accumulating out of a fund originally established for charitable purposes.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Cooney, it is a charity to provide accommodation for former soldiers because anybody who has any experience of the Army &mdash; my experience is very limited &mdash; knows just how pathetic the lot is of a non-commissioned soldier who is living in the Army as an institution and coming to the end of his days as a soldier.  He has nowhere or no life to go to and no accommodation to look forward to except perhaps joining the bottom of the queue as a single person in his fifties or sixties looking for accommodation from a housing authority.  It is a pathetic state of affairs and it was, certainly in the case of the large standing armies that existed when this fund was established, a charity to provide them with funds for the purpose of housing.</P>
      <P>Now, those funds put aside and provided by the Government at the time are to be converted into a discretionary fund to aid all-Ireland projects at the whim of the Taoiseach.  I do not know whether it makes sense to apply them to an all-Ireland Anglo-Irish literary anthology to be published in Derry.  I presume there are a lot more deserving projects on an all-Ireland basis.  It is wrong that this country, which is, after all a Republic, reduces the way in which it disburses funds to a kind of Saudi-Arabian process where people turn up and sit on rugs looking for munificence from their political superiors.  That is really what all this is about, people from Derry are being invited to make submissions for funding from a fund which will be disbursed on a discretionary basis and with all the appearances of patronage by the Taoiseach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2345" /> Deputy O'Malley's amendment is the most acceptable, that it is clearly seen that every single halfpenny applied to every single project comes, not as a matter of discretionary patronage, but as a matter of a resolution of this House and with the authority of law.  The message is clear in relation to the national lottery and so on and it has been understood in relation to projects such as the restoration of Kings Inns and various other buildings from the Funds of Suitors Act. This kind of discretionary, arbitrary funding of cultural projects gives the average citizen the impression that politics are becoming arbitrary again and that the Executive are some kind of sovereign body who can choose this and that project, this or that poet, this or that author or this or that sculptor, for a particular amount of bounty and that this is done as a matter of convenience.  This House is then given an obfuscation of an explanation as to why that is being done.  It is not necessary that the Taoiseach makes the decision without any reference to this House.  It is not necessary that funds which were established for a charitable purpose should in the last analysis be diverted to another purpose to be handed out in such circumstances as to give the very strong impression that it is done on an arbitrary basis at the whim of the Taoiseach and given to whatever project he feels particularly moved by at any particular time.  It is shabby politics and it is shabby standards.  It is shabby behaviour of a Government to say they will establish a £2.5 million fund &mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>As I have said earlier, I listened very carefully to the debate this <Col N="2349" /> morning.  Deputy McDowell was not able to be with us for most of the discussion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>He was here for some of it.  I have attempted to incorporate the amendment in the Bill, as was specified in my speech and was the subject of the debate we had here this morning. Members were anxious that there would be a clarification or an inclusion in the Bill of the areas of understanding between ourselves and the British Government and that has been done.  I have gone further than that and specified the Royal National Lifeboat Institution because again that was the one area where a clear decision has already been made.</P>
      <P>Deputy McDowell in his speech threw around words like &ldquo;squalid&rdquo; and &ldquo;shabby&rdquo;.  It is a general throwing up of muck and some of it will stick.  The reality is that there will be total accountability in the disbursement of this fund because it will come under a subhead in the Taoiseach's Department and as such there will be total accountability in this House as to where the funds are spent.  Deputy McDowell said there is a possibility that on some future occasion the Taoiseach or some other Minister might be seen being photographed and by being so he insinuated that he would be in some way responsible for disbursement.  I seem to remember pictures during the last general election of the Deputy's party leader sitting on a tractor on the Lucan by-pass wearing a Clonmel construction hat, as if the Lucan by-pass was subject to the good works of Deputy O'Malley and the Progressive Democrats.  It is all right when they do that but not when anybody else does it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is total accountability in this regard.  The amendment which I put down in the Taoiseach's name is an addition to section 2 of the Bill for the purpose of such projects or undertakings, including the Royal National Lifeboat Institution involving &mdash; this is the phraseology that was used in the agreement between the British Government and the <Col N="2350" /> Irish Government in 1986 &mdash; co-operation between the State and Northern Ireland or the State and Great Britain or relating to the island of Ireland as a whole as the Taoiseach may, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, determine. The thrust of the issue is that £2.5 million will be spent on the RNLI and also on projects of co-operation between the State and Northern Ireland, the State and Great Britain or relating to the island of Ireland as a whole.  That was the thrust of the agreement between the two Governments of 1986.</P>
    <P>I listed this morning in response to the Second Stage debate, in trying to be helpful, a number of the groups that have so far, without invitation, indicated that they are applying for or are interested in securing some assistance from the fund. No decisions have been made on those groups and there is no suggestion of them getting assistance.  I was trying to be helpful to the House and was merely telling Deputies the types of groups that have so far applied for it.  I have no doubt that when the legislation is passed there will be quite a considerable interest in the relatively small sum of money &mdash; I emphasise it is about £2.5 million and it will not get any bigger.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T. Fitzpatrick Mr. T. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very short Bill comprising five short sections but in my opinion there is a very important principle at stake in section 2 regarding the expenditure and disbursement of State money and the accountability for such expenditure to this House.  When I received this Bill in my post three or four weeks ago, I glanced through it and immediately thought that the provision of section 2 enabling the Minister for Finance to accept gifts on behalf of the State and the provision in the same section enabling the State to disburse the gift in such manner as the Taoiseach might direct with the consent of the Minister for Finance is very unusual.  I stopped and read it again and considered it because to me it appeared to be something I had not come across in legislation previously either in my practice as a solicitor or in my nearly 30 years in this <Col N="2351" /> House.  I thought perhaps I just had not noticed it and for that reason I made inquiries and was told I was quite correct, that this appeared to be a complete and absolute departure from established procedure. I was told further that it probably was not even constitutional.  I admit that when I read it the lottery came to my mind immediately because it was the current topic at the time and the disbursement of a vast sum of £70 million or so seemed to be creating great disquiet and uneasiness in the minds of many citizens. Therefore, I decided I would pursue the matter further and that I would speak on the Bill when it came into the House.</P>
      <P>I heard the Minister in the House really contemptuously brushing aside the objection because only £2.5 million is involved. I would like to see what sort of reception the Minister would get in practically every constituency if he were to brush aside £2.5 million as being insignificant at a time when so many people are deprived of the absolute necessities of life and of essential services of one sort or another.  I will not trot them all out here now, but I note that the Minister proposes to put down an amendment.  I will not go into the merits or demerits of the purpose for which the Minister tells us the Taoiseach intended to expend the money because I am only dealing here with the principle involved.  There may be only this paltry sum of £2.5 million in the Minister's mind today but it may be £100 million next year.  It is an undesirable, bad principle following on the principle of the lottery.  I sincerely hope it is not a case of cattle getting a taste of fresh grass and pursuing the matter having seen the plentiful supply or acquiring an appetite for more and more of the same sort of conduct as the abuse of the lottery funds.  For my purposes I would be satisfied if something was written into the Bill directing what this money was to be spent on.  Indeed, we could have a debate as to whether it was a worthy object or whether there could be a more worthy object, but at least it would get over the difficulty of accountability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2352" /> I have looked at the Minister's amendment. I know it will not come up until Report Stage, but the Minister has used it in argument on this Committee Stage, therefore it is not out of order for me to refer to it also.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Jim Tunney">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I am just going to make one shortish reference to it.  The Minister proposes to substitute for one of the other amendments the following: &ldquo;for the purposes of such projects or undertakings including the Royal National Lifeboat Institution, involving co-operation between the State and Northern Ireland or the State and Great Britain...&rdquo; That is quite understandable and sets some criteria for what the moneys should be spent on, but in my opinion the next few words negative the whole thing and destroy the other part.  I quote: &ldquo;or relating to the island of Ireland as a whole as the Taoiseach may, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, determine&rdquo;.  What in the name of all that is right and holy does that mean?  He can spend it on anything that has to do with the island of Ireland or any part of it or on any activity going on therein.  It is not intelligible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T. Fitzpatrick Mr. T. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>That could be another way of looking at it.  It negatives the other part of the amendment which talks about co-operation between the State and Northern Ireland and the State and Great Britain.  That is all I want to say about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very glad that this point has been taken up in the House and I hope it will be taken as a serious point, a very serious point of procedure and accountability.  It cannot be unrelated to the lottery or to <Col N="2353" /> the expenditure of other sums.  I remember quite well the funds of suitors legislation and I have certain reservations about the use of that money, but I suppose it could be said it is better to spend it on something useful that leave it lying there to rot where it could be of no use to anybody or anything, so long as there is a guarantee that if the suitors ever come up the State will pay.  That Bill went to the trouble of including very precise directions as to what would be done with the money and there was a debate in this House about it.  There should be an amendment to this section directing what should be done with the money.  In my opinion the Minister's amendment is absolutely useless.  Perhaps I will say more about that on Report Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>I am still very unhappy about section 2 of this Bill.  The Minister has now told us that a number of organisations, without invitation as he said, have expressed an interest in these funds and have applied for funding from them.  That is very interesting because I would like to know how these organisations found out there were funds that it would be appropriate for them to apply for.  Even if they happened to locate this Bill in the last few weeks there is nothing in it to indicate to somebody in Derry or wherever that funds would be available for them by reason of this Bill or that theirs would be a suitable project.  There is nothing of that in any section.  How do these people know that there is money there, that they should start applying and that the Taoiseach is ready to hand it out?</P>

      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>That is precisely so. The point I would like to make is that I contacted the Organisation of National Ex-Servicemen during the lunch break and they were not aware that such a Bill existed, that such funds existed; they knew nothing whatever about it, and they would be very interested in applying and probably will be applying now.  I am worried also about the former Taoiseach's <Col N="2354" /> statement and the Minister's statement which seem to make the situation worse in regard to ex-servicemen of the Army here and the possibility of their getting any funds from it.  From statements that have been made now it seems that they are about the only ones who are excluded from any possibility of getting any funds as a result of this Bill.  Almost everybody else can find some reason, some sort of Anglo-Irish co-operation, to apply.  The GAA could apply for this and probably will, too, and get it for that matter.  Ex-servicemen of the Irish Army are the only ones who have been specifically excluded.  That is absolutely outrageous.</P>
      <P>In the Bill itself, in the Minister's speech, in the discussions which led to the agreement and the amendments put down by Deputy FitzGerald which the Minister proposes to accept on Report Stage, I see nothing to exclude ex-servicemen of the Irish Army.  I see nothing that indicates that the Irish Army are not involved in co-operation between the State and Northern Ireland.  They are very much so involved and between the State and Great Britain.  They go over to train in Great Britain and to buy arms from Great Britain.  There is complete co-operation.  In relation to the island of Ireland as a whole, I see nothing to exclude ex-servicemen of the Irish Army from benefiting from the funds in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that in regard to the British side and their 60 per cent, they have allocated 40 per cent of it for charities relating to ex-servicemen North and South.  The other 60 per cent is for whatever they like.  It goes into the Exchequer and could be used for an attack on Dublin if they so wished.  There is nothing in the agreement which excludes them from using the balance of that money for any purpose they wish.  I would like the Minister to clarify this and to indicate that ex-servicemen of the Irish Army are not excluded by anything in any agreement from benefiting under this Bill.  As Deputy Fitzpatrick pointed out, the amount of money is by no means insubstantial and the Organisation of National Ex-Servicemen would not be looking for <Col N="2355" /> a million.  They would be very happy with anything they could get out of it.  All they are looking for immediately is a hostel for ten or a dozen people.  I do not know how much that would cost but I imagine £100,000 would make them happy.  The suggestion that something or other excludes them from benefiting really worries me.  I would like the Minister and Deputy FitzGerald, the former Taoiseach, to clarify that, that if it is provided in section 2 that it applies to those involved in co-operation between the State and Northern Ireland and the State and Great Britain that that will include the Army as well as a whole lot of other organisations.</P>

      <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick commented on my own amendment.  I know the Chair is anxious that we discuss this on Report Stage but the Deputy finds some fault with the wording.  I would draw his attention to the amendment in the name of Deputy FitzGerald.  Deputy FitzGerald was Taoiseach in 1986 when the agreement was reached.  It referred to those issues that are included in Deputy FitzGerald's amendment and in my own amendment.  Deputy Fitzpatrick seemed to think that the wording &ldquo;co-operation between the State and Northern Ireland and between the State and Great Britain or relating to the island of Ireland as a whole&rdquo; was meaningless.  If this were not in, it would not, for example, be legal to help bodies such as the RNLI which is organised on a 32 county basis.  The lifeboat is for use throughout the island, not just the North.  It will be in the west and north west area but it will also obviously go around the north coast.</P>
      <P>In regard to the money going into the Exchequer, we are specifying here that the money will be spent for the purposes of the projects as outlined and putting into the Bill what was the agreement between the two countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to Deputy Mac Giolla's point as to how anybody knew about these funds, I would remind him that the British brought legislation through before their general election in 1987.  In about <Col N="2356" /> April, 1987 it was debated, and it was referred to here this morning by another Deputy in relation to the debate in the House of Lords, so it is common knowledge that this funding was available.</P>

      <P>In addition, the Taoiseach publicly announced that the RNLI were to be assisted.  To save Deputy McDowell coming back in on this later, there was probably a photograph of the Taoiseach making the announcement in relation to the RNLI.  He is the Taoiseach of the land and the media like to be present on a public occasion when the Taoiseach is there.  It is well known that this fund is available.</P>

      <P>It is implicit in my amendment. In fact it is explicit in my amendment because there are the four points in relation to it.

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. D. O'Malley Mr. D. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>There is an enormous difference between Deputy FitzGerald's amendment and the Minister's proposed amendment that he has now circulated for the Report Stage.  The Minister seeks to give the impression that because some of the wording is the same the effect is much the same but it is not. Deputy FitzGerald was trying to limit the expenditure to certain areas and to specify that it could not go beyond certain <Col N="2357" /> areas.  What is most striking about the amendment being put forward for Report Stage is the following wording:</P>
      <P>...for the purposes of such projects or undertakings... as the Taoiseach may, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, determine.</P>
      <P>That type of phraseology is not normal in legislation.  To have that amendment is better than to have the section in the bald fashion in which it appears in the Bill but it is still far from satisfactory and will not improve the position to any great extent.</P>
      <P>Before lunch Deputy Kelly dealt with the effect of Article 11 and I had hoped he would develop that.  In a later contribution he went on to different aspects of the Constitution.  Article 11 states:</P>
      <P>All revenues of the State from whatever source arising shall, subject to such exception as may be provided by law, form one fund, and shall be appropriated for the purposes ... determined and imposed by law.</P>
      <P>In other words, the Constitution compels the House not to appropriate money, to use the wording in the Constitution, for a purpose unless it is determined and imposed by law.  If this section is not amended along the lines of the amendment put forward by Deputies Quinn, Mac Giolla and myself we will be appropriating the money but saying that the appropriation shall not be in accordance with specific purposes; the law shall be that the appropriation shall be as the Taoiseach may determine.  The Constitution did not envisage that.  The Constitution envisaged something specific being said.  It may not have laid out every brick on which it was to be spent but it envisaged that the overall purpose for which it was being expended had to be determined and imposed by law.  It did not envisage that handing the money over to the Taoiseach for disbursement by him was determining it by law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One could argue that creating the law in that fashion is making law at least but it certainly could hardly be described as <Col N="2358" /> being within the spirit of the Constitution. In my view it would be open to challenge.  I had hoped that we might hear more on this from Deputy Kelly because his book does not deal with that point, presumably because no case has arisen.  No case had arisen up to 1984 and I did not see a case on this point in the supplement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>We may well have a case following this.  However, we do not need a case because in my view the article is quite clear.  I note that Deputy Kelly has circulated an amendment which seeks to add the words, &ldquo;as the Dáil may approve&rdquo;.  In substance that is on all fours with what I have been suggesting and meets the point.  If that is added it will suffice because it then becomes determined and imposed by law.  There is an exact parallel, and one cannot get away from it, in the lottery syndrome.  It has become popular, unfortunately, and people seem to be unwilling to tear themselves away from that.</P>
      <P>I have quoted Article 11 which states that all revenues shall be appropriated for the purposes ...determined by law. I should like to draw the attention of the House to the purpose as set out in the Supplementary Estimate before us.  The purpose of that Supplementary Estimate is to determine by law what these moneys shall be spent on.  What does this determine? It determines that they shall be spent on the Irish Sailors and Soldiers Land Trust.  However, the Irish Sailors and Soldiers Land Trust is where the money came from.  This must be the first Estimate in history in this or any other country where the donor of the money is, in fact, specified as the payee.  Clearly, it could not be the payee, the Irish Sailors and Soldiers Land Trust, because the legislation, among other things, sets up a procedure to dissolve that trust.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have been told that certain purposes relating to the Royal National Lifeboat Institution and other cross-Border or Anglo-Irish purposes are in mind but they should be specified and not the place <Col N="2359" /> where the money is coming from.  If an Estimate does not specify where the money is to be expended it seems to me to be in breach of Article 11.  If it is in breach of Article 11 I do not see how any disbursement can be made under it because it is open to challenge.</P>
    <P>It appears that some people did not know about this.  That does not surprise me because they are not regular readers of Hansard or other journals which would contain this information.  Those people will know about this as a result of this debate and I am sure many of them will be applicants.  One of the most obvious ones, as I indicated in the course of my Second Stage speach this morning, are the different ex-servicemens' associations. I have included them in my amendment.  I suggested in it that roughly half of the money should go to the lifeboat institution and roughly half to ex-servicemen. Obviously, they will apply and it may be, if they are so advised, that they may try to set this aside.  It seems to me to be a very defective Supplementary Estimate and it is clearly open to serious question.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. G. FitzGerald Dr. G. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. G. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Supplementary Estimate is clearly absurd and I presume the Minister will modify the wording.  He can hardly expect the House to approve a Supplementary Estimate which is clearly nonsense.  I wonder why it takes that form.  I am wondering what the reason is for disguising it in this wording which, obviously, has no real meaning.  I suppose that the problem may have been that originally the money was to have been disbursed as part of a subhead of the Vote for Foreign Affairs for Anglo-Irish and North-South co-operation, but when it was moved back to the Taoiseach's Department for reasons for which we can only speculate, they could not very well duplicate it and have two such headings, so by using this curious and inappropriate wording they sought to disguise what was happening.  Basically, the Minister's acceptance of the thrust of my amendment is something I welcome.  In the haste in which I prepared it, I did not <Col N="2360" /> adequately cover the point that Deputies O'Malley and Kelly have made and Deputy Kelly's amendment to my amendment meets that point.  If we add the words &ldquo;and as the Dáil may approve&rdquo;, I think we will have covered the constitutional point.  If we do not, we may not possibly have covered that point. I am sure the Minister will want to consider that amendment on Report Stage. It would overcome the difficulty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the wording relating to the island of Ireland as a whole I take Deputy Tom Fitzpatrick's point, but I do not think that it is well based.  Originally, when we were discussing this matter with Lord Killanin we were trying to see the purposes the money could be put to, which would be likely to assist him in getting the money from the British Treasury.  I have explained why the agitation by certain people about the whole question of commemorating the dead of two World Wars prejudiced the question of it being for ex-servicemen.  They achieved by their agitation in this respect the opposite presumably of what they had intended.  They made it politically impracticable, in my judgment to apply the money for the purpose which first came to mind.  I am sorry that was the case, but I did not think we could get involved with the kind of debate we would have had if we had applied it to ex-servicemen generally.  We would have had people coming in and asking whether this meant that the UDR and the British Army in Northern Ireland would benefit? To drag the issue to that level, which people were trying to drag the commemoration down to, was something I did not want to contemplate.  In my judgment the British Government would not easily have accepted the exclusion of British ex-servicemen and the money being applied only to Irish ex-servicemen. For that reason the ex-servicemen element was dropped.  I accept that it may have been a wrong judgment on my part, I am fallible and perhaps I was wrong but that is why it happened. That having happened, I was concerned that the money be applied to purposes <Col N="2361" /> appropriate to a fund relating to the people of the whole island of Ireland. Projects like the Royal National Lifeboat Institution and the Royal Irish Academy and institutions of that kind which are all-Ireland institutions and have survived 65 years of the division of the island were chosen.  I would have thought, but I am open to correction, that the wording I chose for my amendment and which I took straight from the Minister's speech, wording that the Minister now has in his amendment, &ldquo;projects relating to the island of Ireland as a whole&rdquo; limits it in that way.  Money provided to any institution or object which is confined to this State would not be covered by this and the money could not be provided.  The amendment limits the fund to a relatively small number of institutions or objects which relate to the island as a whole. That is what I intended to do, but if my wording is defective, and Deputy Fitzpatrick proposes better wording that is fair enough.</P>
    <P>What is now required is, first, the addition of Deputy Kelly's amendment to make the legislation constitutional and, second, some rewording of the Supplementary Estimate to make it make sense which it does not at present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought the Deputy was going to withdraw the amendment. Deputy O'Malley made the point that it was necessary to specify the constitutional purpose for which the money was to be expended.  This Bill was drafted in the normal way by parliamentary draftsmen, the various heads of the Bill went through them and through the Attorney General and the Bill was printed.  I have now published an amendment to it to try to take account of the spirit of the debate we had earlier and to include in the Bill the purposes for which <Col N="2362" /> the fund could be expended.  I have made provision for that in the Bill which has been drafted and checked and which seems to be accurate.  It specifies the purposes of such projects or undertakings, including the Royal National Lifeboat Institution, involving co-operation between the State and Northern Ireland or the State and Great Britain or relating to the island of Ireland as a whole.  That clearly sets out the purposes for the expenditure.  However, I am no constitutional lawyer and if Deputy O'Malley or some of his legal friends wish to bring it to the Supreme Court I am sure they will get a decision on it.  I would not claim to be a constitutional lawyer but I can say the Bill was drafted in the normal manner and consequently will be found to be constitutional.  In so far as the wording of Deputy Kelly's amendment is concerned, &ldquo;as the Dáil may approve&rdquo;, the Dáil will approve a subhead of the Taoiseach's Vote.  The Dáil will have a full opportunity in the debate on the Estimates to discuss the disbursement of funds&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Will Deputy FitzGerald give us further clarification?  In view of the fact that he was Taoiseach at the time of the negotiations of this <Col N="2363" /> agreement, and he has confused me somewhat, does Deputy FitzGerald think that the British Government allocation of 40 per cent of their funds for the support of ex-servicemen's charities North and South is against the principle of the agreement or is in accordance with the principle of the agreement?</P>
      <P>Deputy FitzGerald made some comment about the UDR but the UDR is part of the British Army and naturally it would come under the heading, ex-servicemen's charities North and South, and would be catered for under the British legislation.  I would like the Deputy to clarify why we were forced to exclude ex-servicemen here from the agreement when the British Government have specifically given money for the support of such charities?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. G. FitzGerald Dr. G. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. G. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already clarified that matter twice and I am not sure I can clarify it any more.  The problem was to enable Lord Killanin to argue a case with the trustees in the British Treasury to get some of the money for us. To enable that to be done a proposition had to be put as to what we would use the money for to enable him to succeed in securing that money.  If a proposition was put that it would be used for Irish ex-servicemen only, a proposition that the British Parliament would have difficulty in accepting in relation to a fund which was designed for British ex-servicemen, but if you added, in relation to our disbursements of the moneys, all ex-servicemen, we would have been likely to have had the kind of row we had from the people who objected to the commemoration. It seemed better to avoid that kind of conflict.  Perhaps I was wrong.  The Deputy may well think I am wrong but he is entitled to think that.  I have explained three times the reasons for being in the position we are in now. We have to proceed from there.  I might add that we still have my amendment in relation to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, which is in line with the wording of Deputy Quinn's amendment and also <Col N="2364" /> of Deputy Kelly's amendment, to deal with.</P>

      <P>In his last intervention the Minister emphasised on a couple of occasions that the Bill was drafted in the normal manner.  That is just the trouble, the Bill was not drafted in the normal way and the abnormality sticks out like a sore thumb.  That is what has us here.  The section of the Bill which is abnormal is directing that the moneys shall be expended as the Taoiseach shall direct.  That is not normal procedure, that is the abnormality which any law student reading the Bill would stop and look at and look at again.  Any parliamentary draftsman would see that it is not normal.</P>
      <P>I would still say that the safeguard that has been put in is so vague as to give the Taoiseach unlimited discretion in one way while in another way it might confine his discretion.  It is not good enough that some provision should be put in in the Taoiseach's amendment defining what the money is to be spent on and what he can appropriate it to.  The Minister should take the Bill away and have another look at it and come back with proper protection in the section.  He could deal with the whole thing by saying that the money should be paid over for the benefit of the Exchequer when it would become part of public funds and would have to be expended and accounted for in accordance with the law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has told us that there will be full accountability and that the fund will have to be accounted for in the same way as other moneys paid out from the Exchequer are accounted for.  When we look again at the Estimate which the Minister is putting before the House we see that £750,000 is required to be spent before the end of the year on this project.  He has told us that £600,000 is going to the Royal <Col N="2365" /> National Lifeboat Institution before the end of this year.  The Minister will not tell us what the £150,000 is required for. That is the reality of the accountability we are getting here today.  The Minister is saying he wants £150,000 and that he has a number of things in mind but he will not tell us what they are.  When he is pressed on them he says they are all up in the air and that no decisions have been made.  How can the Minister say that money is required for something on which he has not decided?  When it comes down to it there is no accountability.  If £150,000 is to be paid to the RNLI &mdash; it may be £100,000 because from memory I cannot remember whether the Minister said it was £600,000 this year or £650,000 next year or <i>vice versa</i>&mdash; but certainly £100,000, one way or the other, is going astray.  On the day the Minister comes seeking that authority he is unable to tell this House what he is going to spend the money on.  He said it may be on a publishing project in Derry and it may be somewhere else but he said he was only telling us that in order to be helpful and to encourage us in this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly, all-Ireland projects of £100,000 on various projects have a bad history but I do not want to be bitter or angry.  I should like to suggest that this Minister is now coming into the House with what I consider to be a remarkable request, that we give him £750,000; he will tell us what he proposes to do with £650,000 but he will not tell us what he proposes to do with the £150,000. He said it is all required to be paid out by the end of this year.  It clearly shows that the accountability which Deputy Kelly's amendment &mdash; which he will be moving &mdash; seeks to put in place is that Dáil approval of the actual purpose is necessary because the Government have on their own admission, by tendering this Estimate and by saying that £650,000 of it is the only purpose which we will hear about, asked the Dáil for another £150,000 for innominate projects on <Col N="2366" /> which we will decide on a discretionary basis between now and the end of December.  I do not accept that that is accountability.  That is the very opposite to accountability, that is blank cheque politics.  There is no basis on which it is proper for this House to say to any Member of the Government: you may have £150,000 for various projects which fit into as rapid a category as Deputy Fitzpatrick pointed out, even as proposed to be amended.  Because of the very terms of the Supplementary Estimate before the House the case is proven QED that this House should approve each and every purpose for which this money is spent and the accountability to which the Minister refers, being the Estimate procedure, is not accountability in any real sense because on this occasion the Minister has told us, in effect, that he wants £150,000 for projects which he cannot now name and does not yet know the identity of.  That proves clearly that there is no accountability in respect of these moneys.</P>

I can agree to change the wording from &ldquo;the Irish Sailors and Soldiers Land Trust&rdquo; in the Estimate to read: &ldquo;Proceeds from Irish Sailors and Soldiers Land Trust&rdquo;, at least it will give a clear indication as to what is intended.  So far as the sum of the Estimate is concerned, every single penny can and will be accounted for in this House under the terms of the Bill.  The first and only allocation that has been decided on by the Government is to the Royal National Lifeboat Institution.  As others come forward they will be published, they will be public, and this House will have an opportunity of debating it when the Estimates of the Taoiseach are being debated, the same as any other Estimate of any other Minister.  The Dáil will have the right to either approve or reject the Estimate.  That goes on in this <Col N="2367" /> House year in year out.

One is &mdash; and the Minister has referred to it &mdash; that as far as the parliamentary draftsman is concerned and so far as this Bill is flawless in legal terms, I understand that his remit is to carry out the instruction of the Minister who proposes the Bill.

      <P>I oppose this section as it stands without amendment.  An amendment in the Taoiseach's name put forward by the Minister is proposed and if that amendment is accepted plus the amendment in Deputy Kelly's name to make sense of it, is likewise accepted, then the section becomes acceptable.  On the other hand, the section as it stands now is clearly objectionable and would give rise to a great deal of concern and criticism afterwards, particularly by organisations who will be aggrieved by their inability to get money from this fund.  It will be the same as the aggrieved lottery applicants, of whom there are <Col N="2373" /> thousands, if not tens of thousands.  If one were not taking account of what has been put down for Report Stage, it would be appropriate to oppose this section but taking account of that and in the hope that the second part of the amendment in Deputy Kelly's name will be accepted in order to make sense of it, I will not oppose this section.  Otherwise it is entirely deserving of opposition because it is simply a variant of the lottery syndrome which was described this morning as the Caligula factor.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P>Section 3 agreed to.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. D. O'Malley Mr. D. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to draw attention to the fact that under this section the expenses incurred in the administration of the Act shall, to such extent as may be sanctioned by the Minister for Finance, be paid out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas.  That is a normal provision. This must be contrasted with the unique provision in section 2 where for the first time, to my recollection and that of others, moneys will be paid out in such manner as the Taoiseach, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, directs.  There is a great contrast between these two sections.  Section 4 is perfectly normal and usual.  It is a provision whereby the normal controls would apply.  By contrast they do not apply in section 2.  It is interesting that the expenses involved in the Administration of the Act have to be provided for out of moneys that will be raised by revenue and voted and provided by the Oireachtas, whereas the other money can apparently be disbursed at the personal whim of the Taoiseach if the earlier section is allowed to stand.  It is not out of money provided by the Oireachtas but there is no accountability to the Oireachtas for the manner of its expenditure.  As section 2 stands, the Taoiseach has absolute discretion to <Col N="2374" /> pay out the money any way he likes. Section 4 follows the normal procedures. The great pity is that section 2 does not do the same.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Malley is working on the theory that if you repeat an untruth often enough it will eventually be believed.  There is full accountability in relation to this disbursement of funds. There is a subhead in the Estimate for the Taoiseach's Department.  In the normal course of events the Taoiseach's Estimate has to be approved on an annual basis, just as the Estimates of all other Ministers have to be approved.  If there is to be a Supplementary Estimate it has to be brought before the House and discussed. Every item in the Estimate can be argued and a Member of the House has the right to vote against it.  Apparently Deputy O'Malley, despite all the clarifications, does not want to accept that.  He wants to have it on the record that there is no accountability and there is some sleight of hand.  There is total accountability in relation to this legislation. There is a Supplementary Estimate to be moved at the end of this debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have bent over backwards in clarifying the agreement which was entered into by Deputy FitzGerald's Government and the British Government in relation to this fund.  I have included an amendment in the Bill.  Yet Deputy O'Malley continues to have his remarks written into the record, in the hope that they will be repeated in the media, implying that the Taoiseach is attempting some impropriety. It is not true.  It is not the fact of the situation.  There is total accountability for every penny that will be spent under this Bill.  It is a windfall to this State.  The Royal National Lifeboat Institution are already benefiting and other organisations can come in under the criteria laid down in the arrangements between Dr. FitzGerald's Government and the British Government.  My amendment will be written into the Bill and it is totally incorrect for Deputy O'Malley to try to get his message across in a vain attempt to increase from 7 per cent in the <Col N="2375" /> polls by besmirching the character of the Taoiseach.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T. Fitzpatrick Mr. T. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>The difficulty here is that normally a payment out is vouched by reference to some authority which has previously been given by this House. That has to be vouched to the satisfaction of the Comptroller and Auditor General, who is responsible for auditing all the accounts.  In this case the only voucher to which the Comptroller and Auditor General will be entitled will be a certificate that the Taoiseach so directed.  If that is so, this House cannot question it afterwards.  We are in the process of making a law whereby the money is to be disbursed completely or within very wide criteria at the direction of the Taoiseach. Once that is so, it cannot be questioned by the Comptroller and Auditor General or by this House.  It may be criticised by the House but not questioned.</P>
      <P>This is a dangerous departure, a dangerous precedent which can be followed in other Bills.  This Bill will be referred to in years to come.  That is the principle at stake here and it is not a petty one.  It is a major principle which bears on the accountability of the Executive to the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>On the question of accountability, the Comptroller and Auditor General will still have exactly the same role in relation to any other funds expended by any Minister under the authority of the Dáil.  An amendment has been put down in my name for the purpose of clarification in an attempt to assist this House and on the basis of the agreement entered into by the previous administration and the British Government that the funds should be disbursed for the purpose of such projects or undertakings, including the Royal National Lifeboat Institution, involving co-operation between the State and Northern Ireland, the State and Great Britain or relating to the island of Ireland as a whole.  This money can be spent only for such purposes or projects.  It is subject to the Comptroller and Auditor General <Col N="2376" /> and subject to the vote in this House.  If any Member does not agree with the way the money is spent it is his or her right to vote against the Estimate containing this subhead.  To say anything else is to try to turn the truth on its head.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>With the greatest respect, the Minister is very far from the truth when he accuses Deputy O'Malley of misrepresenting the facts.  The record of this House should show unequivocally that the Minister is moving a Supplementary Estimate for the Department of the Taoiseach tonight.  The fact is he is asking this House to give him authority to disburse £750,000 in this financial year. The fact is he will not tell the House the purpose for which those moneys are being spent.  He told the House approximately £600,000 will be spent this year on the RNLI and a sum slightly in excess of that next year.  The fact is that £150,000 is being given to the Taoiseach to apply at his discretion to projects of an all Ireland character as long as the Minister for Finance agrees with him.  Those are the facts that no amount of blustering, puffing or looking slightly ratty can change.  The simple fact is that this House is being asked to vote to create a fund of £750,000 to be disbursed by the Taoiseach on projects he will choose because the Bill is open to virtually every project of an all Ireland character the Taoiseach could contemplate.</P>
      <P>The Minister in his remarks on section 4 has chosen to suggest that there is full accountability.  That is not so because this Estimate means that tonight the Taoiseach gets authority to spend between now and December moneys for purposes on which we have no information.  That is a fact and no amount of posturing can get behind that fact.  If the moneys are spent, for instance, on cross-Border projects or on all Ireland projects chosen on a discretionary basis by the Taoiseach, nothing any of us can say will undo that fact, and the Comptroller and Auditor General has no come-back and cannot challenge anything as long as the project came within the very wide parameters of sections 2.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2377" /> If we are talking about facts, if we are talking about misrepresentation and putting things on the record of this House, as the Minister has chosen to do, then let us be clear about this.  Today he is looking for £750,000 but he will not tell us the purposes for which some of that money is being spent.  Today the Dáil is being asked to sign a blank cheque allowing the Taoiseach to spend that money between now and the end of the year.  Those are the facts.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kelly's careful and clever argument on constitutionality is not just so much academic theorising.  It is to ensure one thing, and that is, that the projects the Taoiseach has in mind, and which the Minister told us were candidates for this kind of patronage, must be brought before this House and approved.  That is the principle of parliamentary control.  If the record of this House is to show what the facts are as opposed to misrepresentation, it is very clear that there must be accountability or that the Comptroller and Auditor General has some real function in determining whether these funds were spent in a particular way.  If they are spent in any cross-Border project chosen by the Taoiseach, after tonight's vote there is nothing anybody in this House can do to reverse that, to change it or to suggest it should have been done in another way.  The Minister knows that and there is no point in pretending otherwise.  Those are the facts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>This is similar to every other piece of legislation which gives powers to a Minister when setting up State organisations.  All legislation provides that the Minister involved must have the approval of the Minister for Finance.  As Minister for Energy or Minister for Communications I may spend money subject to the approval of the Minister for Finance.  This is then brought before the Comptroller and Auditor General, and is voted in this House when we discuss the Estimates for my Department. At that time each subhead is looked at.  That is reality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This afternoon Deputies implied that there would be some impropriety so far <Col N="2378" /> as these projects are concerned.  I cannot say this often enough.  The Irish Sailors and Soldiers Land Trust is being wound up.  Thanks to the great efforts of Lord Killanin, the Taoisigh's representative since 1955, an agreement was reached in 1986 between the British and Irish Governments and this Bill gives legal effect to that.  This matter was debated this morning and to try to help the House and to ensure that the Bill would show the purposes mentioned in the 1986 agreement, I suggested an amendment: &ldquo;for the purposes of such projects or undertakings (including the Royal National Lifeboat Institution) involving co-operation between the State and Northern Ireland or the State and Great Britain or relating to the island of Ireland as a whole as the Taoiseach may ... determine&rdquo;.  That is the purpose of the project and there is full accountability in this House.</P>
    <P>If any Member is not satisfied how any group secures assistance, he will have the right to come in and question it, and vote against it.  That is his right, it is his power and it is his duty as an elected Member of the House.  To try to colour that concern with the level of insinuation we have had in this debate, does not do justice to Members.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. G. FitzGerald Dr. G. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. G. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has made the same speech three times but he is not addressing the issue.  Why are the Government not prepared to allow the Dáil to determine the specific objects of expenditure as we did in the Fund of Suitors Bill which laid down that not more than a certain sum should be spent on certain items?  The Minister's Report Stage amendment will allow the Taoiseach to supply the money, subject only to the approval of the Minister for Finance, to any object in the framework of the three headings which the Minister is incorporating in the Bill.  Whether this money goes to a book of poems in Derry or to the Royal Irish Academy would be at the discretion of the Taoiseach.  The Dáil took a very great interest in the Fund of Suitors Bill, which had a very difficult passage through the House.  I am not <Col N="2379" /> complaining about that but we stated specifically how the money was to be provided, not more than so much for the Kings' Inns, and not more than so much for other purposes, and the Dáil was very demanding and insistent that they must have that control.</P>
      <P>Instead of making the same speech for the fourth time, would the Minister tell us why in this instance he is not prepared to adopt the same procedure with this money coming from a fund outside the Exchequer as we adopted with the Fund of Suitors Bill?  If he would answer that question instead of going off at a tangent, we would make more progress.</P>

      <P>In the last line, after &ldquo;determine&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;, and as the Dáil may approve&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is designed to complete the wording of the amendment which the Minister put down in response to the points raised on the earlier Stage of the debate.  With the addition of the words &ldquo;and as the Dáil may approve&rdquo;, the control of the Dáil would be reasserted, which seems appropriate.  I should like to hear the grounds on which the Minister thinks the treatment of these funds should be different from the similar funds in the Fund of Suitors Act which come from outside and which are put to specific purposes beyond the normal framework of Exchequer expenditure.  In that case, as I pointed out earlier &mdash; apparently in a disorderly manner although I did not realise it &mdash; the Dáil specified how much of this money could be spent on particular objects and limited by laying down specific sums for each of the items of expenditure. Why does the Minister feel it necessary in this instance not to have that constraint but to give complete freedom of action to the Taoiseach in the disbursement of these funds?  What are the characteristics of these funds that differentiate them from the Funds of Suitors to such a degree that this open-ended approach is required rather than the Dáil approving specific expenditure of the maximum amount of expenditure on specific items?  I would be interested to hear the Minister's reply.  I am a bit disturbed <Col N="2383" /> that I cannot reply on Report Stage to his remarks but I am sure other Members will do so.</P>

      <P>Even if we did get upset, our day will not have been in vain and we will have achieved something worthwhile.  The Bill as it stands, even though it is about an innocuous matter, is highly unsatisfactory and is clearly open to abuse in the same way as the national lottery has been, not just open to abuse but flagrantly and continuously abused over the past 12 months.</P>
      <P>The words proposed by Deputy Kelly to be added to the Minister's amendment will cover it and will mean that it will not be open to any possible abuse in any of the manners indicated by different people earlier.  We can all be reasonably happy in regard to it and that the objectives which were agreed, apparently, some years ago with the British Government can be met in that way.  There will not be any problem about it.  As I said this morning, the Bill differes from the British Bill in a very marked way inasmuch as the British Bill sets out precisely where the money will go and for what purpose, whereas the Irish Bill leaves it entirely to the personal discretion of the holder of the office of Taoiseach for the time being. I understand that Deputy FitzGerald wants to substitute &ldquo;Minister for Foreign Affairs&rdquo; for &ldquo;Taoiseach&rdquo; but that will not make a material difference.  It is the principle&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The principle which is objectionable is the same whether it is the Taoiseach of the day or the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  It may make more administrative sense but it does not remove the underlying and fundamental objection which, clearly, there is.</P>
      <P>It is worth repeating what Deputy McDowell and others sought to point out in relation to the Supplementary Estimate before us.  There is no accountability. We are told that even though we are voting £750,000, the purposes for which it is being voted have not yet being decided upon and we are, therefore, being asked to vote as if we are in a vacuum.  We are told that the destination of the money has not yet been decided but that it will be decided by the Taoiseach when the Bill is passed and that it will then be disbursed.  That is not accountability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Supplementary Estimate is unique in my experience in that it is the only Estimate I have ever seen which does not set out the purpose of the expenditure which, under Article 11 of the Constitution, it is bound to do.  Rather it sets out the source of the receipt of the money concerned.  As if there was any doubt about that the Minister has offered to clarify it by adding the words &ldquo;proceeds of Irish Sailors and Soldiers Land Trust&rdquo;. The purpose of an Estimate and of a subhead in an Estimate is to specify the service, activity, organisation or whatever else on which the money will be spent and to give approval to that.  The Dáil cannot do that, even if it goes through the motions of voting it through, when what is specified is the donor organisation rather than the recipient.  The one body that cannot be the receipent is the Irish Sailors and Soldiers Land Trust because it is being wound up.  What the point of persisting with that Supplementary Estimate is I do not know. The Minister gets very annoyed when these points are made and he does not reply to them.  I am sorry that he gets annoyed but I feel I have a duty to make <Col N="2385" /> the point.  It has not been replied to, nor has the point that I have made in relation to Article 11 of the Constitution which is that the purpose for which moneys are appropriated must be stated.  They must be determined and imposed by law and that is not being done in this case.  No bluster can get us away from the situation that that is a simple matter of fact.  The purpose of the appropriation is not being stated.  This is not just some sort of academic point; it is a basic point of some importance.</P>
    <P>In order that the problems that have arisen in relation to this Bill be rectified, I urge the Minister, as well as moving this amendment which he has already done, to accept with it the words &ldquo;and as the Dáil may approve&rdquo;.  The necessity for those words is proven by the debate we are having now because we are not in a position to approve of the proposed expenditure.  We have not been told what it is and we have not been told who the recipients for all the expenditure are. Therefore, in spite of the Minister's assertions, there cannot be accountability because there is nothing to be accountable for.  That is why it is very important that the latter few words are added and accepted.  If the Minister does that he would be doing a good day's work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask the Minister, in relation to the amendment in the name of the Taoiseach which he has moved, whether this amendment has the implication that only projects of a North-South or an Anglo-Irish dimension can be supported from these funds.  Am I right in understanding that it excludes from support projects which are exclusively within the Republic?  If so, I wonder if the amendment should be so exclusive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For instance, I would like to raise the question of the plight of the former employees of Irish Shipping.  I would like to ask the Minister if any consideration was given to the proceeds of this fund being used for the alleviation of hardship in that case.  The previous Government and this Government have made clear repeatedly that they had explored all sorts of avenues to alleviate that hardship <Col N="2386" /> but because of legal and other constraints were prohibited from doing so.  Surely, because these funds are not Exchequer funds, this is one opportunity of living up to the promise which the present Government so definitely made when in Opposition. I would like the Minister to be clear on whether consideration was given to that point and, if so, why provision has not been made in the Bill for it.  I would also like to know whether, in the Bill as it is proposed to be amended, it would be possible to alleviate the hardship of some of those Irish Shipping employees who, the House has unanimously agreed, served this country very well for many years but were the unfortunate victims of very bad decisions made without the authority of the board or the Government.</P>
    <P>A second question I would like to raise arising from the Minister's amendment is whether the Irish Lights Commission could be a beneficiary under this heading, whether it has been considered that the Irish Lights Commission should benefit. As the Irish Lights Commission is a 32county body which acts in unison with Trinity House and the Northern Lights in Scotland and which is a partner in the General Lighthouse Fund based in London, I would like to know whether discussions have taken place as to possible assistance to Irish Lights from the proceeds of this fund?</P>

      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Deputy O'Malley, I believe the Bill has been substantially changed by the Minister's amendment and would be further changed if Deputy Kelly's amendment was included.  The Bill we started out with this morning was totally inadequate. It merely states that this money is available, is going to the Exchequer and that the Taoiseach can do what he likes with it.  That was the basis of the Bill we were presented with but it has been changed substantially in its intent.  It now gives a general specification of the types of projects and undertakings involved.  It is very broad in scope, relating to the island of Ireland as a whole, but nevertheless it differs substantially from the Bill we <Col N="2387" /> started out with this morning.  I am pleased that some changes have been made.</P>
      <P>I do not agree with Deputy O'Malley when he says that the British Government set out clearly what they are going to do with all the money.  They did not. They said clearly what they are going to do with 40 per cent of the money but the other 60 per cent is just going to the Exchequer and nobody knows what will be done with it.  All I know about it is what I see in the Minister's speech.  The Minister said that British legislation states that 40 per cent of the money will go in support of ex-servicemen's charities, North and South, and that the remaining 60 per cent will go to the Exchequer.  The British Government did not tell us what they are going to do with the money.  It is precisely that point of 60 per cent going to the Exchequer that I would disagree with.  If the Minister had proposed in the Bill that 40 per cent would go to the RNLI and 60 per cent to the Exchequer I think we would all still be opposing the Bill.  Ths Bill has been substantially changed but nevertheless I am still not happy with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would be happy with this wording if it had been there from scratch because it would mean that funds would be made available for one of the purposes which I have in mind and which I referred to repeatedly &mdash; since everyone else has repeated themselves all day long I might as well repeat myself &mdash; a project that is very important and very relevant to the needs for which the fund was established, that is housing for soldiers.  Some of the funds should be made available for housing our ex-servicemen and to assist in the housing of some of our servicemen who have to pay for accommodation, some of which is very bad.  The money should be made available particularly for our ex-servicemen. I will also repeat again that I believe that would be covered.  Any Minister who would pick up this Bill and ask himself what would he give the funds to would say a project or an undertaking involving co-operation between this State, the State's Army and Northern <Col N="2388" /> Ireland or co-operation between this State, the State's Army and Great Britain.  This State's Army and its ex-servicemen are certainly covered under the terms of the Bill.  The Minister would be quite entitled to hand out whatever funds are required to the Organisation of National Ex-Servicemen for the purposes for which they have already appealed to the Minister for Defence for funds.  No doubt following this debate, they will be applying to the Minister for support from this fund.</P>
    <P>On the basis of the wording before me we would be quite happy that that would be covered and that any Minister would be legally entitled to do that under the Bill.  However, all that worries me are the comments made by both the Minister and the former Taoiseach, Deputy FitzGerald, which appear on the face of it, if somebody was to read the debates rather than the Bill, to exclude assisting ONE. If there was some comment from the Minister to indicate that that is a matter for the Minister or the Taoiseach to decide, that there is no particular exclusion or whatever, if the Minister would give some indication that at least they can apply and so would satisfy me that they are eligible to apply as are many other people, such comment would be helpful.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T. Fitzpatrick Mr. T. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>As was said when the Bill was given a Second Reading here this morning, section 2 simply gave a blank cheque to the Taoiseach with the consent of the Minister for Finance and imposed no restraints of any description on how the money would be spent.  It established no guidelines or criteria as to how the money should be spent.  That was absolutely and entirely unsatisfactory.  I do not believe at all that today's debate has been wasted or a waste of time.  It is probably one of the most valuable day's work that has been done in this Dáil for a long time.  In my opinion we have established a principle that bank cheques like that are not acceptable, that this House will not nod them through and that in each Bill which provides for expenditure there should be machinery <Col N="2389" /> for accountability in respect of that money.  I do not think we will have a &ldquo;try on&rdquo; like this again.  I do not use the words &ldquo;try on&rdquo; in any offensive way.  I use them in the meaning that we will not have an effort made to get a Bill like this through the Dáil which will enable money to be expended in very large sums at the whim or discretion of a political head of a Department.  I believe this will go up as a marker that this is not acceptable in the House and that it will not happen.  The Bill has been improved somewhat, but the attempt to improve it in the form of the Minister's amendment is entirely unsatisfactory.  The last two and a half lines of the Minister's amendment which read: &ldquo;or relating to the island of Ireland as a whole as the Taoiseach may, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, determine&rdquo;.  That is far too vague.  It couples it in some way with the whole island of Ireland, but if one had time one could draw up an endless list of projects which would be applicable. Some of them might be very worthy, some of them might be completely and utterly unworthy and unsuitable, but that spoils the effort the Minister made to amend the Bill.  I would invite him, even at this late stage, to cut out those words I have just read and the amendment will be far more meaningful.  Maybe he will do it between now and when the Bill goes to the Seanad if he does not do it here or does not feel that as of today he has the authority to say &ldquo;yes&rdquo;.  He might have the authority before very long to amend a Bill like this.  He should give serious consideration to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Mac Giolla stated that if it was provided that 40 per cent of this £2.5 million was to be paid for the INLA and the remainder was to be paid into the National Exchequer he would still object to it.  He would be very foolish if he did. As a matter of fact, in the prevailing economic climate and conditions here where there is an acute shortage of money for such things as health, education, roads, housing, you name it, there is a big argument for paying the entire amount of this money into the Exchequer and for paying the entire amount of the <Col N="2390" /> lottery fund into the Exchequer and seeing it was distributed to all those essential services.  We hear people in here every day of the week complaining about hospital treatment for children, adults, old people, the lot, and appealing in God's name to do something for them. The same applies to education and roads.</P>

      <P>We have had a very long day but there is a moral in the story. The next time a Bill like this comes into this Chamber, whatever the instructions to the parliamentary draftsman will be, they will be far more specific as far as accountability is concerned.  We have been six or seven hours debating what started out as essentially a small matter. In fact it is a bench mark that will be referred to on many an occasion in this House in the years to come.  For the years I have been here I have not heard another debate of such intensity.</P>
      <P>We have a better Bill now than we had when we started &mdash; that is my personal opinion.  We have gone some way.  I am very disappointed that the Minister cannot go the other little step to give the Dáil the watchdog capability it should have.  The Minister's amendment goes quite a long way.  I got the impression this morning that he was unlikely to listen to that type of language, but at least we have come so far.  All I can say at this stage is that the matter has been teased out well and many Members of this House will refer to it in the years to come because we have stated fairly categorically that there are certain things that this House will not stand for.</P>

      <P>To take Deputy Connaughton's point in relation to the Bill and things this House will not stand for, this Bill is as it started out this morning, with the amendment which merely puts into the Bill the intention that was there in the agreement between the two Governments.  All it does is write it in.  There has been no change.  It was never intended that, in the words of Deputy Fitzpatrick, it be a blank cheque. It never was and never will be.  There is accountability and the accounting practices are exactly the same in this measure as they are on every other subhead that comes in under every other ministry in this Government.  Deputy Connaughton and others said that we should give the Dáil watchdog capability.  The Dáil has that capability and duty.  It will no doubt do its duty and has done so in all the years that I have been here, and I have been here since 1973.  The Dáil does examine Estimates and votes on the Estimates every year.  That is the duty of the Dáil and the Dáil meets that responsibility and I have no doubt they will do so in relation to this subhead within the Taoiseach's Department.</P>
      <P>In regard to the points made by Deputy Mac Giolla, there is no change.  Exactly the same interests are involved in this amendment as were specified in my opening remarks on Second Stage.  All this amendment does it put into the legislation what was there anyway.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the agreement that was entered into between the two Governments, any group has the right to apply.  This Government recognise their very special responsibility in relation to Army accommodation and that is why, even in the difficult times we live in, with finances controlled to the extent that they are, we have given this year a very substantial increase in the amount of money for Army accommodation.</P>

      <P>I see no difficulty on that.  Deputy Fitzpatrick said it would be better if this went into the overall Exchequer funds.  I do not accept that.  It is £2.56 million in relation to £6.25 billion of expenditure at national level in 1989. I do not believe that that would be the proper way to spend this money.  That is why it is specifically identified in the subhead as being money coming from this particular source and it will be subject to the normal accountability rules of this House, the Comptroller and Auditor General and the accounting officer in the Department of the Taoiseach.  If it went into the Exchequer funds, it would just be swallowed up.  It is better that it go for purposes such as the Royal National Lifeboat Institution.  For example, that institution intends to use this money to purchase a new lifeboat to improve the lifesaving facilities on the north and north-west coasts.  That is very important. There has been a demand for this and this is the right and proper way to spend the money.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Malley referred to the British Bill in which it was specified that 40 per cent would be spent in a certain way and that the balance of the money would go into the Exchequer.  I think that is the wrong way to do it, as do the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley referred also to the question of accountability.  There is total accountability under this legislation just as under any other legislation that is passed through this House.  The Dáil has a right and a duty to examine it when the Estimates are being debated under the various subheads.  Deputy O'Malley also mentioned the source of the funding in the subhead.  It is merely to identify it as <Col N="2393" /> a sum of money to be separately spent but with total accountability.</P>
    <P>I believe the amendment of Deputy John Kelly is unnecessary as the Dáil approves at all times the Estimates of the various Ministers.  I will not be in a position to accept it.  I recommend my own amendment.</P>

      <P>I submitted that amendment during Committee Stage.  In the House if there is some technical <Col N="2396" /> defect of an obscure kind in an amendment it has been my experience that the officials of the House would draw that to the attention of the Member so that the necessary change can be made.  It is without precedent to allow the debate to proceed to a point where there is a catch-22 situation and the amendment can be taken neither before nor after another amendment.  I should like to protest against that.  It is a discourtesy not to handle the amendment in the way which has been traditional when there is some technical defect in an amendment which is a perfectly proper and suitable amendment in itself.  The technical defect could hardly be foreseeable, as was implicit in the Chair's approach to this.</P>

      <P>When I submitted my amendment the Chair had not accepted the other one.  On Committee Stage I tabled an amendment to the Bill as it was then.  I was not told that that amendment was unacceptable or out of order until the end of Report Stage.  I must protest.  That is not the way the business of the House normally operates. My amendment was in order when it was tabled and at that Stage what was before us was the Bill as introduced.  I could not have put down my amendment in any other way.  My amendment had to be to the Bill before the House at the time.  I cannot put down some hypothetical amendment that might, or might not be passed.  In my view it is wrong to say that I must presume that the Minister's amendment will be passed and put down an amendment to it anticipating that decision.  Had I done that I could quite properly have been faulted for anticipating something happening that might not necessarily happen.  There must be <Col N="2397" /> some way that one can table an amendment but it seems to me that no matter how I put down an amendment I was going to be caught one way or another. The amendment put down during the debate on Committee Stage related to Report Stage and was left over and nothing said about it but was ruled out at the end of the proceedings.  That is unsatisfactory and I must protest against a method of procedure which has deprived me of my rights in this matter.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will accept that the occupant of the Chair does not have the power of bilocation.  The Chair is advised as amendments arrive.  I am not at the point where they are handed in, or assessed. The Chair must adjudicate on matters that come before it.  The Deputy can rest assured that I have given a lot of thought to this.  It has happened that a decision on an amendment affects whether subsequent amendments are in order.  That occurred this afternoon.  It often happens that such amendments fall.</P>

Is it the case that when a Member tables an amendment on Committee Stage that Member must form the amendment in relation to any amendments then existing on Report Stage rather than making amendments to what exists on Committee Stage?  I have not heard of that procedure before and it seems extraordinary.</P>

      <P>I tabled my amendment on Committee Stage.  At the outset of the debate on Report Stage I asked about my amendment and the Chair told me that the House was taking Deputy <Col N="2398" /> Kelly's amendment.  That led me to believe that my amendment could be taken but after we went through Report Stage I was told that my amendment could not be taken because it related to the only thing I considered to be properly before the House, the Bill as introduced.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chair is endeavouring to explain the position to the Deputy.  Before I took the Chair there was an amendment, and an amendment to that amendment, before the House. The amendment to the amendment was in the name of Deputy Kelly who had advised the Chair that Deputy FitzGerald had agreed to move it for him.  Deputy FitzGerald's amendment did not appear at all.  I can only be guided by what I see, not by what may be floating around.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>My amendment was tabled during the Committee Stage debate and it did not reach the Chair until after the Leas-Cheann Comhairle had taken the Chair.  The question I want settled for the future is whether when putting down an amendment for Report Stage such an amendment will be ruled out of order, as the Chair has done, if it refers to the text of the Bill at Committee Stage.  Must all amendments for Report Stage be put down in the form of amendments already submitted for that Stage? If that is the case it is a totally new procedure. It is a very dangerous and unworkable one.  Is the Chair ruling that that is how Report Stage amendments must be tabled in future?</P>

      <P>I am not ruling on the articulation of the case as made by Deputy FitzGerald because that is not how this occurred.  That is his treatment of the history but it is not how this occurred.  Therefore, it would be foolish of me to treat it accordingly.  I advised the Deputy that when I took the Chair there was one document before me, an amendment in the name of the Taoiseach and an amendment to that amendment in the name of Deputy Kelly.  Deputy Kelly had advised me that Deputy FitzGerald would be moving the amendment <Col N="2399" /> in his name.  Anything that followed after that is in accordance with the advice given.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Jim Tunney">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I am not making that ruling.  I am advising the Deputy that his amendment arrived subsequently but, because of the decision of the House since then, his amendment fell.  The Deputy must accept that his amendment refers to something that does not exist and, therefore, could not be in order.</P>

      <P>This is an extraordinary proposal, that if one puts down an amendment one must guess as to what Stage the debate will be at when the amendment is typed and reaches the Chair.

      <P>It now transpires that this is the one and only occasion that this House will consider this £750,000, despite what the Minister has been told by his officials.  This is a Supplementary Estimate to an Estimate that has already been approved by the House.  This is the first and last occasion that the House will consider these moneys.  It now transpires that what I said is correct and what the <Col N="2402" /> Minister said is incorrect.  We will never be informed before we authorise this £750,000 as to the purposes for which it will be spent.  That was the point I made and I was accused of obfuscation and deceiving the House and trying to misrepresent the record but it now appears that in November 1988 we are moving a Supplementary Estimate to the Taoiseach's Estimate, which was the subject matter of the Adjournment Debate last July.  It now appears that this is the first and only time that the House is being given an opportunity to consider where this £750,000 is going.  When this year elapses there will be no further discussion on these sums of money.  The Minister assured the House in the course of the debate that £600,000 would be spent on a lifeboat facility this year on the west coast.  He also told the House that the Government had other projects in mind. He told the House solemnly, and attacked Deputy O'Malley somewhat bitterly, I suggest, for being untruthful.  He attacked him for suggesting there was no accountability.  I now say to the Minister that £750,000 proposed to be authorised by this House to be expended in this Estimate will not be the subject matter of another Estimate during this financial year.  The money is to be spent during this financial year and neither the Minister nor anybody else on that side of the House is willing to say what it will be spent on and what projects it will aid.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>They will be getting £1.1 million altogether.  They will get £500,000 or £600,000 this year and the balance next year depending on the cost of the lifeboat.  I think Deputy McDowell will understand that it is very difficult to say at this stage exactly how much the lifeboat will cost and how much the RNLI will want to spend in a very necessary upgrading of their life-saving equipment.</P>
      <P>The balance of the money, if it is not spent this year &mdash; and it is an estimate only &mdash; will roll over and will carry over into future years.  We can have a full debate in this House at any time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>We have spent all day today debating exactly what it will be spent on.  The basis of the amendment that I put down sets out exactly what it will be spent on &mdash; which is based on the agreement entered into by the previous Government and confirmed by us.  The moneys will be spent on the purposes as laid out in the amendment which we passed earlier, for the purpose of such projects or undertakings involving cooperation between the State and Northern Ireland or between the State and Great Britain or relating to the island of Ireland as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy McDowell can try to cast as much dirt as he likes, but this will be fully accounted for.  We will have an Adjournment Debate at Christmas and Deputies will have a full opportunity to discuss it. The Deputy will have a full opportunity to discuss it during the budget debate. Every single penny will be accounted for <Col N="2405" /> and all the insinuations that Deputy McDowell has been making all day will not stand up.  The money will be fully accounted for by the Comptroller and Auditor General and by this House.</P>

Whereas the question of the Royal National Lifeboat Institute was brought to a further stage, nothing was arranged conclusively about the Royal Irish Academy. Nonetheless it was one of the points raised at the time and I would like the Minister to consider it.  I am a member of the Royal Irish Academy but I have had no communication of any kind with them and they do not know what I am saying about it but I felt I should raise the matter here.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. N. Treacy) Noel Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. N. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to address Deputies once again, but this time in more detail, on the matter of the Bill at present before the House.  It has been said already in this debate, but I wish to say it again, that the Bill is an attempt to case a slur on the Government, to undermine public confidence in the Government and that it implies misappropriation of lottery funds.  Anybody who has seen the work that has been done by the Office of Public Works at the five locations I have already described will have no doubt but that the lottery funds are being put to the most beneficial use.</P>
      <P>I gave in detail last night a broad outline of the five projects of national importance which have been grant aided out of national lottery surplus funds.  The works provide major efforts to reconstruct, repair, rehabilitate and improve facilities for various buildings that are important both architecturally and historically.  Work on the Custom House can be taken as an example of some of the finest craftsmanship that has been carried out in this country for many years.  The works which I was describing at No. 5 Kildare Street, as the debate finished last night, will be appropriately furnished to facilitate its use by the National Library.  These works are on target for completion early next year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have gone into these five projects in some detail because I do not want anybody in this House to under-estimate the importance of the work that national lottery funds are assisting.  How can Deputy Harney and others denigrate such fine work by their allegations and insinuations?  For too many years the Office of Public Works have been eager to get to grips with the necessary works in these locations and others, but because <Col N="2407" /> of a continually worsening financial situation they have been unable to do so. Now, because of the funding that is made available from the national lottery, buildings that are unique, priceless and of the utmost significance to this nation's heritage can be preserved for future generations to enjoy.</P>
    <P>During the past year the Government established the National Heritage Council. An allocation of £1 million was made available to the council.  Already some very important national heritage centres have been grant aided.  Post archaeological excavation works at a number of centres throughout the country have been grant aided and there are several other applications before the National Heritage Council which are presently being examined and appraised and further decisions will be made in due course to ensure that the balance of funds available to the national council from the national lottery surplus will be disbursed to the most important areas.</P>
    <P>The remarks made by some Deputies in relation to the disbursement of national lottery funds are distasteful in the extreme and detract from the quite outstanding work that is being done by my Department.  Lest anyone forget, this work is also going to benefit our tourist industry and is providing very important employment.  The facilities being provided at the five locations I have already described in detail will ensure that visitor and tourist facilities for our own people and for foreigners will be available to ensure that they get the maximum opportunities to understand our history, our culture and our unique heritage.</P>
    <P>The money allocated to the Office of Public Works is only a small part of the entire lottery allocation.  Other Ministers will be speaking in this House on the details of how their Departments are spending their allocations.  It is no harm to risk some repetition in the hope that the message will get through to certain people both inside and outside this House that the allegations being made are both offensive and totally inaccurate.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2408" /> Let me take for example the 550 projects that will benefit from the £6 million national lottery fund allocated to the Department of the Environment.  Some 2,000 applications, amounting to expenditure of approximately £61 million, were received by the Department.  Rigorous selection resulted in allocations going to one quarter of them.  Each application was examined in terms of the objectives of the applicants, the necessity for the proposed work, the cost effectiveness of the project and the jobs it would create.</P>
    <P>It was important that every county and county borough should receive a reasonable allocation, bearing in mind that the money being allocated had been contributed by people in every part of the country.  People who buy national lottery tickets must know that they have contributed to making life in this country a little easier and a bit more interesting for our own people and for those who come as visitors.</P>
    <P>The types of projects assisted include the provision and development of open spaces and amenity and landscaping works designed to improve the local environment. Also covered is the provision of recreational facilities such as parks, outdoor playing areas, community centres and youth clubs, and a number of projects designed to enhance the historical, recreational and amenity value of designated urban renewal areas.</P>
    <P>One of the conditions govering the way the distribution of the funds will be managed is that project sponsors made every effort to ensure that at least 50 per cent of the workforce is under 25 years of age and that other unemployed local people be employed where possible.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned briefly how the national lottery will help the unemployed and also our tourist industry.  There are many other areas that will benefit.  For example, lottery funds have been used and will be used in the health and social welfare areas to help alleviate poverty and provide better care and facilities for the less fortunate in our society.  With such motives, which I feel are recognised by all but the most callous of people, any attempt at what can only be described <Col N="2409" /> as misinformed and misguided policital opportunism will be seen by all fairminded people as just that.  It is a crude and unjust attempt to score some points by running down the best intentions of all those involved in the national lottery and in the disbursement of its funds.  I am of the firm opinion that those few misguided people have only succeeded in scoring own goals and have tried to destabilise and undermine the national lottery.  It must be they who carry that responsibility.</P>
    <P>Let me give just a few examples of the unquestionable goods use to which lottery funds are being put in the health area.  A total of £10 million was allocated to the Department of Health 1987-88.  Of this, £6 million was available for projects in the area of community health.  The board headings under which this money was to be allocated were agreed at Cabinet in November 1987 and they are as follows: the handicapped, the elderly, psychiatric services, community information and development services, AIDS preventative programmes and child services. Within the headings a total of 157 projects have been assisted to date. Included in these are the handicapped where a large number of houses have been purchased to move the mentally handicapped from institutional care into the community.  Funds have also been provided to assist voluntary organisations working with the physically handicapped, for example, the Irish Wheelchair Association received a grant of £150,000. A sum of £1 million has been provided for the development of day care services for the elderly as an alternative to institutional care.  The involves the conversion of existing premises, for example, former district hospitals, and the provision of new services which will encourage care of the elderly at local community level.</P>
    <P>Money has also been provided for the psychiatric services.  This has been used, for the psychiatric hospitals and to proties to facilitate the movement of additional long stay patients.  Money has <Col N="2410" /> also been provided in grants for the community information and development services.  Under this heading grants have been used to provide for the enhancement within a broad framework of community information and community development services.  The focus is on services provided by voluntary agencies.</P>
    <P>A total of £450,000 was provided under the AIDS preventive programme in order to assist projects, particularly with an emphasis being placed on special measures to minimise the spread of infections among intravenous drug abusers and between these abusers and the community at large.  A total of £700,000 was provided for child services, £500,000 of which was used to set up services around the country in order to facilitate the improved investigation and management of child sexual abuse.</P>
    <P>On the social welfare side also, national lottery funds are being put to good use.  In 1988 a scheme of grants to voluntary bodies is being funded by moneys made available from the national lottery surplus.  The purpose of this scheme of grants to voluntary organisations administered by the Department of Social Welfare is to give support to voluntary organisations undertaking projects in the social services area.  Under this scheme a sum of £750,000 was made available this year for once-off grants for particular projects being undertaken by such organisations.  In addition, there were special allocations of £100,000 to the St. Vincent de Paul Society for personal development and home management courses for some 5,000 families and £50,000 under a pilot scheme for grants to voluntary organisations providing opportunities for unemployed people to become involved in their activities.</P>
    <P>The vast bulk of the grants under this scheme are paid to organisations providing services in local communities, including services for women, parents and children and in other cases the projects involved would indirectly benefit these categories.  In 1988 in excess of 100 organisations will have benefited under the Department of Social Welfare <Col N="2411" /> scheme.  I think it should be reiterated that this Act was devised, compiled and introduced by the previous Government and that this Government have adhered to the criteria as clearly laid down by this House under the 1986 Act.</P>
    <P>The Bill now before the House proposes the setting up of a board to disburse the lottery funds, comprising a judge and four others from the sports, culture, art, health and welfare areas.  In the past two years the Government, in the face of great national debt, unemployment and the economic recession have made great progress to reduce our debt and put the country on a stable footing once more.</P>
    <P>Decisions on national lottery allocations are arrived at by the Government. Before Ministers may subsequently disburse these funds for schemes and projects, the criteria and conditions for the scheme must first be submitted for examination and approval by the Minister for Finance and his officials.  It is only after this examination, following the approval of the Minister for Finance, that the Minister can allocate grant aid, but only strictly in accordance with the regulations laid down by the Minister for Finance.  This procedure is identical in these respects to the procedure adopted in the case of projects funded from the Exchequer.  The Bill is being brought forward by Deputy Harney on the grounds that the lottery funds have not been properly allocated.  What I have outlined so far demonstrates to this House and the general public that this view is outrageous and without foundation.</P>
    <P>With regard to sport, the Department of Education were allocated £6.64 million under the heading of current expenditure and £10.5 million for capital expenditure. This year the 73 national governing bodies of sport will receive almost £1 million &mdash; £985,000 &mdash; in their annual grant for coaching, equipment and administration.  This sum represents an increase of 22 per cent over last year's allocation.  For 1988 also an extra £210,000 is being provided for the appointment of new administrators for <Col N="2412" /> these bodies to improve their management and coaching structures.  A further £97,000 is being provided for the purchase of large items of equipment and for attendance at international meetings and conferences.  Further extra grants of £273,000 are being made available to enable elite sports persons to compete in international competition and for the organisation of international competitions at home.  A sum of £182,000 was allocated for development officers, while £100,000 was granted for the subsidisation of hurleys.  A sum of £120,000 is being granted under the scheme for outstanding sports people, while the Olympic Council of Ireland received £500,000.  Funding is also given to COSPOIR to enable them to develop &ldquo;Sport For All&rdquo; and other programmes and they in turn disburse these funds though the COSPOIR subcommittees of the various county vocational education committees and county borough education committees.  Several other projects have also been grant-aided.</P>
    <P>The details I have given for my Department, for the Department of the Environment, for the Department of the Social Welfare and the Department of Health, show clearly that every application has been examined in great detail, that decisions have been arrived at taking into account the criteria laid down by the Minister for Finance and the Department of Finance, that applications are brought forward to Government by the various Ministers and that only then can the individual applications be decided on by the various Departments and Ministers.  This shows that both the management and disbursement of national lottery funds is accountable through each relevant Department, each relevant Minister, the officials of the Department of Finance and the Minister for Finance to the Government and finally to the Dáil. There can be no question but that there is full public accountability for the disbursement of all lottery grants.</P>
    <P>This Bill is an effort by the Progressive Democrats, in particular, to get cheap political mileage and to make seriously false allegations, a campaign which they <Col N="2413" /> have carried on during the past number of months, because they cannot contend with the fact that some other party in Government have the ability to discharge their responsibilities both legally and properly in the best interests of all the people in the country.  I am confident that the Irish people see this Bill for what it is and the attitude of that party for what it is &mdash; an effort to decry the efforts of the Government in their attempts to manage the affairs of this country openly and perfectly in the interests of everyone.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>The more contributions I hear from the Government benches on a variety of debates, the clearer it becomes that the Government are totally out of touch with reality.  I do not think it is necessary for any of us to stand up here and to make a case for reform of the national lottery.  Everybody, in their workplace or in their place of socialising in every county, is aware that the national lottery has been hijacked by the political party who form the Government of this country and is being used by that party in a naked attempt to purchase votes and to shore up the dwindling fortunes of a bankrupt administration.  It is an acknowledged scandal.  The Minister stood up tonight and gave a litany of handouts.  A previous contribution from that side of the House was a similar litany of handouts. Nobody is denying that there are good beneficiaries from this fund but there are a few fundamentals which have to be recognised.</P>
      <P>The first fundamental is that when this concept was first moved by the Coalition Government and enacted into legislation by the Houses of the Oireachtas the scale of moneys that became available was never envisaged.  It was not envisaged that we would have this amount of money to put to good use in the community.  At that time the Oireachtas certainly did not envisage that one political party would take it upon themselves to be the total arbitrators of these funds and moneys and to channel them in a party partisan way to various projects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to use the opportunity of this debate tonight to put the record straight <Col N="2414" /> and to explain the Labour Party position. Some months ago, the Parliamentary Labour Party on seeing the unholy practice being carried out by the Fianna Fáil Government whereby Ministers, Deputies and Senators of that party were literally handing out cheques&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>On the front page of my own local paper, one particular Oireachtas Member was photographed in the middle of a group announcing that he was delivering £30,000 for a project.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Had he the cheque?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>The reality is that, if decided, Fianna Fáil could use this as a mechanism to buy votes.  I have contributed to a number of health debates in the last 18 months and I have tried to underline for a Government that is increasingly out of touch with reality, the crisis in relation to the delivery of services in the health care area.  I have tried to do the same in relation to Education and the Environment.  In the area of health, a plethora of hospitals have been closed &mdash; 18 in all, since this administration came to power.  A total of 14,070 beds in those hospitals have closed as have another 3,617 beds in hospitals that survived the axe.  Thousands of jobs have gone and there has been a total dismantling of essential services.</P>
      <P>In the area of Education we have seen infamous circulars trying to worsen education conditions by increasing pupilteacher ratios at every level and withdrawing essential support and ancillary staff that are required particularly among the disadvantaged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the area of the Environment, local authorities are now coming to terms with Estimates for next year which are further cut back by between five and eleven per cent on top of two years of savage cuts. Some local authorities are threatening to put up signs on some county roads indicating that the road has been abandoned by the local authority and inviting people to proceed at their own risk. <Col N="2415" /> Housing lists are growing at a rate we have not seen in two decades.</P>
    <P>In the middle of all this crisis, anybody with a whit of morality would stand back and establish priorities for these resources that are becoming available in the State.  The general public do not see golf clubs and many other projects as being of priority.  It is difficult to justify the channelling of money to affluent resorts or to leisure institutions when people's lives are under threat because of the dismantling of the health services by this Government.  In times of crisis there must be some priority.  That is the view of the Labour Party in this issue of available funds.  Already today, we have had a long debate on another windfall of money to the State.  That £2 million to £3 million is to be subsumed into the Taoiseach's office.  We in the Labour Party, sought to channel that into areas of need, but this Government want to keep their greedy hands in control so that only they can give out largesse and only they, without defined criteria&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a function of Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;can buy votes and be seen to be Santa Claus when it suits them. The attitude of the Opposition Parties is common.  Every Opposition Deputy and a fair number of Government backbenchers have realised that there is huge resentment among the ordinary people to what is happening in the national lottery and that it will eventually impact on the lottery.  People will simply stop supporting it if we cannot prove that the funds are channelled in the best interests of the Irish people in a fair and open way. All the Opposition Deputies are united in trying to achieve that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There have been varying suggestions about how this worthy objective can be realised.  The Labour Party support the notion of a motion.  The Progressive Democrats published a Bill and thought that legislation was the only way to ensure fairness in this regard.  Both those proposals have merits and demerits.  The <Col N="2416" /> merits of the motion are that we would have had a decision this week on the issue.  The Government would be faced with a decision of Dáil Éireann and unless they wanted to abandon democracy completely &mdash; and they are going towards that in the way they have treated other motions that came before the House &mdash; they would be under pressure of the democratic will of the elected representatives of the people to reform in this area.  There are other merits in the notion of a motion.  If a Bill were passed on Second Stage it would have to then proceed through Committee and Final Stages in this House and then go to the Seanad where the Government have a comfortable majority.  Many of us, with some justification, are fearful that the Government would simply bury it and allow, through the passage of time, the slush fund to continue while the talk churned on in both these Houses.  That is why we felt that the most effective and easiest way to achieve the reform desired, the reform which the public are demanding, was by way of a motion.  We drafted a motion last week and sought to gain the support of other parties with some measure of success.  Later in the week the Leader of the Labour Party, Deputy Spring, wrote to the leaders of all the political parties, including the Taoiseach, because we felt that there was a moral obligation on that party to reform in this area.  It is important that the contents of that letter should be in the Official Report.  The Leader of the Labour Party wrote in the following terms to each of the party leaders:</P>
    <P>There is widespread agreement among the general public that there is a need for reform in the way in which the proceeds of the national lottery are administered.  I believe that there is also agreement among most, if not all, political parties about the principle of such reform (if not necessarily about the detailed method).  To that extent, the issue of accountable management of the lottery is an issue where party politics need not, and should not, intrude.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2417" /> For several days now efforts have been made to secure all-Party agreement about a proposal to reform the administration of the lottery.  The Labour Party Whip, Brendan Howlin TD, has been seeking support for the attached motion, which outlines a set of specific measures aimed at maintaining the fullest degree of confidence in the uses to which lottery money has been put.  We believe that it would be possible to secure all-Party agreement around a motion along these lines. More to the point, we had intended also to submit this motion to the Fianna Fáil Party, as we can see no reason why any Party can take exception to realistic proposals on these lines.</P>
    <P>In the event, it now appears possible that the issue will become one involving all-Party recrimination, rather than all-Party agreement.  That will do damage to the lottery, and to politics generally.  It is for that reason that I am writing to you (I will also be writing in similar vein to the other Party Leaders, including the Taoiseach) to attempt, even at this stage, to restore whatever degree of consensus can be found on the issue.</P>
    <P>If the Private Members Bill proceeds next week, we will be supporting it at Second Stage, because we are committed to the principle of reform. However, it does seem likely that such a Bill would find it difficult to emerge unscathed from the Parliamentary process, since each Party will have its own ideas about future methods of administration. It is my own view that the opportunity should be given to the Government of the day to provide the reassurance that the public needs that the lottery will always be managed in the interests of the whole community, by initiating (or accepting) a more accountable method of administration.</P>
    <P>I am therefore proposing that further acrimony and Party in-fighting on this issue should be avoided.  The most sensible way to do this would be for each Party to nominate a representative to a small working group which would advise the Government <Col N="2418" /> on ways and means to ensure efficient and accountable administration of the lottery in future.  The Government would then be in a position to promulgate a mechanism which would have all-Party support, and whose underlying purpose would be to ensure that the lottery will continue to have the widest possible level of public support.</P>
    <P>While I am offering the attached motion as representing the sort of approach that we would consider desirable, the Labour Party would approach the subject with an open mind.  The key issue for us is that those administering funds on behalf of the general public should always be seen to be accountable to the general public, and to be acting in the interests of the community as a whole.</P>
    <P>I hope that you will give this proposals your urgent consideration.  I will, as I said earlier, be writing to each Party Leader along similar lines.  In the interests of trying to secure all-Party agreement, I suggest that the matter should be dealt with on a private basis for the time being (although obviously, the opportunity to deal with this issue on an all-Party basis will be much smaller once debate on a Private Members Bill gets under way).</P>
    <P>Unfortunately the consensus did not emerge on co-sponsoring a joint motion but there are a few principles which need to be established.  The Labour Party were anxious that a set proportion of lottery money should be targeted in law for each of the areas to benefit, for example, youth, sport, arts and culture, the Irish language, health, tourism, local amenities and any other areas that might need support now.  In time of crisis some area might yield for the time being to other priority areas where there are life and death situations.  We sought to have accountability whereby there would be a mechanism for the elected Members of this House to question and ensure that lottery funds were directed properly and administered correctly.  The Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, has given a list of some of those who have benefited.</P>

The Minister of State misses the point.  We are talking about principles.  Maybe these are things on which the Minister and his Party do not dwell overlong.  Fundamental principles are at stake.  This is not about whether X or Y is the better.  There must be clear published guidelines and clear published objectives, defined recipients who should receive a defined percentage of money and specific channels through which the money should be issued.  In the area of sport the money should be issued through COSPOIR and in arts through the Arts Council.  We now have the crazy position where the same groups are applying to the national lottery and to the Arts Council and getting some money from each, with no overall control.  I will cite instances if the Minister is confused.</P>

      <P>Will he also confirm that two-thirds of those were given without previous application?  If that is the sort of fairness and scrutiny that the Minister of State has in mind I fear for public confidence in the national lottery and its future support.  There are other examples all over the country, but I do not want to trot them out for the entertainment of this House.  It is a fact that in a Limerick constituency there was a bidding match between two Ministers.  One Minister arrives at a meeting with an offer of X <Col N="2420" /> amount of money but was told that his constituency colleague, another Cabinet Minister, had offered twice as much.  He was told to go away and come back with more and he did so.  If that is the sort of gombeenism to which we want the national lottery to descend, we should carry on as if nothing is wrong.  If we are interested in having a principled mechanism for distributing resources, which are scarce enough in this country, then we must carry out the necessary reforms we are seeking tonight.</P>
      <P>I have said that we do not regard this Bill as ideal and that we in the Labour Party would do it in a different way if we had complete freedom of action in the matter.  Nevertheless the principles are clear and we will not shirk our responsibility to the people who are clamouring for reform in this area.  For that reason, when the Vote is called next Wednesday we will support this Bill on Second Stage, reserving the right to bring forward our own amendments subsequently.  We are afraid that the mechanism being followed by the Progressive Democrats in producing this Bill will give a shield to the Government who may drag out the legislative process in this House and the other House while they carry on their gombeen tactics, falling over one another in constituencies up and down the country handing out largesse.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. MacSharry)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very interesting having listened to this debate last night in another place and here tonight to find the spokespersons on behalf of Fine Gael and Labour both saying that they will be supporting this Bill on Second Stage but then will cut it to pieces in different ways on Committee Stage.  This means that at the end of the day there will be nothing left of the Progressive Democrats' proposed legislation. The purpose of the exercise is political opportunism.</P>
      <P>I would like to start by giving some of the background and outlining the development of the national lottery so far, to put the present debate in context.</P>
      <P>In 1984 the then Government decided to establish a national lottery, part of the proceeds of which would be allocated to the promotion of sport.  Following on that decision, an international firm of consultants was commissioned to advise on the appropriate form the lottery should take in this country.  It was decided that the lottery should be run by a company operating under licence, and that the lottery should be launched with an instant game, to be followed within a year by a Lotto game.</P>
      <P>The legislation to enable the lottery to proceed was introduced in the Dáil in June 1986 and came into force on 15 July 1986.  When the National Lottery Bill was introduced in the Dáil it did not, in its original form, specify the purposes for which lottery surpluses were to be applied.  The relevant section &mdash; section 5 &mdash; said only that the moneys were to be applied to such general purposes as the Government might determine and that these purposes should be published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i>.  It was also provided that the expenditure should be voted by the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2422" /> In the debate on the Bill, this section came in for a lot of criticism.  Deputies were worried that the lottery surplus would simply disappear into the Exchequer and that there would be no actual benefit to the areas, particularly sport, for which the lottery had been set up.  In response to this concern, the section was amended to its present form, which specifies that the funds shall be applied for the purposes of sport and other recreation, national culture, including the Irish language, the arts and the health of the community, and such other purposes as the Government may determine: any additional purposes that are included in the list are to be published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil.</i></P>
    <P>Since then, three items have been added to the list of eligible purposes: youth activities and amenity and welfare projects.  Lottery expenditure is clearly identifiable so everyone can see that the lottery funds are going to support these specific areas.</P>
    <P>The national lottery was launched on 23 March 1987 and was immediately a huge success.  It caught the imagination of the people of Ireland and right from the first day it was apparent that it would be far more successful than anyone had ever dreamt.  In the 1987 Revised Estimates Volume, we had included in the Vote for the Office of the Minister for Finance a subhead for the distribution of the national lottery surplus, in which we made provision for expenditure of £7 million.  I gave the House details of how this sum was to be allocated in reply to a parliamentary question on 12 May 1987. The breakdown was as follows: £3.14 million for youth and sports projects; £1.75 million for arts, culture and Irish language; £2.1 million for projects in the health area.</P>
    <P>As the year went by it became apparent that the amount raised would be far greater than the original £7 million. Towards the end of the year, in November 1987, we announced the allocation of a further £45 million to be spent in 1987 and 1988.  It was at this stage that we decided to add amenity and welfare projects to the eligible beneficiary areas.  The <Col N="2423" /> three purposes we have added &mdash; amenities, youth and welfare &mdash; complement the categories of sport and recreation and health which were listed in the original Act.</P>
    <P>Finally, in the context of the 1988 Estimates and budget, the Government decided that some services within the beneficiary areas, which had previously been financed directly from departmental votes, should henceforth be funded from the lottery surplus.  As a result of this decision, the following services, for example, are being funded from the lottery in 1988: the Cultural Relations Committee of the Department of Foreign Affairs, the grant-in-aid fund for cultural organisations operated by the Department of the Taoiseach; the scheme of grants to colleges providing courses in Irish, which is operated by the Department of Education; the scheme of grants to voluntary bodies operated by the Department of Social Welfare; and the Irish language publishing activities of the Department of Education.  The availability of lottery funding has meant that these services and others in the beneficiary areas could be maintained at a time when all public spending has been under intense scrutiny and even the most desirable programmes have had to be cut back.</P>
    <P>The total amount allocated by the Government from the lottery surplus so far amounts to £72.234 million, broken down as follows:</P>

    <P>The success of the national lottery has made possible an enormous expansion of the provision of sports and youth services and the development of new and improved sports facilities.  Similarly, in <Col N="2424" /> the areas of arts and culture and the Irish language, lottery funding is being used to maintain and expand existing services and to finance major new projects which otherwise would not have been possible. For example, £1 million has been allocated for an Irish Language Centre at University College, Galway, £500,000 towards the construction of a Gallery of Modern Art at the Royal Hospital, Kilmainham, and £1 million to finance the activities of the recently established National Heritage Council.</P>
    <P>In the health and welfare areas, the £10.85 million allocated from the lottery has made it possible to grant-aid a wide range of community and voluntary organisations engaged in caring for the elderly and the handicapped, which would not otherwise have been supported from public funds.  Money has also been allocated for community information and development services, for special services for children at risk, and for AIDS prevention programmes, with emphasis on special measures to minimise the spread of infection among intravenous drug abusers.</P>
    <P>I am very pleased that the Government have also been able to allocate £800,000 from the lottery for the relief of suffering caused by wars and natural disasters in developing countries.  These are only a few examples from the broad range of activities that have been supported by lottery funds.  I am confident that the vast majority of the people of the country are pleased at the success of the lottery and the way it has made it possible for the Government, even in the present difficult circumstances, to give practical support to local community initiatives as well as maintaining and expanding some services provided by central Government.</P>
    <P>Some people have criticised the way in which the various grant schemes have been operated.  In the first place, I would like to emphasise the enormous demand there is for all these schemes: thousands of applications have flooded in to the various Government Departments, most <Col N="2425" /> of them for projects that are highly desirable. The fact is that, even with the success of the lottery it is not possible to fund all of the applications.</P>
    <P>All grants funded by the lottery, and indeed all other expenditure of the lottery surplus, is subject to the same accounting procedures as all other Government expenditure.  The procedure that is followed is this: under section 8 of the National Lottery Act, 1986, the total proceeds of the sale of national lottery tickets, less the retail agents' commission and the smaller &ldquo;instant&rdquo; prizes which are paid by the retailer at the point of sale, are paid into the National Lottery Fund which is under my control.  Any amounts required to meet larger prize payments and the operating expenses of the lottery are paid out from the fund to the National Lottery Company.  The surplus remaining in the fund, after making provision for current and prospective liabilities, is available for transfer to the Exchequer, where it is brought in as non-tax revenue. It is my practice to bring in to the Exchequer only the amounts needed to cover expenditure on approved projects.</P>
    <P>Under section 5 of the National Lottery Act, the Government determine the general purposes for which lottery funds are to be used and the amounts to be devoted to each purpose.  Within those broad allocations the administration of the funds is primarily the responsibility of the Minister concerned.</P>
    <P>In 1987 and 1988, the Estimate voted by the Dáil for the Office of the Minister for Finance included a subhead entitled &ldquo;Fund for Distribution of the Surplus of the National Lottery&rdquo;.  A similar provision has been made in the 1989 Estimates recently published.  Since the spending programmes for which national lottery funds have been allocated are not within my Department's area of responsibility, the funds are issued from the Finance Vote to suspense accounts operated by the relevant spending Departments. The suspense accounts are audited, like all other Exchequer expenditure, by the Comptroller and Auditor General, who must be satisfied of the propriety of all transactions.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2426" /> The accounting officer of each Department or Office is responsible for the operation of the suspense accounts under his control.  Statements showing the operations on each suspense account are appended to each year's appropriation accounts.</P>
    <P>Each of the Ministers involved is responsible for the expenditure of lottery funds in his area and is answerable to the Dáil for it.  This is the system which Deputy Harney is now proposing to change, by means of the Bill which is now before the House.</P>
    <P>Though some people may criticise the decisions made by spending Ministers on the allocation of grants &mdash; and where demand so greatly exceeds supply, there are bound to be a great many disappointed people &mdash; the fact remains that it is entirely appropriate for Ministers with departmental responsibility for sport and recreation, the arts, the Irish language, health, youth, amenities and welfare, to make the detailed decisions about public expenditure in their areas &mdash; within the general outlines decided by Government.  As I have explained a moment ago, Ministers can be made to answer to the Dáil for their decisions.</P>
    <P>In considering Deputy Harney's proposal to change the existing system the House must bear in mind that the amounts of money involved are very large.  The surplus available to the Exchequer as a result of the first year's operations was over £40 million.  This year we expect a slight fall below this figure, since we will not repeat the phenomenal sales of the first few months when the lottery was a novelty; but more than £30 million will be realised this year, and this will increase in future years.  This is a great deal of money.  Deputy Harney proposes to entrust its allocation effectively to a board consisting of a chairman and four members, one member each representing the interests of sport, the arts, the Irish language, health and welfare. The chairman, she says, should be a judge or retired judge of the High Court.  I doubt the necessity of having a member of the Judiciary perform the <Col N="2427" /> essentially executive function of deciding on questions of public spending.</P>
    <P>Then we come to the four ordinary members of the board.  These would be selected by the Minister for Finance from three persons nominated by organisations representing each of the main beneficiary areas.  The procedures for nomination are yet to be determined and specified in regulations.  These four people would then have the power to decide on the allocation of lottery funds, subject to any general or specific directives they may be given by the Dáil.</P>
    <P>We would, therefore, have four individuals, each of them very familiar with one of the beneficiary areas and probably quite unfamiliar with the other areas, selecting which of a host of competing applicants for grants should be successful. It is clear that the representative of each area would have a very large influence on the allocation in his area.  It is hard, for example, to see the arts representative contradicting the recommendations of the health expert on the health area.  So each member of the board would have effective control of a fund of six or eight or ten million pounds.  I do not think it appropriate that unelected individuals should be given power to determine the spending of such large amounts of public money.</P>
    <P>The board members, one can assume, would be people prominent and active in the areas which they will represent.  They may be independent of the Government &mdash; though they will have been appointed by the Minister for Finance &mdash; but they would, by definition, be interested parties. How could they realistically be expected to be impartial?  The pressures on an individual who is answerable to no one and who has several million pounds in his gift would be well-nigh irresistible. The independence and impartiality which the Deputy seeks to establish for the board, by, for example, having a judge as the chairman, in reality, would be highly questionable.</P>
    <P>The board would, in effect, be accountable to no one.  The extraordinarily unwieldy system provided for in this Bill <Col N="2428" /> would operate like this: first, the Minister for Finance would propose a draft directive to the Dáil, outlining general or specific rules to be given to the board.  The board would then deliberate and, having regard to the rules laid down in the directive, would issue a certificate to the Minister for Finance setting out what payments he is to make and to whom. The Minister for Finance would then be obliged to comply with these requests within 14 days.  In certain restricted circumstances he might make a Ministerial order cancelling the certificate, on the grounds that it did not comply with the law or with the directives given by the Dáil, that it was not in the public interest, or that there was not enough lottery revenue available to cover the payments. Such an order could be rejected by the Dáil.  If the Dáil reinstated the board's certificate, the Minister would have no option but to comply.</P>
    <P>The normal prudent management of public money involves such principles as not issuing money until it is required. In this system the Minister for Finance would not be able to operate such controls, or indeed any controls; he would be simply a puppet obeying the instructions of the board.  The Minister, who would remain accountable to the Dáil for the proper and prudent use of lottery moneys, since they would still be a charge on the Finance Vote, would have no real control; while the board, which would have full effective control, would be answerable to no one.  The Bill would require the board to present an annual report to the Minister, who would then lay it before the Dáil; but there the board's responsibility would end.  No matter what decisions they might make, the board could not be made to answer to the Dáil for them.</P>
    <P>The effect of this would be that the Ministers with responsibility for national policy on sport, youth, the arts and the other areas, would have no say over the spending of large amounts of public money in those areas and the expenditure would be in the hands of a few powerful and interested individuals.</P>
    <P>Not that these individuals would be <Col N="2429" /> entirely without support.  The Bill provides that the board may appoint a secretary and other officers necessary for the performance of their duties, and that the costs and expenses of the board should be paid from the national lottery surplus. So, at a time when this Government, and most other Members of this House, are agreed on the imperative need to reduce public spending, and when the Government have taken active and imaginative steps to reduce the numbers of staff in the public service, in order to bring the huge and growing public service pay bill under control, the Deputy now proposes that we should set up another public service agency &mdash; with staff and premises and overhead costs &mdash; to perform a function which is already being performed at no extra cost by the staffs of Government Departments.</P>
    <P>I should now like to deal with a few points which were raised.  Deputy Noonan made several inaccurate remarks on which I should like to comment.  He is under the impression that this year's Estimates and public capital programme provide for an expenditure of £93 million of lottery revenue and that £55 million is provided for next year.  This is a basic misunderstanding.  This year's Estimates include £60 million for the distribution of national lottery surplus and £33 million of this is allocated for capital spending. The amount shown in the public capital programme is not additional to the amount voted in the Estimates but is the capital element of that amount.</P>
    <P>Similarly, the provision for the distribution of a national lottery surplus in 1989 is £40 million of which £15 million is provided for capital expenditure. Because Deputy Noonan completely misunderstood the figures, he thinks that the sales of national lottery tickets are showing a serious fall.  We anticipate that gross sales in 1988 will be at or above the 1987 level and that they will continue to improve in the coming years.  The reason for the drop in the 1989 provision below the 1988 level is that, in 1988, we had effectively two years' revenue to spend. The surplus of the national lottery in 1987 and the interest earned by the national <Col N="2430" /> lottery fund came to £42.1 million of which £10.815 million was spent in 1987. That left £31.3 million to be carried forward to 1988.  The 1989 Estimate does not, naturally, have the benefit of such a carry-over.</P>
    <P>Deputy Noonan does not seem to be aware of the present range of activities eligible for support from lottery funds. He referred to a Fine Gael policy document which proposed to make four new areas eligible for lottery funds.  These include three areas which are already eligible. Fine Gael want to give assistance to organisations catering for physically and mentally handicapped persons, to give grants for the provision of amenities to promote tourism and to assist special needs such as disaster relief.  We are already doing all these things.</P>
    <P>The allocation of funds we announced last November specifically mentioned that assistance would be given to organisations catering for the handicapped and providing funds for amenity grants.  The House will be aware that the Government have since allocated funds for disaster relief.  I might also mention, in relation to the Fine Gael proposals, although Deputy Noonan professes to dislike quangos &mdash; and one of his objections to the proposal of the Progressive Democrats is that they involve setting up a new quango to back up the board of trustees &mdash; his party are now proposing to set up two new bodies, a national youth board and a sports and recreation council.  Deputy Noonan criticised the Progressive Democrats' Bill in terms very similar to my criticism of it but he went on to signal that his party will support the Second Reading of the Bill.</P>
    <P>It is unique in my experience that a party which have expressed themselves as opposed to the broad purposes of a Bill, in the debate on the Second Reading, should then, flying in the face of all logic, vote for it.  This, I think, has been the essence of this whole exercise for quite some months.  The debate is an exercise in political opportunism on the part of all of the Opposition parties.  The <Col N="2431" /> procedures and controls, both on the operation of the lottery itself and the disbursements of the surplus, are those set out in the National Lottery Act, 1986, which was introduced by our predecessors. Yet far from welcoming the success of the lottery in generating funds for many worthwhile community-based initiatives throughout the length and breadth of the country which would not otherwise have got off the ground, they are undermining its future development through a series of baseless accusations. Not one person, either in this House or outside it, has claimed that projects which have received lottery funding were not entitled to or were not worthy of support under the grant conditions laid down.  I cannot emphasise this point too strongly.</P>
    <P>It is an inescapable fact that where the volume of grant applications is way above the funds available there must be many disappointed applicants.  This is true whether the deciding agency is a Government Minister or an independent agency. Decision making by an independent agency will not of itself soften the blow for a disappointed applicant.  Indeed the creation of an independent agency would deny disappointed applicants an avenue of redress which exists under existing arrangements, effective mediation on their behalf by their elected representatives. In this sense the draft Bill will diminish rather than enhance the sovereignty of the Dáil.</P>
    <P>There is much more that could be said about this Bill but suffice it to conclude as I started.  It is nothing but an exercise in political opportunism.  If one were to trace the events surrounding these proposed pieces of legislation or motions from different parties and the efforts that were made last week to get agreement, not on how things might change but agreement to defeat the Government in the Dáil, one would find that no other purpose is intended in this exercise here this week or next week.  When this matter was discussed by the Fine Gael Party a couple of weeks ago one of the first questions asked of them was if there was <Col N="2432" /> anybody there who would want to support the legislation as proposed by the Progressive Democrats but not one Deputy supported it then.</P>

      <P>What changed their minds is what I have said at the start and how I will conclude and that is the political opportunism of the parties here on this issue because they cannot, and are not in a position to, in any way find fault with the Government economic policies as they are being pursued.  Nor can they find any fault with the expenditure of over £70 million of lottery funding. I challenge everybody in this House, and particularly the members of Fine Gael, the Progressive Democrats, the Labour Party and others, to go around the country to the thousands of people, groups and organisations who have got grants and to bring back one example of one pound that was allocated by any source, Government or otherwise, that was or is being spent wrongly.  As I have said, not one Deputy has suggested this.</P>

The previous Government did not see any part of Ireland above a line from Dublin to Galway but at least this Government know that there is somewhere above that line and below it as well.  As far as the national lottery is concerned, I would like to say in conclusion that it will be successful this year and next year.  The Government of the day will continue to <Col N="2434" /> make allocations and the Ministers of that Government will continue to make decisions, whether they be Ministers from this side of the House as it is now or from that side of the House in the future.  Regardless of what political opportunism might show up next week I would not stand over a situation where one or two people, who found opinion polls going against them in the summer, jumped on a band wagon about lottery expenditure.</P>

      <P>So far as the allegation that we dreamed this matter up during the summer is concerned, I see that the Bill was ordered by Dáil Éireann to be printed on 18 May 1988.  That was when it got its First Reading.  It was introduced some time around the middle of April last which is approximately seven months ago.  This is not something that has been concocted in the last few weeks, months or anything like it.  It is a Bill that we have had ready for a very long time because the scandal that is going on is not of just recent origin.  Unfortunately, it has been going on for a very long time. The only difference is that, even with all the publicity that was given to it and so on, it does not seem to be abating or likely to abate.  That is a great pity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I listened very carefully to the Minister for Finance reading out lists of global figures tonight of amounts paid out under this, that and the other heading.  I have no doubt they are all correct and nobody disputes that £X million were paid out under such a heading and £Y million under another heading and all the rest of it, but that is just about where reality ends so far as the Minister for Finance is concerned or, indeed, so far as the Minister for Education in her speech last night is concerned.  Listening to the Minister for Finance tonight it was impossible to believe he was talking about this system going on in the same country that I see it going on in or in the same country where people are complaining from top <Col N="2436" /> to bottom and from one side of it to the other.</P>
    <P>It will be a matter of great interest to political sociologists who might come to examine some of the socio-political aspects of Irish life in years to come to read the provincial papers in particular and some of the national papers that have appeared in the past nine months.  It will certainly make interesting reading.  For example, I would suggest that if one wanted really to savour what things are like &mdash; and they are pretty different from the picture painted by the Minister for Finance &mdash; they get out the files of the <i>Limerick Leader</i>, preferably the country edition published on Thursdays because that is by far the more interesting one. This matter unfortunately, does not arise very much in the city or the city end of that county, but to read of the goings on in the western part of that county would certainly open your eyes to a remarkable situation that is a million miles from the scenario described here tonight by the Minister for Finance or by the Minister for Education last night where week after week two members of the Government are attacking each other about the disbursement of the lottery funds, where bemused members of the public and bemused recipients are giving interviews to the papers saying they are rather embarrassed by it all, that in many cases they had not made an application and were rather astounded to find a Minister descending on them with a cheque for funds they had made no formal application for.  This goes on week after week in that newspaper alone, and in some of the other and in cuttings I have seen from them, while it is not quite as exciting in other counties as it is in the western end of County Limerick, it is interesting.</P>

      <P>The position in Tipperary was so good that we had a spectacle on televisions recently of a senior Minister in this Government marching at the head of a band to celebrate the good news that was about to befall different parts of his constituency.  I thought, with a number of people, that it was rather fascinating in that there is apparently now an acceptance in some quarters that the disbursement of public moneys is to be regarded as an act of personal munificence by the distributor who applies his own subjective criteria which never have to include necessarily either need or merit.  It is gombeenism gone mad.  It evokes the unsavoury world of nods, winks and political backhanders.</P>
      <P>After 65 years of our independence the citizens of this country if they want to apply for public assistance for some project of public merit and value that they want to undertake are entitled to do that on the basis that as citizens of this country they have equal rights with any other citizens and they can go and look for something on the basis of the need of the project and the merit of the project.  They are entitled as Irish citizens under our Constitution not to have to act like 19th century peasants approaching a gombeen man with their cap in their hand virtually on their knees, begging and pleading as a favour to them from an omnipotent and omniscient TD that they should be entitled to some kind of financial assistance for some project that they and others are pursuing in their own locality. I had hoped we had put that sort of approach behind us, that we could deal with citizens on an equal and fair basis.</P>

      <P>It is a rather unique <Col N="2439" /> institution.  Let me give an example in regard to the arts and the position in the arts which is one of the main headings that are supposed to be assisted under these funds that have become available from the national lottery.  Over each of the last three years there have been cuts in the grant-in-aid to the Arts Council. The most substantial of the cuts was this year when it amounted to 13 per cent of the already reduced figure of last year. An assurance is given that the shortfall, and, indeed a great deal more, will be made up by funds that will be made available from the lottery.  What happens in practice is that the funds are not made available to the Arts Council, at all, and people whom the Arts Council are not able to help have then to go and besiege the Taoiseach's Department for assistance. They are then assessed, apparently by different criteria from those used by the Arts Council, and money may or may not be given to them.  It may be and sometimes is given to them in the teeth of policy decisions and advice of the Arts Council.  It seems crazy that we should be in this position.  In that situation the money should be given to the Arts Council and the Arts Council should then be allowed to disburse it in the best way for the arts generally, but that is not done.</P>
      <P>There was an interesting report in <i>The Irish Times</i> of last Saturday where the Arts Council indicated that they were extremely anxious to support touring theatre companies who need support because it is uneconomic to tour in this country due to the fact that many of the theatres outside Dublin are too small. Nineteen companies, no less, had applied for assistance to tour in the first six months of next year.  The Arts Council had to turn the whole lot of them down even though they are very anxious to assist them.  They are now told that they can go to the Taoiseach's Department. There is absolutley no sense or reason to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had, only today, a rather small Bill, the debate on which developed into a very interesting one.  It exhibited precisely the same syndrome as we have had <Col N="2440" /> exhibited by the Government at large in relation to trust funds which become available suddenly for distribution here. Instead of laying down the manner in which the sum of £2.75 million approximatley would be distributed, that Bill, as introduced here this morning, simply laid down that the Taoiseach would direct where the money was to be paid.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that there is a serious difficulty in this Government accepting that if one is distributing public moneys, whatever their source, whether it is taxation or otherwise, one has to do it according to certain rules and that if one does not there is a danger of considerable abuse, and if there is a danger of considerable abuse there is a danger of very considerable criticism.  That is the position the Government find themselves in today.  They are the authors of their own misfortunes.  It is not that they did not foresee that this was possible because it is interesting to see what the present Minister of State, Deputy Leydon, had to say in the debate on the National Lottery Bill, 1986 in this House, the one that we are now seeking to amend.  As reported at column 1782 of the Official Report for 1 July, 1986, the Minister said:</P>
    <P>A limit should be prescribed for the overheads of a company and we should be told how much will be allocated to sporting and cultural organisations. There should be a clear indication whether it is the intention to establish a representative body to administer the proceeds so that it will become clear that it will not be organised on a party political basis or that grants will not be awarded in a purely political way.  That would politicise the national lottery and would be detrimental to its success if it was clearly seen by the public that the funds which accrued would be used by the Government for party political reasons in the constituencies.</P>
    <P>I must compliment the Minister of State on his foresight because he painted, in July of 1986, a picture that was virtually a photograph of things as they were to be in this country in July 1988.  It is not <Col N="2441" /> everyone that has such incredibly accurate foresight as the Minister of State proved to have on that occasion.  He foresaw certain dangers.  He set out what they were, how undesirable they would be, the damage that they would do and so on, if that Bill was not amended in the way he suggested.  He was absolutely and totally correct under all headings.</P>
    <P>We suggest that the Act of 1986 be amended.  We are not hung up on the detail, as Deputy Harney has already made clear, of how that amendment might be made.  We have no hangups about the detail of it.  What we do want to do &mdash; and we have wanted to do it since last March or April when we published this Bill first &mdash; is to ensure that there is some independent decision-making power in regard to lottery funds and that there is some accountability. People object to the idea of a High Court judge which is one of the possible types of chairman that has been suggested here, and I can accept that.  I do not think a High Court judge is necessarily ideal for this at all.  We were very keen to try to give the public a confidence in this system that they do not have.</P>

      <P>A recent article was written by Dr. T. K. Whitaker on the national lottery, the way it has turned out, the difficulties and abuses and so on that have arisen and the ways to over-come them.  He suggested that perhaps, because the amount was now so big, it could be treated as ordinary revenue and that it should not be treated in this special way under this Act as it now is.  That is a point of view.  I am not sure that he is absolutely right, but at least it is a point of view.  Dr. T.K. Whitaker, for example, would be an ideal man to head up any kind of board of trustees or anything else to see that things were done fairly and to stop the scandalous abuse that is going on at present.  If all the various criteria and checks and balances have been complied with as the Minister for Finance suggests to us tonight and as the Minister for Education suggested last night, some <Col N="2442" /> officials in the Departments and some Ministers, for example, the Minister for the Environment, must have extraordinary powers of perception, given that they were able to allot funds from the lottery even to organisations that had not made application.  That amazes me when I hear from the Minister for Finance tonight that thousands and thousands of organisations apply and that many thousands naturally have to be disappointed. Of course they have, but it does seem remarkable that some of those who did not apply were not disappointed.  I wonder how the Government explains, for instance, the fact that up to last May, 15 of the 49 groups in Dublin county who received lottery grant approval from the Department of the Environment had not made any formal application for lottery assistance, and what an amazing coincidence it is, too, that of those 49 applications approved in Dublin no fewer than 26 of them should come from the Dublin North constituency of another Cabinet member, the Minister for Energy, Deputy Ray Burke.  The remarkable thing about it is that the Dublin North constituency, so far as my recollection goes, is the only three-seat constituency in Dublin under the present disposition; therefore it is the smallest constituency in Dublin and has the smallest population in Dublin.  Notwithstanding that, it gets more than half of the approvals in the entire Dublin region and more than ten other constituencies combined.  There are some amazing coincidences here surely, and some objective criteria have to be put forward to enable a careful examination to make sure that the applications approved are approved on the basis that they are fully examined before that approval is given.</P>

    <P>I was amazed to see in March of this year a letter received by Limerick County Council giving a long list of projects or grants which had been approved for payment under this lottery scheme for amenity grants and so on applicable to the Department of the Environment.  The information which was given to the county council was set out under a number of headings.  One of the headings <Col N="2443" /> concerned the people with whom the county council or anybody else who was interested should get in touch in connection with a grant.  In five cases the Department of the Environment were unable to say who the people involved were and put in that column, the words, &ldquo;ask Limerick County Council.&rdquo;  Limerick County Council were mystified and circulated their own members seeking the same information.  It seems to me that it is very hard, therefore, for either the Minister for Finance or the Minister for Education to urge that these projects and the criteria underlying them were properly and objectively examined and evaluated before decisions were made to pay grants under the lottery scheme to these various recipients.  I do not think that anybody in County Limerick, or in any other part of the country, is codded by that because they are amazed at what we might charitably call the rather subjective approach to the way these things are being done.</P>

      <P>The strike is at Clara vocational school, the one school in the area under the control of the County Offaly VEC in which there is a teacher in dispute.  A similar problem has arisen in the area of the North Tipperary VEC and for that reason I am prepared to share my time with Deputy Lowry who sought to raise that dispute on the Adjournment.  Is that in order?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>The pupils of Clara vocational school did not attend school today because of a one-day stoppage by the teachers.  The dispute concerns a teachers who was appointed to a permanent whole-time position at the school in September 1987, subject to the sanction of the Department of Education.  In the normal course of events that sanction would have been forthcoming by last Christmas but, presumably in anticipation of the new pupil-teacher ratio of 20:1, the appointment was not sanctioned.  The appointment of other teachers to permanent whole-time posts by VECs was not approved.</P>
      <P>In refusing to sanction the appointment the Department relied on a regulation which had not been the code of practice for a number of years.  I am referring to a regulation under which VECs have to seek sanction from the Department before the person appointed commences work.  In the summer the Department decided that teachers in this category could be accommodated within the revised teacher allocations for this school year within their VEC areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A County Dublin teacher in a similar position, Miss Irene Devitt, whose appointment as a permanent teacher had not been sanctioned by the Department, took a High Court action.  She had been offered a temporary whole-time appointment but, following the court action, her permanent appointment was sanctioned by the Department.  I accept that because there are many part-time and temporary whole-time teachers in County Dublin it was not that difficult for the local VEC to accommodate the teacher in dispute. The person at the centre of the dispute at Clara vocational school teaches Irish and history.  After interviews and so on she was appointed by the county VEC to the permanent post, subject to the sanction of the Department.  It is unfortunate that the number of pupils in the VEC area this year has reduced and <Col N="2445" /> because of that the VEC are finding it difficult to accommodate her within the quota system.  However, it is ironic that the only school to show an increase in the number of students is the Clara vocational school and that makes the appointment of this teacher all the more necessary.</P>
    <P>Apart from the technicality of the regulation invoked by the Department in relation to this appointment the more fundamental question of natural justice arises.  The reasonable expectation of that teacher was that her appointment by the VEC to the permanent post would be sanctioned by the Department, probably within two or three months of the date she commenced work.  It is unfair, and unacceptable, that this teacher should find herself in the same position as she was in September 1987.  The Department should accept that in a limited number of cases countrywide &mdash; I understand that a similar problem has arisen in Roscrea vocational school &mdash; the principle of natural justice should apply and that the teachers, not more than ten in all, should be made permanent.</P>
    <P>It is clear from the representations I have made to the relevant section in the Department that there is great difficulty in bringing this teacher within the quota specified in the regulations.  It is unfortunate that it was only as a result of the closure of the school today, and the threat of strike action in the future, that the Department have decided to send a principal officer and an assistant principal officer on Friday to meet officials of the VEC in an effort to sort out the problem. That should have been done a long time ago.  It is not right that at this stage in the school year the teachers should have to resort to this action.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the difficulties the officials of the Department have been faced with in trying to solve this problem.  As a member of Offaly VEC I am <i>au fait</i> with what has taken place since the start of the school year because the problem has been discussed at our monthly meetings. However, I understand that the revised teacher allocation has not been sent to Offaly VEC.  The Department, when <Col N="2446" /> sorting out a similar problem elsewhere, should have dealt with all cases referred to them.  If this dispute is not resolved in favour of the teacher she will be without a job.  We can argue about regulations and the interpretation of them for a long time but at the end of the day we will have to show some humanity.  Officials of the Department have been considering this issue for many weeks but a solution to the problem is not yet in sight.</P>
    <P>I am aware that the Minister has asked to be kept informed about the issue and has instructed her officials not to take any formal decision without her being notified.  I know also that the officials are anxious to adopt a flexible approach in trying to resolve this problem.</P>
    <P>However, quite frankly, this ongoing problem is going on far too long.  We need to resolve it.  It is unfortunate that parent representatives had to call to my door last Monday night to tell me that this strike would go ahead.  Personally, I was very disappointed that I had been unable to resolve the problem by the representations that had been made.  It is unfortunate that the one day strike today has brought this matter to a head.  Commonsense should prevail and I hope that the sympathetic hearing that I have got in the Department will lead to the matter being brought to a conclusion.  Let me add that the Minister has been very good to the school and has ensured that the extension of the school has progressed to the bill of quantity stage and this is as a result of the very supportive attitude she has taken to the representations that have been made by the parents' representatives, the school principal and local councillors in the area.  Could the Minister ensure that her officials apply themselves to resolving the matter without further delay in the interest of the students who attend that fine school which is increasing its pupil numbers all the time?  This is the only post primary school in Clara and I would like to see the matter resolved as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLowry" hpid="Mr. Lowry Mr. Lowry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>The problem which we have dealt with today is common to North Tipperary also and we have dealt with it <Col N="2447" /> on a joint basis.  The difficulty we have is that the Minister for Education has refused to sanction the permanent full time appointment of four teachers in Roscrea school.  This is a similar situation to that in Clara.</P>
      <P>The teachers involved are: Gabriel Quigley, an art teacher; Noel Spittal, a resource teacher for the mildly mentally handicapped; Ann MacDonald, a teacher of physics and computer studies; Kathleen Lane, a career guidance teacher.  These teachers were recommended for permanent whole-time appointment in September 1987, within the teacher allocation.  Each of these subject areas is now critical to provide a proper educational service in the scheme.</P>
      <P>Roscrea, with an intake of students from the Laois-Offaly area, has 480 students. Miss Gabriel Quigley is the only art teacher in the school and her appointment is absolutely essential.  If Miss Kathleen Lane and Mr. Noel Spittal are not appointed the school will be without career guidance and the special class will have to be discontinued.  In the case of Miss Ann MacDonald, it is vital that she is appointed because we have lost two physics teachers in the scheme since September 1988 and we will not be able to provide physics in the Roscrea or Nenagh schools.</P>
      <P>I would like to make the following points in reply to the Minister's response yesterday to my questions.  The Minister is hedging on the issue of allocations to the Roscrea and Clara schools.  The Department have known for the past two months the exact position in these vocational educational committees <i>vis-ávis</i> staff and finances.  The reply that I received is purely a smokescreen and an attempt to conceal procrastination and evasive action.  It is typical of the Department's behaviour in recent times and indicates a total disregard for the children, who are the victims of this apathy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The impact on the complete scheme has been enormous and the entire scheme has been severely dislocated by these events.  The teachers are frustrated because they cannot plan their year in <Col N="2448" /> the professional way required to guide students through examinations.  For example, in one of the vocational schools students were without a commerce teacher for five weeks at the beginning of the term.  In another, the principal and vice-principal are teaching almost full hours, which seriously affects school administration, discipline and staff relations.  None of the principals can plan timetables because they do not know what teachers will be available to them. They cannot authorise the purchase of much needed equipment because of financial shortages.  This can only be described as the deliberate victimisation of students in the vocational sector.</P>
    <P>Many of the schools have a depressed intake.  Social problems are in abundance. These schools should be getting the most immediate attention and consideration, and yet eight weeks after the school year has begun students in the VEC system in Clara and North Tipperary are experiencing an intense frustration which is affecting their educational performance.</P>
    <P>What has happened to the concept of equal opportunity in education which Donough O'Malley so boldly proposed in 1966?  The present Minister quite obviously is abusing the situation and is discriminating against an already under privileged sector of our community.  The result has been immense student hardship.</P>
    <P>The teacher in Clara and the four teachers in Roscrea have experienced 18 months of confusion, insecurity and hardship as a result of the Minister's refusal to sanction their posts.  Consequently, their professional standards have suffered. What right have this Government to impose this horrendous nightmare on people who are trying to do a much needed job of work?  The knock-on effect of this has been the revocation of the voluntary redundancies given to five teachers in North Tipperary, three of whom are school principals, who now find themselves back in school with all the pressures that involves.  They wished to retire and now the confidence and motivation of students, teachers and <Col N="2449" /> parents has taken a huge plunge.  Students in need of remedial assistance are getting less help than at any time in the past.  Is the Minister intent on increasing the rate of illiteracy of school leavers and reenforcing an already poor self image among these students?</P>
    <P>Let us have no more meetings but let us have action and results.  I ask the Minister to give Clara and North Tipperary their financial and teaching allocations.  I call on the Minister to sanction the four posts in Roscrea and the post in Clara immediately.</P>
    <P>A Cheann Comhairle, may I give the remaining minute to Deputy Charles Flanagan?</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to add my voice to that of my colleague, Deputy Cowen, on the situation that pertains in Clara at present.  I urge the Minister to look at this matter in a sympathetic light in the hope of resolving the problem.</P>
      <P>Clara Vocational School is one of the foremost schools in Counties Laois and Offaly.  In the light of the fact that County Offaly is unique in vocational education, I ask the Minister to take an urgent view of the situation in Clara.  Records in the Department of Education will show that there are more students in the vocational sector in County Offaly than in most other counties in Leinster and perhaps throughout the length and breadth of the country.  Therefore, it is quite important that each and every vocational school is looked at with the utmost seriousness.</P>
      <P>This teacher in Clara was one of 103 teachers in a similar situation.  My information is that some 98 of these 103 teachers have had their grievance solved.  I urge the Minister therefore to look sympathetically at the remaining five cases, one of which is in Clara.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The teachers in this school have taken the action they have taken today in the form of strike as the very last resort.  They felt, obviously, that they were not getting their grievance through to the Department and the decision to strike was not taken lightly, as I am sure my colleague Deputy Cowen will agree.  In the light of the strike that has taken place, I urge the <Col N="2450" /> Minister to sanction the appointment of this teacher in Clara.  Indeed, if the teacher is not to be sanctioned I ask that the reasons for such non-sanctioning be made clear at the earliest opportunity.  I urge the Minister to look at the personal circumstances of a teacher who cannot plan her future and cannot decide where she will be after Christmas, let alone over the next few years.  She cannot plan whether she will remain in Clara and remain part and parcel of the Offaly VEC, simply because of the temporary status that she has at present.</P>
    <P>Given the circumstances of the case, there is no reason that this teacher cannot be granted permanent status as a general teacher in Clara in the employ of Offaly VEC.  It is essential that this happens because if it does not we are undermining the entire teacher structure.  All teachers in Clara are of the opinion that this is a matter that should be resolved on humanitarian terms and I would urge the Minister to give favourable consideration to what both Deputy Cowen and myself have said here this evening in regard to Clara and similarly, so far as North Tipperary is concerned, to what my colleague Deputy Lowry has said.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. F. Fahey) Frank Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. F. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that the Deputies have raised these matters as it affords me an opportunity to clarify the position about the teaching staff allocations for VECs generally in 1988-89 and specifically the position in this regard and in regard to teacher appointments in the case of the County Offaly VEC and Tipperary North Riding VEC.</P>
      <P>I would like at the outset to outline the developments over the past two years in the staffing arrangements for post-primary schools.  In the context of their 1987 budget proposals the previous administration decided that posts of vice-principal and career guidance teachers would be brought within the quota in all post-primary schools as from the beginning of the 1987-88 school year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On assuming office, I decided that the question of the implementation of that latter measure should be reviewed.  The <Col N="2451" /> post of vice-principal had since 1983-84 been reckoned within quota in the smaller post-primary schools.  The Minister felt that on grounds of economy of scale, the extension of the arrangement to the larger post-primary schools, that is, those with enrolments of at least 250 pupils would be justified.  The post of guidance teacher in the larger schools was, however, a different matter.  The need for the services of a specialist guidance teacher in the larger post-primary schools is self-evident.  Because of this, the Minister decided that no change should be made in the status of the post of guidance teacher.  This post would continue to be reckoned as ex-quota in post-primary schools with enrolments of at least 500 pupils.</P>
    <P>When considering the 1988 provision for the pay of teachers in post-primary schools, it was necessary to look again at the staffing arrangements for those schools.  In terms of standards and range of ability of pupils catered for, whatever may have been the case before Fianna Fáil introduced post-primary education for all, nowadays the average post-primary school &mdash; whether it be vocational, secondary, community or compehensive &mdash; is catering for a wide range of ability levels.  Consequently I believe that the time has come to put second level schools on the same footing as regards pupil-teacher ratios and this is now being done with the introduction of a common pupil-teacher ratio of 20 to 1 as from the beginning of the 1988-89 school year.</P>
    <P>No change is being made in regard to the ex-quota positions of principal, and those of guidance teachers in schools with at least 500 recognised pupils, and posts as resource teachers established for the purpose of catering for the needs of mildly mentally handicapped pupils.</P>
    <P>A number of concessionary posts &mdash; 30.5 in all &mdash; were also allocated to VECs in respect of the needs of smaller vocational schools which were the only <Col N="2452" /> post-primary schools in their catchment areas.  Those posts were allocated by my Department on the basis of appeals from VECs and with particular reference to school size.  While full account was taken of their needs it was not found possible to make additional allocations to the two VECs in question under this heading.</P>
    <P>Both VECs have a number of disputed teacher appointments, two in County Offaly VEC and four in Tipperary North Riding.  I would like to explain that following a High Court judgment earlier this year in the case of a similar teacher appointed by the County Dublin VEC the Minister wrote to the two VECs concerned. The Minister advised them that, while she was satisfied as to the need for permanent appointments and on the distinct understanding that the appointments in question could be accommodated within the teaching staff allocations authorised for 1988-89, she would be prepared to sanction the appointments on a permanent basis.  Certain difficulties have arisen in accommodating these teachers within the teacher allocations.</P>
    <P>The Department are currently working to finalise the 1988-89 teacher allocation for Tipperary North Riding VEC and County Offaly VEC in the light of the most up to date information supplied by the committees about teacher numbers and pupil enrolments.  The Minister discussed the current difficulties with the Teachers' Union of Ireland with whom she had a very good meeting last Tuesday. She has also arranged for officials of her Department to meet with the chief executive officers of both VECs to discuss those matters further, and I am happy that everything that can be done is being done to ensure a satisfactory outcome in the current situation and to avoid the escalation of industrial action.</P>

      <P>I am, of course, aware that today marks the anniversary of Kristallnacht in 1938.  I am sure that all Deputies will join in the Deputy's reference to this as an outrage of anti-semitism.</P>
      <P>To turn to the separate question of the treatment of the Jewish community in the Soviet Union and the situation of those Jews who have been refused exit visas, these issues continue to be of concern to the Government.  It is encouraging that the number of exit visas granted so far this year is the highest since 1980 and that new emigration laws are at present under consideration which should lead to further increases in the future.  We hope to see further progress in this area.  I continue to believe that the most appropriate and effective framework in which to voice our concern about Soviet policy in this area remains the meetings held within the context of the follow-up to the CSCE.  The Irish delegation has used the opportunities offered by the follow-up meeting which has been taking place in Vienna since November 1986 to draw attention to the public and parliamentary concern in Ireland about the situation of Jews in the Soviet Union.  Together with our partners in the Twelve, we have put forward proposals on freedom of religion, on the right to leave one's country and on the prevention of the abuse of national security grounds for restricting travel.  I expect that the Concluding Document of the Vienna Meeting will include increased commitments on the part of all CSCE participating states including the Soviet Union in these areas.</P>

      <P>Successive Irish Governments <Col N="2285" /> have made repeated calls to the South African Government to release Nelson Mandela.  I welcome the opportunity Deputy Taylor's question affords me to appeal once again to South Africa immediately and unconditionally to release Nelson Mandela and all other political prisoners and to seize the opportunity this would afford to initiate meaningful dialogue towards achieving to truly democratic and multi-racial South Africa.</P>
      <P>Nelson Mandela has now spent over a quarter of a century in jail for his committed stand against apartheid.  His continued imprisonment is a constant reminder of the ongoing denial of basic human rights to the majority population in South Africa.</P>
      <P>Ireland, together with her partners in the Twelve, has called on numerous occasions for the immediate and unconditional release of Nelson Mandela as a necessary first step towards creating conditions for genuine dialogue in South Africa.  This position was reiterated by the Heads of Government of the Twelve at the European Council in Hanover in June and by Foreign Ministers of the Twelve in their statement on the occasion of Nelson Mandela's 70th birthday.

This was repeated by the Taoiseach in his joint statement with Prime Minister Hawke of Australia and Prime Minister Lange of New Zealand during the Taoiseach's official visit to these countries in July.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>More recently, during my statement to the General Assembly of the United Nations on 29 September, I again called on the South African Government to take steps to dismantle the system of apartheid, starting with the release of all political prisoners, including Nelson <Col N="2286" /> Mandela.  A similar appeal was made by the Foreign Minister of Greece on behalf of the Twelve when he spoke to the General Assembly on 27 September.</P>

      <P>The Government view with grave concern the allegations that chemical weapons were used in the course of the military offensive which gave rise to large flows of Kurdish refugees from Iraq into Turkey in August-September of this year.  While the facts with respect to the allegations made in this instance have not been impartially established, our position condemning the use of chemical weapons is clearly on the record.</P>
      <P>In mid-September, a mission dispatched by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees reported positively on the efforts put in place by the Turkish Government to provide for the immediate needs of 50,000 Kurdish refugees.  Turkey subsequently appealed to the European Community and to the member states for financial support for the provision of winter shelters for the refugees and for offers to receive refugees. Ireland welcomes the provision of the sum of 500,000 ECU (IR £375,000 approximately) from the Community budget to the refugees through the Turkish Red Crescent Society.  Turkey estimates that, by mid-October, some 2,300 Kurdish refugees had returned to Iraq under the terms of an amnesty decreed by the Iraqi authorities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 22 and 45 together.  Brian Keenan, a native of Belfast, has been missing in Beirut since 11 April 1986 when he failed to appear for classes at the American University.  To date no group has claimed responsibility for his abduction.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that I am not in a position to detail all the efforts which have been made to locate Mr. Keenan.  However I can tell the House that during the past six months my Department has repeatedly been in contact with all parties in the region that might be able to provide assistance.</P>
      <P>As already stated in the Taoiseach's reply of 21 June, the Taoiseach met the Iranian Foreign Minister Dr. Velayati in New York on the 2 June and discussed the case of Brian Keenan with him.  Dr. Velayati undertook to have inquiries made on our behalf.</P>
      <P>I subsequently met Dr. Velayati on 29 September, during my visit to the United Nations and raised the matter with him. He assured me that his Government would continue their efforts to find out about Mr. Keenan.  I met the Iranian Ambassador on 17 October and he confirmed to me that the Iranian authorities were following all avenues of inquiry in this case.</P>
      <P>Our Ambassador in Baghdad who is accredited also to the Lebanon made one of his regular visits to Beirut in October where he pursued our concerns in regard to Mr. Keenan with members and officials of the Lebanese Government and leaders of various Muslim groups.  In addition the Ambassador discussed Mr. Keenan's case with his colleagues among the Twelve who are also directly concerned with various hostage cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2288" /> Unfortunately, notwithstanding these inquiries, we have received no new information on Mr. Keenan's welfare or whereabouts.  However, I can assure the Deputy that this matter will continue to receive my personal attention until Mr. Keenan is freed.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 23 and 57 together.</P>
      <P>Ireland's fishery limits extend to a 200 mile zone around the coast, an area governed by the Common Fisheries Policy.</P>
      <P>Ireland's national control over foreign vessels however ends at the 12 mile limit of our territorial waters.  Within these limits foreign vessels are entitled to exercise the rights of innocent passage.  All submarines must identify themselves and travel on the surface when exercising these rights.</P>
      <P>Beyond our territorial waters are international waters to which all nations have free access under international law.  It would not be realistic to expect that nations would voluntarily surrender their rights in international waters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, the Government has taken action in relation to the safety of Irish vessels at sea, and particularly in the seas surrounding Ireland, which has been a <Col N="2289" /> matter of particular concern.  An initiative which we sponsored at the International Maritime Organization (IMO) aimed at focusing attention on the problems posed to fishermen by submarine traffic, resulted in the unanimous adoption by the General Assembly of the IMO of a resolution entitled Avoidance by Submerged Submarines Of Fishing Vessels and Their Fishing Gear.  It is our hope that this Resolution will make a significant contribution to the avoidance of incidents involving surface vessels and submerged submarines at sea.</P>

      <P>In order to avoid duplication and increase efficiency, the Government have in recent years had under review the services being provided by the Office of Public Works for other Government Departments.  As a result of this review, a number of services have been transferred from OPW to the relevant Departments.</P>
      <P>In the case of the Department of Foreign Affairs responsibility for maintenance work and for premises overseas has been transferred to that Department from the Office of Public Works with effect from 1 January 1989.</P>
      <P>As a consequence the amount provided in the 1989 Estimates for my Department in respect of expenses on official premises includes £3,320,000 transferred from the Vote for Public Works and Buildings in respect of contract maintenance at home and abroad and rents on overseas properties. Rents on my Department's accommodation within the State will continue to be the responsibility of the Office of Public Works.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no intention on the Government's part to eliminate the grant-in-aid fund for bilateral or other aid contributions for developing countries.  The Government considers bilateral assistance an important and effective means of channelling aid to developing countries. The amount provided for bilateral aid this year is not only sufficient to meet all <Col N="2291" /> our commitments but in addition sufficient to maintain the basic framework for expansion when economic circumstances permit us to do so.</P>

      <P>Development education is a very important element in our development co-operation programme. Development education activities in the formal education sector and among the development non-governmental organisations (NGOS) and other agencies will continue to be encouraged and supported by my Department.</P>
      <P>In order to provide professional advice and assistance to organisations involved in development education and to facilitate the introduction of development education activities into the formal education sector my Department have financed the establishment of the development education support centre (DESC).  It is based at St. Patrick's College in Dublin with a regional office in Limerick.  My Department have also supported a resource centre at University College Dublin.  The allocation of grants for the provision of development education in the formal education system is carried out by a broadly based committee with administrative support provided by Higher Education for Development Co-operation (HEDCO).  Grants to Development NGOS and other organisations are administered directly by my Department.  Among the organisations assisted have been the World Education Project in Sligo, Comhlamh, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions (ICTU), Trocaire and the National Federation of Youth Clubs.  Funding has also been provided for the RTE radio programme &ldquo;Worlds Apart&rdquo; and other mass media activities.  Information material on Irish official development assistance including an annual report is published by my Department.</P>
      <P>In 1987 the sum of £632,850 was spent in this area and £450,000 is expected to be spent this year.</P>

The trade unions which represent the grades of higher tax officer, tax officer and clerical assistant in the Office of the Chief Inspector of Taxes have refused, as a matter of policy, to allow their members to do the work allocations of non-replaced officers.  The total number of work allocations that presently remains unworked represents three posts of tax officer and seven posts of departmental clerical assistant.  In most tax offices the problem has been resolved by local negotiations.  The Revenue Commissioners are making every effort to resolve the problem in the remaining tax offices.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 73, 74 and 75 together.</P>
      <P>The systematic collection of data on the numbers of all species of fauna found in Ireland has not been undertaken. However data on some species is available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the population sizes of individual species, the critical factors are the general status nationally of any population and the degree to which any existing threats may adversely affect that status.  Precise censusing for all species is not therefore generally undertaken. <Col N="2303" /> However, for species which are regarded as threatened or in danger of extinction or for which Ireland has a special responsibility, precise censusing and monitoring programmes are carried out, the nature of which will vary according to the species concerned.  For example, Ireland's four species of geese, Brent, Barnacle, Greylag and Greenland WhiteFronted, are censused regularly by co-ordinated field surveys throughout their ranges.  National population data are available for these species for some periods and I have arranged for this information to be forwarded to the Deputy in due course.</P>
    <P>The conservation of any species is based on two main strategies, namely, the regulation of exploitation and the protection of habitats.  Exploitation is regulated under the Wildlife Act, 1976 through the fixing of open seasons for shooting and regulation and monitoring of the trade in these species.  The regulations are enforced by a corps of wildlife officers.  There is a complete ban on the taking of some species.  Protection of habitat is effected within the general policy objectives of the creation of a network of protected areas representative of all ecosystems found in the country.</P>
    <P>No precise statistics are available for the remaining species listed by the Deputy but I am satisfied that there is no threat of extinction to any of these species.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2304" /> The conservation of fish stocks is a matter for the Department of the Marine.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>In the context of the realisation of the Internal Market the Commission of the European Communities has proposed a general strategy for veterinary controls.  The strategy is designed to achieve a uniformly high standard of health and hygiene in all member states before 1993 so as to reduce the risk attached to movement of animals and animal products.  I fully support that approach and will be pressing for effective action to be taken in relation to the major diseases affecting livestock in the Community.</P>
      <P>The strategy also contains a proposal to discontinue veterinary controls at the internal frontiers of the Community and to substitute a system of controls which would operate at the point of origin of the animals, or products, and which would permit subsequent spot checks.  I have some misgivings about this proposal and I will aim to ensure that the measures adopted afford the necessary safeguards against the dissemination of disease.</P>

      <P>The unemployment assistance claim of the person concerned was disallowed with effect from 24 July 1987, on the grounds that his means derived from the profit from his holding exceeded the statutory limit in his case.  He appealed against the decision and an appeals officer assessed him with means of £75 weekly with effect from 24 July 1987.  This assessment exceeded the maximum weekly rate of unemployment assistance of £72.20 payable to him at that time.</P>
      <P>He made a further claim for unemployment assistance in March 1988 and his claim was referred to a social welfare officer for investigation.  The inquiries, which have proved to be protracted, are expected to be completed shortly.  His case will then be submitted without delay to a deciding officer for assessment of means.  His entitlement to unemployment assistance will be reviewed in the light of this assessment.</P>
      <P>Following the general increase in unemployment assistance rates on 20 July 1988, he became eligible for payment of unemployment assistance of £3.30 weekly being the appropriate maximum rate payable in his case of £78.30, less means of £75.  Due to an oversight this payment was not made.  Arrangements are being made to have the correct payment, including outstanding arrears, made this week.  The inconvenience caused is regretted.</P>

      <P>The person concerned who is a Dutch national was in receipt of unemployment benefit at Kenmare Employment Exchange Office from 5 October 1987 to 6 December 1987 when she returned to the Netherlands.  Before her departure, she requested that payment of benefit be transferred to the Netherlands in accordance with the provisions of EC Regulations governing the social security entitlements of migrant workers.  The applicant's form was sent to the Dutch social security service on 17 December 1987 authorising them to pay benefit to her for a period of up to three months.</P>
      <P>She returned to this country in January 1988 and again claimed unemployment benefit at Kenmare office from 6 January 1988.  Payment was made to her with effect from that date until 4 September. She is currently in receipt of maternity allowance at the weekly rate of £43.60.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been confirmed from the Dutch authorities that the person concerned had registered as unemployed in the Netherlands from 7 December 1987 to 2 January 1988 but no payment had been made to her in respect of that period.

    <P>The low number of prosecutions taken by local authorities is a relfection of the range of other powers available to them under the Water Pollution Act to deal with pollution and to ensure that it does not recur.  In 1987 local authorities issued over 800 notices under section 12 of the Act requiring specified measures to be taken to prevent or control pollution of waters.  In addition, authorities issued more than 4,000 advice/warning letters.</P>
    <P>The significant increase in the number of legal cases taken in 1987 indicates a positive response by authorities to my request last year that they make full use of their powers to prosecute pollution offenders and to have remedial measure taken at the polluters' expense.</P>
    <P>In so far as waste management legislation is concerned, the information requested by the Deputy is not available for the years 1986 and 1987, except for the Litter Act, 1982.  The number of legal cases initiated by local authorities under that Act is as follows:</P>

      <P>The determinants of sectoral employment levels, particularly projected levels, are complex.  The major determinants would include the demand, actual and potential, for the products of the sector, the related levels of output and the methods of production.  Consequently, the first stage in any study of the employment impact of the completion of the internal market for a given sector is to examine the market for the sector's products and the resulting level of output.  The undertaking of such sectoral studies is a matter for individual Ministers and their Department as part of their responsibility for sectoral development policies.</P>
      <P>In my replies to the Deputy of 27 October 1988, I gave examples of sectoral studies now under way in the Department of Industry and Commerce.  As the results of these studies become available, my Department and FÁS will consider their implications for our training and other activities.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2329" /> The Safety, Health and Welfare (Offshore Installations) Act, 1987, requires the making of statutory regulations to bring it into force.  Detailed regulations relating to various specific aspects of workers' safety are in preparation.  The aim is to have them in force in time for next year's drilling season.  The position of the workers on the offshore installations is safeguarded meanwhile by a condition in the offshore operator's licence requiring compliance with directions from the Department of Labour for securing the safety, health and welfare of the workers.  The current directions are contained in the code of <i>Safety Instructions for Offshore Petroleum Operations</i> issued in 1983.</P>
    <P>Part II of the Dangerous Substances Act has not been brought into force.  This particular part deals with explosives.  As explosives were already controlled under special legislation administered by the Minister for Justice, Part II was excluded from the Commencement Order for the Dangerous Substances Act.</P>

      <P>The Medical Council is an independent statutory body established under the provisions of section 6 of the Medical Practitioners Act, 1978.  The council is statutorily obliged to establish and maintain the General Register of Medical Practitioners and to satisfy itself as to the adequacy of the qualifications and fitness to practise of persons applying for entry <Col N="2330" /> to the register.  Section 27 of the Act specifies the categories of persons entitled to be registered on payment of the appropriate fee.  There are four main categories of persons entitled to full registration including the category with which the Deputy is concerned, that is, persons who can satisfy the council as to the adequacy of their training in accordance with the provisions of section 27 (2) (d) of the Act.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the problem to which the Deputy refers.  However, as the Deputy has indicated in his question, the making of rules under section 27 (2) (d) is a matter for the council.  I have no statutory role in the making of such rules. I understand from the Medical Council that this subsection is currently the subject of proceedings before the High Court and in these circumstances, it would not be appropriate for me to comment on the matter at this time.</P>
