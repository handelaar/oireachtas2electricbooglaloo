      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the first time I was accused in this chamber of reluctance of any kind.  The combination of the words &ldquo;design and construction&rdquo; gives the impression that those activities are identical and that might lead to confusion over responsibilities between a designer and a builder.  Two separate functions are involved.  They have implications in planning laws which are about the design of a building rather than the execution of design, the specific construction which is covered by by-laws and building control <Col N="823" /> regulations.  It seems to me that in principle the two, because of their fundamentally different definitions, should not be incorporated as if they mean the same thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn) Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputies will realise that these matters were discussed on another occasion when we were on different sides of the House.  They were dealt with by a special committee of the House and I thought that they had been disposed of to everybody's satisfaction by that special committee.  I should like to say that the words &ldquo;design and construction&rdquo; are interlinked in the science and art of building and it would be wrong to divide them. The words &ldquo;design and construction&rdquo; are included in the definition section mainly for the purposes of section 3 (1) (a). Section 3 is the enabling section for the making of building regulations.  Building regulations will of necessity influence the design of a building and it could be argued that if the word &ldquo;design&rdquo; is not included then the regulations which influence the design of a building are <i>ultra vires</i>.  Also, if the word &ldquo;design&rdquo; is excluded there could be doubts about a designer's responsibility for faulty construction work if an enforcement notice under section 7 is issued or there could be doubts about the powers of the authorised inspector under section 10 to require information from a designer. There could be doubts about proceedings taken by a building control authority against a designer pursuant to section 15. For those reasons I am strongly opposed to omitting the words &ldquo;design and&rdquo;, as proposed by the Deputies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>We should realise that a lot of time has elapsed since the Second Stage of the Bill was debated.  There is striking evidence of that time lapse in the number of amendments tabled by the Minister.  We should not fool ourselves into thinking that we have moved speedily from a consensus on Second Stage to the detailed debate on Committee Stage. The thinking behind the amendment, <Col N="824" /> which runs into section 6 which deals with the certification of buildings, is in regard to the liability and responsibility that would fall upon either the designer of a building or the contractor.  The Minister should delete the words &ldquo;design and&rdquo;, and perhaps, insert a new definition of design.</P>
      <P>It is important that we should be discussing this.  There are two distinct activites relating to building regulations and the Bill proposes to give a legal effect to them.  The first is the design of a building in formal and strict concurrence with the standard of performance specification set out in the building regulations.  That is the responsibility of the design team.  In many cases that responsibility and the team's involvement in the project may end at the point where a set of contract documents are handed over to a building contractor.  A different person may be brought in by the contractor, for whatever reason.  With the agreement of the client a contractor may decide to proceed without any further professional involvement by the design team.  The construction of the building is the responsibility of the contractor.  If the designer is not the original designer or the original design team and does not continue to be involved in the project they cannot be held liable or responsible for the way in which the building was done if the contractor on his own behalf, or on the instructions of a client, decides to omit certain types of building activity which would be required by the building regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That, in essence, is the thinking behind the desire to separate the definition of &ldquo;construction&rdquo; and the definition of &ldquo;design&rdquo;.  I admit that the amendment, which is in my name and also in the name of Deputy Keating, simply addresses one half of the problem by allowing design as we are proposing in this amendment.  We end up with a fairly precise definition of what construction entails but we have no definition of what design entails.  I would ask the Minister to come up with a new definition of &ldquo;design&rdquo; on Report Stage. I do not think there should be any conflict on this matter.  The logic of what I am <Col N="825" /> saying will become far more apparent when we get down to the meat of this Bill; in fact, the meat is not in this Bill but rather in the regulations.  It is rather like Hamlet without the prince.  After two years I would have thought the Minister would have been able to find the prince. Clearly he has not.  This Committee Stage debate will be haunted by that absence because we do not really know what we are giving effect to.  Unless the Minister will be in a position later to elaborate upon this we will have difficulties.</P>
    <P>The difficulties will be compounded in the absence of seeing the form of the certificate if design is inextricably linked up with construction.  As stated in the Bill &ldquo;design and construction&rdquo; includes the execution of works in connection with building and any act or operation necessary for or related to the construction, extension, alteration, repair or renewal of a building.  At the core of my objection is the outrageous price that will be charged for professional liability by any insurance company to underwrite the degree of exposure that a designer of a building would have if that clause would be the clause of definition to be read out by the plaintiff's counsel in a court of law following any kind of defect in the building.  He simply would not be able to practise in the design profession in this country with an insurance certificate if that is the degree of exposure that a designer would be open to because of the reasons I have stated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I would also like to express reservations on this proposal but I would not like to see the proposal deleted.  Recently plans were drawn up for a substantial factory in my own constituency. Planning permission was granted and the person who designed it is no longer involved in the development of the construction.  Somebody else is now involved.  Can the Minister say if the original designer is the person who should carry the can?  I would ask the Minister to consider what is being asked of him here and to take into consideration that if this proposal becomes law there will be serious problems for people in obtaining <Col N="826" /> insurance, and we all know what that costs at present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Although we have not got to the sections which are specifically related to the heart of the Bill, nevertheless we have come to the heart of the issue that is the whole background to this Bill.  This Bill is attempting to privatise building controls and to hand over to designers and architects etc. the right to certify whether a particular building has been properly built or designed. The reality is that, while the designers and the architects are anxious to get their hands on the business of certifying, they are not anxious to take on board the liability which that will carry.  The proposal to delete &ldquo;design&rdquo; is specifically related to that issue.  That is why I said earlier I was surprised that the proposers of the amendment were not prepared initially to indicate why they were proposing it.  For that very reason I oppose the deletion of &ldquo;design&rdquo; from this definition.</P>
      <P>If you read the definition the amendment makes no sense at all.  The definition states that:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;design and construction&rdquo; includes the execution of works in connection with buildings and any act or operation necessary for or related to the construction, extension, alteration, repair or renewal of a building;</P>
      <P>If you delete the word &ldquo;design&rdquo; and read the section it makes sense; if you delete the word &ldquo;construction&rdquo; the definition equally makes sense; the two together make sense.  If the Deputies who are seeking an amendment had put alongside it another amendment which defined &ldquo;design&rdquo; then I would have some respect for what they are proposing to do.  It seems to me that they are attempting to delete the responsibility of designers and architects from the definition of who is responsible for the construction of buildings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I have to say Deputy Quinn is right when he says that the regulations are the important thing.  What we are <Col N="827" /> principally concerned with here is the health and safety of people in and about buildings.  I hope there will not be that much conflict because it should be noncontroversial. We are just trying to do the right thing in so far as those two items are concerned.  The regulations will be important and will be open to be considered or annulled here.  That is the normal practice with regulations.</P>
      <P>We are not setting out to give a definition of &ldquo;design&rdquo; or &ldquo;construction&rdquo;.  That is not what is intended in that opening interpretation.  Design is an important and fundamental aspect of the Bill.  If design were removed from the Bill it could in certain circumstances cast doubt on the ability to introduce, say, a fire safety certificate which would be provided for by the building control authority in relation to part of the building regulations.  It would be based on the submission of the plans by the designer. It would be wrong to provide a situation whereby a building control authority in some way could not in circumstances issue a fire safety certificate.  It would leave a gap in it that would make a nonsense of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The concern expressed in relation to the separate functions of a designer on the one hand and those involved in construction on the other can best be dealt with in the context of the control system which will operate under section 6 of the legislation.  I would envisage that provisions will be made for the furnishing of different types of certificates of compliance in the building control regulations. One type of certificate would be lodged by the designer and another relevant certificate, in relation to a completed building, by either the builder or some other person who may be an approved certifier.  I do not see where the difficulty arises in having this agreed as suggested by me.  I could not contemplate accepting the amendment as suggested by some of the Deputies because it would make nonsense of the whole thing and it would deprive us of getting information from a designer subsequent to cases being taken and that would weaken the whole <Col N="828" /> question of control.  I do not think that is what the Deputies want.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept some of what the Minister says but, nevertheless, there is a difficulty.  I want to put Deputy De Rossa at ease lest he might interpret or impute, at this early hour of the morning on a fairly technical Bill, the whiff of ideology into what is being proposed here, which does not arise.  The facts are that the term &ldquo;design&rdquo; and &ldquo;construction&rdquo; are two different things.  It is no more complex than that.  To globalise them and to pretend that they are synonymous with each other is not in accordance with the facts.  There are cases where designs have been drawn up for a building and never executed but which subsequently became part of, for example, the corporate assets of a company to be executed perhaps one year or ten years later by a building firm or a contractor who may have no connection whatsoever with the designer.  Because of the way this Bill is being put forward they find themselves lumped together for the purposes of controls and responsibility.  I would be quite happy if the two words were defined separately in the Bill.  I am not looking for any diminution of the Minister's control but it will lead to unnecessary confusion to have both words construed as if they are similar in meaning.</P>
      <P>I understand that what is being proposed here, the vesting of certain forms of certification in what Deputy De Rossa would call private hands, is unique in Europe.  In the normal course of events in other countries the state retains this control.  I do not see any problem with this provided the overall control remains with the State.  That is what this Bill is all about.  There is nothing wrong with our utilising the expertise available to us in the community to do the work that is necessary for the common good provided the Government do not hand over lock, stock and barrel that responsibility.  As I understand it that is not what is being proposed here but it is unique in the European context.</P>

      <Col N="829" /> I am not going to delay the House unduly as I have made my point.  I would be grateful if the Minister would consider before Report Stage including a separate definition for the word &ldquo;design&rdquo;.  I will be satisfied if he does so.</P>

      <P>In relation to what the Deputy said, and I will also make reference to what Deputy De Rossa has said, while I am not interested in getting into any ideological arguments, I take the point.  No group should be in a position where they could opt out of their responsibilities.  I am not prepared to concede that.  Everyone, be they designers, builders or contractors, must accept their responsibilities and to remove any one group would be irresponsible.  I take Deputy De Rossa's point on that.</P>

I give notice that on Report Stage we will submit an amendment which would propose in essence to insert separate definitions for the words &ldquo;design&rdquo; and &ldquo;construction&rdquo; which I think would be a better way of dealing with this problem from a procedural point of view.  The arguments which have been made have not been refuted.  There is a need for clear and distinct definitions of both the activities of construction and design.

      <P>Traditionally the building control authorities in this country have been the local authorities.  The only building controls in place are what are known as by-laws.  I am subject to correction but I think that only about five or six local authorities throughout the country have a statutory responsibility.  There is no requirement in a vast geographical area to submit legal documentation on the standard of construction.  Not wishing to be argumentative, I must say however that the reason this very controversial legislation has been stalled for such a long time is because we have not been able to agree on a system of administration.  I do not think anyone in this House would disagree with the proposition that the ideal form of administration is the one administered by a local authority such as <Col N="831" /> Dublin Corporation or Dublin County Council.  We should recognise in the debate we will have on this legislation that that is the ideal but that we are derogating from that for a variety of reasons.  The most obvious reason for this is cost and this is being compounded by the severe cutbacks in staff and shortages in local authorities.  I am not going to get into the politics of that debate, but whatever the strength of argument back in 1981 or 1982 it has been substantially compounded by the reductions in staffing levels in local authorities.</P>
      <P>In his comprehensive review of this Bill, and particularly this section, has the Minister considered allowing local authorities to retain the option of building control administration?  In other words, instead of a developer or an architect going down the self certification route they would have the alternative option of going to a local authority or a combination of local authorities as provided for in subsection (5) of this section to get a certificate to the effect that the design complies with the building regulations. Let me elaborate on that point.  In the administration of other local government functions we have a combination of local authorities for the purposes of efficiency and administration.  In some cases we have joint county managers and the provision of joint services.  In the smaller local authorities the cost would not be justified by the level of demand, even allowing for the fact that fees have to be paid for by-law approval.  Has the Minister given any thought to the idea that a group of local authorities, perhaps those in the seven regions which have been formed so as to avail of EC Structural Funds, could join together to provide a building inspection unit using their own staff resources so as to offer an alternative to self-certification for someone who cannot get professional indemnity insurance and that that group of local authorities would be able to perform the functions, for example, currently performed by those authorities who administer by-laws at present?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="832" />
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will understand, the certificates are dealt with under section 6 and the point he has made is dealt with in section 5, which provides for co-operation between local authorities, adjacent or otherwise.  That is provided for, but implementing this is another matter.  It is important that legislation would include that option which could be taken now or later if the need arose.  That matter is dealt with in section 5 and I presume it will be raised by the Deputy again when we come to deal with that section.</P>
      <P>This section provides for the establishment of building control authorities and indicates that the following would be building control authorities: the council of a county, the corporation of a county borough, the corporation of Dún Laoghaire, the corporation of any other borough and the council of any urban district which at the commencement of the Act is a fire authority within the meaning of the Fire Services Act.  These same local authorities are designed as fire authorities under the Fire Services Act, 1981.  There are 27 county councils, five county boroughs, along with Dún Laoghaire Corporation, Drogheda Corporation, Dundalk UDC, Athlone UDC, and so on, 35 in all.  It is important that I put this on the record so that those reading the transcript will understand precisely what is intended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a number of the parts of the building regulations deal with fire safety it is considered desirable that the local authorities who are fire authorities should also be building control authorities.  I think that is right.  This arrangement recognises the importance of the regulations in relation to fire safety and should ensure close co-operation in the administration of building control and fire safety measures. The relationship between the control authorities and the fire safety element attached to buildings is fundamental to the thinking behind this section.  When the current local government reorganisation is completed, as we all know Dún Laoghaire Corporation will of course cease to exist and their function as a building control authority will be <Col N="833" /> exercised by the new county council of Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown, which will be a building control authority by virtue of what I have said above.</P>
    <P>Building control is concerned, <i>inter alia,</i> with fire safety in new and reconstructed buildings from a construction viewpoint, while fire safety administration is concerned both with new and existing buildings from a management and use of building viewpoint.  Subsection (2) (a) provides that where the Minister makes an order under section 9 (2) of the Fire Services Act, 1981, that a local authority which is designated as a fire authority under that Act shall cease to be a fire authority from a particular date then that local authority shall also cease to be a building control authority from the same date.  The purpose of this is to ensure that the same authorities will continue to be both building control and fire authorities.  Subsection (2) (b) is the natural follow up from subsection (2) (a) in that it provides for the transfer of staff and property from an authority which ceases to be a building control authority to the building control authority which takes over their functions.</P>
    <P>I will refer later to section 17 of the Fire Services Act, 1981, which is mentioned in this subsection.  It provides for the transfer of staff and property from a local authority which ceases to be a fire authority to the fire authority taking over their functions.  There are other minor matters related to this section but generally that is the thinking behind the section.  I think we would all agree that the important overview is the relationship which exists between the building control authority and the fire control arrangements.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like on the section to make two points of a slightly general nature, one of which I will deal with in greater detail later on.  In so far as we are providing in this section that local authorities will be building control authorities, I think it is incumbent on us to concern ourselves slightly with the degree to which they can carry out those functions and satisfy ourselves that they <Col N="834" /> can actually do the job.  The comprehensive complexity of what we are asking them to do in this Bill is a serious responsibility and at present I am somewhat reluctant to accept that some local authorities would be able to do what is being asked of them.  For example, I know that at present in the Dublin city area parts of the city do not have planning inspectors &mdash; in other words, the basic broad parameters of planning are not being observed for one reason or another due to the kind of factors Deputy Quinn mentioned a moment ago.  If we are going to go down the road of asking local authorities to become involved in very detailed building control regulatory mechanisms it is not good enough for us to simply say to local authorities &ldquo;It is your function from now on&rdquo; and assume that it is being done.  I have some concerns that it will not be done because it may not be able to be done or there may be very great unevenness around the country, which I know exists even at the present time, in relation to the existing planning legislation.  I am worried about this aspect of the Bill and it should be addressed by the Minister.  There is no point in us dreaming up a massive scheme of things here if it will not be overseen, as I do not believe it will be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Second, in so far as there is obviously &mdash; and the Minister wishes it to be &mdash; a correlation between the local authorities in terms of overseeing the building control regulations and, say, areas of fire safety, I was surprised to learn recently, although I have been a member of a local authority for many years, that there is a difficulty sometimes which arises because of the kind of conditions which some local authorities give planning permission.  For example, in some areas local authorities give a planning permission which says &ldquo;You have your permission subject to the fire officer's report&rdquo;.  The problem is that apparently the fire officer's report is not a written statement.  The insertion of the fire officer's conditioning of the planning application is apparently no more than a verbal assertion by the fire officer of a local authority that certain things should be done, but because it is not stated or <Col N="835" /> explicit it has two very important consequences which are germane to this section.</P>
    <P>First, the exact conditions which are appropriate to the construction and development of the particular proposal for which planning permission is obtained cannot be checked.  There is no way of finding out whether a person is observing in detail the requests of the fire chief. This is extraordinary.  Secondly, the public interest is being very badly served because a third party has no way of checking whether what is sought by the local authority is being done.  I will give a concrete example of what I am talking about. What happens typically is that a person gets permission for a building, subject to the fire chief's agreement, but the fire chief can say &ldquo;Sorry, I want you to move the building 20 feet down the road because I want to be able to drive fire tenders in at the side of it&rdquo;.  That huge change in the planning permission &mdash; moving a building 20 feet down the road &mdash; does not have to be written down anywhere, as I understand it, and it is not written down anywhere that the fire chief will respond to the minutiae of stating what his role is in terms of the planning application.  The conditions relating to the removal of a building 20 feet down the road are not available to the public. I cannot go into a local authority and say &ldquo;My neighbour wants a building to be built.  I gather he has got the permission so what are the conditions he has to meet?&rdquo;  The fire chief's conditions are not available to me and I understand this applies also to sanitary services, health board reports and hygiene reports of various kinds.  I make this point because I do not want us, collectively, to entrust to local authorities who already do their job inadequately, and perhaps this is not their fault in many cases, the power to now be able to say &ldquo;Here are 165 other regulations&rdquo;&mdash; or however many there would be eventually &mdash;&ldquo;to look after&rdquo; when this is not being done now.</P>
    <P>The manner in which local authorities are presently doing their job is inadequate, and I can give this in chapter and <Col N="836" /> verse if one wants it.  The quite extraordinary loophole in present planning permissions means that the full terms of the planning permission are not available either to any interested party or third party.  That is staggering, and I have to admit that I only discovered it in recent times.  Others may have known about it but I was surprised to learn about it because I thought one could get a fire chief's report in writing.  I understand that some local authorities have recently taken up the job of doing that because the Minister's Department wrote to them. However, as a member of a local authority I know, with respect, how much weight is given to letters from the Department of the Environment and I would not be unduly comforted by that.  This is a very important Bill and it is important that we take this aspect of it seriously. There is no point in having a set of building control regulations if there are going to be loopholes in them and if one cannot go along and see under what conditions and to what specifications a building is supposed to be built and what conditions attach to its planning permission.  Apparently that is the position at present and I find it quite extraordinary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has surprised me somewhat in this connection.  With regard to the planning permission schedule, planning permissions are granted or refused in so far as the conditions attach thereto are concerned.  Even before the present Minister, who has a particular interest in this type of thing, came into office some if not all authorities had written report available to those seeking planning permission regarding fire officers' requirements.  I accept that often a person who is submitting plans may have verbal discussions with the planning officers and the fire officers regarding certain regulations and arrangements.  To my certain knowledge in the case of a particular local authority with which I am familiar, if it is stated in the schedule of conditions attached to the grant of a planning permission that a person must comply with the terms of the fire officer's report, a written notice is handed to that <Col N="837" /> person stipulating the things that must be done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Maybe not surprised, but it would be regarded by me as the normal practice that if planning permission is granted subject to compliance with the fire officer's report, which would have been furnished to the planning authority before the issue of planning permission, that report would be furnished to the applicant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite so, but any of those requirements, whether discussed verbally with the authority or with the individuals concerned, would be in essence a written arrangement that would have to be complied with.  As far as I am concerned, it is being compiled with in that way.  If it is suggested to me that there are some authorities who do not follow this procedure, I will see to it that conditions sought by the fire officer will be recorded and included with the planning permission.  Otherwise, how could one pursue a defaulter subsequently?  The written word would be needed to support the case.  I am disappointed and a little surprised at what Deputy Quinn says. Small authorities have been carrying on that good practice for some years, without the back-up of staff and expertise that is to be found in some of the larger authorities.  I will pursue the matter further.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the provision <Col N="838" /> in the Bill that the council will look after the matter.  What the Minister has stated would be the normal practice in the council that I know best.  I have experience of several cases where the fire officer laid down requirements.  We all welcome the provision that buildings should be inspected, but we must recognise the difficulties in regard to the availability of manpower to carry out these inspections. Staff dealing with planning are under severe pressure, especially in a developing county adjoining County Dublin.  The staff of Meath County Council are under great pressure because of the vast number of applications received on a regular basis.  The applications are becoming more technical and it is necessary to ensure that too many permissions are not granted in one area.  We have had to take steps in our development plan to cater for this.  We may include certain provisions in this Bill, but how does the Minister envisage their being carried out on a nationwide basis in view of the pressure on staff?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>This all seems to come back to the question of certification, which is dealt with in section 6.  I appreciate that there is anxiety about this point, but it is not covered in this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the point regarding our tendency to wander around this issue and not to stick narrowly to the section, but they are inter-connected.  Perhaps the Minister could give an example of how he would see section 2 (2) (a) or section 2 (2) (b) applying.  I have no problem about the proposal, which I think is correct, but how realistic is it?  What fire authorities or local authorities currently in existence could conceivably be on a list which would be abolished?  Perhaps the Minister could give that information without showing his hand as to the nature of local government reform.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is in good form.  I think that would be regarded as a politically leading question.  It refers back to what the Deputy said earlier <Col N="839" /> regarding co-operation with the authorities. There is something to be done there in the wider context of regional planning and development.  As a principle local authorities should not just be prepared to co-operate but should seek each other's advice and assistance in particular areas of expertise which might not be available to them but might be available next door.  What is wrong with that as a principle?  What would be wrong with using the expertise of a strong local authority in an urban area in relation to planning, services and technical matters? I would include even the sharing of plant. I know this has always been resisted and that one keeps to the boundaries of one's own planning area.  Where techncial advice is concerned, it would be appropriate to allow authorities co-operate with each other.  I see nothing wrong with it.  Obviously, it concerns the restructuring of local government and the number of authorities.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment has been suggested by the Royal Institute of Architects of Ireland who have been in contact with me and with Deputy Keating.  To my knowledge they have tried to contact the other parties in this House.  In the interests of brevity and clarity the amendments have been put down in both names rather than repetitiously in separate names.  There is a worry &mdash; I can only express it as such and perhaps the Minister might elaborate on this &mdash; in regard to extending the definition in this instance.  It is readily understood and accepted that it is essentially a definition <Col N="841" /> of health, safety and welfare.  In what way is convenience not included in welfare and what does it mean?  Behind some of these amendments is a worry I have to express on behalf of the institute and the design profession generally and that is the increasing level of litigation that surrounds the building industry.  Every word takes on a new definition and a new connotation. If you put a committee of people into a room and ask them to consider a Bill in draft form they will see dangers where perhaps they do not exist. I say that with some sympathy because I think the Minister will recognise how difficult this is having regard to the impasse that has existed for three or four years in relation to this matter.  What benefit is seen by the Department or by the Minister in including the word &ldquo;convenience&rdquo; that is not already covered by the word &ldquo;welfare&rdquo;?</P>

It seems that the word &ldquo;convenience&rdquo; should remain in the Bill. Under subsection (2) the question of the provision of facilities for disabled and so on is dealt with.  I am concerned that if we delete &ldquo;convenience&rdquo; there may well <Col N="842" /> be other areas of concern to people who may not be affected by the building regulations or building regulations may be challenged on the basis that &ldquo;convenience&rdquo; was deleted in this House because it was not seen to be a concern with regard to building regulations.  That is what concerns me.</P>
      <P>I will come back again to the fact that most of the alterations in relation to this Bill have been suggested by various professional bodies who are obviously keen to ensure that their liabilities are limited to the greatest possible extent.  My concern in relation to these regulations &mdash; I am not implying that it is not the same for everybody else in this House&mdash; is not for the professional bodies but for the people who will live in the buildings which are built under the building regulations that will arise from this Bill.  I am reluctant to accept amendments which delete words such as &ldquo;for the convenience of the people who will use the buildings&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I do not think anyone is going to go to the wall as a result of this amendment.  It is reasonable for the Minister to take the odd suggestion from this side of the House.  The discussion up to now has dealt with three amendments of a fairly peripheral nature.  I get the impression that Deputy De Rossa thinks there is some massive gang-up by a group of people who have a vested interest in this matter.  There are no amendments down in my name, nor I am sure in the names of Deputy Quinn or Deputy Farrelly, which would not assist the public whom we represent.  Of course the public also include people who wear professional hats and I have no particular axe to grind against them no more than for them.  The word &ldquo;convenience&rdquo; is a word of such generality as to be possibly open to being unjust to people who might subsequently be affected by its most extreme interpretation.  There is an obligation on us to be as precise as we can in framing legislation.  The word &ldquo;convenience&rdquo; is not as sharply focused as the word &ldquo;health&rdquo; which can be judged against some objective criteria or the word &ldquo;safety&rdquo; which is relatively easily <Col N="843" /> understood.  The word &ldquo;convenience&rdquo; can mean anything.  It can have the most outlandish meanings.  Theoretically that could very well mean that someone could take an action or pursue his own personal interest under this Bill in the context of something not being convenient to him, something which might be quite outlandish and completely contrary to public interest.  The word &ldquo;convenience&rdquo; is not defined anywhere in the Bill.  Even in the Oxford English Dictionary its definition is nebulous and general in nature.</P>
      <P>The Minister has said that, as far as he is concerned, to leave out the word &ldquo;convenience&rdquo; would not damage the Bill in any way.  Our reason for wanting to do so is not to remove responsibility from anybody.  I want those who are involved to be fully responsible in law right down the line but we have to be fair also.  There is no point in putting in a phrase such as &ldquo;and for the convenience of&rdquo; or any other such phrase.  That kind of thinking comes across later in the Bill on one or two points which I hope to deal with.</P>

      <P>I would have to say to Deputy De Rossa that if I thought for one moment that to concede this amendment would weaken the legislation in any way I would not even have considered it and I do not think the Deputies would have asked me to.  I am not here to defend any sectional group or any vested interest and I do not think anybody else is either.  It is right and proper, if Deputy Quinn, with his professional competence in the matter, has points which have been made to him either here or outside, of a nature that needs to be expressed here, that not only would I welcome them but that it would be his responsibility to make them. I am holding no axe for anybody.  I just want to do what is right.  I have reviewed this matter.  What is proposed in the building regulations is that the matters that are needed can be provided under the revised wording, if the amendment is accepted.  Everything we want to do can be done without any difficulty or problem and without minimising the legislation in <Col N="844" /> any way.  I should like to assure the Deputy on that.</P>
      <P>I do not know whether it will be any comfort to the Deputy to say this but the word &ldquo;convenience&rdquo; is not included in the United Kingdom legislation in this matter.  That is not to say that we could not do it, but it does not appear to me to be absolutely critical to the proper promotion of the legislation.  For that reason I am prepared to concede it unless I thought there was an attitude developing in the House that said: &ldquo;No, leave it in, it might have relevance&rdquo;.  As Deputy Keating says, it could be taken to the ultimate and render otherwise good legislation nonsensical in minor respects.  I would rather that it did not go that way. I think the Deputy's concerns can be catered for under the existing wording without the deletion of the words &ldquo;and convenience&rdquo;.</P>

Section 3 (2) then goes on to specify various other things that may be done as well.

I know that other Deputies on the Opposition benches here do not regard it as an important point and it may very well be that it is not important in the general context of the Bill.  If you like, I am putting down a marker that I consider there is a need to ensure that the Minister has the power to make regulations which would provide for the convenience of persons in or about buildings and persons who may be affected by buildings or by matters connected with buildings.  That is the point I am making.  If the Minister feels that the provisions of the Bill are as well without the usage of that word I will accept his word on that, but I am not happy with it.</P>

When one examines the matter closely one finds that the building regulations that I or any of my successors might make to deal with all of those matters really are not what we are talking about.  We are talking about health, safety and welfare.  If one were to apply the widest possible interpretation to those three aspects then it could cover everything, including convenience.</P>

Taking the interpretation of the word &ldquo;convenience&rdquo; to its ultimate, it might not be helpful, whereas the safety element applied to the regulation could cater for all of that, if required, in any <Col N="846" /> set of circumstances.  Therefore it is in the widest possible interpretation of the terms health, safety and welfare that I would consider the term &ldquo;convenience&rdquo; could be incorporated.  Otherwise, I would not have accepted it.

      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 5, subsection (2), lines 36 to 38, to delete paragraph (f).</P>
      <P>The discussion we have had for the last 20 minutes on the definition of one word in section 3 (2) (a) and the usefulness of such a discussion seem to me to be set at nought if there is a provision in legislation which subsequently says: &ldquo;However, leaving aside all the foregoing, nevertheless we think the Minister should be able to make provision for such other matters as appear to the Minister to be necessary or expedient and are specified in the regulations&rdquo;.  As a matter of principle I consider it bad practice for the State, or for a Minister, to take unto himself or herself the open-ended right, without further reference to the House, to seek power which is not specified or explicit in any way, as is suggested here. This is not true merely of this Bill but of many others also.  I know this is a form of words used now and again.  It is one of these catch-all, safety net type of clauses which allows for a certain degree of intellectual laziness, not necessarily on the part of the Minister, but a sort of feeling of &ldquo;Well, if we have not covered everything else we will cover it in this way&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In principle I contend it is not right. Ultimately, Governments and Ministers serve the public and are elected by them. It is wrong for the bureaucracy of the State to set itself up as some kind of ultimate arbiter and propose a clause like this which means effectively that nobody can predict with any degree of certainty <Col N="847" /> what might be sought under the guise of that clause at any time in the future.  I do not like that general principle, that &ldquo;building regulations may be made for all or any of the following purposes ... making provision for such other matters as appear to the Minister to be necessary or expedient and are specified in the regulations&rdquo;. The last part &ldquo;and are specified in the regulations&rdquo; is probably fair, but the words &ldquo;as appear to the Minister to be necessary or expedient&rdquo; are very subjective, both the words &ldquo;necessary&rdquo; and &ldquo;expedient&rdquo; being subjective terms. There have been the occasional times in our political history when the definition of the word &ldquo;expedient&rdquo; by a Minister might not necessarily have coincided with the common good, even allowing for the fact that this falls into the broad area of building regulations.  I merely make the point that I consider the wording of legislation should not be that loose or sloppy. My reason for tabling this amendment was to make that point publicly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Applying the line of thought the Deputy has expressed in so far as other legislation or measures contemplated by the Oireachtas are concerned, there might be some validity in it but I do not think it has validity here for the following reason, that the effect of the amendment is to delete section 3 (2) (f).  The Bill is required largely because the enabling powers of the 1963 Planning and Development Act are now inadequate in regard to building regulations which can only address health and safety matters.  The special needs of the disabled and energy conservation are not included in the 1963 Act as purposes for which such regulations can be made.  It would be wrong to allow a similar situation to develop at some future date simply because we cannot now anticipate <Col N="848" /> all the reasons we may need building regulations in the future including, for example, advances in building technology, on which Deputy Quinn made a point earlier.  We do not know what will be the technological building advances of the future.  Why cut ourselves off from the possibility of accommodating those advances in this legislation?  Why not at least allow ourselves the possibility of making such changes, if necessary, in the future?  In fact, even new skills and practices in construction might have to be addressed in a different fashion.</P>
      <P>In my view the general power conferred in section 3 (2) (f) should stand. Of course, the overview would have to be expressed here that any regulations any Minister for the Environment might contemplate would have to be laid before the House anyway.  If it was discovered that they were unsatisfactory or draconian in any way then they could be annulled by the House.  That is the overall power of the House which it is important to understand in relation to any regulations of this nature.  All I am seeking is enough power to catch things that might not now be contemplated but which would have a very significant relevance in the future.  I would ask the Deputy to see it in that way and to perhaps withdraw his amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 17, which provides for the orders and regulations, is a standard section used frequently in this House in which regulations become law if they are not annulled.  I have no dispute with the mechanism, but in view of the impact of the regulations to be administered by this legislation I will be open to the Minister's argument if the section is changed and the regulations would only come into law when approved rather than if not annulled.  We should have a positive method of intervention rather than a negative one.  Deputy Flynn has been in the House for as long as I have and I doubt if either of us can recall regulations that have been annulled.  It is not the sort of thing that happens in this House.  If there is logic in the flexibility being provided for in subsection (2) (f) it only <Col N="849" /> becomes subject to effective parliamentary scrutiny and control if section 17 contains the possibility for a positive intervention rather than a negative one. I do not feel strongly about this amendment but I can see the sense of what Deputy Keating is saying and that it is really at the core of parliamentary scrutiny.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister elaborate on why he and the Department feel it necessary to describe in such a detailed way what is contained in section 3?  I find it hard to understand why the section has to be so specific, and then we have this all pervading subsection (2) (f) clause as well.  This is a very long and elaborate section running to two full pages and it is not the normal section one sees.  There seems to be a belt and braces and perhaps a second belt being wrapped around this section.  The draftsman has set out clearly the different ways in which these regulations can be applied and then thrown in something like this global clause in the end.  If one takes the extent of the section in the first instance, the all embracing power implied in section 3 (2) (f), and then looks at the mechanism for the making of the regulations which will go through on the nod here in this House, I am not so sure that it is the best way to make law for regulations.  Perhaps the Minister will elaborate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a good thing to have parliamentary scrutiny attached to regulations. The reason I cannot remember offhand something having been annulled or having been sought to be annulled is because in general very great care is taken in making regulations subject to legislation being passed.  When the regulations are made and are available to the House they are good regulations, and I cannot say any more than that.  If it ever comes to pass that regulations are going in the wrong direction so far as the legislation is concerned, then they will be annulled.  This is a good practice and we should not minimise what has stood the test of time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In other legislation when we tried to cover specific things that needed to be <Col N="850" /> covered we were always asked why we did not cover something else that came up later.  That is the reason this is being included in that way.  We accept that a specific reference should be made to the disabled.  I would like to see that reflected in more legislation which will come into this House, particularly in relation to the construction industry.  There is good reason for having that subsection in the way it is.</P>
    <P>Conservation of fuel and energy became a very big issue, bigger than it is now, but, so as to continue to have people reflect on it as a major issue that might have an enormous relevance again should certain economic or international factors occur, it is good to have it included as a specific.  The other references in paragraph (d) &ldquo;the efficient use of resources&rdquo; is really a catch-all as well as is the phrase &ldquo;the encouragement of good building practice&rdquo; in paragraph (e). Good building practice is something that should be fundamental to the section but it happens to be specified there.  I see it not as a specific that should be isolated but as something that is an overview of what should be the normal practice in these matters.  Paragraph (f) is put in to cater for a case where something which is not contemplated occurs in the future or for a change of practice or in building types.  We cover all these things anyway so as to have the freedom to move if we so wish in the future.  It is as simple as that.  This has to be subsequently supported by regulation which comes to the House anyway and which can be changed if the House so decides.  We are preaching two kinds of philosophy.  We are seeking this in other legislative proposals every day in the House.  We are including this here now and it should be allowed because it gives us the power to move should we need to in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not press this any further, but one of the reasons we are seeking this is because of the way in which the House operates.  Because of the manner in which the business of the House is ordered we do not get a lot of business done, so there is a fear that <Col N="851" /> if we do not get every possible option available to us right now in the context of a Bill like this we may never again get the chance.  The Minister made the point that there could be a change in building practice or that there could be new technology. These two options are already covered.  In principle we should be as explicit as possible.  It is feasible for the Minister and his Department in looking at the next 20 or 30 years in construction to be able to suggest what might arise and be able to make those possibilities quite explicit in the section.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to one or two catch-all phrases.  At least these phrases are relevant.  To make provision for securing in relation to building an efficient use of resources is relevant, but to make a provision for &ldquo;such other matters as appear to the Minister to be necessary or expedient&rdquo; is so general that the Minister could just leave that clause in and leave the rest of it out except for the case the Minister made about wanting to address the needs of the disabled.  In the same section there is a reference to persons who may be affected by buildings or matters connected with buildings.  I do not know if the Minister is talking about piping extensions or what.</P>

Deputy Quinn has been pressing for this legislation to be brought back and in the end I said that it could be brought back. It is a shame it had not been concluded because then the regulations that would have been expected and desirable over the past number of years could have been made, including some of the things we have been trying for here for some time. It was in deference to that point of view that I said, let us do it.  There are a number of sections being removed or restructured.  This is tedious now, but it could have been dealt with and disposed of in another way.  Unfortunately that has not happened and I am now going to pursue this until it is finished and the Minister can make regulations, and can be pressed by Members of the House to make regulations, in specified areas, which he cannot do now.</P>

      <P>He said motions to annul regulations do not generally appear here because the regulations are so well made.  I dispute that.  The fact is motions to annul regulations can only be debated in Private Members' Time and, by the nature of things, parties in Opposition are reluctant to use their Private Members' Time to debate the annulling of regulations.</P>

It seems that for reasons best known to the draftsman, very extensive powers have been given to cover anything that might be relevant in the future in relation to building regulations.</P>
      <P>The core point &mdash; and this was supported by Deputy De Rossa &mdash; in relation to the coming into effect of the mechanism which gives legislative operation to this Bill and the administration of the building regulations, will itself be substantive legislation.  The actual prescribed form of certification will contain the essence of this Bill, and will contain the essence of protection for the public. It is in relation to that point that I believe the House should see this and formally approve it.  I do not for one moment contend that the normal section, in this case section 17, should be reversed and that every regulation pertaining to every piece of legislation enacted by the Oireachtas should come before the House by way of positive motion. However, we can deal with section 17 at the appropriate time.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
      <P>In page 6, lines 8 to 18, to delete subsection (4) and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(4) Building regulations which relate to&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  buildings as regards which any material change takes place in the purposes for which the buildings are used, or</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="856" /> (b)  material alterations or extensions of buildings, or</P>
    <P>(c)  the provision of services, fittings or equipment, in or in connection with, buildings,</P>
    <P>may apply to a building, the construction of which was commenced before the operative day, in so far as such building is affected by any material change in the purposes for which such building is used or any material alteration, extension, provision of services, fittings or equipment, as the case may be, which occurs on or after the operative day and in all other cases building regulations shall, subject to section 20 (2) apply only to buildings the construction of which is commenced on or after the operative day.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Section 3 (4) provides that with the exception of material alterations, extentions and provision of services, fittings and equipment, building regulations shall only apply to buildings the construction of which commences after the coming into operation of the regulations.</P>
    <P>The amendment I am putting forward addresses two aspects, the more substantive of which ensures that the regulations may deal with the material changes of use in existing buildings.  In view of the vital importance of this provision &mdash; and in this context I am thinking of buildings like the Stardust &mdash; I consider it essential that the ability to regulate for material change of use in existing buildings be put beyond all doubt.  The other change affected is the amendment of structural alterations to material alterations, the reasons for which we have already discussed in amendment No. 3.  I think Deputy De Rossa raised that point and he was satisfied on it.  This is an important matter and I recommend the amendment.</P>

      <P>I appreciate that but if we agree to this amendment there will be no debate on the others.  As I understand it, the Minister is deleting in page 6, line 12 of the original Bill &ldquo;the construction of which was commenced or was completed before the operative day&rdquo;.  The Minister's amendment takes out the words &ldquo;or was completed&rdquo;, so in effect we are talking about the principle of non-retrospection at one level.  Is that correct?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to tease this out.  I am not clear on the full implications of this change.  This amendment makes two changes, first in the Bill as initiated the building regulations relate to section 3 (4) (a) and (b) but we now have three paragraphs (a), (b) and (c).</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no great problem with that.  However, some thinking has gone into the element of retrospection because following paragraph (c) it further states:</P>
      <P>may apply to a building, the construction of which was commenced before the operative day, in so far as such building is affected by any material change...</P>
      <P>That substantial paragraph in the amendment is different from the original section in the Bill as initiated.  In his amendment the Minister has removed the words &ldquo;or was completed before the operative day&rdquo;.  Perhaps the Minister would indicate why that has happened?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>However it could be helpful to the promoters of the amendment and it might help to change their minds.</P>
      <P>This amendment introduces a concept of uncertainty into the area of compliance with the building regulations which could be argued and interpreted differently by the different people, designers, builders and indeed the courts and is therefore unacceptable.  The legislation must require full compliance with the building regulations, to do anything else would make it ineffective.  However, I am aware of the inexactness of the science of building and of the anxiety of the building industry in this regard.  I will be looking at the regulations to be made under section 6 and in particular at the wording of the certificate to be lodged with the Building Control Authority by approved certifiers to see to what extent the points raised by the Deputies collectively can be catered for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has put his finger on the core of our concern, which is about liability.  In this context I would like to clarify a point made earlier by Deputy Proinsias De Rossa and to which I did not reply at that time.  The reason that this Bill has not been advanced for quite <Col N="861" /> some time is because of the severe difficulties in relation to the alternative methods of administration.  In fact, the construction industry would prefer if the local authorities at national level administered the building by-laws, now the building regulations, in the manner in which Dublin Corporation and the other large local authorities do.  We are moving away from that.  Lest Deputy De Rossa think so, there is no desire to privatise it; on the contrary this is a chalice of such potential poison that they have resisted coming into the room to look at it, let alone to handle it for such a long time. Part of the reason relates to a large body of law and litigation in the other jurisdiction, which for some legal reason is transferable by way of precedent to the Irish jurisdiction.  We have heard this before now and it is not appropriate for me at this stage to go into it at any length because that will come in section 6 when we are talking about the certificate.  In deference to the Leas-Cheann Comhairle who wants us to move along I will not elaborate on that point.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Substantial compliance&rdquo; is the kind of phraseology that has surfaced invariably in relation to certificates that people would sign &ldquo;to the best of my knowledge&rdquo; or &ldquo;to the best of my ability&rdquo;&mdash; that kind of qualification that allows for the human condition and human frailty, the absence of which would lead to locking somebody irrevocably into something over which he might not have 100 per cent control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think anyone disputes that argument.  Should we put in a qualification on the word &ldquo;compliance&rdquo; at this point of the legislation or should we put it in at section 6 in relation to the certificate?  We do not have the certificate in front of us and we are in the process of making law.  The only way we on this side of the House can address ourselves to a concern which I think both sides recognise as being not unreasonable is to do it within the framework of the legal <Col N="862" /> process itself.  That is why some recognition is being sought for the problem to which I have referred.  If the Minister wants to consider this he can come back on Report Stage.  I do not want to weaken the building regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>As I understand it the amendment would derive from some of the professions' anxiety that minor breaches of the regulations would be prosecuted by building control authorities. Given the inexactness of building as a science there will be minor breaches. I think Deputy Quinn is getting at that. Because compliance has to be absolute all regulations have this clause built into them and in the final analysis the courts, as he says rightly, will decide reasonableness and unreasonableness.</P>
      <P>As an example of the type of certificates that can be produced I refer the Deputies to the form of certificates prescribed by the regulations in relation to the Local Government (Multi-Storey Buildings) Act, 1988 which includes the words &ldquo;subject to the procedures and tolerances of normal building practices&rdquo;.  That is already there.  The form of the certificates is a matter on which I will be seeking the avice of the building regulations advisory body who will be set up under section 13 of this legislation.  That is an enormously important section.  The regulations that will be made will be before that advisory body, who will include the people whose anxieties Deputy Quinn is expressing now &mdash; and I can understand that.  They will have their say: the professions, materials people, developers and all the people you would like to name who should be included on that advisory body.  Therefore, the Minister will have that advice. That will overcome much of the anxiety expressed by Deputy Quinn here on behalf of people who, I appreciate fully, would have anxiety in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me say, without seeming to cut Deputy Keating off, that the original amendment was pursued at some length in the Oireachtas joint committee by the leader of his party and, after all the talk and the necessary assurances regarding <Col N="863" /> the advisory body, he withdrew it.  I am not making that as a point that the Deputy should withdraw this but, having considered everything, particularly the section 13 proposal for the advisory committee to be set up to deal with these matters, it was regarded as satisfactory and sufficient.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister saying that the phrase which he quoted from the certificate about provisions being subject to the normal stresses, tensions and tolerances&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;in this area is implicit in the section or is it likely to be part of the certification in due course?  There is a certain degree of concern in some quarters about the kind of microscopic compliance which might be sought by some people in the real world.  I hope it will not develop into an opportunity for even minor breaches of the regulations.  They were suggested to me almost as a larger scale of evasion.  I am talking simply about compliance of the level referred to in the phrase the Minister used regarding writing the certificate.  If that is the case I am quite happy about it and will be happy to withdraw the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it would be right for me to pre-empt what the building regulations advisory body might recommend subsequently, but should they consider that phraseology as adequate I would be happy to consider it favourably.  Deputy Quinn and I had this out when we were talking about other certificates for other legislation and I had to pull a great deal to get any advice at all in the matter from the outside professions. I hope when this advisory committee are set up they will be helpful and constructive rather than trying to negative anything we are seeking to achieve.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>On that last point I accept broadly the Minister's assurance, but he <Col N="864" /> quoted a phrase &ldquo;procedure and tolerances&rdquo; that is obviously on the form of certificate in relation to the multi-storey buildings legislation.  Has that certificate been accepted by the ACEI and others?</P>

However, I take the point and I think we can relate the two.  I would be much happier on the question of the type of certification and the wording attached to it if we could get it agreed between the departmental staff and their experts and the people involved with this on a day to day basis so that there would be no hassle subsequently as long as the overriding position is, as Deputy Keating suggested, that in no way are vested interests or groups seeking to undermine the philosophy or the principles enshrined in the legislation.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The most frequent sustained criticism of the proposed building regulations has been that practitioners in the building industry state they have difficulty in using them in view of the uneasy alliance in the proposed regulations between the legal <Col N="865" /> format in which they are drafted and the technical concepts which they enclose.  In England and Wales building regulations have been simplified by separating out the technical concepts from the legal format.  This has been achieved by using regulations containing simple, functional requirements supported by approved documents which contain the necessary technical details written in a type of language the building industries are familiar with.  The evidence to date based on the objective surveys in England and Wales suggests a high level of users' satisfaction with the new approach and my Department are considering the redrafting of the proposed building regulations in a similar format.  For that reason I recommend the amendment to the House.</P>

Is it a replacement?</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>One point concerns me most particularly in relation to the section.  Subsection (4) at the last line says that the building regulations will only apply to buildings, the construction of which is commenced on or after the operative date.  It is obviously important to have a clear cut-off or commencement date from the point of view of liability. However, there are considerable numbers of buildings, some relatively new, which would not be certified in terms of access or safety or health.  We hear talk at the moment of &ldquo;sick&rdquo; buildings and we know there are quite a lot of buildings which do not provide for access for disabled people.  Perhaps the Minister would indicate what his thinking on this is.  Is there any way in which we could say that over a number of years we will seek to have buildings comply in a minimum way in relation to particular aspects of the regulations in relation to health, safety and access in particular?</P>
      <P>Another point is that there is no obligation on the Minister to make any of the regulations.  He may make regulations in relation to any or all of the matters. Obviously we know he will make some regulations because there would be no point in dealing with the Bill otherwise. Again I would like the Minister to indicate his intention to make regulations in relation to the matter specified because the Bill as it is constructed says he may do and not that he shall do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Quinn said that the professional bodies are not keen on taking on board the responsibilities under this Bill.  That may well be, but it is only because they are reluctant to take on board the liabilities that this Bill will place on them and I know that a lot of pressure has been exerted to restrict their liability. In other words after a certain number of years their responsibility for defects or whatever in relation to the certification or the carrying out of certain works under this Bill will end.  The question has to be <Col N="867" /> asked where the liability then lies.  Does it come back to the local authority or to the Department or to the Minister or where?  It may be that I am jumping a number of sections to deal with this issue but having dealt with section 3 it is important to put it on record that professional bodies are trade unions in a sense.  They represent their members and the generality of the views of their members.  By and large we would accept that architects, valuers, engineers and so on do a job of work to the best of their ability, and there are some very excellent ones, but it has to be said also that any professional body or any person in the professions would be loth to refuse the business that will accrue as a result of this Bill because it will mean extra money for them.  The only reluctance seems to be in regard to liability; they want to restrict their liability.  It is my concern to ensure that if they are taking on this responsibility, they take on the full liability.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I have resisted taking up the time of the House so far but at this stage there is something I should put on the record of the House because it relates to this section.  Let me explain what the design profession actually is because I think the record should contain this information explicitly and clearly.  The design profession signs contracts and assumes liability for between ten and 12 years depending on the nature of the contract and there is full liability for any defect that would arise within that period.  It is the normal contract one gets with any service, commodity or product and there is no dispute in relation to accepting that responsibility.  That was the position that prevailed for quite some time and it was the law of contract that governed liability, professional negligence and incompetence. I am speaking from memory now of a seminar I attended on professional liability and indemnity about four a half years ago, but what I am about to relate can be verified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was a ruling in England arising from a case that said that the contract liability period of 12 years starts from the <Col N="868" /> time the defect is noted.  Therefore, one could have a building 25 years old in which a defect occurs and after which the owners would have 12 years to sue for negligence and liability.  Let me give Deputy De Rossa an example of what actually happened.  This is a case history and some of the officials assisting the Minister would have a detailed knowledge of it.  There was an architect in England who designed a school for a local authority and who retired from practice at, perhaps, the age of 65 but who maintained his professional liability insurance in retirement for a period of 12 years. When he was in his eighties he got a letter from solicitors acting on behalf of clients he never knew or recognised or worked for who had bought the school building from the local authority and were now using it for another purpose suing him for professional incompetence in the construction of the building.</P>
    <P>What happened was that in the late seventies or early eighties there had been an extraordinarily hot summer which had completely altered the level of the water table in whole sections of Britain and as a consequence the ground bearing pressure was significantly altered which in turn led to differential settlement in the building and this resulted in a crack.  Every conceivable design manual giving the bearing pressure of that ground and the atmospheric and environmental behaviour and performance etc. indicated that the construction and the fabrications of the design foundations and so on were done in accordance with acceptable practices and procedures.  Yet the people concerned were able to get into court on the basis of this particular interpretation.  I am not a lawyer and I may not have the full legal details accurate but it is a matter of record.  That change in the law of contract to include the law of tort meant that designers became permanently and eternally liable for their buildings even though all sorts of things could change.</P>
    <P>In relation to the &ldquo;sick&rdquo; buildings to which Deputy De Rossa refers, some of which are on the corner of St. Stephen's Green, the design of the pre-cast panels was three steps removed from the <Col N="869" /> execution of them.  In other words we had the architect, then the engineer and then the specialist engineer in the company who got the subcontract to make the pre-cast panels, and that company have subsequently gone out of existence.  In law the aggrieved party goes back up the line and eventually the case lands on the desk of the surviving design organisation.  I do not want to in any way prejudice cases that are currently in the courts and it would be inappropriate for me to do so; but it is for the reasons I have stated that there is an extraordinary new fear in the last four or five years in the entire construction profession and the consequences are that many people will not be able to work adequately and projects will not be built because the insurance cover necessary for their construction or design will be so prohibitive cost-wise that people will not be able to practise.</P>
    <P>The House will be aware of the concerns of the design profession.  They are some of the reasons why we have had a difficulty for some time in regard to certification.  The construction industry would prefer if the system of administration operated by local authorities, such as by-laws and so on, applied to the entire country.  However, we all recognise that that would cost a lot of money even if fees were charges for by-law applications.  When we reach the section in the Bill which deals with by-laws I will propose a parallel system for the Minister's consideration.  However, it is important to nail the idea that the construction industry, in the broadest sense, is trying to evade its responsibilities.  By virtue of legal interpretations in the court they have been given an open ended cheque.  If one buys a new car one gets a five year warranty with it, not a 25-year or 45-year warranty.  That is what is at the core of a lot of our problems and the House should be aware of it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to refer the Minister to some of the extraordinary language used in subsections (9), (10) and (11).  Subsection (9) states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Building regulations may contain <Col N="870" /> such supplementary and incidental provisions as appear to the Minister to be necessary or expedient.</P>
    <P>Subsection (10) states:</P>
    <P>Building regulations may exempt, in whole or in part, from all or any of the provisions of such regulations such classes or descriptions of buildings...</P>
    <P>Subsection (11) states:</P>
    <P>Building regulations, or any provision contained therein, may be made so as to apply generally, or as regards any area specified in the regulations, and the regulations may contain different provisions for different areas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>That could be anything.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Whoever devised those subsections should get an accolade for assisting the Minister to deal with the furthest outreach possible for the longest possible length of time over the most comprehensive area possible.  I should like to ask the Minister a question in relation to subsection (12).  Will the Minister say why it is that building regulations shall apply to buildings belonging to or in the occupation of the State, with which I am happy, other than buildings which are used as prisons or places of detention? Obviously, there is a reason for that but I wonder why the standards should be open to being inferior for places of detention or prisons.  What is the rationale behind that provision?  I accept that many of the buildings are very old but I gather that there are proposals to erect new buildings and I do not see why they should be exempt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>This must be the only piece of legislation introduced since the foundation of the State that has had three different Ministers responsible for it, Deputy Kavanagh, Deputy Boland and now Minister Flynn.  There has been one from each party carrying responsibility for it before it becomes law.  I suppose that the answer to the Deputy's question is that the parliamentary draftsman was trying to accommodate us all in this <Col N="871" /> regard and we should express our appreciation for that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">

      <P>A response for the three Ministers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The only people who did not have an opportunity of getting involved in the preparation of the Bill were Deputies Quinn and Keating.  If there are serious problems with existing buildings, to reply to Deputy De Rossa, there is legislation to deal with them such as the Dangerous Buildings Act or the Fire Services Act.  The building regulations we are referring to are concerned with design and construction and buildings that do not have adequate access to and egress from so far as the disabled are concerned.  I share the Deputy's point of view in regard to them but I am sure he will accept that much has been done in regard to that matter.  While it was not mandatory on builders to cater for the disabled in recent years, because of the lobbying of the Irish Wheelchair Association and other interested parties, an enormous amount of work has been done.  Existing buildings have been renovated to accommodate the disabled and I support those moves.  I have spoken to representatives of organisations who have an interest in the disabled and in their right to have proper access to and egress from buildings, and other facilities such as lifts, and I have made them aware of my personal interest in those matters. I have told them that where we can we will accommodate the disabled.  I am sure Deputy De Rossa will agree with me that modifications have taken place in recent years.  It is important that we should impress on those who have not carried out such work the need to do so, particularly when they are carrying out reconstruction work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to tell the House that it is my intention to make regulations.  I was asked if this would be pie in the sky but that is not so.  The building regulations were issued in 1984 and, by and large, they are being complied with.  It is the <Col N="872" /> manual that is attached to construction and design work now.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is my intention to make regulations for most, if not all, of the matters referred to in the book on building regulations.  Of course, the Bill does not deal with the question of general liability, an issue raised by Deputy Quinn. Existing common law provisions in relation to civil liability will continue to apply.  Deputy Quinn has expressed anxiety about that area but he is not seeking to minimise the need for control in design and construction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Absolutely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that.  Deputies will be aware that the Minister for Justice is responsible for matters relating to civil liability.  The Department of the Environment have advised the Department of Justice in the matter and made them aware of the concerns expressed by design professionals and other bodies in the construction industry.  We have asked them to take them on board.  By and large we have got this reasonably correct.  I concede that the parliamentary draftsmen has made it possible for the Minister of the day, whoever he may be &mdash; three of us have had our hands in this &mdash; to do all that is necessary now and in the future to accommodate changes in practices or technology.  I am sure the House will concede that it is right and proper that the Minister should have a right to deal with problems that may arise rather than being obliged to introduce legislation in the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister reply to my question as to why buildings which are used as prisons or places of detention are exempt?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason is so obvious that one does not think about it.  It relates <Col N="873" /> to the question of egress, the question of security.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not totally statisfied with that, bearing in mind that these are optional for the Minister to implement.  I would be concerned that people who are incarcerated in these places would at least have a reasonable standard of construction in those facilities.  I wonder whether this is an opportunity for such places to be built in accordance with standards which would not be acceptable generally.</P>

      <P>In relation to the question of retrospection, I acknowledge, as the Minister has done, that there has been progress regarding the provision of access for disabled persons in buildings. Nevertheless, there are buildings which have been built since 1984, when this Bill was first introduced, which do not provide for access of persons with disabilities.  We should be looking at some way of trying to ensure that at least public buildings comply with building regulations, even though they may have been built and completed before the date on which these regulations come into effect. I am not sure what way that could be done.  It may be that it could be done solely in relation to buildings occupied by Government Departments, State agencies or whatever.  It would probably be difficult to do it in privately occupied buildings.  I wonder whether the Minister could give an undertaking in relation to that matter.  I have in mind the building across the road where we hold committee meetings.  It used to be called Setanta House but I think it is now called Kildare House.  A person in a wheelchair simply cannot get into that building unless there are at least two other people there to lift them up the seven or eight high steps. Then there are two doors which create a problem in relation to how they open.  I do not know to what extent that problem exists in other buildings occupied by State Departments.  Indeed, I may well put down a question to the various Departments in relation to that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In dealing with a Bill which is trying to establish standards on a legal basis we should be addressing ourselves to buildings which are already in existence and which may never come to our attention under these regulations unless they seek to have alterations of a significant nature carried out.  We should try to find a way of ensuring that buildings are made <Col N="875" /> accessible.  That is the reason I am pressing the point with the Minister.  Can he indicate whether he is prepared to consider introducing on Report Stage, or under some other legislation, the question of applying at least some of the regulations to buildings already in existence?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>All I can say to that is that matters such as this have been considered by members of local authorities over the years on a continuous basis and a very good response has been achieved where it was feasible or where there was not enormous cost attached to it.  I do not know what exactly is the position in Setanta Centre.  While it might be difficult to gain access because of steps and whatever, sometimes there are lifts from the carpark underground.  I do not know whether they exist in Setanta but I would be surprised if they were not there.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 11:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="876" /> In page 7, before section 4, to insert the following new section:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;4.&mdash;(1) Subject to the provisions of this section, a building control authority may, if it considers it reasonable having regard to all the circumstances of the case, grant a dispensation from, or a relaxation of, any requirement of building regulations in respect of buildings or works which are situated within the functional area of the building control authority and&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  which are designed, constructed or carried out by or on behalf of the building control authority, or</P>
    <P>(b)  in relation to which an application for such dispensation or relaxation has been submitted pursuant to subsection (2).</P>
    <P>(2)  An application for a dispensation from, or a relaxation of, any requirement of building regulations shall be made in the prescribed form, and any such application shall be accompanied by the prescribed fee (if any).</P>
    <P>(3)  Building regulations may provide that in respect of any specified requirement of the regulations, subsection (1) shall not apply.</P>
    <P>(4)  Where, within the prescribed period, a building control authority does not notify the applicant of the decision on an application for a dispensation from, or a relaxation of, any requirement of building regulations, a decision by the building control authority to grant the application shall be regarded as having been given on the last day of the prescribed period.</P>
    <P>(5)  A building control authority may make a dispensation from, or a relaxation of, any requirement of building regulations granted pursuant to subsection (1) subject to such conditions (if any) as it sees fit.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>A new subsection is being substituted because of the extent of the changes arising. The changes involve removing the <Col N="877" /> references to arbitration in subsections (6) and (7).  Provision is now being made for appeals against the decisions of building control authorities to be made to An Bord Pleanála.  I think that is important.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>We are putting in a new section 7 as well.  It also provides that a building control authority will not have to apply to itself for relaxations or dispensations in respect of work which the authority itself carries out.  It also provides that the time within which applications for dispensations or relaxations must be decided upon can be prescribed by the Minister.  The section provides the power for building control authorities to dispense with or relax particular provisions of building regulations in individual cases.</P>
      <P>Given the fact that the requirements of the regulations are mandatory and the different types of building and building situations that must be catered for, it is considered desirable that there should be a means for permitting a relaxation or dispensations where compliance with such requirements could be considered unreasonable in a particular case having regard to the use to which the building might be put.  For example, a multi-storeyed carpark, which is classified as a storage building, might not have to meet the full fire protection requirements of normal storage buildings as its fire load is generally low compared with other types of storage buildings.  Its open sides enable heat to escape and facilitate fire fighting.  Its means of escape are generally good for the small number of people who would frequent it at any one time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A building control authority will have to deal with an application for dispensation or relaxation within a period to be specified by the Minister by regulations. If it makes no decision within that period a decision to grant the application will be regarded as having been given. Certain provisions of the regulations will not be capable of being dispensed with or relaxed and these provisions will be specified in the building regulations.  It is <Col N="878" /> intended at this stage that the provisions to be so specified will cover only Part A of the regulations which deals with the non-technical administrative parts&mdash;for example, such matters as interpretation, rules, exemptions, application of the regulations and the designation of purpose groups.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The normal retirement age of a district justice is 65 years, under section 30 (1) of the Courts (Supplemental Provisions) Act, 1961.  However, the Courts of Justice (District Court) Act, 1949 provides a mechanism by which a district justice may be continued in office year by year up to age 70.  The power to grant an extension is exercised by a committee, comprising the Chief Justice, the President of the High Court and the Attorney General.  Where a justice satisfies the committee that he is not suffering from any disability which would render him unfit to continue to discharge efficiently the duties of his office, the committee may, if they so think proper after consultation with the Minister for Justice, make a continuation warrant.  A warrant is required for each extension year and must be made before the year commences. The responsibility for seeking an extension of service in good time rests with each district justice although the standard practice is for the Department of Justice to advise a district justice about nine months in advance of his 65th birthday of the need to apply to the committee for a formal extension of service under the 1949 Act if he wishes to be continued in office beyond that date.  If the justice requests an extension of service the matter is referred to the committee for attention.  The consultation with the Minister for Justice required under the Act normally takes place by formal correspondence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the Bill is to enable the committee I mentioned to make a warrant retrospectively in a case where such a warrant was not made in due course through error or oversight.  That, in fact, is what happened in one particular case.  No application was made for an extension of service in the case of a district justice who reached the age of 65 in 1984 and no warrant was made.  The Bill is designed to remedy that problem by <Col N="880" /> providing a means of having a warrant made now.</P>
    <P>I now propose to indicate to the House the precise circumstances in which that omission occurred.  The district justice in question is Mr. Séamus Noel Mahon who was appointed as a temporary justice of the District Court in October 1976 and as a permanent justice in May 1977.  He reached the normal retirement age of 65 years in January 1984.  He should before that date have applied for a continuation warrant but did not do so and a warrant was not made.  As I have already indicated, normal practice is for the Department to remind a district justice well in advance of the need to apply for a warrant. A reminder was not given in this case, however, because of a mistake in departmental records.  Mr. Mahon first applied for appointment in April 1973 and in his application form he gave his year of birth as 1920.  This was recorded in departmental records.  In January 1977 Mr. Mahon submitted a birth certificate which showed his year of birth as 1919 but the discrepancy was not noticed and the incorrect year of birth remained in departmental records.  Warrants were, in fact, made for subsequent years but I am advised that these have no effect because of the critical absence of a warrant to cover the first year after Mr. Mahon reached his 65th birthday.</P>
    <P>I am advised that in the absence of a valid continuation warrant for each year after his 65th birthday Mr. Mahon has not been a duly appointed district justice since he reached his 65th birthday. Consequently, his decisions in court since then are invalid and his service since then cannot count for pay, superannuation or other service benefits.  I am also advised that, under the law as it stands, the committee I mentioned have no power to issue a certificate retrospectively and that is why the provisions proposed in this Bill are necessary.</P>
    <P>In the period since January 1984 Mr. Mahon has dealt with some 8,000 criminal cases, 74,000 Road Traffic Act cases, 1,100 family law cases, 11,000 liquor licensing cases and 17,500 other civil cases.  Penalties he imposed included <Col N="881" /> approximately 40,000 fines, imprisonment/detention in relation to some 1,250 offences, and disqualifications or endorsements for some 3,700 Road Traffic Act offences.  Clearly the public interest would be served best by enacting legislation to allow for validation of such a wide range of cases.  It is inevitable that there should be some doubts about the wisdom of doing this for criminal cases. I am satisfied, however, that it would not be in the public interest to make an exception.  The convictions in criminal cases must be presumed to have been decided in good faith on the evidence presented and since the normal appeal mechanism was available to any person dissatisfied with the decision there can be no valid argument as to the merits of any convictions which were not appealed or, if appealed, upheld on appeal.  It would be quite wrong, in my view, that a person, who, for example, was convicted for drunken driving and had been disqualified should benefit from this technical omission by having the disqualification lifted and any fines returned to him.  Apart from criminal cases there is a range of decisions made in civil cases including family law cases. It is clearly in the public interest that decisions made in such cases should stand on the basis that they were made in good faith on the evidence presented.  Otherwise serious hardship could result.  There is, however, in the Bill a specific saver for the possible infringement of a constitutional right.  This is similar to a provision in the Garda Síochána Act, 1979 which, Deputies will be aware, was also in the nature of validating legislation. The effect of the provision is to emphasise that it is not the intention of the Bill to deprive anyone of a constitutional right. It would be open to any person who considered that the Bill did conflict with a constitutional right to seek redress in the courts.</P>
    <P>The Bill, as I have indicated will enable the committee to make the necessary warrants in the kind of situation we have to deal with now.  An alternative approach would have been to have a provision directly validating Mr. Mahon's <Col N="882" /> position as and from January 1984.  There are two reasons for not adopting this approach.  First, I think it important to preserve the concept that all extensions of service of district justices should be considered and granted, if appropriate, by the committee set up under the 1949 Act.  In this way the independent nature of the process is retained.  The second reason is to provide a mechanism by which errors or omissions made in the future may be corrected without the need to come back to this House for new legislation. This is not to seek to justify in any way the acts or omissions which have led to the present problem.  I have set out fully what did happen and it is for Deputies to draw their own conclusions as to any culpability involved.  However, I can assure Deputies that there has been a full review of administrative practices within the Department of Justice so as to avoid in future any contribution that these practices may have made to the present problem. It is, of course, impossible to guarantee that no error or oversight of any kind will be made in the future at any stage of the proceedings, whether by a district justice, the Department, the committee or any other body, and it is to provide against that eventuality that I consider this Bill should be adopted.</P>
    <P>A feature of the Bill is the provision under which Mr. Mahon's service since January 1984 can be validated for pay, superannuation and other service benefits. We have a situation where a person has sat on the District Court bench for more than four years and performed all the duties required to be performed by a justice.  It would be unfair, given the background, to deprive that person of this service for pay, superannuation and other purposes.</P>
    <P>However much we may regret the circumstances which gave rise to this measure I am satisfied that there are convincing public interest and humanitarian reasons for adopting it.  I am satisfied that this measure is the appropriate one in the circumstances and I therefore commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>Usually at the end of a <Col N="883" /> Second Stage speech by the Minister it is left to the Opposition spokespersons to commence their contributions either than by welcoming the legislation or by indicating their intention to oppose it.  This is an unusual situation in so far as Fine Gael will not be welcoming the legislation, nor will they be opposing it.  We will not be introducing amendments to it either.  It is technical legislation which in the circumstances should get the support of the House.  It is unfortunate that the circumstances are such that legislation is necessary to correct any error, omission or oversight on the part of the powers that be.  It is unfortunate that the matter should have had to come before the House.</P>
      <P>The powers referred to by the Minister to issue a warrant are laudable.  After reaching the age of 65 there is a provision whereby a district justice can apply on an annual basis to continue in office, having regard to the health, etc. of the justice but it is clear that due to an oversight the necessary warrant did not issue in this case.  The members of the special committee who have power to issue warrants include the Chief Justice, the President of the High Court and the Attorney General. All of these people are most definitely beyond reproach and I would not like the feeling to come from this House that there was any error or omission on their part.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was interested to hear the Minister assure the House that following the year in which the discrepancy was made the normal channels were undertaken in so far as a warrant did issue.  One point made by the Minister which I would like tightened up related to the fact that the warrant issued after formal correspondence between the committee, the applicant and the Minister.  If there was something more than formal correspondence, for example, a meeting by way of oral hearing between the Minister, the committee and the applicant, perhaps the problem which has given rise to the peculiar difficulties in this case would not arise again.  I take it that the reminder from the Department of Justice did issue <Col N="884" /> to the district justice in, I think, 1985, as would have been normal in these cases. I should like the Minister to be able to give an assurance that any orders made by the district justice in question since 1984 would be validated and that there were no circumstances under which confusion could arise from this legislation. Unfortunately, though, that cannot happen for the simple reason that we are now recognising that there was an error or oversight and that, in fact, a district justice sat on the bench without being validly appointed.  I believe the best we can do in these circumstances is to enact the legislation, which is before the House today.</P>
    <P>Section 1 (2) (a) of the Bill is the global section of the Bill.  It attempts to validate everything that was purported to have been done while that justice was on the bench.  I believe that is as far as we can go.  I have sympathy with the Minister and his Department in their efforts to try to redress this difficulty.  The Minister has quite rightly left a valve in section 1 (3). This is not a concession in the legislation because under our Constitution it is something we must always guarantee.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that an element of confusion has arisen in relation to this legislation.  This is particularly dangerous in view of the fact that this district justice was assigned to District No. 15, the District Court area which initiated a number of extradition cases as well as a number of serious criminal matters since 1984.  Of course, we in Fine Gael respect at all times the right of the Government of the day to appoint a district justice to the bench.  This is a matter about which there has been some debate in recent times and many people believe that this system should be changed.  I do not agree with that.  I believe it is the duty, and should be prerogative, of the Government to appoint people to serve on the District Court.  However, I should like the Government to have due regard at all times that a person, be they a solicitor or a barrister, has fulfilled more than the criteria of serving ten years in practice. It is very important that they look at the suitability, level of experience and <Col N="885" /> adaptability of these appointees to their jobs and the responsibilities which are being placed on them.</P>
    <P>Perhaps it would be no harm for the Government to consider increasing the number of district justices having regard to the number of cases being heard in the District Courts.  It is interesting to read that District No. 15 alone has dealt with an enormous number of cases since 1984, some of them petty, some of them serious.  The Government should perhaps consider appointing younger people and more women to the bench.  However, I am sure that is a matter for another day.</P>
    <P>Obviously the most important aspect of this Bill is the validation of the orders which were made by this district justice since 1984.  The Minister was correct in saying that the only course open is an absolute validation of what has taken place.  This would be in the public interest.  If one looks at the cases which were referred to by the Minister one will see that during the hearing of these cases there was an acceptance by all parties in both civil and criminal matters that the district justice was duly appointed and that each case was judged on its own merits and not on the basis that it was heard before a district justice.  From that point of view the only course open to us at this time is to legislate in so far as we can for the validation of those orders. There may be some constitutional difficulties on that point but we should do whatever we can so that the committee can backdate the warrant in order to validate everything that has taken place in the past.  If we were to take any other course of action we would be doing a great disservice to the community and to all concerned.  If we had a scenario whereby all convictions in that area since January 1984 could be overturned the practical difficulties would be enormous. One has only to look at one simple aspect of this.  If one takes an average of £50 for each of the 40,000 fines, how could the Exchequer go about returning £2 million to people who answered charges before a court and were duly convicted?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>The circumstances are different in so far as the merits of the case are such that they were judged as though there was or was not a conviction.  An appeal mechanism was also there and anybody who was not satisfied with the decision had the opportunity to appeal to the Circuit Court.  Many people opted to do that and had their convictions either upheld or overturned.</P>
      <P>The District Court was initially set up as the Court of Petty Sessions.  Now it deals with licensing, debt collection, family law, civil cases up to £2,500 and road traffic cases.  Even extradition cases are now being initiated through the District Court.  Some serious crime is also being dealt with.  While we are discussing this matter I would ask the Minister to look again at the system of on-the-spot fines.  I fail to see why we cannot have amending legislation to avoid the complete waste of time in having a number of gardaí sitting in the District Court waiting to deal with two or three summonses for speeding.</P>
      <P>I would ask the Minister to assure the House of the global nature of section 1 (2) (a).  That must be the crucial element, otherwise we are in difficulty. It is unfortunate that this legislation has had to be brought before the House.  The error or oversight was such as to assure everybody here that there was no element of sharp practice involved.  I hope it will not happen again and that this legislation, having being passed, will not allow the Minister or the special committee of which he spoke to go easy on any of their duties.  Formal correspondence between the parties is not sufficient.  Each application should be considered by way of full hearing.  It is important that the Department should be ever vigilant in the handling of these matters because of the very serious consequences that can result.  Fine Gael support the measure without amendment because of the technical nature of the Bill.  I hope no hardship will accrue as a result.</P>

      <P>I should also like to express grave reservations about this Bill, which is not one that can be welcomed. It has obviously been put together in a hurry and appears to be an impersonal legal measure, but in fact it is designed to undo a major mistake which has been made in the Department of Justice in relation to a particular district justice.  It is a pity the Minister for Justice is not here to face up to the problem.  I realise official business can take a Minister for Justice away from the House at inopportune times but it is a pity he is not able to be here today.</P>
      <P>The mistake which has been outlined by the Minister for Social Welfare was originally made under a Coalition Minister but continued under a Fianna Fáil Minister.  The double trouble we have experienced under the two Governments points to a slipshod method in the administration of the courts and the whole Department of Justice.  This, in tandem with the mistakes discovered and dealt with last night in relation to extradition, cannot be allowed to continue.  It points to a real difficulty within the Department of Justice and the Department of Foreign Affairs in keeping an eye on matters which are their responsibility.</P>
      <P>District justices have a normal retiring age of 65.  The Courts of Justice (District Courts) Act, 1949 provided for an annual extension of a justice's tenure on foot of annual warrants made by a committee consisting of the Chief Justice, the President of the High Court and the Attorney General, as if he had not enough to do. This committee is required to consult with the Minister for Justice in relation to each warrant they propose to issue. The warrant is expressed by section 2 (2) of the 1949 Act to be one which continues the justice in office.  It is not a fresh appointment.  It can only be made in respect of an existing justice who, at the time the warrant is made, is already duly appointed and has not ceased to hold office.  A second or subsequent annual extension warrant under section 2 (3) of the 1949 Act must be issued before the expiry of the previous warrant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where a district justice reaches the age <Col N="888" /> of 65 without a warrant being made in respect of him or reaches his sixty-sixth or subsequent birthday without a renewal warrant being made, he ceases to be a district justice and, as the law stands, is not eligible to receive a further warrant under the 1949 Act.  Once a justice's continuity of office is broken, the procedure of the 1949 Act is incapable of restoring his judicial capacity.  Having reached the age of 65 he is also ineligible for appointment <i>de novo</i>.  Consequently the maintenance of continuity is, as the law stands, an absolute necessity for a district justice past 65 years.  The onus of keeping such continuity is a heavy responsibility.  It appears that that responsibility was not complied with in at least one case in recent years.  That is the fault of those whose duty it was to keep these procedures under review.</P>
    <P>The administration of justice is restricted by Article 34 of the Constitution to being carried out in courts established by law by judges appointed in the manner provided by the Constitution.  No valid administration of justice can be carried out in bodies other than courts or by persons other than duly appointed judges.  The appointment of judges can only be done by the President, under Article 35.1 of the Constitution acting on the advice of the Government.  District justices are judges for the purposes of Articles 34 and 35.  Thus where a person who is not a judge purports to act as a judge and to administer justice under Article 34, the purported administration of justice is a nullity in constitutional terms.</P>
    <P>One might go so far as to compare the operation of courts under a justice who is not duly appointed with the attempts at illegal courts which we find among illegal organisations.  I do not say this lightly.  We are taking very lightly this Bill and its attempts to deal with the problem caused by a person who has not been properly appointed but yet has dealt with thousands of cases.  It is not good enough to take the matter lightly.</P>
    <P>It is not open to the Oireachtas to deem a person to be a judge.  A person appointed to be a judge must be <Col N="889" /> appointed by the President and must thereafter make a declaration.  He only holds office for the duration of his term of office.  Once his term of office expires, he ceases to be a judge and cannot become a judge again except by reappointment.</P>
    <P>The stark fact is that a justice who, whether by deliberation or inadvertence, reaches and exceeds his retirement age without extension of his term, ceases to be a judge.  He does not become &ldquo;a judge in suspense&rdquo;.  The Constitution does not admit of quasi-judges.  At any given time, a person is or is not a judge.  Where, by error, the machinery of the 1949 Act is not operated in time, the person affected ceases to be a judge.</P>
    <P>It would of course be open to the Oireachtas to provide that a person who formerly held judicial office and had ceased to be a judge would be eligible for reappointment under Article 35.1.</P>
    <P>It is not open to the Oireachtas itself to pass an Act to retrospectively &ldquo;deem&rdquo; a person who had ceased to be a judge to have continued as a judge.  That would be to attempt in retrospect to clothe as the due administration of justice acts which were not such at the time they were done.  If the Oireachtas cannot retrospectively deem Acts to amount to a valid administration of justice, it follows that no decision of a statutory committee can retrospectively transform a former judge into a serving judge.  Accordingly the effect of section 1 (2) of the Bill is a nullity in law in so far as it purports to deem any act by any person who was not at the date of its closing a judge to be the administration of justice in a court established by law by a judge.</P>
    <P>Section 1 (3) seems to imply that the constitutional rights of citizens may have a limited circumscribing effect on section 1 (2).  In fact, section 1 (3) would render null any purported judicial determination of any rights in a manner which amounts to an administration of justice, creating a doubly unconstitutional aspect to the Bill.</P>
    <P>Persons who have been adversely affected by a purported but unconstitutional administration of justice, <Col N="890" /> whether by inadvertence or not, are entitled legally to regard the proceedings as a nullity.  Whereas they may not now be able to recover fines paid, they can, if in custody, be set at liberty.  Their licences, if revoked, may be treated by them as valid.  It would, of course, be open to this House to confirm licences granted without jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>It seems that the best this Bill can do is (a) to indemnify those who have relied on the acts of the former justice, and (b) to make any such justice eligible for reappointment.  It is not possible to achieve the effect of section 1 (2) (a) of the Bill by law is so far as that clause attempts to confer the status of due administration of justice on any act of a person who was not for the time being a judge.</P>
    <P>Every citizen has a constitutional right not to have his rights varied by a judicial process unless that is done by a judge and in a court.  Thus section 1 (3) means that no decision which adversely affected anyone's constitutional rights on a continuing basis can be validated by the Bill.  Nor can the retrospective issuance of warrants under section 1 (1) make a judge out of a person who in law has ceased to be a judge.  To achieve that end, the Bill would have to make the person eligible for appointment once more a judge and the President would have to appoint him again.</P>
    <P>This Bill, therefore, is an empty husk. It tries to achieve the impossible.  It purports to attempt the retrospective extension of a judge's tenure which had expired and could only be renewed by a new appointment.  It attempts to give to a committee a power which this House could not exercise on its own account.  If it were open to this House to deem retired judges to have continued in office or to authorise a committee to retrospectively continue their period of office, the monopoly of appointment given to the President acting on the advice of Government would be broken.</P>
    <P>The only effect of warrants under the 1949 Act is to continue a justice in office. They cannot be used by this House to &ldquo;bridge&rdquo; a discontinuity or to revive that which had ceased to be.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="891" /> The Bill is hurriedly drafted, misconceived in law, ineffectual in content, and deserving of reference to the Supreme Court lest the original error made in the Department of Justice, whose responsibility it was to ascertain the true facts and to act on them, should be compounded by further constitutional blunders.</P>
    <P>It is worth noting that the justice in respect of whom this Bill was introduced sat in the early stages of a significant extradition case.  Providence kept him from making a final order in the matter. The mind boggles at the damage that could have been done to our standing had such a void order been made.  We ought not tempt providence twice.  This House should not compound the original error by legislating for &ldquo;error on stilts&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to the area District Justice Mahon covered, area No. 15.  It is quite incredible that such an area has been covered for four years without the proper status of a justice in the District Court.  Thirteen towns in six counties have been dealt with in area No. 15, including such large towns as Carlow, Portarlington, Portlaoise, Athy, Roscrea, Rathdowney, Templemore and others.  The mind boggles at the numbers of cases that have been dealt with and the importance of some of those cases, whether they be criminal or family law cases.  You cannot run away from the problem by simply saying we will wave a magic wand.</P>
    <P>As a footnote, the legal remedy for a person who suspects that they have been tried by a &ldquo;non-judge&rdquo; is to apply for an order quashing the decision by way of judicial review.  This procedure, known as <i>Quo Warranto,</i> by what warrant, is only open to those who make application within three months of the purported decision.  This is provided for in the rules of the superior courts.  In many cases, fines and other decisions would not now be capable of being quashed by reason of the lapse of time.</P>
    <P>The absurdity of this Bill is that it would require a committee to attempt in retrospect to assess the capacity of a <Col N="892" /> person to make a judicial decision.  It would also require the committee to consult with the Minister in relation to such a finding.  Were any doubts to arise that at sometime during a period of years the justice had ceased to be fit, we would have the absurd spectacle that some decisions would be retrospectively validated while others made at different times would not.  Not only that but the retrospective analysis of the justice's fitness must be concerned not with his continuing state of health but with his state of health immediately prior to each birthday from 65 to 69.</P>
    <P>The Bill acknowledges, in section 1 (3), that what it is doing is unconstitutional, in the recognition of the difficulties that may arise out of passing of this Bill.  We know this has been brought to light because some person who was the subject of a decision by a district justice adverted to it and a case has been set aside.  Perhaps others have also.  We must face up to this difficulty.  It is not simply good enough to pretend that we do not have a Constitution or that we do not have the laws that have been adhered to up to now.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the practice of almost automatic extension of service for district justices has caused a slipshod approach to obtaining warrants.  I would like to ask the Minister what is the reasoning behind the reliance on district justices over the normal retirement age in a large number of cases.  I would ask him to consider the alternative approaches I have suggested.</P>
    <P>The Bill before us could have been taken straight from the pages of Gilbert and Sullivan's &ldquo;Trial by Jury&rdquo; or &ldquo;The Mikado&rdquo;.  Unfortunately, it is more like a comedy of errors than a Bill and I do not say that lightly.  We in the Progressive Democrats have grave doubts about the Bill.  That is not to say that we would not wish that the provisions contained in it would not take effect.  We wish they could take effect but we have grave doubts about that.  At the very least the Bill should be sent to the Supreme Court to test its constitutionality.  That would be a wise move in the circumstances, if the Bill passes this House.  I fail to see how <Col N="893" /> it could be adequately amended so as to make any real difference and therefore I will not be pressing any amendments.  I would ask the Minister to take seriously the real doubts about the Bill and about its efficacy, to face up to and not to try to hide the problems that have been created by the mistakes that have been made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>As an interesting aside before remarking on the Bill itself, I should say it is interesting to see what is the workload of a typical district justice, as recited by the Minister in the course of his introductory remarks.  It is indeed a remarkable one.  Apparently since 1984 Mr. Mahon dealt with 8,000 criminal cases, 74,000 Road Traffic Act cases, 1,100 family law cases, 11,000 liquor licensing cases and 17,500 other civil cases.  That is a remarkable workload cited by any standard.  Many people who are often critical of district justices should have regard to the workload they carry, very often in difficult circumstances and inadequate court accommodation.  One would have to pay tribute to the District Court and the work it does up and down the country in maintaining the bread and butter role of the administration of our judicial system.</P>
      <P>The events disclosed in this Bill are nothing short of horrific.  I can only sympathise with the Minister in the appalling position in which he finds himself, the dilemma that must have been faced by him in deciding what to do about this clearly was horrendous.  The mind boggles as to what was the right way to tackle it, whether one should have accepted that something very serious had gone wrong in the administration of justice here &mdash; something rare, very exceptional &mdash; meet it and remedy it so far as one could in so far as people were adversely affected by the decisions of that justice, and I put the word &ldquo;justice&rdquo; in inverted commas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I presume the Minister did not and was advised not to take that line because of the sheer weight of cases that Mr. Mahon had determined in his unauthorised period in office from January 1984.  I will say one thing for starters.  It was a mistake <Col N="894" /> to have introduced a general Bill here in the way this one was done that would seek to cover a generality of cases where there had been slip-ups of this nature in the appointment of a judge.  If the decision had been taken to introduce a Bill I would have thought that the best course would have been to have limited the provisions of the Bill to the one case of Mr. Mahon alone, have it a Mr. Mahon rectification Bill, if one were to tackle it in that way.  I do not think one should legislate in advance, <i>in futuro,</i> for mistakes of that kind.  They ought to be regarded as once-in-a-lifetime that would never recur.  A Bill confining itself to the specific case of Mr. Mahon, mentioning him by name, would have been altogether more appropriate.</P>
    <P>It is noteworthy that the Minister in the course of his remarks did not say that he had taken advice on this issue from the Attorney General as to the validity of this Bill from a constitutional point of view.  One would have expected the Minister to have said in the course of his introductory remarks that the Government had sought the advice of the law officer of the Government and other law officers as to the constitutionality of this Bill and had been advised that it was constitutional.  As the Minister did not say that, there are two possible alternatives. One is that the Minister did not seek the advice of the law officer of the Government, the Attorney General, at all.  The other is that the Minister did seek the advice of the Attorney General on the Bill and that that advice was adverse, namely, that there was a very large question mark over its constitutionality.</P>
    <P>I would find it totally incredible that in these circumstances in a Bill of this type the Minister and the Government did not seek the advice of the Attorney General. For the life of me I could not imagine that the advice of the Attorney General was not sought on this issue.  If that be so, then I was driven unavoidably to the second conclusion, which is that the advice of the Attorney General was sought and was either adverse or cast a very serious doubt as to the constitutionality of the Bill.  That is the <Col N="895" /> inevitable conclusion to which I have been driven.</P>
    <P>In fairness to the Minister I should say that in the course of his remarks he more or less concedes that there is a constitutional doubt when he said:</P>
    <P>It would be open to any person who considered that the Bill did conflict with a constitutional right to seek redress in the courts.</P>
    <P>&mdash; thereby, as it were, inviting any person who had their doubts to seek a constitutional decision on this Bill.</P>
    <P>I do not think that this House should introduce a Bill and pass it in the normal way when a constitutional question mark to that extent hangs over it.  At the very least, when a question mark as to the constitutionality of a Bill arises to that serious an extent it seems to me that the Minister should be telling the House that he will arrange to have the Bill referred, before adoption or enactment, to the President for examination and referral to the Supreme Court as to its constitutionality. I do not know whether the Minister intends doing so.  My request to him would be that he should seriously consider doing so, that it is not good practice for the House to bring in legislation when implicit in it is so serious a doubt as that expressed in the Minister's introductory remarks.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether or not the Bill is constitutional.  I have grave doubts about it.  It would take people with greater knowledge of constitutional law than I to determine that issue.  That case must be unique.  That material I have examined certainly finds no prior case that comes anywhere near parallel to this one.  I would think it must be unique both here and in the United Kingdom.  Deputy Kelly is more learned in this line of country than am I.  When he contributes he may have some record of something parallel, but certainly I cannot find any.</P>
    <P>It boils down to the question of retrospective legislation, something which is always unsafe.  Article 15.5 of the Constitution itself says:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="896" /> The Oireachtas shall not declare acts to be infringements of the law which were not so at the date of their commission.</P>
    <P>I do not think that quite meets the kind of circumstances we have here.  I do not think the Bill quite purports to do that. There is an interesting comment in Deputy Kelly's book on the Constitution in page 72, in which he is quoting Mr. Justice Cave in a case called <i>Re</i> Raison where he says:</P>
    <P>There is an old and well-known saying with regard to new laws, that you are not by a new law to affect for the worse the position in which a man already finds himself at the time when the law is actually passed:</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that if this law we are debating here today was passed it would adversely affect very many people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>

      <P>Mind you, if it had any effect at all it would affect them adversely.  Mind you, it would also have a beneficial effect on an awful lot of other people.  There would be winners and losers if the Bill was found to be valid and constitutional.  I have my doubts about that.</P>
      <P>Wade and Phillip's book on constitutional law, which of course deals with English constitutional law where the considerations are different, had this to say on page 36 dealing with retrospective legislation:</P>
      <P>Retrospective laws are, however, <i>prima facie</i> of questionable policy and contrary to the general principle that legislation by which the conduct of mankind is to be regulated ought, when introduced for the first time, to deal with future acts and ought not to change the character of past transactions carried out upon the faith of the then existing law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are faced with a very difficult situation. Deputy Colley referred to Gilbert <Col N="897" /> and Sullivan and, to use another quote from Gilbert and Sullivan, I do not know whether even quiet and calm deliberation here can disentangle this particular knot. I have grave doubts that it can.  It would have been better not to have introduced the measure but to have faced up to the fact that a drastic situation had occurred and to have dealt with that and provided whatever funds were necessary to meet the defective situations arising from the unlawful decisions given in that period by Mr. Mahon.  There may be people in prison today who were sentenced by a person who was not a judge.  That is a remarkable occurrence.  Can one come along now under our Constitution and validate that?</P>
    <P>Deputy Colley was taken with the point that section 1 (2) is talking about one thing deeming to be another and that his actions are deemed to be as valid as if the warrant had been duly made.  That of itself would not necessarily adversely affect the Bill if that was all it was, because one finds all the time in Acts of the Oireachtas and in Parliamentary and ministerial orders statements deeming one thing to be another.  There is nothing wrong with that.  The difference is that those deemings are <i>in futuro</i> and they would operate from the time when that law was passed.  I remember reading once that when one sees the expression that one thing is deemed to be another it sets up warning bells, because it means that that thing is not that thing but is a different thing altogether.  This expression was used very frequently in the wartime emergency powers legislation.  I remember reading a long time ago that one regulation was brought in which said something ridiculous like &ldquo;for the purpose of this regulation sewing machines shall be deemed to be dog biscuits&rdquo;.  That kind of ridiculous statement appears in this sort of thing.  That alone would not affect the issue.  The nub of the problem is that we are attempting to validate sentences of imprisonment, decrees of a court, by a person who undoubtedly was not a judge appointed under the terms of the Constitution when he made those decrees.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="898" /> Section 3 (1) of the Bill is the most remarkable section I have ever seen in a Bill.  It provides that if there is anything unconstitutional here it does not apply.  I do not know whether or not we can do that.  That is a most remarkable product from a parliamentary draftsman and I do not see how it can possibly stand up.</P>
    <P>Section 1 (e) talks about the committee being satisfied that the person was not when the warrants or warrants aforesaid fell to be made, suffering from any disability which rendered him unfit.  This, in other words, is putting the committee in a position, quite an appreciable time after the events, of deciding that a person was fit at that time.  How can the committee possibly know that, two years later?  They could not possibly know whether he was if it two years ago.  They can talk to him and examine him now and decide now whether he is fit for the age exemption, but how can they be expected to decide that he was fit two years ago?  Quite frankly, it escapes me.</P>
    <P>I do not want to condemn any one or say where the responsibility lies for this appalling mess as that will solve nothing. I sympathise with the Minister and the Government in their position on this issue.  I realise what induced the Minister to bring forward this Bill, having regard to the enormous number of cases determined by Mr. Mahon.  All of us in the House will do anything we reasonably can to assist the Minister in trying to rectify matters.  If we were satisfied that the thing was in order there would be no problem.  I would ask the Minister to assure us, when he replies, that the question of the referral of the Bill to the Supreme Court will be taken up before the Bill becomes law.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of The Workers' Party I signal that we do not support this legislation.  In the event of a division today we do not intend opposing it.  We take the view that the legislation is wrong in its direction and it cannot achieve what it sets out to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The blame in this affair rests full square on the Minister.  It is the duty of Ministers to accept responsibility for all that goes <Col N="899" /> on in their Departments.  It has already been indicated that during this saga there was a change of Government and at least one change of Minister.  However, the error must be looked at critically by any legislator or any one concerned with the proper administration of justice in this country.</P>
    <P>Look at how simple a job we have asked the Minister, through his Department, to do.  At a guess we are talking about 100 judges in the State at any one time.  We have a complete administrative Department of Government to ensure that documentation, the tenure of office and the qualifications for office are correct. It is not a very big job and it is unforgivable that errors of this sort should arise.  In the media, leading from the publication of the Bill, certain indications were given that the fault in some way rests with the District Justice in question. It appears that in the initial documentation submitted in 1977 there was an error of one year in date of birth.  One might ask whether or not at that stage because of the importance of age in the tenure and conditions of office a person would not be required to submit a basic birth record when applying for the post and that somehow somewhere that document would correspond with the other. There was an error of one year, but it appears that after 1984 individual applications were made in the Department to this committee for extensions on a yearly basis and that this was done on at least three occasions.  Again one asks what was asked for and was not a birth certificate sought and referred to at this stage?  I understand that quite some time ago the justice in question had submitted a birth certificate.  That is confirmed in the Minister's speech as being as long ago as January 1977.  Surely some explanation must be given beyond merely saying that there was a misrecord in the Department, because this matter was fully dealt with on at least three if not four occasions when extensions were required.  I have come to the firm conclusion that first the root of the problem is the rather facile way in which extensions appear to be granted <Col N="900" /> for the asking and, second, the very unsatisfactory and somewhat slipshod approach to dealing with the District Courts generally in the administration of law within this jurisdiction.  I will come to that shortly.</P>
    <P>The message must go very clearly from this House today that we as legislators are completely dissatisfied with the nature of these events. It is an incredibly simple job asked of the Minister and his staff and it is unforgivable that an error like this should or can arise.  The drift of this legislation is to give power to this committee to appoint retrospectively.  I am opposed to that.  I do not believe we should be legislating in a general way for future errors.  The approach should be that the Minister gets his house in order and, more particularly, gets his Department in order.  It is a view widely held that the Department of Justice is a difficult place to deal with.  As a practising lawyer who has gone on deputations to the Department over the years, I certainly hold that view.  It is even said that Ministers in office encounter difficulties.  It is time we found a Minister who is prepared to take charge of the ship and take responsibility for everything that goes on there.  He should be seen to be and he should be in full control of the affairs of his Department. It is time this type of administrative sloppiness was dealt with once and for all.  This is not the first time errors of this sort have been made in this area.  Only a few years ago a member of the Bar was appointed to the District Court and within a year through litigation it was established that the unfortunate man was not qualified to take office and had to be removed.</P>
    <P>The point has to be made that it is unnecessary to provide legislation for the prospect of future errors.  Consequently, the point made by Deputy Taylor is one with which we agree.  The approach of this legislation should have been to deal with this specific instance, and the way to deal with the future is to ensure that a simple straightforward affair is dealt with competently and errors like this should not be allowed to arise.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="901" /> The Minister gave two reasons he thinks the Bill is better drawn in general terms but in my view neither reason stands up.  He spoke about legislation in this instance and in all others &mdash; although there should never be another case like this &mdash; enabling the committee appointed under the 1949 Act to make the actual decision.  Those decisions have been made with regard to Mr. Mahon.  Nobody denies the work he has done over the years and no one begrudges him his entitlements to remuneration and all other rights; but it is unnecessary at this late stage to ask the committee to make this decision because under the Act the committee consult the Minister.  The notion of total independence is not even in the original legislation.</P>
    <P>What we should have been dealing with today is a simple section enabling the Minister to seek to validate those conditions and decisions which he is empowered to do &mdash; I have grave doubts as to what they are but they would relate to remuneration and other rights accruing from time spent on the bench by Mr. Mahon.</P>
    <P>The second reason the Minister gave was that it would provide for future errors.  I totally reject that approach.  He said:</P>
    <P>The second reason is to provide a mechanism by which errors or omissions made in the future may be corrected......</P>
    <P>We should not be legislating on the basis that the Minister is going to, is likely to, or could make errors in the future, particularly when one considers the simplicity of the operation &mdash; a mere reference to records retained publicly, a birth certificate, relating that to documentation on file and making what, with care, would take a few minutes in any departmental office, that is a decision. That is what we are dealing with here. We should not be asked to legislate on the basis that future errors could arise. They should not.  For that reason I believe the approach to this legislation is wrong.</P>
    <P>The legislation is seeking retrospectively to validate the decisions <Col N="902" /> already made or taken.  Curiously, the Minister makes a plea, not as a legislator but in the guise of an extra court constitutional lawyer seeking in some, I believe, vain way to influence future inevitable constitutional actions on this legislation, seeking to make the case that because decisions were made in good faith on evidence and that there was an appeal mechanism available, they should not be lawfully challenged.  Those decisions were constitutional errors, flawed constitutionally at the time, and I do not believe any legislation can put them right.</P>
    <P>There is an area of law dealing with the impact of the breach of constitutional rights on the position of accused persons where the formula of the knowing breach was made irreparable by a court and where in the balance between maintenance of the Constitution and the common good the accused person must be protected.  If a knowing breach of constitutional right is made, then the person must be freed if it is a question of liberty, or it must be put right if it is a question of penalty other than imprisonment.</P>
    <P>The law is clear, as I understand it, in defining what is a knowing breach of the Constitution.  Where law has been laid down by this House, where it has been sought to be enacted and put into effect by the Minister and by the justice sitting, there is no scope to suggest that this was not other than a knowing breach of the Constitution.  For that reason I believe the judicial interpretation of the courts, where they have said that mere oversight does not equate with unknowing, imposes a positive duty on all of us to ensure that the Constitution and its provisions are respected and that mere inadvertance, mistake or oversight will not give an out, an explanation or a justification to the person seeking to suggest that the Constitution was knowingly breached.</P>
    <P>I believe the decisions of District Justice Mahon, as far as the criminal code is concerned, are open to valid challenge by all persons affected and aggrieved, and I do not believe this legislation can <Col N="903" /> interfere in the judicial process.  Consequently, I believe section 1 (3) is superfluous. It is a vain attempt by the Government to dress up in some way a grave error that has huge constitutional and legal consequences.  Statements like the Minister's suggestion that it would be quite wrong if people were now entitled to come to court to seek a remedy in law under the constitution achieve nothing.  I have no great expertise or knowledge with regard to civil cases and our entitlement as legislators to impact on those decisions retrospectively.  I appreciate that different considerations would apply, but as previous speakers have said the matter will ultimately have to be determined by the courts.</P>
    <P>What I believe is wrong, and what this illustrates, is a matter of fact &mdash; the haphazard and slipshod approach to the question of the administration of justice at District Court level generally.  As I have already indicated, an error of this sort was made in the past five years in the appointment of District Justice Murphy, a barrister who simply did not have the qualifications, and any inquiry properly carried out would have established that long before he was put on the bench and subsequently had to be removed.</P>
    <P>Reference has already been made to the method of appointment.  I ask why the Minister has not more regard to the qualifications needed to meet specific jobs, such as family law cases.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Jim Tunney">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that the legislation does not refer to qualifications but rather it refers to age, etc.  I do not think it would be wise to use this legislation as the basis for stretching out too far in that direction.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am making the point, if I am allowed, that I believe this problem is symptomatic of the Department's overall approach to the administration of justice in the District Court.  If the Chair will allow me I would like to give some brief illustrations of this &mdash; the lack of attention given to the establishment of <Col N="904" /> night courts in the District Court; the problem of the proper level of remuneration of those appointed to the District Court bench, which has been a matter of contention; court facilities, the fact that many of our courts are unusable and in some areas are completely inequipped for the elements; and that which is dear to me, the legal aid schemes.  All of these are in a sorry state and reflect a grave indifference at departmental and ministerial level to the quality of justice delivered in the District Court.  The problem we are dealing with today is simply another symptom of that major ailment. The Minister would be well engaged in having a complete review within the Department of all matters affecting the District Court and its operation to ensure that we will not have a repeat in future of an error of this sort.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill opens up a fascinating range of legal problems of a kind the House luckily does not have to concern itself with very often.  I have a lot to say on it and will be drawing, if the House will give me that much patience, on some decided law in areas which, although not squarely in point, are sufficiently analogous to the problems in front of us today to be illuminating.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me offer the House a trailer of the conclusion that I will come to, which is that the matter in front of us is not a national disaster and that well-established principles here entitle us to regard this, by no means certainly as a trivial over-sight but as something with limited consequences and not at all, I think, in practice having the kind of consequences that Deputy Colley as well as Deputies Taylor and McCartan quite rightly explored.  Let me offer the House a simple analogy from the part of the constitutional structure which we ourselves represent.  We are part of the Constitution, the very same as the courts are. Let us suppose there is some irregularity in the composition of a Dáil, of a kind which may very easily be imagined.  Is one seriously to assume that all the works of that Dáil are invalid, and if we were to assume such a thing who is to put them <Col N="905" /> right?  Are we to dissolve the State or to invite in the United Nations?  Let me offer the House in a very short space of time a couple of instances.  The law on eligibility for membership of this House, or most of it, is contained in the Electoral Act, 1923, but that is alluded to, of course not by name, in Article 16.1.1º of the Constitution:</P>
    <P>Every citizen without distinction of sex who has reached the age of twenty-one years, and who is not placed under disability or incapacity by this Constitution or by law, shall be eligible for membership of Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <P>It follows therefore that people who are disqualified or incapacitated by law are not eligible and those two categories &mdash; the House will not expect me to read out the full statutory provisions &mdash; if I may mention them very quickly and roughly, include people who are undergoing certain sentences of imprisonment, imbeciles, persons of unsound mind &mdash; needless to say no such person was ever elected here &mdash; an undischarged bankrupt or a person who has been convicted of corrupt electoral practice.  These people are all disqualified.  Other categories are what is called incapacitated, although the distinction is not very firm, and in the incapacity category seems to refer to one's status or the category to which one belongs rather than to any personal weakness whether culpable or not.  People are incapacitated from being elected here if they are a member of the Defence Force on full pay, a member of the police force on full pay or temporarily or permanently in the Civil Service, unless by the terms of such employment they are expressly permitted to stand and be elected to Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <P>Let us suppose that a Taoiseach is elected by a narrow majority of one, and we have had such cases in the recollection of every Deputy here.  Let us suppose the Government party &mdash; and we will not speculate as to which party is most likely to have the weak links &mdash; by some fluke turned out to contain an apparently elected Deputy who was a bankrupt, another who was a member of the police <Col N="906" /> force, perhaps a plain clothes man in some obscure rookery carrying out some highly sensitive employment which even his party colleagues did not know about, but nevertheless on police pay, and a third, although I do not have to enumerate three as the Taoiseach has only an overall majority of one, but for safe measure let us say the third was in some capacity a member of the permanent Civil Service or even a temporary civil servant serving in a category not specifically regarded as compatible with membership of Dáil Éireann.  Let us say the Taoiseach is elected by a majority of one, or even two, but it subsequently turn out that there are these three weak links, what does that mean?  Let us suppose this comes to light three or four years later and that this Dáil has enacted a whole stack of legislation, taxes have been imposed, disabilities of all kinds imposed, immunities lifted.  Let us suppose that drastic things have been done in external affairs as well as internal matters?  Let us suppose, as is the normal case, 40 statutes a year have been enacted.  Is all of that a nullity when it turns out that these three men or women ought not to have been here and in consequence that there were three non-Deputies among the majority which apparently elected a Taoiseach and in consequence the Government which appeared to have been serving under him is not a Government at all?  Are all these consequences to follow?  Of course, they are not, and this matter has been addressed, admittedly not in great detail but in sufficiently broad and trenchant terms by the Supreme Court in other settings in recent years in such a way as to be illuminating.  I hope before I finish to get a chance to cite these passages to the House.</P>
    <P>Having said that much, I will admit a point made by Deputy Colley on my right and two Deputies on my left.  I will concede that if a situation arises which is unconstitutional or involves a potential loss of citizens' constitutional rights it cannot be put right by a Bill.  I may have stated that proposition over-tersely, over-compendiously, but this House cannot be enacting something to deprive <Col N="907" /> someone of a right which is his constitutionally. If, on the other hand, that constitutional right is a naked, bare right, unsupported by any possibility of ever putting it into effect because it would run foul of the large considerations of public order which lurk beneath &mdash; one's refusal to concede, for example, that all the doings of a Dáil are invalid &mdash; then the House by legislating is not perhaps just beating at the air; it may be putting some shape and order in the best way it can on this fallible collection of 166 men and women of flesh and blood in a situation which has arisen by mistake.</P>
    <P>The Minister said, fair enough, we cannot offer to insure against mistakes or guarantee against them.  That is true and all the huffing and puffing in the world will not change that.  Of course mistakes can be made and have been made in the history of the State.  Deputy McCartan a moment ago mentioned the case of the State at the prosecution of Walshe <i>v.</i> Murphy which is reported in the 1981 <i>Irish Reports,</i> page 275, in which a gentleman who, no doubt inadvertently, was appointed a district justice and did not have enough years in practice to qualify for such appointment under the terms of the statute which was applicable.  I believe it was a mistake made in good faith because that length of time had passed since his call to the Bar.  He had spent some of that time not in active practice but in legal employment in a State office and it was a matter of fair debate whether that qualified as practice.  At any rate, the High Court found against him. I do not think it would be quite right to say they had to get rid of him, but that finding operated to disclose his appointment and not having been valid from the beginning.  He had not been there very long and certainly he had not built up the Titanic score of 17,500 and I forget how many other tens of thousands of cases of various categories, which I find not just admirable as Deputy Taylor said, but next to incredible&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to see that broken down into the average number of cases per day and hour.  I find it hard to believe that a workload of this kind, unless reckoned among the total are automatic actions effectively carried out by a District Court clerk, that number of adjudications of a serious kind where somebody has to bring his mind to bear on two competing points of view, would be within the physical power of a man or woman in that time.  The man Deputy McCartan had in mind, the apparent Justice Murphy, was not there long enough to have built up a workload of that kind and as soon as the proceedings involving his status were initiated he was put in abeyance, so to speak, or allowed to run with the belt off, if that is not a disrespectful expression to use of a district justice.  The total number of people affected by his operations, which I believe were quite innocent, was very small.</P>
      <P>This is a different case.  A genuine honest mistake appears to have been made, on the Department's part certainly and possibly also on the part of the justice, and it is up to us to put the thing right.  I do not think it is necessarily the case that this irregularity must be seen to have invalidated everything done by this gentleman when he was not, in fact, operating as a district justice according to law and consequently was not a judge within the terms of the Constitution.</P>
      <P>We have had cases over the past 15 years which have opened up the whole question under a much broader claim of what happens when something turns out to have been illegal all along.  There is a stack of such cases.  I will not weary the House by enumerating them but I will mention to the House a couple of conspicuous ones.  There was a case in which a Miss de Burca and another lady &mdash; I think her name was Kelly &mdash; successfully challenged the provisions of the 1927 Juries Act&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry, Anderson &mdash; on <Col N="909" /> a number of grounds which are not really here material, partly on the grounds that they effectively or largely excluded women and, much more relevant, they effectively excluded anybody but householders from appearing on a jury.  The judgment is reported in the 1972 report; the case may have been decided a year earlier.  Until then the State had existed for 43 or 44 years operating its jury courts according to the provisions of the 1927 Act, which ever since 1937 at the very latest had been invalid because the Supreme Court held in one of these cases by four out of five that the moment at which invalidity must be seen to date in the case of a pre-Constitution Statute was the date at which that Constitution came into force.  In other words, the Juries Act had been invalid because it was not consistent with the Constitution ever since 29 December 1937.  Think of the thousands, tens of thousands of juries in criminal cases that had been impanelled in those intervening 44 years.  Think, in sterner times from the States's point of view than we now live in, of the sentences which had to be passed by law in consequence of their verdicts.  Think of the persons who suffered capital punishment in consequence of the verdicts of juries which were constituted essentially not from a cross-section of the adult population at large but from a cross-section of the male householders.  You do not have to be either a soft witted loony out of sight &mdash; I beg pardon, I am not talking about the workers &mdash; you do not have to be anti-social and opposed to this sort of society in all its dimensions to see that the kind of jury can be by its very disposition prejudicial, not kindly disposed to people of a different social background and different set of experiences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That seems obvious enough and I could well imagine that case being raised earlier, but it was not raised until 1971.  Was the State now to regard all the things that had been as a consequence of jury verdicts over those 44 years as void, unlawful, illegal?  Leave alone the people who had been hanged in consequence of jury verdicts &mdash; of which I suppose there were a couple of dozen in that period &mdash;<Col N="910" /> how was one to make good even to people who had been in prison or perhaps not even sent to prison but endured the ignominy of a suspended sentence or a heavy fine?  I suppose most of them were not even still alive.  Was the State to regard the most important and drastic end of its judicial arm as having been beating the air but doing so in such a way that a large number of people suffered who should not have suffered for that 44 years?  We could not accept a conclusion, as Chief Justice O'Higgins said.</P>
    <P>I think I will be asked almost at once to move the adjournment of this business. Before I do so let me say that, although I could quite understand the sense of grievance of somebody who might only lately have been prosecuted, tried on indictment before a jury of a kind which now turns out to be unconstitutionally constituted, I do not think any more than a handful of such cases were subsequently raised.  There were one or two on which the point was made but the public at large, although they have no doubt registered the fact of Miss De Burca's will, accepted that there could be no refunding up the river the water which had flowed down and passed under the bridge.  There is a limit to the extent to which that can be done in an orderly State.  That is not intended, I do not mean to offer that, as an umbrella absolution for every irregularity and for every illegality that can be imputed to the State.  Of course I do not do that.  If I were to do that there would be an end of all law.  People must be, in principle, entitled to redress; but when their entitlement to redress, to be relieved from an illegality has not occurred to them before, so to speak, and only emerges as a possibility in consequence of a development which involves not only them but countless other people in numbers so large that, were they all to get justice in the technical sense of the word &mdash; because they may in fact already have had substantial justice &mdash; could the structure of the State sustain it and could ordered society sustain it?</P>

      <P>Tá sé ar intinn agam freagra a thabhairt ar Cheisteanna 2, 16, 17, 23, 25, 33, 40, 42, 47, 48, 50, 51, 52 agus 58 le chéile.  Tugaim faoi ndeara go bhfuil na ceisteanna sin go léir bunaithe ar éilimh a dhein Comhdháil Náisiúnta na Gaeilge leis an Aire sa phlean a d'ullmhaíodar tamall ó shin.</P>
      <P>Phléigh an tAire an plean seo le lucht na Comhdhála le déanaí agus chuir sé in iúl dóibh go bhfuil sé sásta na moltaí i gcoitinne a chur i bhfeidhm de réir mar is cuí áit nach bhfuilid i bhfeidhm cheana féin.  Go ginearálta, tá na moltaí ag teacht le polasaí na Roinne faoi láthair. Ar bhealach, is é sin freagra ar na ceisteanna a cuireadh ach is féidir liom tagairt do na poinntí ar leith de réir a n-ord sa phlean ag an gComhdháil.  Glacaim leis gurb é bunchumas cumarsáide an chéad chuspóir ba chóir a bheith le múineadh na Gaeilge.</P>
      <P>Maidir le pleanáil, tá meitheal oibre sa Roinn, a bhfuil ionadaíocht air ó bhrainsí éagsúla na Roinne, i leith cur chun cinn polasaithe faoin nGaeilge.  Tá comhchoiste ann freisin idir an meitheal oibre sin agus Bord na Gaeilge agus tá fochoiste ann den gcomhchoiste úd chun pleanáil a dhéanamh i leith scolaíochta trí Ghaeilge.</P>
      <P>Tá Rúnaí na Roinne ceapaithe ag an Aire cun polasaí i leith na Gaeilge a chur i bhfeidhm.  Beidh sé faoi cúram ag an Rúnaí polasaí Comhdháil Náisiúnta na Gaeilge a cur chun cinn.</P>
      <P>Ó thaobh líon na ndaltaí ag déanamh lánchúrsa Gaeilge de réir rialacha na Roinne, bunaítear eolas na Roinne ina thaobh sin ar dhearbhú foirmeálta na scoileanna.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Beidh ceist riachtanais na scoileanna Gaeltachta agus na scoileanna lán-Ghaeilge agus freisin an gá go bhfreagródh an siollabas do thimpeallacht na ndaltaí dá gcur san áireamh ag an gCoiste <Col N="917" /> um Aithbhreithniú Curaclam na Bunscoile atá ag obair leo faoi láthair.</P>
    <P>Nuair bhí an siollabas nua don Teastas Sóisearach dá ullmhú, tugadh treoracha soiléire don gcoiste siollabais faoi chomhordú le siollabas Gaeilge na bunscoile. Maidir le haidhmeanna cinnte grádaithe insroichte, tá sé seo lárnach don siollabas nua don Teastas Sóisearach agus beidh sé ina n-aigne freisin ag an gCoiste um Aithbhreithniú Curaclam na Bunscoile. Mar is eol do chách anois, tá siollabas nua Gaeilge don dTeastas Sóisearach nua fógraithe anois do na scoileanna iarbhunoideachais le tosnú an bhliain seo chugainn. Is é cumas cainte agus cumarsáide a bheidh mar phríomhaidhm i gcumadh na siollabas go léir.  Tá sé i gceist cúrsaí inseirbhíse a chur ar fáil le deimhniú go bhfuil tuiscint cheart ar na siollabais nua ag múinteoirí.</P>
    <P>Tacaíonn an Roinn áit is féidir é le scoileanna chun go múinfear ábhair trí Ghaeilge.</P>
    <P>Tá grád C ar pháipéar onóracha na hArdteistiméireachta riachtanach le haghaidh an chomórtais iontrála do na Coláistí Oideachais, maraon le pas ag scrúdú béil.  Is gá go ndéanfadh gach macléinn sna Coláistí Oideachais cúrsa proifisiúnta Gaeilge d'fhonn iad a ullmhú le teagasc na Gaeilge agus le teagasc trí Ghaeilge sa bhunscoil.</P>
    <P>Tá na cáilíochtaí acadúla atá riachtanach do mhúinteoirí Gaeilge i scoileanna cuimsitheacha agus i ngairmscoileanna ar aon dul i gcoitinne leis na cáilíochtaí i bpobalscoileanna.  I gcás meánscoileanna is í an Chomhairle Chláraitheachta, eagras neamhspleách atá curtha ar bun go reachtúil, a leagann síos na cáilíochtaí atá riachtanach chun clárú mar mhúinteoir.</P>
    <P>Tuigtear go bhfuil aonad amháin san Ard-Teastas Oideachais ar fáil trí Ghaeilge sna Coláistí Ollscoile faoi scáth Ollscoil Náisiúnta na hÉireann.</P>
    <P>Bíonn aithbhreithniú leanúnach ar sholáthar cúrsaí tríú leibhéal trí Ghaeilge ar siúl idir mo Roinn-se, an tÚdarás um Ard-Oideachas agus Comhairle Náisiúnta na gCáilíochtaí Oideachais.  Bíonn sé á phlé chomh maith i gcomhthéacs pleananna de chuid Bhord na Gaeilge <Col N="918" /> agus, mar a mhínigh mé, tá socruithe ann a chuireann ar chumas mo Roinne dul i gcomhairle leis an mbord ar bhonn leanúnach.</P>
    <P>Is féidir le heagraíochtaí eile ar nós Chomhdháil Náisiúnta na Gaeilge a mbarúla a chur in iúl do cheann ar bith de na dreamanna atá agam.</P>
    <P>Measaim gur leor na socruithe seo agus nach gá aonad foirmeálta mar a luaitear sa cheist a chur ar bun.</P>
    <P>Cé nach dtugann an córas feidhmithe i ngach ríomhaire an &ldquo;síneadh fada&rdquo; san áireamh, tá bogearraí chuí ar fáil leis an áis seo.  Mar sin, beidh aon trealamh ríomhaireachta a chuirfear ar fáil feasta do scoileanna ar chostas an Stáit in oiriúint lena úsáid trí Ghaeilge.</P>

Seo an chéad cheist atá agam: an bhfuil an tAire sásta go bhfuil caighdeán sásúil á bhaint amach ag ábhair mhúinteoirí sna coláistí ullmhúcháin agus sna coláistí ollscoile, nó an bhfuil sé ar eolas aige, as líon na gcéimithe a tháinig amach as Coláiste na hOllscoile i gCorcaigh i mbliana bhí níos lú ná ocht faoin gcéad de na céimithe sin go raibh Gaeilge mar phríomh-ábhar acu? Bhí breis is 280 céimí a tháinig amach le teastas acu, agus ón líon sin ní raibh ach níos lú ná ocht faoin gcéad go raibh Gaeilge mar ábhar speisialta acu.  An bhfuil aon pholasaí faoi leith ag an Aire anois chun an scéal sin d'athrú nó chun aon leigheas a chur ar an scéal sin?  Sin an chéad cheist.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>B'fhéidir go bhfuil an dá cheist déag sa cheist sin, a Cheann Comhairle.  Ar dtús, glacaim leis an méid atá á rá ag an Teachta faoin méid daoine atá ag déanamh Gaeilge mar phríomh-ábhar anois.  Tá sé soiléir go bhfuil i bhfad níos lú daltaí ag tógáil Gaeilge mar phríomh-ábhar, ar ndóigh, mar ábhar ar bith, ná mar a bhí cúpla bliain ó shin, agus sin rud a bhfuil imní ar gach duine faoi.  Mar gheall ar an gcaighdeán, caithfidh mé a rá go bhfuilimid sásta leis an <Col N="919" /> gcaighdeán atá ag na daltaí atá ag teacht amach as na hollscoileanna.  Ar ndóigh, tá sé soiléir go bhfuil an-obair á déanamh sna ranna Gaeilge sna coláistí ollscoile i gcaoi is go bhfuil an caighdeán chomh maith agus atá sé.</P>
      <P>An cheist eile a luaigh an Teachta faoin gcaighdeán sa teanga féin; is é an fáth go bhfuil an polasaí seo curtha suas ag Comhdháil Náisiúnta na Gaeilge agus an fáth go bhfuil glactha leis ag an Aire, agus, ar ndóigh, tá sé mar aon le polasaí na Roinne faoi láthair, ná go bhfuilimid ag iarraidh an caighdeán a chur chun cinn agus an teanga Ghaeilge agus an teanga labhartha go háirithe, a spreagadh i bhfad níos mó ná mar atá sí ag an am seo.  Mar gheall ar an gceist faoin gcaighdeán sna coláistí oideachais, arís caithfimid a rá go bhfuil an caighdeán go maith, ach aontaím leis an Teachta go mba chóir dó a bheith níos fearr.  Sin é an fáth go bhfuil an-obair á déanamh sa Roinn agus ar na húdaráis eile ag an am seo, chun dul chun cinn níos fearr a dhéanamh.</P>

      <P>Ní hé polasaí Chomhdháil Náisiúnta na Gaeilge atá á phlé againn inniú ach polasaí an Rialtais agus polasaí na Roinne Oideachais ach go háirithe. Ach an cheist seo: deir an tAire liom go bhfuil a fhios aige go bhfuil an scéal mar atá sé ráite agam, agus más mar sin atá an scéal, an féidir leis a insint dom anois díreach cad é an polasaí dearfa atá ag an Roinn Oideachais nó ag an Aire Oideachais chun leigheas a chur ar an scéal faoi mar atá sé faoi láthair?  Creidim go bhfuil a fhios ag an Aire nach féidir an siollabas nua, mar shampla, a chur i bhfeidhm sna meánscoileanna.  Mura mbíonn Gaeilge agus mura mbíonn caighdeán áirithe ag na múinteoirí ní bheidh sé ag na mic léinn.  Tá mé ag iarraidh ar an Aire anois, cad é an polasaí atá ag an Rialtas faoi láthair chun an Ghaeilge agus caighdeán na Gaeilge d'ardú sna coláistí ullmhúcháin agus sna coláistí ollscoile, agus go háirithe sa chúrsa Higher Diploma in Education.  Sin é an rud atá i gceist agam, ach go háirithe.</P>

Mar a dúirt mé sa bhfreagra sin, go ginearálta tá na moltaí atá ag teacht ó Chomhdháil Náisiúnta na Gaeilge mar aon le polasaí na Roinne ag an am seo, agus táimid ag obair i gcoitinne le haghaidh na polasuithe sin a chur i bhfeidhm.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Ar an gcéad dul síos ba mhaith liom mo bhuíochas a ghabháil leis an Aire Stáit as ucht an fhreagra fhada a thug sé dúinn. Tá súil agam go bhfaighfimid breis tuarastail de dheich faoin gcéad um Nollaig as bheith ag cur ceisteanna trí Ghaeilge.  Ag tagairt do Cheist a 2, tá súil agam nach bhfuil sé ar intinn ag an Aire nach n-aithneofaí choíche múinteoirí atá ag teagasc Gaeilge go sásúil leis na blianta ach nach bhfuil oiliúint fhoirmeálta acu i múineadh tríd an dara teanga, agus nach bhfuil sé ar intinn aige deireadh a chur leis an scéim sin agus go leanfaí ar aghaidh léi. Is é atá ar intinn agam, tá múinteoirí ann go bhfuil céimeanna in ábhair eile acu; níl oiliúint fhoirmeálta acu i dteagasc na Gaeilge ach tá siad ag múineadh Gaeilge go sásúil le blianta anuas.  Tá súil agam nach bhfuil ar intinn ag an Aire deireadh a chur leis sin.</P>

Is í an aidhm is mó atá sa Roinn ag an am seo ná go gcuirfear an teanga labhartha chun cinn agus go mbeidh an chuid is mó de na múinteoirí in ann an Ghaeilge a labhairt agus an Ghaeilge a úsáid, agus go mbeidh gach seans ag na daltaí a bheith in ann an teanga labhartha a chur chun cinn.</P>

      <P>Mar a dúirt an tAire, tá na ceisteanna seo go léir bunaithe ar an phlean a chuir Comhdháil Náisiúnta na Gaeilge os comhair an Rialtais agus is dócha go dtuigeann an tAire go bhfuil glactha go fonnmhar ag na páirtithe go léir sa Teach seo leis an phlean sin.  Dhá <Col N="921" /> cheist a ba mhaith liom a chur: dúirt an tAire Stáit ina óráid fhada go bhfuil meitheal oibre ar bun sa Roinn, nó fochoiste, chun na plean a chur i bhfeidhm. An bhfuil sé ar intinn tuarascáil a chur ar fáil gach bliain maidir leis an dul chun cinn atá á dhéanamh?  Agus an dara pointe a ba mhaith liom a dhéanamh, an deacracht is mó atá le hoideachas sa bhunchóras agus san iarbhunchóras ná easpa téacsleabhar.  Cad é go díreach atá ar intinn agaibh a dhéanamh maidir leis an bhfadhb sin?</P>

      <P>Cheapas go raibh tú ag labhairt faoi na téacsleabhair sa Ghaeilge í féin.  Faoi na hábhair eile atá ar Teachta ag labhairt?  Ar an gcéad dul síos, beimid ag cur ar fáil tuairisc ó na daoine atá ag obair sa Roinn, an meitheal atá sa Roinn ag an am seo, agus tá súil agam go mbeimid in ann é sin a chur ar fáil i bhfad níos luaithe ná bliain o anois agus is é an rud is tábhachtaí atá bunaithe ag an Aire ná go bhfuil Rúnaí na Roinne anois ceaptha chun na polasuithe i leith na Gaeilge a chur i bhfeidhm.  Déarfainn gur rud maith é sin, mar beidh an dul chun cinn ceart a dhéanamh, ós rud é go bhfuil an Rúnaí ag tabhairt na hoibre seo faoin a chúram féin.  I dtaca leis na téacsanna de, aontaím leis an Teachta go bhfuil deacracht sna hábhair eile, taobh amuigh den Ghaeilge, le téacsanna trí Ghaeilge, agus sin ceann de na rudaí atá sa pholasaí, an méid oibre atá le déanamh againn chun an fhadhb sin a chur i gceart.</P>

      <P>As an méid ceisteanna atá curtha le chéile ba mhaith liom ceist a 17 a thógáil.  Baineann sí seo le cúrsaí ríomhaireachta.  Mar shampla, ba mhaith liom ceist dhíreach a chur ar an Aire Stáit, an bhfuil sé i gceist aige glacadh le moltaí ón gcúigiú tuarascáil den Chomhchoiste don Ghaeilge sa Teach seo, is é sin go mbeadh bunchaighdeán ann i leith chúrsaí ríomhaireachta.  Is é sin, d'aimsigh muid sa tuarascáil sin, toisc gur cuireadh litreacha amach ón Roinn Airgeadais, nach raibh a lán de na gléasanna ríomhaireachta a cuireadh isteach sna scoileanna, in oiriúint do úsáid na Gaeilge.  Mar sin, an bhfuil sé i gceist aige an moladh sin a chur i gcrích? Agus, ó tharla i mo sheasamh mé, ba mhaith liom ceist ghearr eile a chur, agus baineann seo le ceist a 40, faoi chúrsaí inmheánacha.  An bhfuil sé i gceist ag an Aire seans a thabhaiart do na múinteoirí dífhostaithe Gaeilge &mdash; agus tá a lán acu dífhostaithe faoi láthair &mdash; ag a bhfuil cumas na Gaeilge acu freastal ar na cúrsaí inmheánacha, nó an bhfuil siad nó dírithe ar na múinteoirí atá ag obair?</P>

Níl sé ceart a rá go gcaithfidh tú an ríomhaire é féin a chaitheamh amach.  Is féidir an bogábhar a fháil agus is í an cheist atá againne ná gur féidir i bhfad níos mó de na ríomhairí atá sna scoileanna úsáid a bhaint as an mbogábhar sin, agus ní dóigh liom go mbeidh aon deacracht ann.  Ní bheimid in ann dul ar ais agus na ríomhairí sin nach bhfuil in ann an Ghaeilge a úsáid a chaitheamh amach.

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> There are a number of supplementary questions I would like to ask.  I would ask the Minister to tell us if, when she comes to evaluate the viability of multidenominational schools in an area, she takes into account the fact that other schools might be made non-viable through the opening of an alternative school?  Secondly, can the Minister tell us if the staffing ratios which are applied to Protestant primary schools in the country are different to those which apply to multidenominational schools and if it is her intention to apply these staffing ratios to multidenominational schools?  Thirdly, if I may link this with the previous questions, would the Minister consider applying the same regime to scoileanna lán-Gaeilge?</P>

      <P>In relation to the Deputy's first question as to whether the Department take into account the viability of adjoining primary schools when a multidenominational school is being established, all such matters are looked at just as they are considered when any new primary school is being established.  The effect of establishing a new primary school on other schools would be examined and parental interest for such a school would also be looked at.  It is only when a school has been established in temporary premises that <Col N="928" /> the Department are in a position to project what its ultimate size will be and what provision should be made for it in State aided accommodation.  As I have said, there are seven such schools at present with a few more in the pipeline. In regard to the Deputy's question on staffing levels, I will have that information furnished to him as I do not have it on hand.</P>

For a considerable period of time the Department of Education insisted in some instances that these children were mentally retarded.  In one particular case a child was referred to a school for the mentally retarded and only for the fight of the parents to do something in this area and to set up the Association of the Speech and Language Impaired these unfortunate children would have been left languishing in some cases in mental institutions.

Is it also true to say that consistent attempts are made within the Department to close down St. Angela's because the Department officials never wanted it in the first place?

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9 and 37 together.</P>
      <P>The post-primary and the primary tiers of the National Parents' Council received a payment of £10,000 each in their first year, 1985, and further payments of £25,000 each were made in 1986.  These payments were made for the purpose of helping the council to become operational. It was never intended, as was clearly stated at the time, that they should continue beyond the first year or two.  It was always envisaged that the council should be self-financing.  Provision has not been made in the Estimates since 1986 to facilitate a payment to the council and the position is unchanged for 1989.</P>
      <P>However, an application has recently been received from the primary tier of the National Parents' Council for lottery funding for a development/parent education programme.  As you are aware, the disbursement of lottery funds is not a matter for decision by my Department, but the matter is being examined to see if a recommendation to the appropriate authorities may be warranted.</P>

The primary tier have put forward a very carefully worded developmental programme for parental involvement in education.  They have forwarded this programme to the lottery authorities and I hope I will be able to give that application my recommendation.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>In the primary sector redundancies were accepted strictly in accordance with age.  Naturally, this varied in each diocesan panel according to the variant in the teacher's age in each panel.  It would be a mammoth task to answer the Deputy's question across the floor but in general terms the redundancies at primary level were in order of age.  The age at which the redundancy offer ceased varied in each diocesan panel.</P>
      <P>At secondary level the redundancies were based on the redeployment panel system worked out between the JMB, the ASTI and the Department and the availability of teachers who were deemed to be eligible for the voluntary redundancy scheme as per the subjects they taught.  At vocational level the redundancies were based on recommendations from the vocational education committee and one presumes that they in turn based these on the subjects taught.  The age factor was not considered at secondary or vocational level.  As I said, the redundancies at second level were based on recommendations and at vocational levels were based on recommendations from the VEC.  With regard to community and comprehensive schools, which we are presently working through the redundancies will again be on the basis of need and also on subject choices.</P>

      <P>As the publication and sale of school books are in the hands of private companies it is not open to me to influence their pricing policy. However, I hope to increase the rate of grant towards the cost of school books in national schools in 1989.</P>
      <P>The position in relation to second level schools is that only a small percentage of text books is prescribed by the Department and most of these are repeated in rotation, generally in a three to four year cycle.  Publishers have produced anthologies of short stories, poetry, etc., which contain all the material required over a period of years.  Other prescribed texts &mdash; for example, plays and novels &mdash; are repeated in the rotation already mentioned and they are notified to the schools two years in advance of the appropriate examination.</P>
      <P>The syllabus planners try to avoid over-frequent changes and are conscious that they should avoid any unnecessary increase in costs.  However, text books must be changed from time to time if teachers are to keep their work educationally stimulating, and if content and methodology are to be kept reasonably up to date.</P>
      <P>The Department is aware of the financial strain placed on parents of school pupils in providing school text books for their children and has issued circulars to secondary school authorities reminding them of the desirability of changing non-prescribed text books as infrequently as possible in order to save parents undue expenditure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Moreover aid is also provided by my Department towards the cost of school books for necessitous pupils.  Despite the severe financial constraints at present it <Col N="937" /> has been found possible to provide for an increase of approximately 20 per cent in the provision for this purpose in the post-primary sector in 1989.</P>

      <P>I was waiting for the last sentence and I was delighted to hear the Minister say she intends to increase the rate of grant in 1989.  The increase is to be 20 per cent.  The Minister will be aware that the current rate of grant amounts to approximately £1.50 per pupil per year and a 20 per cent increase would bring that amount up to £1.80.

      <P>I am sure the Minister is aware that the previous Government did nothing about increasing the level of the grant.  Deputy Noonan was a Minister in that Government.  I am asking the Minister to make a comparison between the amount of grant per pupil on Northern Ireland, ranging from £26.60 <Col N="938" /> to £43 per pupil, and £1.50 here, now being increased to £1.80.  Does the Minister consider this an adequate rate of grant?  Now that the Minister for Finance has pennies pouring from heaven would she ask him at least to double or treble the rate of grant for schoolbooks.</P>

      <P>I certainly will speak to my constituency colleague, the Minister for Finance.  Prior to his becoming the Minister, we had already secured an increase, albeit a small one, in the grant to necessitous pupils at both primary and post-primary level.  In all matters educational, as in any sphere of life, one would wish to have limitless money to apply.  The case for necessitous pupils to receive more aid for school books is unchallenged.  It is extremely necessary. I am glad we were able to ensure a modest increase for next year which will be announced in the budget.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Education, with the agreement of the Minister for Finance, is at present considering the possibility of funding certain capital projects in the second-level educational sector from sources other than from State funds.  It has been decided, therefore, to initiate a scheme on a trial basis, under which developers will be invited to submit proposals to design, finance and build four building projects at the post-primary schools mentioned above.  In the event, however, of such proposals, being regarded by the Minister for Education as unacceptable the trial scheme will be terminated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department of Education accordingly wishes to invite applications from developers interested in submitting tenders to design, finance and build the above projects on the basis that the developers will meet all related costs and will lease the completed developments to the State on a lease-purchase basis over a period of twenty years.  The accommodation is to be provided on sites which will be <Col N="940" /> made available to the developers and shall be in accordance with plans and specification to be approved by the Building Unit of the Department. Developers may be permitted to use designs which have already been prepared for the individual projects.</P>
    <P>Parties interested in tendering for one or more of the projects involved should contact the Building Unit, Department of Education, Marlborough St., Dublin 1, (Tel: 734700 Ext; 2305) for application forms.</P>

      <P>Yes.  As the Deputy knows, the previous Government took a decision that there should be a very thorough review of the availability of third level places and the job requirements for such.  We followed through with that proposal by setting up the interdepartmental committee.  As I have said, they work in conjunction with several committees and their work is very extensive. I will be very happy, when the committee submit their findings to me, to make those findings public.</P>

      <P>As I acknowledged in the Dáil yesterday with regard to the third level education element of the Labour Party motion concerning Tallaght, the Patrick Clancy report which issued over the last few days points clearly to the fact that apart from the demographic considerations there is a need for increased take-up in the light of changing <Col N="950" /> job expectations and requirements, particularly after 1992 and that is why the interdepartmental review body assisted by professional expertise which we have set up, would be such an important factor in important decisions.

      <P>I thank the Minister for that reply and look forward to the details. Will the Minister accept that at the moment in certain areas there are numbers of teachers deemed to be surplus on panels, while at the same time we have a number of schools designated as disadvantaged who are awaiting appointments of additional teachers in line with the approved quota for such schools?</P>

      <P>All appointments have been made under the arrangements worked out under the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> between the INTO and the Government and we have strictly adhered to that arrangement.  The Deputy's point is valid but the question of teachers on panels and their redeployment is a matter for long term review having regard to the needs that may arise in the near future.  It is being kept under consideration.  Already this term, between September and now, we have allocated a considerable number of teachers from those panels.  To allocate teachers from panels to the areas in need seems to be a neat solution to the problem but one has to consider the school from which the teacher has been called off on the panel.  Naturally that school feel they have every right to retain that teacher but that is a separate question which I addressed earlier.  With regard to the movement of teachers from a school where a teacher is deemed to be over <Col N="952" /> quota, that is a question we have constantly under review.</P>

Has any consideration been given to a request made some time ago to set up a panel of supply teachers who would do replacement work for teachers who are out of school work because of in-service courses, the introduction of the new syllabus or because of the introduction of additional language teaching and so on?  Has the Minister given any consideration either to the introduction of job sharing in primary schools&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Title>Courts Bill, 1988: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>
      <Col N="985" /> Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Adjournment I was drawing the attention of the House to the fact that there are a few decisions of the Supreme Court of recent years bearing not squarely on the question of invalid judicial appointments or the continuation of people in apparent judicial office beyond an age at which they were no longer warranted so to do, but, nevertheless, illuminating, because they bear on the problem of whether the sky must be deemed to have fallen if some irregularity shows up in our legal or constitutional process of a kind which in theory might seem to invalidate a huge number of acts which previously have been done.</P>
      <P>Before Question Time I had mentioned the case of Miss de Burca in which the plaintiff successfully got the Supreme Court to declare invalid the provisions of the 1927 Juries empanellment to persons who were both male and householders, and because of its conflict with the constitutional provision against discrimination, infringing what the court took to be the proper composition of a jury, and opening up the question of the status of jury verdicts in the years between 1927 and the date of the judgment.  I inadvertently gave the House the wrong date for Miss de Burca's case.  It was not in the 1972 but in the 1976 <i>Irish Law Report</i>.  I was confusing it with another case in the same list.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In that case Chief Justice O'Higgins referred to a case which had been decided a few years previously in which the court had not been invited to, and nobody had thought to draw anyone's attention to, the potential of the case before it for invalidating things which had previously happened.  That was the case of McMahon <i>v.</i> the Attorney General.  It was the case I had in mind and it is reported in the 1972 <i>Irish Law Report</i> page 69.  In that case the plaintiff challenged what were regarded as the applicable provisions on the secret ballot in Dáil elections.  He drew attention to the <Col N="986" /> rules in and authorised by the 1923 Electoral Act which required that the presiding officer at a voting table, before issuing a ballot paper to an elector, would note on the counterfoil of the ballot paper the number in the electoral register opposite the name of the voter being given the ballot paper.  That in theory made it possible to re-associate the ballot paper with the voter, by tracking the number on the ballot paper and matching the number on the counterfoil, to trace a particular ballot paper to a particular voter.  It was not suggested that this had ever been done or that such an abuse had ever occured since the State began, but Mr. McMahon's point was that a reasonable apprehension must exist and the court said he was right.  Accordingly, the court said a ballot constituted in the way I have described could not be described as a secret ballot for constitutional purposes and that that requirement which had existed under the 1922 Constitution had not been respected from the moment the 1923 arrangements came into force.  Did that mean there had never been a validly elected Dáil since 1923?  No one thought of raising that point, in fact it was expressly disclaimed in the McMahon case, but it was adverted to a few years later in de Burca's case when the Chief Justice said as follows:</P>
    <P>In <i>McMahon's Case</i> the Courts were not asked to entertain any suggestion that such irregularity invalidated previous elections nor, in my view, could such a submission have been successfully made.</P>
    <P>Why?  Here is the pragmatic answer of a Chief Justice who for many years was a Deputy and a Minister in this House.  I am not trying to imply that such a person would necessarily have his feet more on the ground than a lawyer who had never gone into politics but at least this is some kind of guarantee against not being free floating like a balloon in the air several hundred feet above common or garden reality.  Chief Justice O'Higgins said:</P>
    <P>The overriding requirements of an ordered society would invalidate such an argument.</P>
    <P>He said that in Miss de Burca's case the <Col N="987" /> same consideration would apply to any suggestion about the status of the jury verdicts which had been found by unconstitutionally composed juries over the years.</P>
    <P>Chief Justice O'Higgins repeated this observation in much the same words, though cast in the form of a rhetorical question, when the point about the status of earlier jury verdicts was an issue shortly after in a case, The State (Byrne) <i>v.</i> Frawley, 1978 <i>Irish Law Reports</i>, page 326.  The Chief Justice posed the question:</P>
    <P>Could ordered society accept such a conclusion?</P>
    <P>In other words, if we are to do what one of the judges in the Supreme Court felt might need to be done, although he said this realising the magnitude of the implications of the statement, what would be left of society?  Would the convulsion not be so mountainous that society could not survive if we were to try to undo the effects of thousands of jury verdicts down to the uttermost implications theoretical justice might require?  One of the judges in de Burca's case, Mr. Justice Walsh, our most senior and respected judge stood a distance from this.  He said that the implications of the suggestion that earlier verdicts might now be impugned might be thought to be frightening.  He went on to say that whether they are frightening or not has nothing to do with the task of interpreting the Constitution which falls upon the court, that if an infringement of the Constitution were to continue long enough, the cost of correcting it might be great but that that is not a reason for perpetuating it.  In an oblique way he did envisage that one might some day have to incur a heavy cost in putting right some unconstitutional process, but if I have to declare a preference between two very respected and fine judges, I would have to come down on the side of Chief Justice O'Higgins for the simple reason that society simply could not sustain the burden which any such retrospective rectification of countless errors would throw on it.</P>
    <P>The last of the cases I want to burden the House with is the income tax case <Col N="988" /> which everyone must remember &mdash; Murphy <i>v.</i> the Attorney General reported in the 1982 <i>Irish Law Reports</i>, page 241.  That case bore on the constitutional validity of the Finance Act provision which effectively taxed a married couple more heavily than if they were two people cohabiting, even calling themselves Mr. and Mrs. X, perhaps even having a bogus reception and handing out wedding cake.  There is no law against that.  They could have been masquerading in every respect as a married couple but not in fact married.  They would pay less in tax than a lawfully married couple going through the same social formalities.  All the imagery I have employed naturally did not come into the court's judgment but, in a nutshell, that was the reason for the court striking down those provisions.</P>
    <P>That, of course, raised the ancillary question of the status of any taxpayers, of whom I was one, who down the years had been the single taxpayer of a married couple and had been treated less advantageously than if he had not been married but living in ostensibly the same conditions. The court did a very unusual thing.  It gave a set of opinions uncoupled from the substantive judgment in which it dealt with the question of possible retroactivity.  In the judgment the majority view, certainly on the point that interests us here, was delivered by Mr. Justice Henchy in a form which I think must be regarded as magisterial and authoritative. I could not improve on it.  If the House will bear with the quotation from the Supreme Court majority, I will cite it.  Judge Henchy said:</P>
    <P>While it is central to the due administration of justice in an ordered society that one of the primary concerns of the Courts should be to see that prejudice suffered at the hands of those who act without legal justification, where legal justification is required, shall not stand beyond the reach of corrective legal proceedings, the law has to recognise that there may be transcendent consideration which make such a course undesirable, impractical, or impossible.</P>
    <P>Over the centuries the law has come <Col N="989" /> to recognize, in one degree or another, that factors such as prescription.</P>
    <P>&mdash;that is lapse of time&mdash;</P>
    <P>(negative or positive), waiver, estoppel <i>laches</i>,</P>
    <P>That is, sitting on your rights so to speak and not doing what perhaps the solicitors in the cases that we are talking about here, might well have done, namely, asked themselves how old is the judge, ought his appointment to have been renewed, has it been renewed, or is he properly there on account of the practice qualification?  That is for solicitors, forgive me colleagues, but that is what they are part paid to do just as counsel are paid to do it and from now on, no doubt, it is a point which every defending solicitor and counsel will look at &mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the man sitting on the bench under the harp and purporting to administer justice entitled to be there? His client will be expected to be satisfied about that before pleading to the court or even recognising it.</P>
      <P>Over the centuries the law has come to recognise in one degree or another these things:</P>
      <P>a statute of limitation, <i>res judicata</i> or other matters, most of which may be grouped under the heading of public policy may debar a person from obtaining redress in the courts for injury, pecuniary or otherwise, which would be justifiable and redressable if such considerations had not intervened.</P>
      <P>I will quote one more short paragraph, Sir, if you will allow me.</P>
      <P>Judge Henchy, speaking for three other judges as well as himself, said:</P>
      <P>For a variety of reasons, the law recognizes that in certain circumstances, no matter how unfounded in law certain conduct may have been,</P>
      <P>&mdash;in this instance the collection of tax on a basis which was found unconstitutional&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>no matter how unwarranted its operation in a particular case, what has <Col N="990" /> happened has happened and cannot, or should not, be undone.  The irreversible progressions and by-products of time, the compulsion of public order and of the common good, the aversion of the law from giving a hearing to those who have slept on their rights, and quality of legality &mdash; even irreversibility &mdash; that tends to attach to what has become inveterate or has been widely accepted or acted upon, the recognition that even in the short term the accomplished fact may sometimes acquire an inviolable sacredness, these and other factors may convert what has been done under an unconstitutional, or otherwise void, law into an acceptable part of the <i>corpus juris.</i></P>
    <P>of the body of the law.</P>
    <P>Now, Sir, I freely admit, and I would not be required to be pushed on this point, because it is a very important point, that a doctrine like that is a dangerous one to stand on in all cases.  If it was proposed to use such a doctrine as an umbrella to protect against the rain of litigation or challenge, all unlawful acts done officially, by carelessness, by inadvertence, or even deliberately, if the people who had suffered under them did not realise what had happened, I would not put that forward in this House for an instant.  There would be an end to all justice in this country, or anywhere else, if such a proposal was made, that water under the bridge, whatever pushed it under the bridge, at whatever speed or in whatever channel it flowed under the bridge, was simply gone and could not be recalled.  I would not stand over such a thing at all, but where you have a large scale irregularity, so large in scale that, as the Minister has said, tens of thousands of people are involved, even if in only relatively minor ways, so that to undo the thing would not only be a headache but would probably be physically impossible in many cases, then, I think, large considerations of public policy may come into play.</P>
    <P>I do not want to be the one to draw the line as to where the argument I have just quoted from Mr. Justice Henchy would apply or where arguments of strict individual man to man justice would apply.  I do not want to be asked to draw that line <Col N="991" /> in any theoretical form, but what I am saying in general terms is that there may come a point &mdash; and I believe the situation here before us today is one of those points &mdash; at which to put the thing right in all its last and uttermost dimensions is not possible and not reasonable to ask for.  I think, therefore, we are not doing anything outlandish by acquiescing in it.</P>
    <P>I will be concluding shortly but, before I do so, I cannot let this moment pass without for the very first time in Leinster House using a passage of Roman Law in order to bolster an argument that is highly topical here.  I will condense an excerpt from the fourteenth title of the First Book of Justinian's Digest.  This excerpt comes from a late classical Roman jurist who would have been writing around the year 200 A.D.  His importance derives not just from his reputation, which was very considerable, but from the fact that what he wrote was incorporated by a very tough selection process into the Digest of Justinian, compiled about 300 years after he died, which remains, so to speak, the highest form of common law reason in Eastern Europe first and then in Western Europe after it was rediscovered, throughout the middle ages and well into early modern times.</P>
    <P>It was regarded Sir, by the medieval people as <i>ratio scripta</i>, written reason, which enjoyed the same status in civil affairs that the Bible did in religious. Therefore, the passage that I am going to mention without quoting it <i>in extenso</i> represents a piece of canonical European legal wisdom.  It is not in the common law tradition and is not incorporated in any judgments of a court of Edward the III or Edward the IV or of Saorstáit Éireann, but it is part of the oldest legal tradition extant, still alive and breathing.  If you overlook, Sir, the unavoidably archaic physical setting of the case, it bears on the question of what happens if somebody who is actually of un-free status &mdash; a runaway slave as, in fact, the instance cities &mdash; if somebody of unfree status, who has absconded from his owner, goes to a place where he is unknown, where no one knows his status which is that of not being a citizen and therefore he is <Col N="992" /> ineligible of public office, and gets himself elected <i>praeto</i>, which is something more than a judicial office.</P>
    <P>Let us suppose that he spends time in that office issuing edicts and decrees before this unfree status and therewith his ineligibility is discovered, the answer given by this jurist Ulpian who is personally responsible for about one-third of the Digest and who is given canonical force by Justinian is yes, these decrees and edicts stand, even though the person who put them out was not just inadvertently doing so, having mistaken his status, but in the full knowledge that he was not entitled to act as <i>praetor</i>.  He has given out decrees and edicts of a kind that have affected people and they may not now be reversed.  I have condensed his ruling and I am not denying that problems arise in a passage of that kind which the House will not want to lecture on, but it is unquestionably part of a very ancient European tradition that in a case where something irreversible in one sense has taken place, the public interest and public policy may be better served, within reason, by allowing the situation to stand. I emphasise &ldquo;within reason,&rdquo; because I do not want to be taken as saying that what is done is done and cannot be undone.  That would be grotesquely unjust.  I am not saying that, but that there may come a point where the scale of an irregularity is such, particularly when it is an inadvertent one, that the public interest is better served by trying to find some form &mdash; as any Government would have had to do &mdash; to make sense of it.</P>
    <P>The question remains: is this Bill necessary quite apart from whether it has any effect?  If what I say might be applied by analogy to the situation that this gentleman's judgments and various acts <i>qua</i> justice are concerned, if all these considerations from the Murphy case, the de Burca case and so on could be applied to these 17,500 plus 10,000 cases, then perhaps there is no need for the Bill at all.  The House is entitled to look at it this way.  If that principle which I have tried to explain to the House is a fair one and if we can regard it as having been settled now by a reasonable quantity of authority, and I think that can be said, the <Col N="993" /> House would be so to speak well within the four corners of its conscience in not attempting to undo all the things this justice did.  If it is within the four corners of its constitutional conscience, if I may invent such a concept, then it is within its rights to try to put the thing into some orderly form.</P>
    <P>If we do not put it into an orderly form it is going to be up to someone to raise by means of a declaratory action some kind of case in the courts which will cost money, take time, result in uncertainty and possibly even go the wrong way from the public policy point of view.  I do not want to adjudicate as to whether, if it went the wrong way, this Bill would have any validity, but we are within our rights in making an effort with it.  As the Minister said when introducing this, in particular the effort to provide for similar slips in the future is not only justified but necessary.</P>
    <P>Section 1 (3), in which Deputy Taylor said he could see no point, is an attempt to save constitutional rights which might appear to be infringed by this Bill.  It is copied from the provision in the 1979 Act, the passage of which was made necessary by the foul up over the wrongful dismissal of Commissioner Garvey from the Garda Síochána and, accordingly, the non vacation of his post and, consequently, the void appointment of another officer purportedly as Commissioner. For a certain time until the matter was regularised his acts were theoretically challengeable because he was not the Commissioner, the commissionership never having been effectively vacated in the first place by Mr. Garvey.  A similar clause was built into that, I think on my suggestion, back in 1979.  I accept that the mere fact that this is put into the Bill does not really achieve anything special, because if somebody has a constitutional right it does not require the vesture of a statutory section to make it effectual.  If I have a constitutional right and this Bill without this subsection infringes it, I am still entitled to assert it before the court even though I do not have the vesture of this section. However, it has this much purpose: it displays this House in a frame of mind in which it always ought to be, namely of <Col N="994" /> an unwillingness to breach constitutional rights, a consciousness of the duty laid upon it by Article 15 not to do so, and an effort so far as it is within the power of the House to preserve individuals' constitutional rights while not losing sight of the general public interest.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not for a moment suggest that I could add anything to the constitutional wisdom of my colleague, Deputy John Kelly.  The House is a bit richer for his contribution on this legislation.  One thing that comes out of what he said is that back in the year 200 AD great commonsense prevailed. Deputy Liam Cosgrave, a former Taoiseach, once said that every country needs a constitution but no country can afford one that cannot be put on the back of a postage stamp.  There is a great deal of truth in what that man said.  We seem to get ourselves tied up in knots here about Constitution matters.  Not being a lawyer or a member of that illustrious legal profession, I often have to knock my head and ask myself if I am sitting in the Four Courts or whether I am in the place where laws are supposed to be made and changed by those elected by the people to do so.</P>
      <P>Recognising that we have a Constitution, I wonder, when the Irish people were asked to approve of that Constitution away back in those beautiful days, whether they realised what in God's name they were doing.  I do not think they ever intended that, because of an error in whatever Department it was and somebody gave his age a year older or younger, 8,000 criminal cases, 74,000 road traffic cases, 1,100 family law cases, 11,000 liquor licence cases and 17,500 other civil cases should be thrown out because somebody in some Department made the mistake about a gentleman's age.</P>

      <P>The people never intended that sort of nonsense to happen when they approved this Constitution. This House can not alone make laws, it can change laws.  That is our role.  The other evening here we were talking about the Extradition (Amendment) Act, 1987 and reading section 7 I, and I am sure any reasonable person, would interpret that as providing that the law could be extended beyond a particular date, that if one extended it beyond that date for a limited period one is in keeping with the principle of the law.  I would to my frustration that apparently the legal eagles got working on this again and are telling us we cannot do that.  Of course we can. That is what we are elected here to do. We were elected here to make and change laws.  That is the responsibility the people gave us.  To say we cannot do that because it is not in keeping with this, that and the other, is nonsense.  We are the ones who should change the law when it is necessary and make new laws when they are necessary in the best interests of the public, provided it really is in the best interests of the public.  In this case would we endanger all the best interests and what about the thousands of summonses signed by this district justice? What about the thousands of bench warrants signed by him?  There is no air of reality about what we are talking about here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not for one moment trying to justify what happened.  The Minister of the day has a responsibility to ensure that procedures are put in place so that this sort of thing may never happen again, but the reality is, as an ordinary, reasonable person would accept, that as long as there are human beings on this earth there will be mistakes.  Nobody can guarantee that never again in any Department will a mistake be made.  Of course mistakes will be made.  Somebody may press the wrong button on a computer or put in a two instead of a three on a piece of paper.  You can do the best you can to eliminate as many <Col N="996" /> possibilities of mistakes being made as is feasible.  Therefore, I urge this House that when we are faced with a situation like this, one none of us particularly likes, we make it quite clear that we have to change the laws to suit the situation. It is in the public interest that we make the necessary changes here to enable those cases to remain valid and we do not drag ourselves into a heap of problems that could be avoided.</P>

Imagine trying to explain to ordinary people that, for argument's sake, the courts found that 74,000 road traffic offences are invalid because somebody in a Department made a mistake about reporting somebody's age.  They think little enough of us, but can you imagine what they would say about us then?  Would it be that we could not find a way of changing this so this sort of nonsense cannot go on?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="997" /> Every day I speak to people who read in their newspapers that somebody got off on a technicality.  They pull their hair out.  They ask what sort of nonsense this is when the man was clearly guilty but somebody found a technicality that allowed him to walk free from the court. Did the people really intend that when they were adopting the Constitution?  Did they really intend that they should elect people to an assembly to allow that sort of nonsense to come through?  They did not.  I think I speak for the ordinary, reasonable people who go about their daily lives wanting to live in peace and harmony and not to interfere with the day to day running of the State, and they are electing us to do it.</P>
    <P>Legislators are elected to make laws or to change them.  The public depend on legislators to tell them if their Constitution that was approved a number of years ago is not meeting the needs of Irish people in today's world and to advise them to change it.  Then it would be a question of the decision of the people.  If their decision was for change, we should give them that opportunity but let us not continue to justify some ridiculous decision because somebody got off on a technicality.</P>
    <P>I should not be straying into this area but, in relation to the Extradition (Amendment) Act, I fear that the will of the majority of the Dáil here the other night was that it would have been safer to allow another period of 12 months to elapse before making a final decision as to whether that legislation remained in place.  I have a sneaking feeling that the majority of the people in this House had sufficient doubt about that legislation to prevent them from passing it into permanent law.</P>

      <P>They do not like to hear the ordinary punter like myself challenging the collective wisdom of the legal profession.  They feel there is an integrity that should not be challenged.  I say, &ldquo;hump that.&rdquo;  I am elected as an ordinary representative to use basic commonsense to put on our Statute books laws that make sense and to change laws that do not.  This does not make sense and I do not give a hoot what book they quote from, who said what or when.  It does not make sense to me that because somebody in the Department of Justice made a mistake in filling in a record of somebody's age, 74,000 Road Traffic Act offences should be thrown out; it does not make sense to me that 11,000 liquor licence cases or that 17,500 other civil cases should be declared invalid because somebody filled up a form incorrectly.  Did the Irish people ever intend that that should happen?  The answer must clearly be no.</P>
      <P>Therefore, despite the discomfort of having to implement this and the fact that people may have their suspicions that it may not be in accordance with the Constitution and may have to be fought out in the Four Courts, the Irish people would say that we should go ahead and change the law and make sure that those things stick and that we are not put to the expense of having to find ways and means of unravelling this mess because somebody in the Department of Justice made a mistake.  I would lay my house and my next year's salary on it that if one did a survey in Grafton Street 90 per cent of the people would agree with me.  I think it makes sense that we should pass this sort of legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having said that, in relation to the <Col N="999" /> appointment of the Judiciary, we should be looking at ways and means of getting the best people to serve on the Bench. If we want to pay peanuts we will get monkeys.  Society depends on our courts to administer the laws fairly and to have people doing that who have the ability.  I am not casting aspersions on those who serve on our Bench at the moment but there was a period when we were out looking for people to serve as District Court Justices because people could earn more money serving in private practice. In any democracy that is a dangerous thing.  We should be prepared to provide the salaries and the conditions of service that will attract the people who are capable of administering the law properly and they should work in premises where the conditions and such that any human being would expect.  I wonder would health inspectors approve of the conditions that exist in our District Courts for people in any other sector?  The answer must be no.  Yet we who talk so much about the need to preserve democracy are expecting these people to work in appalling conditions and we do not seem to be able to transfer responsibility for the maintenance and upkeep of district courts from local authorities to a central agency such as the Office of Public Works because local authorities do not have any money: I am not saying that the Office of Public Works have a lot of money either but at least there is some chance that the Office of Public Works may be able to maintain these buildings in some sort of reasonable condition.</P>

      <P>I believe the Irish people have elected me on a number of occasions on the basis and in the hope that I can recognise a bit of commonsense when it stares me in the face.  I hope that always this will be a place where people can use commonsense in deciding whether legislation should be passed or changed or whatever.  There were two occasions in this one week where commonsense did not prevail.  One was on the Extradition (Amendment) Act, where a crazy decision was taken.  We should have challenged the great legal opinion.  We could have opened up this shop the following day and walked in here and passed another piece of legislation if we wanted to make certain that the Extradition (Amendment) Act would not be permanent. It was only an excuse that was offered here.  The same thing applies here today.  Commonsense is being attacked because the legal arguments are being thrown in again.  Therefore, we will be supporting this legislation, regretting that it is needed, on the basis that it makes commonsense.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank the Deputies who have contributed to this Second Stage debate.  At the outset I would like to say that the Minister is unable to be here as he is at an EC meeting of Ministers of Justice, one that occurs about every six months or so.</P>
      <P>The Deputies raised a number of questions which do not directly relate to this Bill but which are related to the position of district justices, including such matters as night courts, remuneration, legal aid schemes, the question of accommodation for district justices and a variety of other questions.  I will certainly convey the comments of Deputies to the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am satisfied that the public interest will best be served by adopting the Bill. It provides a mechanism by which Mr. Mahon's position and decisions may be regularised.  In a sense the difficulty about Mr. Mahon is a technical one.  No one can say that the due process was not observed in the hearing of the cases he <Col N="1001" /> dealt with.  Decisions were made in good faith on the evidence presented.  Any person dissatisfied with the decision made in his or her case had the option of an immediate appeal.  If he did not avail of that option he must be presumed to have accepted the verdict.  Also, if he appealed he had the benefit of a higher court's reassessment of the case on the evidence. I cannot see, therefore, that any real injustice will have been caused if the technical difficulty about Mr. Mahon's appointment is corrected.  The second reason for promoting this measure is the humanitarian one of allowing Mr. Mahon to benefit from the service he has given since January 1984 by way of remuneration, pension and so on.  Given the background, I hope Deputies will agree that the best thing to do is to provide the means by which his service may be validated.</P>
    <P>I should, perhaps, explain, in response to questions, what happened in this case. The district justice on the original application form in 1973 gave a wrong date of birth, 4 January, 1920 when the correct date of birth was 4 January, 1919. He submitted the application form and documentation on 25 April 1973, and was appointed in October 1976.  In that month he was asked for a copy of his birth certificate for record purposes and that was submitted in January 1977.  That certificate was filed but was not at that stage compared with the original document.</P>
    <P>The first error occurred when the district justice submitted his application form with the wrong date of birth.  The second error occured when the person who received the birth certificate for record purpose failed to cross check it against the original document.  The birth certificate was requested as a routine and placed on a file.  We can say that the person who requested the certificate should have compared it with the original document.  A Kardex system operates in the Department and the initial document is put on to that system.  The system is used as the reference subsequently. When one considers the system that operates it is a lot easier to understand how an official can subsequently make such a mistake.  Nevertheless, it should not happen.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1002" /> The district justice reached the retirement age of 65 years in January 1984 but he did not apply until late in that year for an extension from January 1985, and successively for each year after that.  The cross-checking was against the Kardex system.  It was not until mid-1988 that the association between the documents was made and it became clear that an error had occurred.</P>
    <P>A number of Members have asked about the position since the mistake was discovered.  The position is that verification of age and qualifications is done before the appointment by the President. That is a routine part of the checking before the appointment of a district justice now.  District Justice Mahon says that so far as he was concerned it was a genuine mistake.  The Minister is giving the district justice the benefit of the doubt, in so far as there is any, about the matter.  We heard a lot about old Roman law from Deputy Kelly and one could say that even Homer nods.</P>
    <P>The district justice has said that his failure to seek an extension was a genuine oversight.  Arrangements have been made to ensure that before a candidate is considered for appointment as a district justice it will be necessary for him to supply a birth certificate and evidence that he fulfils the statutory qualification requirements.  To be eligible for appointment a person must be a practising barrister or solicitor of not less than ten years standing and verification that he fulfils that requirement will have to be supplied by either the Bar Council or the Law Society, as appropriate.  That is a new arrangement in the verification process. If correct information is obtained in this way before an appointment is made a difficulty like what occurred in this case will not arise but I accept that other difficulties may arise.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that a mistake was made in this case.  The consequences could be very serious for the public at large and for the person concerned.  He has indicated that the problem arose through a genuine oversight and the only reasonable course of action is that being taken by the Minister.  Deputy Colley questioned that action being taken by the Minister and Deputy Kelly spent some <Col N="1003" /> time responding to the points made by her.  I do not intend to deal with them again.  The 1949 Act allows for a justice to be continued in office by way of a warrant made by the Committee and this will be an extension of that power.  I note the argument Deputy Colley made about the break in service but there will not, in fact, be a break in service if the new procedure is followed.</P>
    <P>I should like to assure the House that the Attorney General considered this matter and advised the Government on all aspects of the Bill.  He regards the Minister's action as prudent and correct. Indeed, that is reflected in some of the statements made by Deputy Kelly. Deputy Flanagan asked me to give an assurance on that point and I am pleased to be able to do so.  Deputy Colley referred to the mistake made in the Department of Justice and I should like to tell her that the Department do not conceal the fact that a mistake was made. I do not think anybody has tried to conceal anything.  It was an unfortunate occurrence and that has been made clear. I am sure Members on all sides are anxious to put the matter right.</P>
    <P>The Minister has taken action to ensure that verification of age takes place and has expanded that to include the verification of qualifications.  Deputy Taylor asked if advice had been taken from the Attorney General, a point I referred to earlier, while Deputy McCartan said that the responsibility for the error rests with the Minister.  At the end of the day the Minister has to take responsibility.  The Minister is fully aware and conscious of that.  Deputy McCartan seemed to think that the checking involved was very simple that it should have been done easily and pointed to the fact that there cannot be many involved.  There are not many involved, but it was a very unusual occurrence.  The administrator can be caught out at times when something quite unusual happens.  The Minister is trying to provide against that in future.  Taking all the cases that arose this would seem to be the only one where a mistake occurred.  Perhaps it is inevitable that at some time something like this should happen.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1004" /> I always find Deputy Kelly's contributions particularly interesting and enlightening.  I am always afraid of them because they usually open up a debate which can go on for at least a week afterwards. He made some cogent arguments and quoted some precedents which bear on the situation.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will deal with them separately.  The concept which Deputy Kelly was trying to convey relates to the overall public interest and the requirement for general order in our society.  To some extent Deputy Barrett made that point also about commonsense which must accompany all the actions. Deputy Kelly made a point about the constitutional saver and stressed the fact that the saver shows that the House is unwilling to set aside rights.  It could be argued on the other hand that, since the safeguards are there already in the Constitution, they do not have to be put into a Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it does not acknowledge an infringement.  It is there as a saver and Deputy Kelly did not mention it.  Something which he might have mentioned was the fact that actions could arise which we would not want to snuff out through this legislation which would be action for a different reason altogether. For instance, say, six or eight months ago, a district justice might have denied somebody the right to free legal aid or some other right of action might have arisen out of some of the actions which were carried out.  To avoid that right being infringed or affected the saver is inserted.  The need to include it is a debatable point.  It was decided on balance that it was more advisable to include the saver.  This point has been debated in the House before in a situation such as this when Deputy Kelly obviously felt that it was desirable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thank the Deputies for their comments. I can assure them that the <Col N="1005" /> Government's interest in this Bill is to restore order as quickly as possible and to overcome any of the difficulties which have been created while, at the same time, trying to ensure that any individual rights will not be violated.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 1 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make a few comments. The Minister said that in all the numerous cases heard by Mr. Mahon the due process of law was followed in every respect &mdash; and so it was in every respect except one.  The man was not a judge. That is the very serious defect that arises. Of course they called witnesses and cross-examination them, and so on, and the due process was gone through, but was it not a mock trial because the man sitting up there, dispensing judgment, was not a judge?  Let us not overlook that fact.</P>
      <P>Deputy Barrett was talking about commonsense. We all know that everybody's view of commonsense is not the same. Different people have different views on what is commonsense.  I, Mervyn Taylor, could go out to Rathfarnham District Court one day when the Justice was delayed and tell the garda on duty that I was the Justice appointed for that day.  I go up on the bench.  Deputy Barrett is charged with driving without insurance &mdash; which, of course, he would not do &mdash; and I sentence him to six months imprisonment. If you asked if that was commonsense you would be told that it was not.  It is not a simple or easy matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I listened carefully to the arguments put forward with great skill by Deputy Kelly.  I am sorry he is not here.  I have <Col N="1006" /> considered them very carefully and I do not agree with his reasoning.  The cases which he selected and the types of situations he described are not the same as this case and I will give the reasons.  He gave a number of examples, one of which was where one or two Deputies had something improper about their election to the Dáil.  That would not invalidate decisions made by the Dáil.  That is true but those decisions were still decisions of the Dáil.  The decisions in this case were made by a man who is not a judge.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kelly gave another example of the De Burca case.  Because the situation of women had not been dealt with the juries were not in order because they had not been selected properly over the years, and so on, and women should not have been on them.  That is true.  They were not in order but the verdicts were given by juries.  It was juries who gave the verdicts, not properly constituted, but it was still the jury that gave the verdict.  In this case the decisions were given by a man who is not a judge and that is the difference.</P>
    <P>The third case cited by Deputy Kelly related to ballot papers where it was found that the number was on the back and they were traceable.  That was found to be wrong and had to be corrected. Deputy Kelly correctly made the point that, of course, that did not invalidate all the elections that had taken place.  That is true and I agree with him on that matter. They were elections and a vote took place.  Perhaps the ballot paper was wrong, but a vote took place and the ballots were counted.  In this case the decisions were given by a man who was not a judge.</P>
    <P>In relation to the income tax case which dealt with two people living together and the fact that PRSI prior assessments by the Revenue Commissioners were, nonetheless, held by the court to be valid, that is true.  The point is that those assessments were made by the Revenue Commissioners and they have the authority to make assessments.  The assessments in all those prior cases were made by the Revenue Commissioners.  These verdicts and these judgments were given by a man who was not a judge.</P>
    <P>In Deputy Kelly's final point he went <Col N="1007" /> back to Roman law.  He referred to the man who went to another town and was elected <i>praetor</i>, a kind of judge.  He gave verdicts even though he was not entitled to have been elected <i>praetor</i> because he was not qualified.  That man was at least elected <i>praetor</i>.  He did not have the qualifications but he was elected.  Mr. Mahon was not a judge on this occasion and that fact is inescapable.  No matter how many verdicts he gave he was just a man and his verdicts could have no more effect than mine or Deputy Flanagan's if we sat up on the bench at Dundrum, Rathfarnham, or wherever, and started to give out judgments.  What possible legal effect could that have by any stretch of the imagination no matter how long it went on?</P>
    <P>The question then arises, which is the purport of this Bill, whether you can retrospectively validate a purported verdict given at that time by that person who then was not a judge and say that the matter is now to be dealt with as though he was a judge at that time.  That is the nub of the question and that is where the difficulty arises.  That is why I have grave doubts as to the constitutionality of this measure.  We are supporting it and we will not oppose it in these difficult circumstances. I sympathise with the Minister's difficulties, but it would be a grave mistake to think there was any certainty about it.  I thought the Minister's reply on the question in regard to the advice of the Attorney General was very interesting and guarded.  The advice of the Attorney General was that the bringing forward of this Bill was the most prudent and appropriate thing to do but what the Minister did not say was that it was constitutionally in order for him to do so. If he had said that, it would be a different matter.  It may be the most convenient thing to do and easiest way out but there must be a serious question mark over whether it is constitutionally in order for him to do so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>There are three points I want to make in regard to this Bill.  The first is that an effort is being made to try to tidy up a mess.  Every one of us in this House is in favour of tidying up a mess <Col N="1008" /> which has been created.  This is attempted in section 1, but in a way which is not valid.  Clearly, if a publican went before Mr. Mahon and asked for what seems to be a valid licence to be reviewed that publican is entitled to have his position vindicated by this House by way of section 1.  He would have been told that the court is the place where justice is administered, that that is the place he should go to have his licence renewed and where he is entitled to be vindicated. That is the necessary outcome of any legislative consideration of this mess.</P>
      <P>The second point I want to make relates to the status of the individuals at any given time.  I know this sounds simplistic but sometimes the truth is horrifyingly simple.  If a person ceases to be a judge in law, he is no longer a judge for the purposes of the Constitution and any purported administration of justice by him is null and void under the Constitution. Anyone who has been adversely affected by his decisions has a right to have these set aside.  That right is not absolute but it is a right which is continuous in some circumstances.  If a person is in jail, he is entitled to be set at liberty because no man, unless he is a judge, is entitled to adjudicate on the liberty of another.  If a person has been disqualified from driving or has had a sentence imposed on him, according to our administration of justice he is entitled to have that decision set aside.  He is not entitled to secure any financial compensation in respect of fines paid by him or secure compensation from the State in respect of any term of imprisonment he may wrongly have served as a result of an order made by the judge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with what Deputy Colley has said, that where somebody is of the opinion that the judge has adjudicated in the absence of judicial authority, the procedure to apply is the order of judicial review, to set aside the charge on the basis of the absence of authority on the part of the justice in question.  that procedure, <i>quo warranto</i>, is based on the legal framework used by the English Crown and is only available under the Superior Court Rules within three months of the determination.  That puts some kind of time limit on undoing the <Col N="1009" /> damage which has to be undone in circumstances such as these.</P>
    <P>My third point is that this House must take a long hard look at this Bill and decide whether section 1 is constitutional. It is open only to the Government through the President, to appoint someone to be a judge.  This House is not entitled under legislation to provide that somebody who ceased to be a judge is effectively to be regarded retrospectively to have continued to be a judge.  That is the fundamental point.  This House cannot legislate to provide that somebody is or is not a judge.  The exclusive monopoly to appoint a judge is given to the State.</P>
    <P>What happens when somebody ceases to be a judge, as undoubtedly Mr. Mahon did?  He ceases to be a judge and can only in my view become a judge again in law if he is reappointed formally.  There is no way that his House can alter that fundamental constitutional prerequisite for a valid execution of the judicial power.  There is a very simple way around this problem.  We could provide in this Bill that a person, who through ill-advertance had ceased to be a judge, would be eligible for reappointment notwithstanding his age, be reappointed properly.  That would not deal with the discontinuity and the consequences of that discontinuity of the tenure of his office but at least it would be a straightforward constitutional way of dealing with this issue.  It seems that a justice, when appointed, should be required to produce a birth certificate and so should every other judge as they all reach the age limit at various times.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>The problem which the Department of Justice are bona fide trying to remedy under this section of the Bill is one which could be avoided.  I do not believe it is correct in retrospect to attempt to square a circle and to say something which is not, is, and something which could not be, could be, by legislation and I think that is the big problem with regard to the wording in subsection (2).  I am worried by the provisions contained in subsection (3) because in one sense they mean very little.  Every Bill this House passes has implied in it that if anything done by that Bill is in conflict with the Constitution then, by ordinary constitutional interpretation, the Bill is held by post 1937 Statutes to fall short of any unconstitutional effect.</P>
      <P>I think that this subsection is designed to have a wider effect.  I think it is designed to deal with conflicts between this Bill and the constitutional rights of any individual.  Apart from the consititutional right to liberty, to property and to a good name, there is another constitutional right which flows from Article 34, which is that every citizen in respect of whom justice is administered is entitled to have it done by a court, not simply by a court consisting of any old person but by a court consisting of a judge appointed in a manner provided by Article 35 of the Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is a constitutional right which applies to all litigation.  Nobody is obliged <Col N="1011" /> to subject himself to justice unless it is constitutional justice and that requires the two ingredients of a duly constituted court and a duly and constitutionally appointed judge.  That is a fundamental constitutional right which section 1 (2) (a) conflicts with in virtually every case in that every single person who has been subjected by a compulsory process to an unlawful purported administration of justice has had his or her constitutional rights infringed.  It is not simply a matter of looking to people who have exceptional constitutional rights: everyone who is affected adversely by the decisions or adjudications of the District Court is someone who has had his or her constitutional rights infringed.  As I said before I do not believe that it flows from that that every single decision has to be torn up and that the State has to compensate people for a clerical slip or inadvertence nor do I believe that every fine has to be returned but I do believe that this Bill in the last analysis will not remedy to the extent that it seems to on its face the infringement of constitutional rights of every single person who was affected by an unconstitutional purported administration of justice.</P>
    <P>While no one can oppose an effort to remedy the situation, we should at this stage at least sound a warning that the Bill does not achieve what is claimed for it and that it is unlikely to staunch the wound which this carelessness created in the first place.  Subsections (1), (2) and (3) could have been drafted differently, could have been drafted better and could have been drafted in a manner which will not give rise to further constitutional litigation.  One thing which is fairly sure is that somebody is bound to test out the constitutionality of this Bill.  It is a certainty so far as any legal matter is concerned that somebody will have a vested interest in trying to undo this Bill. Therefore, the Bill should have been presented after much more reflection and should have been presented in a way which is least likely to trail a coat in front of the constitutional jurisdiction of the High Court or the Supreme Court.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1012" /> The Bill should be referred to the President under Article 26 to see if it is constitutional in its intended consequences because if it is not it will make it a laughing stock of this House that, confronted with one constitutional problem and one unnecessary defect in the administration of justice, we compounded it by a remedy which was unconstitutional.  I do not think there is a procedure for petitioning the President in relation to Article 26 but it should go on the record of this House that more than one Deputy believes that the President should take the advice of the Council of State on the Bill, send it to the Supreme Court before signing it to see if it does have the effect claimed for it and does not go too far.  If this was done at least we would have some degree of certainty in regard to the litigation which would follow.  It would be dreadful if a huge crop of litigation arose out of the passing of this Bill and the result was that the High Court or Supreme Court struck down the Bill in two years time with even worse consequences not alone for the judicial system but for the credibility of the legislative system.</P>
    <P>I want to put on record my request that the Bill be sent by the President to the Supreme Court and that members of the Council of State should raise this with him so as to prevent an embarrassment arising out of what I consider to be a defective attempt to deal with a very serious problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened to a very interesting debate including, in particular, the Second Stage contribution by Deputy Kelly, a former lecturer of mine in Roman Law which he brought up again in this House.  One has to say that his arguments were persuasive up to a degree about commonsense, as Deputy Barrett would put it, the need for the State to continue in being and that it should not fall apart because of simple administrative inadvertencies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The difficulty &mdash; and Deputy Kelly referred to this &mdash; goes to the heart of the Bill, that is, section 1.  He refrained from dealing with the concept of reasonableness judging between, as he put it, the overriding requirements of an ordered society, and he referred to the <Col N="1013" /> McMahon case which Chief Justice O'Higgins spoke about, not allowing administrative problems to take over and that these would put into second place the constitutional rights of the individual. Deputy Kelly admitted that there must be a line drawn but he refrained from drawing that line.  I believe that is the difficulty we face today.  We have a real query about where the line can be drawn in this Bill.  If in the case of a judge who was not a judge and who presided over many thousands of cases we can simply wave the magic wand and allow him to have been a judge, where will that end? That is a very dangerous precedent to follow and for that reason and a number of other reasons, as Deputy McDowell and I said earlier, the Bill should be referred by the President to the Supreme Court.</P>
    <P>As the Minister said in his reply to the Second Stage debate section 1 (3) allows for other constitutional challenges which would relate to cases that came before Mr. Mahon but would not relate to his inability to preside there.  That may well be the case but the subsection as it is drafted does not exclude cases brought because of the present impasse we find ourselves in.  It does not exclude people from challenging decisions he made on the grounds that he was not a properly designated judge or justice at that time. No matter what the Minister has said concerning other cases, if it allows that constitutional rights may be in conflict with the terms of this Bill, then we are acknowledging that there is a constitutional defect in the Bill.  We must give that very close scrutiny.  As I said earlier, if at the beginning of the consideration of this Bill we are faced with an acknowledgement that there are constitutional problems with it, I believe the case I have made is all the easier to make.</P>
    <P>The Minister and others referred to the remuneration, pension rights, and so on, of Mr. Mahon.  I would certainly have a lot of sympathy for somebody who finds himself in that situation, having worked effectively for four years.  One does not ever expect a person to do that without payment.  His expectation was that his pension rights would be growing.  There are ways of getting around that problem.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1014" /> The State can provide for that kind of difficulty either by an <i>ex gratia</i> payment or otherwise.  That is not a real argument for pushing ahead with this Bill.  There are other methods of dealing with some of the problems which arise.  I mentioned them on Second Stage.  Many of these decisions are not challengeable because of the time lapse.  It is a case of facing up to the real difficulties.  Deputy Kelly also referred to that.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barrett made a lot of play about commonsense as if he, among the Deputies who contributed, had a monopoly of commonsense.  That is certainly going over the top.  Everybody here wants in a commonsense way to come up with the right answer to this problem. However, when does commonsense go too far and what protection can we expect the law to afford the individual if we simply take a subjective view of what constitutes commonsense?  The courts are intimate part of the administration of justice.  We do not expect to get in the courts the commonsense of the common man.  We expect justice and we expect to have some sure idea of what will emerge from a court because the law is written down and there are precedents, etc.  We also expect that the machinery which operates the administration of justice will be as it purports to be, that the judges will be duly appointed and will uphold the law as laid down.  It is not enough simply to say we need commonsense.  We need a commonsense approach to sorting out this problem.  We must analyse the real problem and not simply refer to the thousands of cases.  Obviously this man worked at a very high rate to get through the voluminous cases mentioned here. That does not mean we must run for cover and take this Bill as the only way around the problem.</P>
    <P>The Minister did not say that the Attorney General felt this Bill was a constitutional way of going about it.  There are constitutional queries which have been raised since the Bill was published. I raised them with representatives of the Department, as did others.  I do not believe the Minister could make two separate speeches about this Bill and not refer to the fact that the Attorney General feels the Bill is constitutional if in <Col N="1015" /> fact he does.  I call on the Minister to say whether the Attorney General considers the Bill to be constitutional or not.</P>
    <P>The laws we enact in this House are only one part of the administration of justice.  It is on the administration of justice that the State stands or falls.  I do not believe that the whole body of cases involved under Mr. Mahon need fall simply because we discover that there is an administrative mistake.  We make the laws here but they are implemented by the courts.  If we do not keep to the order of the House in the throughput of legislation we are swiftly told that we cannot behave in that manner.  We expect the same of the courts of justice.  If they are not constituted correctly, the defect should be remedied immediately.  Simply to rely on the Legislature to deem something to have been properly constituted is not the way to deal with the problem. We must analyse the consequences of this action and consider the realistic ways of resolving the difficulty within the confines of the administration of justice and of the Constitution.  Whether Deputy Barrett likes it or not, that is the system under which we operate and if we did not have it we would have anarchy.  The talk about commonsense, changing things if we need to change them or holding a referendum if we need one simply horrifies me.  That kind of talk is not what makes a State work.</P>
    <P>I have grave reservations about section 1.  It is not that I wish it not to work; I wish it could work but I believe it should be referred to the Supreme Court.  If the Minister would consider initiating other methods of dealing with the problem he would be doing the House and the State a service.</P>

      <P>I realise your concern and I am also conscious of the time scale for the debate.  We have gone somewhat off the rails regarding this legislation.  All <Col N="1016" /> sides have agreed that we are talking about a technical hitch, a clerical omission or mix-up regarding a birth certificate and a date.  There is an interest among certain parties in gloating over an imaginary can of worms that is about to be opened.  That in itself is a grave danger.  Deputy Taylor spoke about going into Rathfarnham District Court and purporting to be a district justice. Everyone agrees that there was no element of fraud in this case.  Nobody purported to be other than he was.  This man was lawfully appointed in 1976 and due to nothing more than a clerical error the circumstances of his jurisdiction are now in question.  It is completely different from an attempt to defraud somebody or purporting to take upon oneself the role of a district justice.</P>
      <P>We are legislating for the public interest and I am satisfied that the Minister spoke to the Attorney General about it and is satisfied with the advice he received.  This House must accept that.  I would urge the Progressive Democrats to think of the public interest, the fact that there are 74,000 road traffic cases and 17,500 civil actions&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The attempt to redress the difficulty is incorporated in this legislation.  I sympathise with the Minister because this is a very difficult matter that he has to try to redress and he has made an effort to do so.  I hope the legislation will be passed with that in mind.  We have attempted to redress a technical hitch.  There is no question of anybody trying to undermine the functions of the Judiciary and the District Court.  Nobody is attempting any sharp practice.  We are talking about redressing a simple technical hitch.  I urge the Minister, if he has any difficulties, to go back <Col N="1017" /> to the Attorney General on the matter.

We have discussed the way in which it came about and I will not go into it again at this stage.  Nobody said it is not a difficult problem.  It was not created by anyone here but it is a problem for which we want to try to find a solution. Nobody likes retrospective validation and nobody likes to have to bring in legislation to bring it about.  At the end of the day it is a matter of judgement.  The legal advice which the Minister has is that this would not be repugnant to the Constitution. Deputy Flanagan is correct when he says the Minister is satisfied with the advice he has received in that respect. I ask the Deputies to accept those assurances.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimKemmy" hpid="Mr. Kemmy Mr. Kemmy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kemmy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not have persisted in raising this matter in the House this evening if the subject matter of my case had not warranted it.  The fact that the Belltable Theatre and Art Gallery in Limerick have been closed for the past three weeks is a matter not only of concern and importance to the people of Limerick but also of national concern and importance.  The Belltable Arts Centre was established in Limerick in 1981 and <Col N="1018" /> since that time it has become an integral and central part of the cultural and social life of Limerick.  In that period the Belltable centre has hosted plays, concerts, arts and sculpture exhibitions, poetry readings, the launching of books and records, a variety of entertainments and other events.  International, national and local theatrical companies have performed there in a cross-section of plays.</P>
      <P>This year the local company, the Island Theatre Company, Limerick's first professional theatrical company, was formed.  It has used the Belltable centre as its permanent home and base.  Some hundreds of art and sculpture exhibitions have been held in the Belltable centre in the past seven and a half years and many of these exhibitions have been opened by Government Ministers.</P>
      <P>The Art Gallery has also hosted many travelling exhibitions from the Arts Council and other such bodies.  In its relatively short life the Belltable centre has made a valuable and lively contribution to the cultural life of Limerick and the entire mid-west region.  Unfortunately, it is not possible in the world in which we live today for a provincial theatre to be financially viable.  Indeed outside of Dublin &mdash; there are also some doubts about many of the theatres in Dublin &mdash; all Irish theatres need some form of financial assistance to survive and the Belltable theatre in Limerick is no exception to this rule.</P>
      <P>That theatre started off with a very severe handicap.  It began with a fairly large debt due to the refurbishment of the theatre.  It was most unfair that the Belltable theatre should be saddled with this debt at the start of its life.  It was most unjust to a small provincial theatre. Seven and a half years later the Belltable centre is now £70,000 in debt.  As I have said, the threatre and art gallery have been closed or, to use the language of the profession, have been in the dark for the past three weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to explain to the House how these debts came about.  The Belltable centre has not received adequate funding to enable it to survive economically. In answer to a question in this House on 8 November this year, the Tánaiste, speaking for the Taoiseach, <Col N="1019" /> stated that the Belltable centre, in the period from 1985 to 1988, received an increase in Arts Council funding from £16,000 per year to £40,000 per year. While this increase would appear to be dramatic and while the Tánaiste was correct in his statement to this House, these figures must be analysed because they do not bear out the full story of the financing of the Belltable Arts Centre in the period mentioned by the Tánaiste.</P>
    <P>In 1985 the Belltable centre generated 93 per cent of its total income, a figure worth thinking about.  Unfortunately, this figure was reduced to 81 per cent in 1987.  There were a number of reasons for that.  The increase in the Arts Council funding must be viewed within these relative terms.  In the same period most of the other art centres throughout the country generated only 50 per cent to 65 per cent of their entire income.  In this respect the Belltable's achievement and excellence must be attributed to its record in gaining the sponsorship of a number of private firms in the mid-west region.  In passing I should say that the Belltable &mdash; in the period since the inception of the national lottery &mdash; received only £10,000 from that source.</P>
    <P>There are two immediate problems facing the Belltable Theatre and Art Gallery at present.  The first is the clearance of the £70,000 debt I have mentioned and the second is the question of its access to increased Arts Council Funding.  Given the present economic climate generally the Belltable centre cannot generate any more income from its resources without raising admission ticket prices to an unacceptable level which would automatically cut off whole sections of the community it was established to serve.</P>
    <P>If we in this House are really serious about making increased public access to the arts a reality, we must make a realistic financial commitment to the Belltable centre and other such centres throughout the country.</P>
    <P>Of course there are also other vital considerations to be taken into account in this matter also.  There are eight permanent jobs at stake, a similar number of part-time jobs, nine social employment scheme places and countless other <Col N="1020" /> employment opportunities for actors, artistes and musicians participating in local and touring groups who use the support structures of the centre and its facilities throughout the year.  Therefore it will be readily appreciated that it is almost impossible to quantify the practical and cultural benefits to be derived, in one form or another, from the Belltable centre.  It would be a disaster for Limerick and the country as a whole if the Belltable Arts Centre were forced to close its doors because of our failure to provide the relatively small amount of money necessary for its survival each year.</P>
    <P>Without, I hope, appearing to be bitter or acrimonious &mdash; which I hope I never am in this House &mdash; I would have to say that I would be lacking in my civic capacity and as a public representative if I did not put on the record this evening my deep disappointment to read in the press this morning that, of the total of £372,000 allocated to Limerick city yesterday, the Belltable centre received nothing whatsoever, not even a brass farthing. While I do not begrudge any other group their right to survival the three projects which have secured those grants are laudable; they are excellent groups in their own right doing useful work in Limerick especially with regard to youth development, nevertheless I believe the Belltable centre should have featured prominently in the allocation of that £372,000.  I have my own view on why that money was made available to Limerick city but I will preserve that for another occasion.  I regret very much that the Belltable Arts Centre did not feature in that list.  I am sure there was plenty of money available to help out the Belltable centre in its modest quest for survival.</P>
    <P>At present the Belltable theatre and art gallery are closed.  Its assistant administrator, public relations officer and stage manager have been laid off over the past three weeks by way of enforced holidays and will remain so in the immediate future unless immediate financial help is forthcoming.  Their employment prospects and those of other part-time employees and participants in the social employment scheme appear very bleak. At present there remain open in the <Col N="1021" /> centre only the restaurant and coffee shop, staffed by one or two permanent employees, the remainder being part-time who are paid at a very modest rate.</P>
    <P>The problem is further aggravated by the fact that a new Arts Council is about to be appointed.  Perhaps the Minister of State would be good enough to let me know when the members of this new council will be appointed and will take up office.</P>
    <P>Because of the urgency involved I would appeal to the Minister of State to make an immediate decision in this matter.  I know, from my personal dealings with her over the years, that she is a compassionate, enlightened person.  This has been demonstrated by her attitude to the Rape Crisis Centres throughout the country.  Generally she has been very helpful to me in the past.  It would be my hope that she would respond this evening in a similar fashion.</P>
    <P>In the Belltable centre recently I spoke to the Minister's colleague, the Minister for the Marine, about the provision of assistance for the centre.  I met him when he was opening an art exhibition there when I fully outlined to him the case for the survival of the centre.  He showed a sympathetic interest in the problem and offered to help in whatever way he could. In this connection I might make a suggestion to the Minister of State.  It should be remembered that SFADCo have responsibility for the promotion and development of tourism in the mid-west region.  The company also have an entertainment division which is responsible for the entertainment provided by the company in the Bunratty, Knappogue and Dunguaire Castles.  Indeed SFADCo are also represented on the board of the Belltable centre.  It should be possible for SFADCo, within their enlarged budget, to give help to the Belltable centre on an annual basis thereby enabling it to survive.  There is no reason that company should not be able to do so.</P>
    <P>I might reiterate my earlier appeal to the Minister to allocate some national lottery funding to the Belltable centre to enable it clear its debt.  As the Minister may have noted I have refrained from any bitterness or acrimony with regard to where allocations of national lottery <Col N="1022" /> funds have gone.  I do not believe in useless incriminations in this House.  The Minister will take the point I am making. I would welcome her support in seeking a greater annual grant from the Arts Council, as a matter of urgency, to the Belltable centre to enable it keep its doors open.  I would appeal to her also to use whatever resources may be at her disposal to clear the £70,000 debt which has accumulated there over the past seven and a half years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>A Leas-Cheann Comhairle, you and I would agree, having listened to that case, that the Belltable Arts Centre has a worthy champion in Deputy Kemmy.  I have noted carefully a number of additional points that may not have been made already raised by him here this evening.  As an avid theatre-goer myself, as one of those who was extremely critical for many years, that all of the best in Irish theatre was in Dublin &mdash; as I think Deputy Kemmy said when speaking &mdash; I know the difference The Druid Theatre Company in Galway made to the west.  I can appreciate that a similar impact would have been made by the Belltable Arts Centre in the mid-west region.  All of us appreciate that the Belltable Arts Centre, now in its seventh year of operation as the arts centre for the mid-west region, is an arts centre of major stature in artistic and cultural terms.  It has given access to the theatre-going public in Limerick and its environs to professional touring theatre companies, Irish and foreign. The centre has also hosted a number of music network concerts as well as other occasional recitals and held important visual arts exhibitions on its premises.  It has also been the venue of a very active film club.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The artistic success of the Belltable is due in no small measure to the commitment, energy and imagination of its director and staff.  However, the harsh reality of life today is that critical success <Col N="1023" /> must go hand-in-hand with a grasp of commercial realities.  The Belltable has been assisted in carrying out its work by funding from a number of public sources including the Arts Council, the national lottery, FÁS schemes, SFADCo, and Shannonside Tourism as well as funding from Limerick Corporation and Limerick County Council.  Of course, the centre has been a major recipient of Arts Council funding since its inception in 1981. Since then it has received more than £170,000 in direct grant-aid from the Arts Council.  For example, in 1988 the total Arts Council grant-aid will amount to almost £47,000.  The level of the Belltable's grant from the Arts Council has increased by 74 per cent since 1986, surely something which reflects the importance which the council attaches to the work of that centre.  The level of Arts Council financial support is all the more striking when one appreciates that the funding by the council of other arts centres has remained static in the period since 1986.</P>
    <P>As I already indicated, the Belltable Arts Centre has received lottery assistance amounting to £10,000.  Deputies may well plead that additional lottery funding should be provided for it.  In the first instance, it must be appreciated that the lottery aid of £10,000 for the Belltable was for &ldquo;once-off&rdquo; capital purposes, that is to say, to meet the cost of painting the fabric of the building and the refurbishment of light and sound fittings.  Even more fundamentally, I would draw the attention of the House to the recent statement by the Taoiseach on the future allocation of lottery funds to assist cultural <Col N="1024" /> projects, when he stated here on 29 November:</P>
    <P>There are a number of major cultural institutions for which my Department have responsibility and to which we have had to resort to lottery funds to support and carry out necessary works, and they are in a category by themselves.  It would be my intention from now on to allocate all moneys for the arts to the Arts Council and give them full jurisdiction over the distribution. As the Deputy knows, in the early stages of the lottery there were instances where both the Arts Council and the lottery were giving assistance, and this was not satisfactory.  It is my intention that from now on my Department would withdraw totally from this area and whatever resources are available from the lottery would be given to the Arts Council to distribute.</P>
    <P>In summary, the future funding of the Belltable Arts Centre will be a matter for the Arts Council which is, of course, statutorily independent in the way in which it allocates its funding.  As the House is aware, a new Arts Council will be appointed before the end of the present year.  I have every confidence that the incoming council will fully appreciate the needs of regional arts centres such as the Belltable Arts Centre.</P>
    <P>I will ensure that the points made by Deputy Kemmy are brought to the immediate attention of the Director of the Arts Council so that he will be in a position to appraise the new council of all the facts.</P>

      <P>The matter to which the Deputy refers is a Commission Work Programme on the promotion of innovation in secondary education in the European Community communicated to the Council in mid-October.  The programme sets out a wide range of actions for member states under six broad headings which were identified as priority areas as a result of the two series of pilot projects on transition from school <Col N="959" /> to adult and working life.  Supporting or supplementary actions by the Commission are also included in the programme. These actions, by both the member states and the Commission, will be reflected in a resolution on innovation in secondary education which will be prepared in consultation with the Education Committee and which will be submitted to Community Education Ministers at their meeting in the first half of 1989.  The purpose of this resolution will be to seek to exploit fully within second level school systems the results and experiences of the pilot projects mentioned above and we will be participating fully in work at community level to this end.</P>
      <P>The Commission Work Programme is a fairly detailed document and so I propose to make a copy available to the Deputy.</P>

Their total weekly slaughter capacity is estimated at 50,000 head and the average weekly kill, which does not vary much throughout the year, is 37,000 pigs.  A major rationalisation and modernisation programme involving a total investment of some £140 million by 1992, supported by substantial FEOGA and State aid, is currently underway within the pigmeat industry.  It is envisaged that by 1992 that industry will be serviced by up to eight central slaughtering units each licensed to the highest EC and US Department of Agriculture standards and with a minimum capacity of 6,000 pigs per week.  A key element of the programme is a substantial increase in pig numbers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he will review the case of a person (details supplied) in Dublin 12 who had 219 contributions paid; who claimed for disability benefit in April 1987 whose payment was stopped in April 1988; if she should have continued to receive benefit as the guide to social welfare entitlements states that all new claims from April 1988 need 260 contributions but the requirement came to only 208 prior to that date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the conditions for the continuous payment of disability benefit is that a person must have 260 contributions paid since entry into insurable employment unless 52 weeks benefit had been paid immediately prior to January 1988.  According to the records of the Department the person concerned has a total of 219 contributions paid since entering insurable employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Disability benefit has already been paid for the periods 22 April 1987 to 21 July <Col N="979" /> 1987 and from 18 October 1987 to 22 April 1988.  She had made a late claim for maternity benefit for the period from 22 July 1987 to 17 October 1987.  This claim has been admitted.  She also claimed and was paid maternity benefit for the period 13 June 1988 to 3 September 1988.  Accordingly disability benefit is due to her for the periods from 23 April 1988 to 12 June 1988 and 4 September 1988 to 11 October 1988 when the combined total of weeks of disability benefit entitlement reached 52.  In order to qualify for the further payment of disability benefit the person concerned requires a further 13 weeks of insurable employment.</P>

      <P>Persons in receipt of the long-term rate of unemployment assistance are entitled to a weekly fuel allowance under the national fuel scheme provided that they (a) live alone or (b) reside only with a qualified adult dependant and/or child dependants.  A qualified dependant for this purpose is a person in respect of whom an adult or child dependant allowance is payable.  No fuel allowance is payable where any person other than the qualified dependants are residing with the claimant.</P>
      <P>The person concerned is in receipt of unemployment assistance at the long-term rate of £38.80 per week.  His wife is in receipt of disability benefit of £54.20 plus £5.00 pay related benefit per week. As he is residing with somebody who is not a qualified dependant he is not entitled to receive a fuel allowance under the 1988/1989 national fuel scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Eligibility for free food under the European Community Free Food <Col N="980" /> Scheme, which is administered by the Society of St. Vincent de Paul under the aegis of the Department of Agriculture, is confined to persons in receipt of the long-term rate of unemployment assistance who qualify for a fuel allowance under the national fuel scheme.  As the person concerned is not in receipt of a fuel allowance he is not eligible for receipt of free food.</P>

      <P>The number of patients attending the casualty department at the North Infirmary has been very few.  From <Col N="983" /> 1 to 24 November this year only five new patients attended the casualty department of the North Infirmary, all of whom were referred to the Mercy Hospital.  In fact, during the current year only 353 new patients attended the casualty department at the North Infirmary.</P>
      <P>In these circumstances I felt that the proposed expenditure of £100,000 on the casualty unit at the North Infirmary could not be justified and that the best way to improve accident and emergency facilities for the people of the north city was to improve the cramped facilities at the Mercy Hospital.  I increased the level of the proposed capital grant to £335,000 to provide for renovations to the accident and emergency department at the Mercy Hospital and to provide a separate outpatient department.</P>

The school authority's application for grant aid towards the cost of a permanent extension is under consideration in my Department in conjunction with applications from other schools in a similar position and the school authorities will be advised of the outcome as soon as possible.</P>
