      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £153,762,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1988, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Agriculture and Food, including certain services administered by that Office, and of the Irish Land Commission, and for payment of certain grants, subsidies and sundry grants-in-aid. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Estimate is for a gross amount of some £330 million.  However this represents only a minor part of the total spending by my Department.  As part of ongoing support from the EC for Irish agriculture my Department oversee and supervise a large number of support measures and special aids which are fully funded by Brussels.  These measures will result in expenditure of some £840 million being paid by my Department in 1988 to farmers and agri-business.  In addition the Department spend some £460 million funded from borrowings on the purchase of products into intervention.  The services being provided by my Department, including staff costs, are vitally necessary <Col N="2141" /> to meet our EC obligations and to maintain well-established standards for our agricultural exports.  There is much continuing misconception regarding the staff numbers employed in the Department. In that regard I must reiterate that the Department are involved in disbursing funds in the region of £1,630 million and staff costs must be viewed in that overall content and not just in relation to the voted moneys.</P>
    <P>The past year has seen a remarkable turnabout in Irish agriculture.  The slide in farm incomes was not only halted but was well and truly reversed.  It would have been difficult to believe that this was possible at the end of 1986 when farmers' confidence was at a low ebb.  The year's achievements in agriculture have been all the more remarkable given the restrictions in the operation of the Common Agricultural Policy.</P>
    <P>The indications now are that in the first year in office of this Government farm incomes increased by over 20 per cent. This boost in farm incomes is responsible in no small measure for the upward revision in GNP growth for 1987 to 5 per cent and I am glad to say that the trends in 1988 are showing further significant increases.</P>
    <P>A major element in this income increase is the reversal of the so-called price/cost squeeze.  Up to last year farm input prices have risen more quickly than farm gate prices for the products sold by the farmer.  Between 1980 and 1985, agricultural output prices rose by 35.6 per cent while input prices rose by 47.5 per cent.  Recently this trend was reversed. Farm output prices were particularly strong last year and increased in real terms for the first time since 1978.</P>
    <P>A further element in the substantial increase in farm incomes has been the steady decline in interest rates over the year.  In addition, inflation has been at its lowest level in two decades.  The general economic signals coming through this year are more positive than they have been for many years and have brought considerable benefits to the agricultural sector.</P>
    <P>Looking to the future, I feel there is <Col N="2142" /> still scope for an increase in farm incomes this year.  The reductions in the national quota will probably cause some reduction in the volume of milk output.  However, I am very happy to report that market buoyancy in the dairy sector is such that further increases in milk prices are imminent. Indeed one major co-op yesterday announced a retrospective rise of 1p per gallon from 1 May and a further 2p per gallon from 1 June.  I expect that the general increase will be of the same order.</P>
    <P>It is also likely that there will be an expansion in other sectors &mdash; sheep, poultry, crops etc.  On the inputs side, there should be a further reduction in volume, particularly feeding stuffs and fertilisers, as farmers make more economies in the usage of farm materials and services.  It is a bit early yet to be predicting the outturn for 1988.  Still I think we can expect agricultural output prices to show further increases even though the downward trend in input prices of the past two years appears to be levelling off.</P>
    <P>There is no reason why farmers cannot build on the achievements of this year despite the difficulties that lie ahead.  The expansion of the agriculture and food industry is a central element of the Government's <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i> It is of crucial importance to the economy as a whole in the years ahead that agriculture maintains the momentum generated in 1987.  In the EC context, the European Council at its meeting on 11/12 February last decided on a range of issues designed to strengthen the Community's ability to act arising from the entry into force of the Single European Act.  From an Irish viewpoint the main issues decided on were a larger and more equitably designed financial base for the Community, a doubling by 1992 of the Structural Funds for the less developed regions, including Ireland, and tighter budgetary discipline and management, including stabilisation measures for a number of sectors.  The European Council also laid down an overall guideline for agricultural expenditure, provision for its growth over the <Col N="2143" /> next four years and separate arrangements to deal with monetary fluctuations and to dispose of existing stocks.  These latter parts of the agreement are crucial for the future of Irish agriculture as they ensure a reasonable level of financing for the CAP well into the nineties.</P>
    <P>The doubling of EC Structural Funds should benefit farmers and rural areas generally in a special way.  Ireland has obtained substantial amounts under the various funds heretofore and it is certain that we can look forward to a greater flow of funds in the years ahead.  In my own Department we are considering urgently how to ensure that we get maximum benefit from the enlarged funds.  We are examining how to make greater use of the existing structural schemes and also new initiatives such as integrated rural programmes aimed at encouraging broadly based development in rural areas.  While agriculture will remain the cornerstone of rural prosperity, it must be accompanied in the future by other enterprises.  The enlarged Structural Funds can provide the impetus for such diversified development.</P>
    <P>The Commission's proposals on farm prices and related measures for 1988-89 represent a continuation of the restrictive approach which has applied to CAP expenditure in recent years culminating in the European Council's conclusions on stabilisation measures and application of tighter budgetary controls.  I will be heavily engaged this coming week in the final stage of these negotiations and I hope that we can achieve some improvement on the very restrictive proposals of the Commission.  The outcome of the Uruguay round of the GATT negotiations, which are likely to extend over the next few years, will be crucial to the future of international trade in agriculture and further reform of the CAP will have to be carried out in tandem with these new developments.  Our concern must be to secure a continuing return to our farmers and a commitment by all trading partners to bring about a better balance between supply and demand in the short and longer term.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2144" /> As regards disease eradication I have been impressed by the enthusiasm and commitment shown by the new management board in setting about its task. This bodes well for the achievement of the Government's target of reducing the levels of bovine TB by one half over the new four year programme.  The Government's approval of my proposal to maintain their commitment to the funding of the scheme over that period is a particular source of satisfaction to me.  It should bring to an end the continual uncertainty and dissatisfaction about the resources to be made available in any year and allows all the parties concerned to co-operate in removing the remaining obstacles to eradication.</P>
    <P>I should now like to refer to the main areas of agricultural production, starting with dairying.  Intervention costs continue to be a substantial burden on the Exchequer.  However the position has improved enormously on the dairying side.  No skim powder has been taken into intervention either this year or last year and all our stock and virtually all the Community stock has been disposed of. As regards butter, the situation has also improved dramatically.  Intake has fallen considerably from the levels experienced in 1986 and in early 1987.  So far this year only 2,200 tonnes have been taken in while disposal of the order of 60,000 tonnes have been achieved.  The infamous food mountains as far as dairy products are concerned are fast disappearing. The Community now has virtually no stocks of skim powder.  Butter stocks, which exceeded 1.3 million tonnes at the beginning of 1987, are rapidly being reduced to normal levels and are currently below a half million tonnes.</P>
    <P>These rather dramatic changes reflect changed circumstances in the milk sector and a greatly improved environment on international markets.  We had an exceptionally good year in the export market in 1987 and 1988 looks like being better. Our milk industry has broken free from its former dependence on intervention. There is now an eagerness in the industry to broaden its range of products and to embark on new projects.  Practically all <Col N="2145" /> our major co-operatives are involved in rationalisation and modernisation projects. What is particularly encouraging is that these involve value-added products. In recent weeks a number of significant projects have been announced and there are more in the pipeline.  This has been helped by the improved financial performance of milk processors during 1987 &mdash; the reality is that processors cannot develop or expand unless they have the financial resources.  Another major factor is the availability once again of FEOGA grants for projects from the milk sector. It must also be recognised that the improved economic situation, with inflation and interest rates at exceptionally low levels, has had a major influence.</P>
    <P>Recently, the Commission through Management Committee procedure reduced the level of aid for a number of support schemes including the aid for skim milk used in casein manufacture. Prices for skim powder have been very buoyant and in that sense it was to be expected that the support measures would come under review.  However, the levels of reduction sought by the Commission were quite draconian.  I immediately made direct contact with the Commission and I am pleased that they eventually agreed to reduce the cutbacks by approximately a half which has been a matter of relief for our dairy co-operatives and Bord Bainne.  Overall, the reductions must be balanced against the improvements which have occurred on the international market and falling production of skim powder in the Community.</P>
    <P>The broader question of rationalisation and amalgamation among co-operatives remains unresolved.  This is an issue which will not go away because the facts are that our industry is highly exportoriented and must compete in a very demanding and competitive international market and in a market which is becoming increasingly dominated by a smaller number of larger firms.  Therefore, we must have the kind of structures which <Col N="2146" /> will enable us to survive in that environment and to compete with the large scale operators.</P>
    <P>At farm level dairying continues to be a very important and attractive enterprise. The strengthening of international markets and the improving balance in the Community's milk regime have been translated into improved returns for farmers.  Dairy farmers have received very worthwhile increases over the past year and indeed during recent weeks. The reality is that dairy farmers are now receiving very good returns for their milk. For the short term at least the quota system is here to stay.  Dairy farmers must maximise their returns within their permitted quotas and this involves adopting systems of production which are most suited to their own individual circumstances.</P>
    <P>I have endeavoured to introduce some flexibility into the quota system and to make provision for farmers with small quotas and others with particular difficulties. The milk quota restructuring scheme which I negotiated as part of last year's price fixing package has met with a good response.  Under this scheme, and under the temporary leasing scheme I recently announced, special priority has been given to small quota holders and young farmers.  I am satisfied that this is a very effective attempt to manage the consequences of the quota decisions which are imposing quite severe restriction not just in Ireland but throughout the Community.  I want to put on record that the small farmers and young producers can be assured that they will remain my priority in the context of the quota free arrangements.</P>
    <P>The cattle and beef industry had a reasonably satisfying year in 1987. Although cattle numbers declined, there is strong evidence that the fall has bottomed out.  The yearly decline recorded at the December 1987 livestock enumeration was some 47,000 head compared with a decline of 153,000 head in the previous year.  I am glad to be able to say that now the national beef cow herd is recovering.  The fall in beef cow <Col N="2147" /> numbers has been reversed, cow slaughterings over the last 18 months have shown a significant decline.  They reduced by 13 per cent in 1987 and were down 18 per cent in the first four months of 1988 as compared to the same period last year. Artificial inseminations so far this year are showing a substantial increase on last year.  In the first four months of this year they were up 12 per cent on the same period last year.  The very good cattle and, in particular, calf prices so far this year should give further encouragement to farmers to increase the breeding herd.</P>
    <P>Another encouraging development is that there are signs that the quality of our national herd is improving.  Inseminations of continental breeds were up from 14 per cent in 1983 to 32 per cent in 1987.  This clearly indicates that our producers recognise that there is a stable market for beef from quality cattle.</P>
    <P>There were satisfactory developments also in the processing industry.  Live exports continued to fall and cattle slaughterings at meat export plants were one of the highest ever recorded.  Exports of beef in carcase weight equivalent terms increased by 4 per cent while exports to the United Kingdom increased by about 13 per cent.  Exports of vacuum packed beef increased by 50 per cent with exports in this form to the United Kingdom increasing by over 70 per cent.</P>
    <P>The salaries of the Department's staff at meat export plants are charged to subhead A1.  These staff are performing an essential task in ensuring that our meat exports are wholesome and produced under the most hygienic of conditions and all importing countries require veterinary certification to that effect.  Our task is to make certain that the highest possible standards are achieved at our meat plants.  In this way we can ensure the wide acceptability of our meat products on world markets at premium prices. Receipts of £6.5 million from inspection fees are provided for under subheads M27 and M30 towards the cost of providing this service to the meat industry.</P>
    <P>Sheep farming is an expanding area and one in which I am glad to say that <Col N="2148" /> there is still considerable growth potential. Although budgetary stabilisers have recently been applied to the sector, the common organisation of the market for sheepmeat continues to afford Irish producers important support through the ewe premium and producers can look to the future with confidence.  The Commission proposal to have a single ewe premium based on a single income loss for the entire Community ignores Ireland's dependency on export markets and the fact that our prices are at the lower end of the Community range.  This, therefore, is a proposal which I will resist since it is imperative that producer income is protected in the move to a single market.</P>
    <P>Last July, I was pleased to be able to announce a major plan for the development of the slaughtering/processing sector of the pigmeat industry.  The plan involves a total investment, including contributions from the State and from FEOGA, of up to £140 million by 1992 and is designed to create a number of centralised slaughtering units licensed to the highest EC and USDA standards.</P>
    <P>Increasing pig output from the existing 2.1 million to 3 million by 1992 is crucial to the success of the programme.  The report of the study group recently presented to me outlines a number of measures for achieving the necessary expansion.  At my request the group have now initiated discussions with the various sectors of the industry so that a specific action programme can be agreed upon and set in motion as quickly as possible. I feel that the pigmeat industry is on the threshold of a new and brighter future. Much, however, remains to be done and it is in the interests of all to ensure that the sector achieves its full potential.</P>
    <P>After two bad harvests and continuing pressure on returns to producers, the area under cereals decreased by 7 per cent in 1987.  However, production in 1987 increased by nearly 8 per cent over 1986. Production of malting barley increased significantly.  The quality was generally good and markets were available at premium prices both at home and in Europe. Producers are looking to malting barley <Col N="2149" /> to help offset some of the reduction in their returns as a result of cuts in support prices.</P>
    <P>Cereals were the major target of the European Commission's efforts to reduce the cost of the Common Agricultural Policy.  The stabiliser measures agreed recently by the European Council &mdash; a maximum guaranteed production threshold and an increase in the coresponsibility levy &mdash; may seem harsh, particularly as Ireland does not contribute to any significant degree of support costs.  The new measures are, however, mild compared with the first draconian proposals from the Commission.</P>
    <P>On the positive side, the Commission have agreed to tackle, in the context of the ongoing GATT negotiations, the problem of increasing imports of cheap cereal substitutes.  A scheme is also being devised to encourage the use of additional cereals in animal feed.  The proposals for set-aside of arable land being discussed at present will benefit some cereal producers.</P>
    <P>I am glad we are proceeding with the reinstallation of the installation aid scheme for young farmers.  I submitted details of this scheme to the European Commission some time ago, and I hope their approval will be forthcoming in the near future.  It is my intention that the revised scheme should apply retrospectively to 1 April 1987.</P>
    <P>Two notable improvements are being included in the 1988 schemes for disadvantaged areas.  The first which I announced recently is the extension of headage payments at the higher rates of £70 and £66 to suckling cows kept by dairy farmers throughout the disadvantaged areas.  I estimate that up to 12,000 farmers will, as a result, get higher grants in 1988 and this improvement will make a vital contribution to increasing beef cow numbers.  The second innovation is the payment of grants of £32 or £28 on the non-thoroughbred brood mares registered in the Irish horse register. This will encourage growth in the numbers of horses kept by farmers in the areas.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2150" /> I am providing £23.1 million under subhead B4 for agricultural research, training and advisory services.  This is an increase of £3.1 million on the original £20 million allocation and is mainly in lieu of the local contributions by county councils for agricultural services which arrangement is now being terminated arising from the Teagasc legislation.</P>
    <P>The food and drink industry is of particular importance to the Irish economy in terms of production, employment and exports.  Approximately 23 per cent of all those employed in manufacturing industry are engaged in the food and drink sector.  Exports in 1987 of drink and agrifood products accounted for close to £3 billion which represents about one-third of all our exports.  In order to fully exploit the potential of this sector it is essential to increase the added-value input through further processing.  Over £200 million of food imports can be substituted by home-produced products and the achievement of this target will result in a significant benefit to our balance of trade.</P>
    <P>I am sorry to have to rush through this estimate and give what is only a brief summary of the current position of what is a vital and healthy sector of the Irish Government's programme &mdash; agriculture and food.</P>
    <P>What I have said is only a brief summary which will enable the House to debate the issues.  In conclusion, we have seen what can be called extraordinary and beneficial changes in agriculture in the past year, despite the adverse market and other factors to which I referred earlier. I am confident that we can build on the achievements and that the agriculture and food sector will continue to play its pivotal role in the development of the economy as a whole.</P>
    <P>I recommend to the House the adoption of the Estimate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>It is now very clear that agriculture has been abandoned by the present administration.  In the meantime, the focus continues on the development of the food sector as the flagship of Irish indigenous industry.  This latter <Col N="2151" /> approach is one with which I entirely agree, but there is a major fundamental flaw in Government strategy.  Very simply, vast sums of money are being expended on the development of the food sector in the sure and certain knowledge of insufficiency of raw material supply. Commonsense alone would dictate a twin-track approach which would provide parallel incentives for production with those available for processing.  Despite this, the Minister continues to preside serenely over a continuing disastrous fall in the national cow herd numbers.  To compound the problem, he has reversed engines on his previous statements and now makes a ludicrous defence of his position by stating that this issue does not, in fact, constitute a crisis.</P>
      <P>It is very clear indeed that there is a crisis facing the beef industry because of shortage of supply.  The reduction in our milk quota in the past two years has major implications for the beef industry through reducing dairy cow numbers and thereby calf supplied for the beef herd.  Cow numbers have fallen by 100,000 over the last couple of years.  A further cutback in dairy cow numbers of 200,000 is in prospect over the next four to five years. Accordingly, the massive investment which has taken place and which is due to take place in beef processing will be an utter waste unless urgent measures are taken to build up cow and cattle numbers. The Minister now refuses to recognise this fact.  He did give some indication last year of at least a recognition of the problem.  However, his actions in failing to produce an acceptable suckling scheme, coupled with his avowed intention to decimate the advisory and research services, provide confirmation both of his inability and his unwillingness to face the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fine Gael have proposed a radical comprehensive action plan to increase beef cow numbers over the next five years.  The implementation of this programme will result in at least 1,000 additional jobs in the meat industry, extra beef exports of £200 million a year and <Col N="2152" /> viability for 20,000 to 30,000 farm families. No additional Exchequer spending is involved.  Yet, the Minister has refused to take on board these proposals.  For this reason alone he stands indicted before the people and on his departure will leave a legacy of lost opportunities as his main contribution during his tenure as Minister for Agriculture.</P>
    <P>There is the danger that a similar contradiction in policy will apply in relation to the pig industry.  Again, substantial incentives are available to update our processing facilities.  The Minister mentioned tying up the negotiations earlier on last year under the special programme; this has been negotiated by his predecessor, Deputy Deasy.  He should have been a little gracious and mentioned that fact.  However, the programme is in place.  The real problems facing our pig producers are not being faced.  It is difficult, if not impossible, to see how the targeted increase in output can be achieved unless and until the Minister faces these issues head on.  A cohesive scheme to improve our static production figures must be at least as important as the drive to update and improve our processing facilities.  Apart from his refusal to devote any resources or devise any effective policy initiatives to cope with these major problems, the Minister has demonstrated a determination to decimate the services whose purpose it is to support farmers' own efforts in achieving increases in production, improved quality and better onfarm efficiency.</P>
    <P>The ACOT/AFT debacle will stand as a further monument to the Minister's total lack of commitment to the development of agriculture to meet the challenges of the nineties and into the 21st century.  Hasty decisions, lack of planning, concessions to bureaucratic control, delays in introduction and processing legislation and an insistence in maintaining departmental structures at the expense of the front line services have characterised the Minister's approach to the merger.  If Teagasc happen to make an effective contribution to agriculture in the years ahead it will be in spite or <Col N="2153" /> rather than because of the Minister's best efforts.</P>
    <P>The hollow ring of Government rhetoric is nowhere more evident than in their announcements on rural development. Where is the Government policy for rural development?  Eight months after the statement in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> that a pilot scheme would be set up we have had the recent announcement from the Minister outlining the 12 areas involved.  The very minimum that was to be expected in the announcement was a substantial statement about both the philosophy underlying this move and the detail of how and when it is to be implemented.  Unfortunately, we were disappointed on both counts.  The whole concept of integrated rural development originated from the failure of conventional development strategies to have the desired trickle-down effect on disadvantaged areas and regions.  An essential prerequisite to such approach is the decentralisation of institutional structures and devolution of decision making.</P>
    <P>Later this year we are to have 12 coordinators who will report back to the Department of Agriculture and who in the course of their work will find themselves in some kind of administrative limbo.  We have been told that there is an urgency in preparing programmes and projects to avail of the enlarged structural funds.  In this situation the absence of any detailed philosophy or vision in the Minister's statement is utterly disturbing and disappointing.  Very simply, the doubling of the structural funds will be of no advantage to us in rural areas unless we have clear policies and established programmes to take advantage of the opportunity.</P>
    <P>To some degree the absence or otherwise of such a philosophy is not the crucial test.  After all, actions speak louder than words.  The reality is that in the autumn of 1988, one year after the announcement of the pilot IRD programmes and the merger of ACOT and AFT, there will be 500 fewer staff in these organisations, with the declared intention of reducing that number by a further 500.  Very many of these people were agents for rural <Col N="2154" /> development in the real sense of the word.  In their place the Government will in the course of time establish 12 people unattached to any organisation and scattered around the country in politically sensitive areas.  On that basis it is now very clear that those who were expecting results of any consequence from such an approach will be gravely disappointed.</P>
    <P>Similarly disappointed are those who were expecting action in relation to the proposal to re-classify all existing less severely handicapped and mountain sheep areas to more severely handicapped status and the extension of the disadvantaged areas boundaries. Decisions in this regard were made by the last Government and the proposal for reclassification was lodged with the EC last year.  It is now very clear that the present Government are dragging their feet on both counts.  Those who had legitimate expectations of income support through cattle headage and otherwise will be left waiting.  Their concerns are obviously not the concerns of this Government.</P>
    <P>Similarly, concerns expressed about the need for pollution control measures and for incentives in support of these have not been matched by action on the part of the Minister.  The revised western package was piloted through the European Commission by Commissioner Peter Sutherland last year after its formal approval by the Council of Ministers. There was a tremendous brouhaha in Castlebar to announce the details, but the Government have been criminally negligent in failing to put the necessary regulations in place so that the benefits of the revised package can be availed of. Nowhere is this more obvious than in regard to pollution control.  Most farmers accept their responsibilities in this regard, but they are being denied the opportunity to commence work because the grant structure has not been put in place.  The Government will bear a heavy measure of responsibility for any consequences which accrue as a result of this neglect on their part.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, the appalling delay in <Col N="2155" /> paying farmers their legitimate entitlements under the existing grant schemes is inexcusable.  On 1 January last a sum of £9 million was properly due and owing to farmers under the various grant schemes which remain outstanding and unpaid by a Government which had the gall to say that their books were balanced. I am aware of instances of farmers waiting for upwards of 12 months for payment of such grants due to them.  Apart from the obvious unfairness of the situation, particularly to farmers relying on temporary bridging overdraft facilities, this approach smacks of dishonesty.</P>
    <P>Young farmers seeking payment of installation aids are in a similar position. Furthermore, the ill-advised decision of 1987 to axe this scheme, followed by the U-turn last January to reintroduce it, has had the follow-through effect that the reintroduced scheme is not yet in place. When will the Minister shake the bureaucratic dust off his file, if only to restore what was in place before he came into office?  He cannot blame the European Commission for such delays since the proposal was only sent to Brussels for formal approval last month.</P>
    <P>Speaking of the European Commission recalls the bulldog-like efforts of the Minister's predecessor to secure the maximum benefits for Ireland in various EC negotiations during his tenure of office.  I recall the shallow criticisms of his efforts from the then Opposition and I do not intend to indulge in the same behaviour in relation to the present Minister. My attitude is that a Minister representing the country in serious negotiations on our behalf is entitled to our full support.  However, he will be judged on his efforts after the completion of negotiations and in this regard it must be said that the failure of the Minister to secure a national grain quota will have devastating repercussions for our cereal producers in the years ahead.  The Minister's half-hearted efforts in the present farm price talks give rise to no great confidence in his ability to secure a successful outcome.</P>
    <P>This short debate on the estimates <Col N="2156" /> allows for a brief assessment of the attitude of the Government towards the development of agriculture and the food industry.  Clearly, the Government regard agriculture as a soft target.  There is a reduction of £33 million in the Vote which, at 18 per cent, is six times the overall average decrease.  Within the Department, this huge reduction is managed in such a way by the Minister to ensure that the bureaucratic structures of the Department are kept fully in place and protected.  Therefore, it is not surprising that the Minister's record is one of total non-performance and complete inability to tackle the needs of our main productive sector.</P>
    <P>On the question of staffing, the Minister referred to a continuing misconception in this regard.  However, he does not give us any information in regard to numbers.  Where is the information in relation to the audit?  Where is the information underlying the Taoiseach's statement to the IMI Conference in Killarney when he admitted that there was overstaffing in the Department to the tune of 500 people?  The Minister has refused to publish that audit and he has been very tardy in replying to Dáil questions on the subject, so much so that those of us seeking information on the audit have been denied it.  All the Minister could say today was that there is a continuing misconception.  If that is the case, it is solely as a consequence of the Minister's inaction.  Let us have a full, clear and open debate about this matter, which would be fair to the Department. There are continuing stories about 90 people sitting at their desks with nothing to do for the past 12 months and about which the Minister seems to have done nothing.  That is damaging to the Department and that is why we should know the facts.</P>
    <P>The Minister also referred to the increases in farm incomes and gave reasons for it.  However, he ignored the main reason for the increase which was the marvellous weather.  Thank God for it and &mdash; unlike some of my Opposition colleagues &mdash; the Minister might give <Col N="2157" /> some credit to the man above and give Him his due and proper place&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Minister's record, since he came into office, has been disastrous. I appreciate that he has to make the best defence possible of his tenure to date.  I hope, without any great confidence, that in the remainder of his tenure of office he will make some effort to deal with the major serious problems facing our main productive sector, agriculture.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>The attempt to control public spending must be welcomed but we have a long way to go before we receive any benefits.  However, it is a change from the Fianna Fáil of the early eighties.</P>
      <P>In considering the Estimate for the Department of Agriculture and Food one could not be blamed for thinking that there is a major element of self-preservation involved.  Considering the cuts in other areas of agriculture, it seems ludicrous that there is only a cut of 2 per cent in general administration.  It seems the administration in the Department is above accountability and cannot be questioned.  It is high time the staffing audit for the Department of Agriculture and Food was made public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The massive amount of money spent on administration does not reflect the service to farmers.  Will the Minister list the achievements of An Bord Glas, which cost £168,000, over the past year?  Surely the Department, with all their staff, do not want yet another board to submit yet more reports to collect more dust?  The cut of 2 per cent in administration is matched by the massive cut of 44 per cent <Col N="2158" /> in AFT and ACOT which provided a vital service to farmers.  This will prove to be a major mistake in our most important industry.  It means that large areas of work will cease.  Do we stop training the next generation of young farmers?  Will there be reduced research?  What about the huge reduction in staffing levels?  This will have an inevitably disastrous effect on efficiency and productivity and we will be left with nothing more than the remains of an advisory service.</P>
    <P>I should like to examine the industry, sector by sector.  Dairying gained most from our membership of the EC and it is the most profitable sector in spite of the surpluses of dairy products.  Of course, the sector is not without its difficulties; the super-levy has created problems, not only for the small milk producer but also for the producer who was not fully developed by 1983.  Unfortunately, the trend is for small milk producers to get out of the industry for one reason and another.  It is inevitable that milk production will be concentrated in fewer hands.  Milk production will be vital to small milk producers because the Government have a social obligation to try to make it easy for them to continue in milk production.  If they do not, the opportunities in other sectors are not viable and they will have to leave the land.  The margins in other areas do not allow small farmers to continue.</P>
    <P>The only other alternative for the small farmer is to get into beef production.  I welcome the recent announcement by the Minister in relation to increasing grant payments on beef herds in disadvantaged areas.  However, beef producers' margins are greatly eroded because of the ban on growth hormones and the reduction of VAT refunds.  Not only is it important that we encourage farmers in disadvantaged areas to increase their cattle numbers, but it is also extremely important to encourage farmers in the lowland lying areas to increase their stock.  There seems to be a perception here that farmers not in the disadvantaged areas do not need help.  I ask the Minister to consider offering incentives to farmers in low lying areas to increase their cattle numbers.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2159" /> One of the biggest scandals in agriculture is the shortage of cattle and most people are now beginning to realise that unless we increase our cattle numbers we cannot possibly hope for agriculture to play its part in helping to get this country out of its economic crisis.  We have to get our cattle numbers up to the levels of the late seventies and until we do this we need not expect the additional jobs we have heard so much about in the past year to be created.</P>
    <P>I would now like to deal briefly with the sheep sector, which offers us unrestricted opportunities for expansion and we should avail of these in every way possible. We would not want to abuse the French market and it is important that we breed the quality lamb which they require.  That is just one opportunity for expansion which is available to us.</P>
    <P>Cereal production in this country is nearly finished, in my opinion.  We do not contribute in any way to the massive surpluses in the EC.  Despite these surpluses there is an increase in cereal substitute imports into the EC, and it is time that the Commission tackled this problem.  Cereal farmers in this country are facing extinction and until some positive steps are taken I foresee a very dark future ahead for cereal farmers.  I consider the set aside proposal which we hear so much about as a nonsense because as it stands at present it is very unattractive. Until a serious stand is taken by the Minister on behalf of cereal farmers, it is going to compound the problems which agriculture already faces.  There is no place to which these cereal farmers can go.  They cannot get into beef production because of the shortage of cattle and the outlook is very bleak.</P>
    <P>Pig production is being taken over by big companies such as Avonmore.  This is regrettable because farmers involved in pig production are not able to compete with the big co-operatives such as the one I have just mentioned and they come under extreme pressure when cartels are formed to keep the prices of pigs down. The margins in pig production are very limited.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2160" /> Let me now say something about farm pollution, which we hear so much about and which is a very topical subject at present.  I welcome the Minister's announcement that grants are now going to be made available to farmers in disadvantaged areas, but the Minister should also realise that most pollution is caused in low lying areas where the vast amount of silage is made.  Generally in disadvantaged areas a large amount of winter fodder is hay and it is high time that grants were made available to try to alleviate the problem.  Pollution cannot be controlled in a couple of months; it is going to take years to come to grips with it on most farms.  Farmers are now expected to control pollution and in some cases farmers are being told to get out of silage altogether.  That is a very negative approach and it is up to the Minister to try to make it as easy as possible for farmers to come to terms with pollution.</P>
    <P>We have to improve the quality of our fruit and vegetables and it is vital that we do this if we are to compete with our European counterparts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>In addressing this Estimate I wish to place very clearly on record my appreciation and that of my party of the position of land, agriculture and farming. We see the agricultural area as the greatest natural resource available to us and the Labour Party's socialist policies include in a very important way agriculture. These policies are aimed at the creation of jobs and wealth and agriculture would play a primary role in that regard.  This would be to the benefit of farmers and their families and workers in the downstream industries in processing and providing other services.  Therefore, socialists do recognise &mdash; let this be clearly understood &mdash; the potential, the massive potential, of agriculture.  I want to lay to rest and explode the myth that <Col N="2161" /> the Labour Party are in some way a threat to farmers and their families.  We want to assure farmers and their families that Labour Party policies will give them security of tenure on their farms from both a legal and economic viewpoint. That being said, I want to recognise the false perception, and the reason for it, of an anti-farm bias on the part of the Labour Party.  This arises from demands made by the Labour Party and the trade unions for an equitable tax return system. I want to deplore the incident outside this House where farmers, quite legally and rightly, demanding a just tax system were foolishly attacked by people who were misinformed about the nature of the demands being made by these small farmers. I call for what I see as a natural alliance between small farmers and their families and the PAYE sector.  There is a natural alliance there with common interests and I believe this would be desirable in trying to narrow the divide between town and country and city and country.</P>
      <P>The Labour Party support the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers' Association's campaign for the introduction of a land tax as an alternative to the present tax on accounts system.  The tax on accounts system penalises small and family farms by driving them into the hands of accountants to prove that they have little or no taxable income.  In many cases farmers pay out more to accountants than they do in tax.  The only beneficiaries of the present system are large farmers and ranchers who can afford an army of high powered accountants who exploit loopholes and avoidance mechanisms to reduce the tax yield on large farm incomes.  This is why the IFA are so strongly opposed to the land tax.  It is the small and family farms which lose out under the present system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The crisis in Irish agriculture, which is widely recognised, arises from the lack of investment, under capitalisation and low inefficient production.  A comprehensive land tax would facilitate a more planned approach to agricultural production by taxing land rather than production.  This would mean that the <Col N="2162" /> large inefficient farmers would pay a higher proportion of the tax than the efficient ones.  It would also lead to certainty in the tax system and allow farmers to engage in long-term investment planning by being able to calculate their tax liability years ahead.</P>
    <P>A comprehensive land tax on adjusted acreage would yield considerably more revenue with no compliance costs for farmers.  This would be a better deal for both small and family farms and PAYE workers.  The Labour Party have already tabled a motion in the House calling for the reintroduction of the land tax.  The Labour Party will do everything possible inside and outside the Dáil, to advance the case made by the ICMSA for an alternative land tax.  The additional revenue accruing from such a land tax would render it possible for the Minister to introduce a more realistic Estimate in this House for his Department.</P>
    <P>The structures of Irish farms warrant urgent and effective attention.  In this regard, I want to issue a plea today to the Minister for the reinstatement of the Land Commission.  The Land Commission has been described as dead but not buried.  The Taoiseach in a reference to the Land Commission in this House said that he refused to bury the corpses of others.  Therefore, what we are demanding is a Lazarus-like resurrection of the Land Commission; we want it given back its teeth, purpose and role The Land Commission was one of the most effective vehicles for the structuring of Irish land that had ever existed.  We want to see distribution of the land, of ranches that are under-utilised, mainly in the midlands, to family size farms.  We want to see that unused land taken up and given to farmers.  We are most anxious that the distribution of land is not dictated by market forces which will result always in the large, rancher-type farmer getting bigger and the small farmer being left out.  There has been no such distribution catered for in this Estimate, another reason for its not being acceptable to us.</P>
    <P>The AFT/ACOT conversion to Teagasc normally would have been very <Col N="2163" /> acceptable to my party and to me as spokesperson on Agriculture.  However, this £20 million cut device &mdash; which is what it effectively turned out to be &mdash; will result in loss of jobs, not just ordinary jobs, although of course some of those will be lost as well, but the loss of experts badly required in agriculture who will no longer be available in the numbers and quality required.  There will be a loss of service.  Again, those who will suffer first in that regard will be the smaller, poorer farmers.</P>
    <P>There will also be a loss of worker participation arising from the provisions of the Bill establishing Teagasc whereas previously workers were entitled to representation on the board that was their employer.  This has now been excluded. There is a loss of democracy involved in the provisions of the Agriculture (Research, Training and Advice) Bill, 1988, through the abolition of the county committees of agriculture who had offered to operate without cost but who were chopped by the Minister under the provisions of that same Bill.  There will be a loss of training, advice, research and development arising from its implementation. Henceforth the position will be that the big boys who can afford to buy the services will continue to do so and the smaller ones can go to hell.</P>
    <P>That appears to be the attitude permeating the agricultural policies of the present Government.  The passage of that Bill probably constituted the most backward step since the foundation of this State.  It amounts to a war on small farmers and will have the effect of wiping out very large numbers of them.  As somebody emanating originally from an area in which Fianna Fáil had the strong support of small farmers, it appears to me that Fianna Fáil have lost their soul.  If I could accept everything else contained in the Estimate the disastrous effects of that Bill &mdash; and I say disastrous deliberately &mdash; would lead to our opposition to this Estimate.</P>
    <P>I also want to ask the Minister to undertake a detailed re-examination of the CAP by his Department.  I believe that <Col N="2164" /> the Common Agricultural Policy has been a failure not alone from the point of view of any of its objectives outside farming but from the point of view of those set for itself.  It has not provided adequate farm incomes.  It has not provided cheap food; in fact, food arising from it is very expensive.  It has created a mountain of food which is an international scandal. There are examples of that in my constituency, where there is 76 per cent unemployment among principal breadearners, where there is a colossal warehouse &mdash; an ugly building which in my view should not have received planning permission for its construction in front of a housing estate &mdash; and where food is stored that the people in the houses across the road cannot afford to buy.  In fact, what the Common Agricultural Policy did was to transfer very large resources, provided, by and large by PAYE workers, to the fat cats in agriculture. There was an old saying in my part of the country that there was no need to rub the fat pig's arse in lard.  Effectively the Common Agricultural Policy did that. That has been to the detriment also of the other desirable programmes organised by the EC, because of the massive resources being transferred to agriculture, with the fat cats getting the lard.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil have betrayed the fundamental and historic struggles of Irish people &mdash; the basic tenet that land would be for the people.  They have betrayed their long-standing policies and special constituency in that regard.  By way of the programmes envisaged in this Estimate they are putting in place measures to drive out small, family farms.  In pursuance of those policies they will prove to have been more effective than were the bailiffs and sheriffs with the battering ram.  That is highly regrettable.  I would ask the Minister, and particularly the Government party, to re-examine the effectiveness of the policies they are pursuing. As I have pointed out, all of these considerations will lead to my party opposing this totally inadequate Estimate and the unacceptable plan contained therein for agriculture.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. J. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The expansion of the food and beverage industry is a key element of Government policy.  That policy is that the future of the food industry should be guaranteed by changing the emphasis from a production-led attitude to a market-led one, through the creation of value-added consumer-ready products for identified markets at home and abroad.  This policy will render the industry less vulnerable to changes in EC policy, enabling it to compete with the best our continental partners can offer.</P>
      <P>In order to lay the groundwork for this change of attitude and policy the Office of Food, in conjunction with the IDA, prepared a five-year strategy for the development of the food and beverage industry.  This strategy, published last Christmas, clearly set out firm policy guidelines and charted the course for IDA grant support for the food sector over the next five years.  Key elements in assessing business potential in this overall area are soundly-based market plans and product development capacity.  I can say clearly that support in the future will be less in the form of grants or hand-outs in relation to fixed assets and very much more in the form of State investment in total business, that is management, key marketing strategy and identified outlets for products.  The strategy aims to increase exports by £350 million and to create 5,000 new jobs by 1992.  The potential areas for net job creation are the beef industry, pigmeat industry, the poultry and sheep meat sectors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Further expression of the Government's commitment to the food sector is evident in the recently published consumer survey by the IDA, in which my Office was closely involved.  That survey identified 28 new food products where growth potential exists and highlighted and potential for substituting approximately £250 million worth of imports of food products into Ireland.  This will be of considerable advantage, particularly to smaller Irish companies, who are seeking a specialist product and an outlet for it, initially on the home market, hopefully <Col N="2166" /> graduating to competitive European and world markets.</P>
    <P>Opportunities in this area will provide a great scope for progressive Irish companies to meet the challenges of international competition on the home market and prepare them for launching their products on the world market.  The successes already achieved by the Irish food and drink companies on the international market demonstrates that the best of Irish products can become world leaders in specialist areas.  We all know of unique Irish products which were launched in the past decade from a relatively modest base that are now market leaders in many countries.  In order to lay the foundations for 1992 and to take the food industry into the next millennium we have a clearly defined strategy for the future of food and in the recently published IDA consumer products publication.</P>
    <P>I was very pleased to perform the official opening of the National Food Centre recently.  Product development and research into new areas and trends in industry is absolutely crucial for the development of a modern food industry. The new food centre at Dunsinea, along with its sister centre at Moorepark, will provide the essential back-up and the R and D support necessary for a developing food industry.  The graduates and research and development workers in both of those centres will be available in their laboratories and processing halls in the centres to work confidentially with the industry; or, if the industry want to have the work done in factories in their own locations, the research workers at both of those centres will be very glad to do the work at those factories.</P>
    <P>During the past 12 months I have emphasised over and over again the importance of quality products and the essential requirement of quality right through from production to the finished product.  I was glad to be associated with the introduction of the Abattoirs Act, which I am delighted to say has passed all Stages and will be fully operational by the end of this year.  That Act and the <Col N="2167" /> regulations under it will provide important assurances not alone for Irish consumers but for our customers right throughout the world.  Under the Abattoirs Act each domestic abattoir will be licensed by the Department of Agriculture and Food; and there will be super-vision and inspection of all slaughterings, including health marking of carcasses by veterinary inspectors employed by local authorities.  This will mean that the meat which we eat will be subject to stringent health and hygiene regulations and standards. This is important because regrettably in recent years there were instances which were of no credit to the meat industry or food industry.  It is important for the image and picture we hold to the world that we clearly demonstrate in the home market that we have standards which will enable us to achieve the highest possible quality products.  This is important for the domestic market as well as for our export trade.</P>
    <P>The Abattoirs Act represents an important milestone for the Irish meat industry because for the time legislation has been introduced which is specifically geared to the meat business. Up to now the rules governing the preparation and sale of meat on the home market were contained in some 80 individual sets of local authority by-laws which dated back to the last century.  It is important that these regulations have been brought up to date.  The trade now have a modern Act to operate under and one in whose formulation they were very closely involved through the Irish Master Butchers Federations, the Irish Meat Wholesalers Association and the Irish Domestic Meat Traders Association.  I consulted with these and other bodies prior to and right through the passage of the Act through the Oireachtas and their helpful and responsible approach to the legislation was very much appreciated. Those consultations are ongoing in the drawing up of regulations under the Act. Most of our abattoirs are owned by family butchers, many of whom have been in the trade for generations.  These people know and accept that fresh ground rules <Col N="2168" /> have to be established.  They are aware also of the challenges facing them both now and increasingly from 1992 onwards when they will be part of a single European market.</P>
    <P>The ground rules have been laid and solid foundations have been prepared for the food industry.  I believe the Government can be well pleased with their record in promoting the sector since coming into office.  More than anything else the general economic climate had to be put right first so as to maximise investment in the industry.  It is most encouraging that the key indicators are coming right; inflation is down to less than 2 per cent; interest rates are down to their lowest levels for 20 years, and not alone are we surpassing previous Irish performances but more importantly relative to our competitors in Europe, in both inflation and interest rate terms, we are doing historically important work.  While this is the most effective way to facilitate investment decisions in general, I believe it was important for the Government to signal very early on that they meant business in relation to the development of the food industry.  In the Finance Act, 1987, we changed the capital allowance system for food processing, which was specific to the food industry, to give them an additional kick start which will take them into the next decade.</P>
    <P>During the past year we have been most successful in relation to the uptake of FEOGA grants and we have been maximising that area.  Regrettably, during the previous decade there was something of a scandal in that the uptake of FEOGA grants or the drawing down of money was not as efficient or effective as it should have been.  However, with greater selectivity in the applications for FEOGA grants during the past year a record £20 million was made available to the food industry and during the next few weeks a further £10 million will be made available for the development of the Irish food industry.  The food industry have not been slow to react; in fact, there has been an enthusiastic response to this new environment which had major investment programmes totalling almost £600 <Col N="2169" /> million undertaken in the past 12 months, most of which are now on stream. Additionally, there was an increase of 30 per cent in food exports during the past 12 months, an increase from some £1,900 million to £2,500 million.  It is most encouraging that the major organisations in the food industry have responded to this new climate and new support for this critical industry.</P>
    <P>The beef industry is one area where there is considerable scope for development, especially in the value-added sector.  I am glad that in the first three months of this year artificial inseminations were up by over 40,000 head which is over a 12 per cent increase.  A greater number of farmers are being more careful to ensure that they will have a much higher ratio of calves per herd. There will be a badly needed increase in the number of beef cattle coming onstream to avail of our processing capacity.  Several of the players in the beef industry are marching forward with major development plans and this will have a dynamic effect in stimulating increased exports and increased value to the economy.</P>
    <P>In the pigmeat sector a major modernisation programme costing over £140 million has been undertaken.  Already two plants are up to USDA standards and more will come onstream.  Here again, the plan is to increase the size of the pig herd from around two million to three million.  I have no doubt that Irish farmers and pig producers will respond to a profit margin.  If they know there is a strategic plan to ensure long term profitability, they will respond.</P>
    <P>In the dairy industry as well, there is a very valuable investment programme. Structural reorganisations have taken place and there is a degree of dynamism in the dairy sector which will be quite important for the future.  The dairy area will come right up to world standards. Our expertise and technology in that area is second to none.  The dairy sector will make the most of the limited volume of milk we have now by converting it into the most remunerative products.  There is tremendous potential for development <Col N="2170" /> in the food industry and the rewards for this development are great.  We have great assets and advantages in this area. We have a unique location for a progressive food industry.  My office door is always open to the industry or to anybody who has a contribution to make to the development of this industry which is so important to our economy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very important debate.  The Government were slow enough to give credit where credit was due in this area.  Listening to the Minister of State one would think that everything that has happened in the food industry happened when he became Minister of State.  It should be acknowledged that a lot of the ground work for the new body was done before the Minister came into office.  I set up the new body and put the structure into place and I did not get much credit for it at the time.  It is important to say for the record, that what is happening now is good but that I was very much involved in the setting up of the structure.  I am glad it is working out.</P>
      <P>On the positive side, the whole dairy scene is the only bright spot on the horizon due mainly to the co-ops and the farmers.  If there is improved marketing, the credit must go to the co-operative societies.  If there is less food going into intervention it is because people like Mitchelstown Creameries are pushing their products further and further and are developing new ranges of products.  The same is happening with Waterford, Avonmore and Kerry Co-operatives. Belatedly, people have realised that intervention is not the marketplace.  For far too long the soft option was taken. They did not need a marketing team so everything went into intervention.</P>
      <P>One area which gives cause for concern is that some of the major co-operatives have gone too far into developing one product.  Casein might be an example. Over-investment in one product for export makes them very vulerable.  A change in the market or a change in Government policies abroad could have severe repercussions for us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a recent parliamentary question to <Col N="2171" /> the Minister I was disappointed the Minister did not take up the option to discuss my real concern about nuclear fall-out. Only the other morning, the Minister of State, Deputy Walsh, had to cope with a radio interview on nuclear fall-out, with regard to our milk powder becquerel levels.  That is a matter for concern.  The Minister said that he had no record of this.  The report on the &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; programme recorded our problems in the food industry.  We know that the food was sent back.  That is something totally outside of our control.  Although it might be embarrassing for some of his colleagues, the Minister and his colleagues should raise this with the Council of Ministers and ensure that the polluter pays.  In the northern hemisphere we have a very real problem.  The countries in the southern hemisphere will use nuclear pollution as a marketing ploy.  As soon as they start getting their products off the ground they will tell people not to touch anything from the northern hemisphere because of nuclear contamination. We should address ourselves to this problem.</P>
    <P>Recent successes in the beef industry can be attributed only to the people involved in the industry.  The progressive people, for instance Dawn Meats, long before now recognised that there was a market other than intervention and that we have a place at the top in that market. When I introduced the bull breeding legislation I got a lot of media criticism for insisting that we should have the highest quality beef.  I was ridiculed for that measure and it was regarded as not being serious legislation.  However, the result is that we now have top quality cattle.  That legislation has resulted in us steering away, as I advised at the time, from Holsteins.  We do not need the American-type Holstein here.  We have more milk than we are allowed to produce.  Let us hold on to what we have. Britain does not have it any more.  They talk about British Friesians, but they are not Friesians they are British Holsteins. We should hold on to our beef industry which gives us a guaranteed place at the <Col N="2172" /> top of the market in Europe.  That is where we will stay as long as we maintain quality.</P>
    <P>I have views on hormones.  One can say that natural hormones do not cause any problems but our customers in the European marketplace &mdash; and no amount of talk will change their minds about this &mdash; do not accept that because of recent and not so recent experiences.  If the housewife says: &ldquo;I want hormone free meat&rdquo;, then so be it, we give her hormone free meat.  That is the reason I agree with that decision.  We must give the housewife what she wants.</P>
    <P>We were talking about a 20 per cent increase in farm incomes.  The grain farmers have not had a 3 per cent increase much less a 20 per cent increase.  The grain farmers are going through a very bad time and I would like that that would be noted.  There is absolutely no light at the end of the tunnel for tillage farmers.  I had hoped and I suggested to the Minister at the time of the negotiations that we should look for the lifting of co-responsibility levies on items such as malting barley and wheat for bread, and, indeed it could be extended to all grain.  Because we are an island nation we have to be self-supporting in grain in an emergency, but we are not being encouraged to do this.  We are exporting malting barley, for instance of which we cannot produce enough, and yet it is levied.  That is not fair, it is not right, and something should be done about it.  We were talking about setaside for good tillage land, but that is not on either.  Where it might be on would be in the very wet poorer land if we could convince the EC that instead of trying to make grassland out of bogland they would consider giving us the setaside moneys to develop that land into forestry. That would be the natural thing to do with that land, and I have said that before in this House.  If we could get all that wet land into forestry then the owners would have a reasonable income which could probably be supplemented by the State and in due course they or their families would benefit from the results of that forest.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2173" /> I turn now to my own particular area, horticulture.  I am glad that the Minister of State with responsibility for horticulture is present.  He has a difficult task.  I do not underestimate it.  I had it myself and I know what it is all about.  I would like to see him concentrating a little more on the potato scene.  I am disappointed with some of the reactions from An Bord Glas.  I would ask the Minister to restructure that board and have it properly set up because the statements emanating from them do not ring right.  Today, for instance, one of their members was talking about potatoes and saying: &ldquo;We will go to the EC and we will get permission for a producer group&rdquo;. We have a producer group.  We have a national potato co-operative going through terribly tough times.  For goodness sake get it back on its feet.  As the Minister said previously in this House, you cannot compel farmers to limit their potato acreage.  There is no quota for potatoes; they can grow all the potatoes they wish and they are quite free to do so.  But the important thing to remember is that when all of them decide to grow too much potatoes in the one year there is chaos and then only half enough grow them the following year.  The only people who are capable of doing that are the farmers themselves.  That is why that type of operation must be encouraged by the Minister.  I compliment him on offering them &mdash; and this was something we did in our time too &mdash; a part of the cost of a market co-ordinator.  There are plenty of IFA branches throughout the country from which to structure this.  It is a pity that somebody like Colm Warren, who is so taken up with the commercial horticultural side, which is so successful, could not be found for the potato side where farmers could be advised about quantities and varieties.  There is no point in growing varieties if they are not the varieties that people want.  That is something that should be addressed because this past year has seen chaos in the industry from the point of oversupply and the supply of the wrong varieties.  If the processor gets into business in 1989, in the Cork region, I think he will take care of <Col N="2174" /> the long term problem of potatoes and will make potato growing very attractive indeed.</P>
    <P>I am glad that some attention is being paid to amenity horticulture.  This is an area that ties in with the forestry.  It seems to be falling between two stools &mdash; forestry and horticulture.  With all the new bungalows and because local authorities are becoming more involved in trying to brighten up our towns and cities and indeed, our dual carriageways there is a great future for amenity horticulture and forestry.  Perhaps the Minister would go back to the Minister for Finance and appeal to him to reconsider the 25 per cent VAT on the import of shrubs and seeds.</P>
    <P>In relation to pollution, the farmer has a major task and an expensive one.  I am concerned that since the Government have decided to get rid of An Foras Forbartha who will now police the whole farming scene?  Will it be the local county manager or the local county engineer?  If there is a dispute as to whether it is the local authorities or the farmers are to blame, who will be the judge?</P>
    <P>A figure of £200 million for imports has been tossed around.  I do not think that is on, but let us concentrate on the things we can do well.  When we get our potato processing plants going that will take care of about £40 million worth of potatoes, but do not try to compete in areas where we cannot compete.  There is room for looking at some new crops &mdash; for example, flax.  There is some scope in the area of health foods.  If the housewife is looking for lean cuisine or weight watcher foods then she should be supplied with them.  That is a challenge for us.  I am concerned about too much attention being paid to organic farming.  Organic farming has a certain role and there is scope for it.  If some people require that product we should give it to them, but there is an underlying danger that anything other than organic may be regarded as less than pure food and it is something about which we should be careful.</P>
    <P>Finally, this House should concern itself realistically with the Third World. We talk about quotas, intervention and <Col N="2175" /> food stacked away.  When an emergency breaks out we are told that we do not have the type of food that these people can eat.  Surely, in between times, we should be producing a certain amount of food for these people.  It is all very well to say it is better to teach them to fish than to give them fish.  But they need fish and food for a very long time.  If the Community of which we are a partner can spend billions on armaments, most of which are unnecessary, surely their collective responsibility should be towards the Third World and towards giving a proportion of what they produce annually by way of grain, which would be ideally suitable, and milk powder to the Third World.  We are basically in support of the Estimate and I wish my colleagues in the opposite benches well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Kirk) Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Kirk)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Kirk)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to deal in particular with horticulture, which is one of my main responsibilities in agriculture.  My objective as Minister for Horticulture is, with the co-operation of everybody involved, to develop the horticulture industry to reduce substantially the imports of fruit and vegetables coming into this country, to increase exports of these products and by so doing to improve the country's balance of payments position and, of course, to find employment for more people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In doing my work I am very conscious that I am depending on the co-operation, goodwill and hard work of everybody connected with the industry.  The people connected with the industry cover a very wide range, beginning with the staff who specialise in horticulture in the Department of Agriculture and Food.  That staff now comes under the Office of Horticulture which has been established in the Department.  From there we go to An Bord Glas, still on an interim basis but doing excellent work and about this I shall be saying more in a moment or two. We have the people involved in research and advisory work, the main elements of which will soon be brought together by the merger Bill under the new authority <Col N="2176" /> Teagasc which is now approaching the final long stages on its way through the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>We have some very good horticultural producers.  In a few product lines we have had worthwhile achievements.  However, there is much ground to be made up if we are to achieve the progress which I hope for and which I am determined to do everything I can to bring about.  Ministers and State agencies have an important part to play but the solutions must be found from the bottom up.  That means that producers, all of them, everywhere in the country in all lines of production, must have a much better and keener appreciation of the road along which success lies.  Going that road means paying attention to quality production and, equally importantly, paying attention to marketing. Good quality products produced for a determined market is the way to success.  This is a matter not only for individual producers but very much a matter for producer groups, of which we still have a great lack in this country for the great bulk of our horticultural production.</P>
    <P>That in brief is a summary of my outlook on how we shall achieve success in horticulture.  I now propose to give in some detail an account to the House of the work which An Bord Glas have been doing.  I should like to mention the position as regards the legislation to set up the board on a statutory basis.  The legislation is at quite an advanced stage and it is intended to bring it before this House as quickly as possible.  If the statutory board continue to work that has been achieved by the interim board it will have been a very worth while innovation in the area of horticulture.  I would like at this point to take the opportunity to pay tribute to Deputy Paddy Hegarty, my predecessor in the Department, who had special responsibility for the development of horticulture during his time there.  He made a significant contribution to the development of the industry and I am grateful for the words of encouragement we have had from him here today.</P>
    <P>As soon as An Bord Glas were set up <Col N="2177" /> last year one of the first decisions was to set about a very detailed examination of the problems of the industry and make recommendations as to how these problems might be resolved.  In all the board set up seven commodity teams and on each team were eight or nine people each eminent in a particular commodity.  The seven areas examined were: potatoes, field vegetables, mushrooms, processed fruit and vegetables, protected crops, hardly nursery stock, amenity horticulture and fruit and bee-keeping.  The reports of the seven teams were some months ago put before An Bord Glas who have since then been very actively going through the different reports and recommendations in great detail.  At present the board are about to produce an action plan for the industry to cover the next five year period.</P>
    <P>As regards the legal position of the board, draft legislation is very advanced and I hope to be in a position to say something about that in the not too distant future.  It has been necessary, of course, before bringing in the legislation about An Bord Glas to await the completion of the legislation in regard to Teagasc because there will obviously be a connection between the two bodies.</P>
    <P>An Bord Glas, of course, have been involved in other activities in the past 12 months.  I rightly felt that, while planning for the industry as I have described was a major task, it also saw the need to become involved quickly in current activities.  For that reason in September of last year the board, in co-operation with ACOT and tomato growers, organised a very successful tomato campaign covering the months of September and October.  Growers were encouraged to continue heating their tomato crops so as to maintain high quality and packaging of the crop was improved so as to present consumers with an Irish product which could complete on a equal footing with imports.  As Deputies will be aware, tomato production in this country has declined considerably over the last ten years.  From an annual production of 28,000 tonnes of Irish tomatoes in 1979 we fell in recent years to something well <Col N="2178" /> below half that figure.  An Bord Glas, therefore, in deciding last year to pay special attention to tomatoes, were involving themselves in a sector which could benefit from help.  I am glad to say that the effort of last September-October was successful and growers who participated in the promotion got a price premium of up to 15 per cent for their tomatoes.  Over 40,000 trays, each weighing 12 lbs., of high quality tomatoes were marketed and wholesalers and retailers were enthusiastic about the quality and presentation.  Indeed, during the two months September and October of 1987 imported tomatoes virtually disappeared from the wholesale market.  An Bord Glas are planning to repeat this exercise in June this year and I hope to have the opportunity to launch the campaign shortly.</P>
    <P>I shall have more to say shortly about potatoes, but An Bord Glas have also involved themselves in a promotion for Irish potato chips.  The restaurant here in Leinster House and the restaurant in the Department of Agriculture and Food played a prominent part in that promotion campaign.  The board also conduced what was regarded as a very successful campaign for ware potatoes in Dublin and surrounding areas in March of this year.</P>
    <P>Another product which An Bord Glas concern themselves with is onions, a product for which we are far too dependent on imports.  Indeed, the import level is in the region of 77 per cent or 78 per cent of all onions consumed and it illustrates graphically the problem that exists in this area.  An Bord Glas in co-operation with ACOT have arranged a demonstration of onion plots in locations in Counties Kerry, Kilkenny, Louth and Meath.  Our intention is that the latest production techniques will be demonstrated on those pilot plots and potential growers for the 1989 season will come along, see how it is done and, we hope, participate.  All the indications are that we will have a number of very worthwhile onion growing projects under way for the 1989 growing season and I hope it will <Col N="2179" /> make a major contribution to the urgent need of import substitution in this area.</P>
    <P>The board were also active in the processed fruit and vegetable sector.  In co-operation with ACOT, meetings were held between processors and producers. The results were good and this year additional acreage has been contracted for in the case of peas for processing, vegetables for processing and strawberries and raspberries.  I am particularly encourged with the development in this area where the processors are prepared to go out and look for additional acreages to be grown.  The prospects look very promising indeed and that should lead to greater output and, in turn, to the creation of much-needed jobs.</P>
    <P>I would like to mention a few cases where there has been very satisfactory progress.  An area which is not always thought of immediately one speaks of horticulture is the trade in nursery stock. This business is showing remarkable progress and in 1987 there was an increase in exports amounting to 85 per cent in volume and 53 per cent in value.</P>
    <P>The most notable success, of course, the country has had in regard to horticulture has been in the mushroom sector.  Mushroom production increased in 1987 by 24 per cent in what is very much a labour intensive area with the consequent creation of much-needed jobs.  Exports are a very important part of this industry and in the past year additional export markets were opened up in Scotland and the north of England. For the first time also in 1987 our mushroom exporters began to sell directly to supermarkets in Britain.  This was a very worthwhile development.  Also in proof of the forward development of this industry was the production of spawn for mushroom growing for the first time in this country in Navan.  Spawn is, of course, a most important basic requirement for the industry.</P>
    <P>In the few minutes I have left I would like to move on to a very important area in horticulture and that is the potato growing sector.  I am glad to report that for 1988 there is a projected increase in <Col N="2180" /> the acreage of seed potatoes being grown of 20 per cent.  That is very significant for an area that has, unfortunately, been in decline for a number of years past.  For the first four months of this year import levels of ware potatoes have been at their lowest level for many years.  I am not claiming any credit for that but it is a good omen and should encourage producers considerably.  Part of the reason for that was the fact that there was a considerable volume of potatoes available during 1987 Community-wide.</P>
    <P>Members will be aware that in recent days we have identified a number of areas where initiatives will be taken.  We have made application to the European Commission for the doubling of the grant aid for potato storage.  In the months of April, May and June, at the end of the main crop, the quality of potatoes tends to deteriorate because of poor or inadequate storage facilities.  We reckon there is a need for additional storage space to accommodate 80,000 tonnes and that the capital investment for that will be about £8 million.  Being realistic I do not think that type of money can be found in the potato industry and, consequently, we have sought additional aid.  I do not know what the result of the application will be but I am sure Members will agree that we should seek the aid.</P>
    <P>We have made application to the European Commission for an extension of the producer group regulation applicable to potatoes.  There is a need to get the general organisation of marketing right and to do that we need such assistance.  We have made an offer to the IFA to part-finance the appointment of a market co-ordinator for the potato sector.  Such an appointment is needed and I hope that they will agree so that we can pull the industry together.  We are also planning to produce a video on the industry.  From the point of view of the primary producer and those involved in presentation and marketing, it is important that such a video is made available for advisory and educational work.  I have no doubt it will prove invaluable to those who are dealing with the primary producers.  The video will deal with the need to get the product <Col N="2181" /> right, to eliminate as far as possible such matters as the mechanical damage factor, the need for proper storage and the need to present the product properly.</P>
    <P>Imported apples are also a problem. We are satisfied that the new varieties such as Idared, Johnagold and Katje, which are being grown successfully in the apple growing areas of Kilkenny, south Tipperary and Waterford, offer great potential to replace the French Golden Delicious on our markets.  We will be encouraging the planting of additional acreages of apples.  It is unfortunate that under the FIP regulation we are precluded from giving grant aid except where there is grubbing out or replacement. I am glad to say that the prospects are reasonable and I hope that the trend of planting more apple trees will continue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to compliment the Ministers of State for their constructive contributions this morning. The Minister took on board divine intervention as being part and parcel of his policy.  However, notwithstanding that, we will be constructive in our criticism. The food and agri industry represents the best prospect for economic and employment expansion for this country over the next 20 or 30 years.  Whether we make a success of it will depend on how we go about our business.  With the advent of the internal market in 1992 we should be preparing to cater for the needs of a consumer population of the order of 320 million.  That represents the biggest opportunity we have ever had.  It also represents a possible threat from competition and a great risk.  It is important that the Minister, and his successors, and the industry, should realise what we are facing.  They will have to make the right decisions to ensure that that industry survives in a very competitive market place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It should be noted that in the year to the end of March last we imported almost £1 billion worth of food products of one type or another.  That is an exceptionally high amount of food imports.  I should galvanise all of us, the Government, the Opposition, the dairy industry, the beef <Col N="2182" /> industry and those involved in horticulture, into believing and accepting the magnitude of the market and the need to support, buy and promote home produce.  After 1992 it will not be as easy to be as parochial as we have been in the past.  We will have to accept the stiff competition from the rest of Europe on our own doorsteps.  Companies have not recognised that yet.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hegarty referred to consumer demands and said that they were the most important matters we will have to face. Their demands and requirements, even though they may change from day to day, must be catered for.  If we do that we will improve and expand and as a result our economy will grow.  If we do that we will be under constant threat and challenge from elsewhere.  Those who challenge most often in the marketplace of the future will be most likely to succeed.  It is difficult for a country the size of Ireland to prosper if our food imports amount to £1 billion annually.  We should try to tackle that problem and supply the home market.  I accept that we cannot produce some of the products but we can produce many of those we import.  Having dealt with the home market we should move on to tackle foreign markets.</P>
    <P>Some of our co-ops are competing very successfully on foreign markets while others are slow to get off the ground. Our meat processors are competing on foreign markets very successfully.  They recognise what they have to do to compete on those markets.  The phasing out of intervention is probably the most worthwhile thing to happen to the industry in the last five to six years because greater emphasis has to be placed on marketing and selling as opposed to the easy option of placing products in intervention. The whole concept of the Common Agricultural Policy, intervention supports and so on, was introduced to try to ensure a constant supply and a reasonable recompense for producers. The system got bogged down along the way and people took the easy option but we should not forget that at a time when stocks in Europe are decreasing at a fast rate we need to retain some <Col N="2183" /> stock in intervention at all times for emergencies.  We have had to deal with emergencies in the past and I have no doubt they will arise in the future.  It is important that the stock in intervention is not kept for many years and at a great cost to the Community.  It would be better to have a reasonably fast turnover while at the same time ensuring that sufficient stock is kept for emergencies.</P>
    <P>It is important that the stocks in intervention at any given time are pollution-free, radiation-free and hormone-free. There is no benefit to be gained from storing supplies of contaminated food products.  The contamination might not be very serious but it might have a serious effect on our markets if released onto European or world markets.  If we are interested in protecting those markets we should try to ensure to the very best of our ability that whatever goes into intervention and whatever is released onto the marketplace is of the highest possible quality so that nobody will come back to us now, in two years' time or in four years' time and say the levels of radiation or the toxins in our products were of an unacceptably high level.  We should not allow that to happen.  There is absolutely no excuse for it.  We have our own means of testing our food products and there should be no reason for anybody from outside of this country to be able to come forward and say that our standards are not as high as theirs or that they are unacceptable to them.</P>
    <P>We must also accept that those in the marketplace have a vested interest in coming forward and casting aspersions on the quality of our products.  When we are talking about selling our food products either at home or abroad there is more than one aspect to be taken into account.  Apart from the competition and the quality, we also have to recognise that the people in the market place who are competing with us may indulge in negative advertising which will be to our detriment.</P>
    <P>I welcome the recent IDA plans to further expand certain aspects of the food industry.  Announcements have been <Col N="2184" /> made by the Department of Agriculture and Food in recent times as to the potential that is there and the jobs that are to be provided in the future, much more so than the jobs that are being provided.  I suggest that the time has now come to let us have a look at the jobs that have come on stream in the meat processing area. Let us have a look at those jobs now as opposed to telling us what will be there in 1992 or thereafter.  We need to do something about that now.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his speech referred to the new system of funding from Europe, the changes in relation to FEOGA guidance grants and the need to develop alternatives to the traditional agricultural pursuits.  That is extremely important and is something that cannot be adequately dealt with in a short space of 15 minutes. Suffice it to say that other European countries have copped on very quickly to the alternatives that are available.  While one market might be over-supplied, in the areas of tourism, recreation and amenities, there is an ongoing demand in the consumer-oriented society in which we live.  There is a need to meet that demand and we are very well placed to do so.  We have the natural amenities and it is up to ourselves to explore, exploit and sell them and meet the requirements of the people in the European bloc to which I referred earlier.</P>
    <P>The Minister also referred to the reintroduction of farm installation grants and the retrospective payment to 1 April 1987.  That is something which&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to mention one <Col N="2185" /> other point which is very important. There is a need to cop on to the idea of value-added products.  A typical example is the humble spud.  It can be boiled, fried, mashed, crisped, chipped, powdered or baked.  Anybody who attended Punchestown Racecourse not so long ago during the Punchestown Festival&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately I was unable to attend because of business in this House but I heard what went on there.  Anybody who attended that festival would have known that the humble potato, on which we put very little value when boiled, when baked and sold to the consumer had a value of £1 or more.  If we do a rough calculation we will find that an eight stone bag of potatoes which costs about £8 to £10 could cost as much as £300.  That is what value-added means. It is one of the things that all our food processors have to become aware of as a matter of urgency.  While it might not be so easy to sell a sack of potatoes to the consumer on the street, by dividing it up, giving it a different name and a new brand and targeting a certain area in the market, the possible increase in the value of that product is amazing.  That is only one product and every other product is the same.  I would ask that in the future our food processors would take note of that single example.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>We are debating this Estimate on agriculture at a time when there is a return of confidence in agriculture. That return has come about primarily as a result of the measures the Government have taken, with the reduction in bank interest charges which caused such a problem to the development of agriculture over the years and with the fall in inflation.  There are areas which are still of concern to us such as the cattle herd which has dropped to a dangerously low level.  While the fall in numbers has been arrested it will take a considerable time to get it back to the level which we would require.  A survey was carried out on our entry into the <Col N="2186" /> EC which showed that at that time the number of our cattle herd &mdash; about seven million &mdash;&mdash; was higher than it is now. The projection was that it would increase by the nineties to about nine million and would level out thereafter at about ten million.  We have not much more than half that number at present.  We are depending on store cattle, beef cattle and slaughtering.  Beef will continue to be one of the main value-added products, thus leading to job creation.</P>
      <P>The previous speaker remarked, and I agree wholeheartedly with him, that agriculture seems to be one area where there is an opportunity for development and for increasing exports. However, the major areas of production remain static.  There is now the added problem of a restriction on milk production, at a time when we were expecting to increase production.  We are curtailed in our numbers of cattle and we have not enough calves.  Cattle are being purchased by producers who are not in the dairying or production sector and they are charged so much that they will have a very small margin of profit.  We are left with milk, beef, pigs and poultry. Added to that we have what has been one of the biggest success stories in agriculture over the years &mdash; and I am very pleased to be able to say I was very closely identified with it from the beginning &mdash; that is, mushroom production.  This industry is providing a great many jobs and is going from strength to strength. However I hope it will be monitored at departmental level so that if more people come into the industry, they will not upset the present structure which was arrived at after much painstaking work by the mushroom producers in the initial stages.</P>
      <P>There has been a great deal of talk about alternative farm enterprises.  We hear a great deal about deer, cheese, angora goats and so on, but we should not concentrate on these enterprises because there is only room for very limited expansion there.  We will have to look at areas like seed potato production, flax growing and so on, areas where there is plenty of room for expansion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a constituency like mine, the small <Col N="2187" /> family farm is under continuous threat. Many of these people are involved in poultry and mushroom production.  They have been very successful because the traditional areas of production are being whittled away.  The Minister mentioned the structural and regional fund. Last February's summit was the most successful since our entry to the EC because we got a doubling in the structural and regional funds.  When we get this money to implement the integrated programmes, I hope the local input from the voluntary, youth, farming and other kind of development organisations will play a big part in monitoring that fund.</P>
    <P>A few weeks ago I visited a rabbit processing plant, Blaney Meats.  This was one of the first IDA grant-aided plants. It has the most up-to-date refrigeration and killing line system I have ever seen and I have visited most poultry and pig plants in this country; 960 rabbits are processed every hour but the problem is a lack of veterinary know-how.  The producers have been grant-aided from the international fund to the extent of 30 per cent.  This is very satisfactory.  But what is needed is that a veterinary inspector and some of the producers go abroad and examine all aspects of this industry in other countries.  Some of these people will be meeting departmental officials shortly and I hope they will be given a sympathetic hearing.  There are approximately 100 producers from Louth to Donegal who are involved in this alternative enterprise.</P>
    <P>Mention was made of the seed potato industry.  This is an area with terrific potential and room for expansion and I have spoken about this many times in this House.  The Irish Marketing Potato Board is already in existence.  I was very glad to hear the Minister of State, Deputy Kirk, saying there had been an increase of 20 per cent in the acreage under seed potatoes, but this increase was from a very low base.  I know from reports I have read recently that the market is there.  I am sure that, with the Minister of State's drive, this industry will develop along the proper lines.  Before I came into Dáil <Col N="2188" /> Éireann I was involved in the potato industry.  I visited Perth, Scotland, in 1969.  At that time there was massive expenditure by the British Potato Marketing Board providing storage.  What we need for our potato industry is storage and we must get EC funding to provide it.</P>
    <P>Another area causing concern in my constituency is pig production.  This has been a major source of income in my area for the last 50 or 60 years.  We had two killing and processing plants in Monaghan town.  One went out of business because of rationalisation in the western region &mdash; a Castlebar co-operative &mdash; and the second, through trading difficulties, closed temporarily.  Between the two firms, 150 people have been out of work since last summer.  Last week the owner of the second factory decided to pay redundancy and offered the plant for sale.  The problem is that the IDA appear to have adopted the Danish system. They seem to think there should be no problem transporting pigs 40 or 50 miles to a meat plant.  They seem to be hell bent on setting up a new green field structure and do not seem to be concerned about the butchers who are out of work or the producers who have been in this line of business for many years.  That is not acceptable to the people of the area, and the IDA and any others who have that idea in mind should think again.</P>
    <P>Another alternative is flax.  Tribute has been paid to Deputy Hegarty who was Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, and I would like to pay a tribute to the present Minister and his Ministers of State, because what we have found over the last 12 months is that if we have a suggestion to make, it is given very carefully consideration.  I am sure the same applied when Deputy Hegarty was in the Department.  He set up the flax trials in Cork but unfortunately this work was carried out by a private company and little information was available, and the little information that was available was not helpful.</P>
    <P>Donegal, Cavan and Monaghan were traditional flax growing areas during the war.  Herdman's of Sion Mills, Derry, <Col N="2189" /> who announced an £18 million extension to their factory, will require flax.  This will provide a great opportunity for flax growers.  I ask the Department to set up trials in Cavan, Monaghan and Donegal similar to those set up by the private company in Cork.  The initiative already is being taken in Donegal by the development officer.  There have been a number of meetings there and with the Department. There is a substantial subsidy involved of £100 per acre and I hope that other areas will grasp this opportunity.</P>
    <P>About six or eight months ago I drew the attention of the Minister to the restrictions on milk production in my constituency. The dairy farmers there are approachable and they would discuss matters with the Minister.  As a result of a reduction in their milk quotas and improvements in milk yields, the farmers were left in the position that seven or eight cows out of a 25 cow herd would have had to be disposed of.  I suggested at that stage that they be allowed a cattle headage grant for suckling cattle, even in the case of dairy herd owners.  The Minister's announcement of a few weeks ago is very satisfactory to men such as those.  Up to now in the more severely handicapped areas payment were restricted to ten dairy cows, at £32 for the first eight and £28 for the next two cows.  In the less severely handicapped areas there were no headage payments to farmers on any of their animals.</P>
    <P>Under the present scheme, in the more severely handicapped areas the payment is still restricted to ten dairy cows, but suckler cows and dairy herds are allowed £70 on the first eight cows and £66 on the next 22.  In the less severely handicapped areas the payment is £70 on the first eight cows and £66 on the next 20 cows.  That is the most positive approach to increasing cattle numbers and recognising the problems of these small farmers and dairy farmers who had been unable to avail of cattle headage grants and had to dispose of very good cows, reducing their farm income severely.  This positive step is in line with the thinking of the present Government in many other areas where <Col N="2190" /> recognition has been given to the problems that had been damaning the farmers for so many years.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned that there would be a reduced payment for putting stock into intervention and this is one of the more satisfactory aspects.  Intervention, while necessary, was one of the real drawbacks to our development. There were the lazy manufacturers who would not go out to sell their produce, dumping it into intervention at a massive cost to the State and to the EC.  That was the cause of EC surpluses.  Practically all the beef we are producing can be taken up by the British supermarkets who are ready for it at a premium price, which is very satisfactory.  I hope that if intervention must be used in the future recognition will be given to those farmers and manufacturers who had the initiative to go out and sell their produce.  They did not get that recognition.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak in this debate.  A number of regrettable things have happened during the last 12 months.  It was hoped that the Estimate presented here would have provided much more money for very important areas whose budgets had been reduced drastically by the present Government.  When I reflect on the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy O'Kennedy, I am reminded of somebody who, having bought a farm, comes down the country from the Law Library every two months.  He looks around, sees a serious problem, gets somebody else to look after it and goes back to Dublin.  Sir Michael sends down his two Ministers of State to find out the problems and, if the problems are too severe, he will not go down near the patch of land he bought.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In connection with the overall position over the last 12 months the Minister produced a proposal to amalgamate ACOT and AFT, with a budget which was £15 million less than that of the previous year. He presided over one of the largest reductions in allocations to the research and development programme in agriculture and left several thousands of small <Col N="2191" /> farmers with no possibility of any advisory services.  The majority of those small farmers would be unable to pay for such services.  As we all in this House know, the average farm income is well below £5,000.</P>
    <P>The Minister has announced the reintroduction of the installation grant.  I would like to know how long ago it was that the application was made for the reintroduction of this aid, which should not have been abolished in the first place. He tells us now that payment will be retrospective to 1 April of this year, which is very welcome.  Regarding those whose applications have already been approved, there are people in my constituency, a few, who are eligible for this grant and who have been waiting eight months for their money.  The Government should not be hindering people who want to develop and have made many improvements to their farms entitling them to all lines of grants &mdash; installation aid, headage payments, or whatever.  The Government are holding back this money to buttress the balance of payments at the end of the quarter and it is the same with all the Department that are responsible for paying out grant aid.  Something positive should be done about this.  This money should be paid out when it becomes due.</P>
    <P>With regard to the disadvantaged areas, as everybody in the House is aware and none more than the Minister of the Department, an application had been made and Minister O'Kennedy told this House that it had been made on a certain date close to the end of the administration of the previous Government.  Nobody disagrees with that.  We all accept the date on which it was made.  During the price negotiations last year there was goodwill on the part of EC Commissioner Andriessen to negotiate, if there was a willingness on the part of our Government, to include the less severely handicapped areas in the category of disadvantaged areas because of the serious amount of bad weather that Ireland had experienced in the previous two years.  This Government had then no <Col N="2192" /> commitment in that regard.  Is there a commitment to having the inclusion of the less severely handicapped areas put on the agenda during the price negotiations this year?</P>
    <P>We all heard about, and some of us saw, the launching at Castlebar of the allocation of extra moneys for the Regional and Development Funds, which we all welcomed.  Nine Ministers were present.  Within six weeks of that event an application still had not been made to Brussels for the money.  I believe that since then that application has been made.  Deputy Leonard had been before then defending the indefensible at a meeting one evening in Monaghan.  His two colleagues, the two Ministers in Cabinet, did not appear.  They appear only when there is good news and lottery money to give out.  That is the fact.  Will the application be on the agenda during the farm price negotiations?  There are many farmers who are depending on the Minister to do that job for them.</P>
    <P>In connection with An Bord Glas, the Minister of State mentioned that he intends bringing in legislation to formulate new policies in this area.  There seems to be conflict in that one of the nominees to the board is a very big fruit and potato importer into this country when there is a scarcity of those commodities. He appears to be in conflict with the potato growers here.  Can this matter be sorted out positively before the board is finally organised and before the legislation comes before this House? There should not be business people on a board who are in conflict with the home producers.  That would not solve anything or improve relations between them.  If this is to be run in a businesslike way, conflict should not be created in these areas.</P>
    <P>There are serious problems in regard to pollution and the majority of grants to combat the problem were provided by the Government from 1973 until recently.  I am not saying that the Minister blames farmers for pollution but many people have said that that is the case. Unfortunately, the grants which were <Col N="2193" /> approved by the Department are inadequate at present.  The Minister for the Environment paid lip service over the last couple of months to this issue.  He said that local authorities will ensure that the law is implemented.  Nobody disagrees with that but there is no point in paying lip service to the problem without making grants available.  Farmers are on to me every day of the week &mdash; I am sure the same is true in relation to many other Deputies &mdash; asking when the percentage grants will be available because the cost of treating and avoiding pollution is enormous. The farming community are willing to help to solve the problem and they do not want to be polluting their areas. Will the Minister do something positive in this regard?</P>
    <P>The farm classification officers, having had a year's holiday, paid for by the State, have now returned to the Department. The Minister blamed the Opposition for the problem but we did not suspend the work of the farm classification officers. The Minister and the Government did so in a pre-election promise in 1987.  Even though the farm tax was not continued, classification of the land should have gone on to find out who owns it.  Many people own land over and above the 250 acre deadline set in regard to farm classification.</P>
    <P>I noticed from the reply of the Minister for the Environment to a question this week that legislation will not be introduced to abolish this measure.  That seems to indicate that the Government are thinking of introducing a property tax, and the farm tax would be part of it.  Another U-turn will not make much difference.  The Minister is smiling&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister also referred to the <Col N="2194" /> increase in CBF levies.  Because there are one or two members&mdash;&mdash;</P>

If not, we want to know the extent of Government funding to the operation and if they are doing away with it we would like to be told.  There is no point in saying one thing in the House and then perhaps having a conference in Castlebar attended by seven, eight or nine Ministers to announce something else.</P>

      <P>I wish to thank Deputy Farrelly for giving me some of his time to contribute to this debate which is so important for the whole country, not just for those in agriculture.  Agricultural land is part of the assets of the whole country and it affects all workers because it is a vital part of industrial development. Governments have been very lethargic in this regard since we got our independence. It should have been an area of dynamic development but instead it has been one of decay.  Departure from the land, lack of development and productivity have deprived hundreds of thousands of people of jobs over the years because this is the area where the greatest number of jobs can be created.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are now importing hundreds of millions of pounds of foodstuffs each year and even farmers are going into the local market town to buy vegetables which come down from the Dublin market in big articulated trucks.  Over the years, I have continually harped on the failure of the Government to develop horticulture. The Irish Sugar Company developed this <Col N="2195" /> area and set up Erin Foods but they were sold to Heinz-Erin during the Government of Mr. Jack Lynch.  In Holland, 4 per cent of the land is under glass.  I am not suggesting anything like that but 4 per cent of our agricultural land could be devoted to horticulture and if that were done we could create up to 20,000 jobs on the land in production and twice that number in the processing sector.  This is an area we have to get into as we need to have alternative products and alternative markets.</P>
    <P>In Holland 75 per cent of horticultural and agricultural produce is processed in that country, some of it on the farm.  The food processing sector in Holland, half the size of Ireland, employs 136,000 people.  Over 100,000 more people are employed in the food processing sector in Holland than in Ireland.  When we entered the EC it was expected that many industries in the industrial sector would close down but we had great hopes that there would be tremendous development in agriculture and that the downstream industries which would be created as a result would more than compensate for the firms which would be forced to close down in the industrial sector.  With our entry to the EC a new language was created which those outside agriculture could not understand &mdash; we had MCAs, the green £ and intervention payments. The end result was that there was no increase in productivity, fewer people employed on the land and indeed fewer farmers.  Farmers were forced off the land and there was no increase in the number of downstream industries.  Bigger farms were created and there was a significant increase in dairying but overall there have been no new significant developments.</P>
    <P>The intervention system has led to a lack of marketing and a concentration on two products &mdash; beef and dairy products. We have seen a cessation of production in a whole range of products for the home market.  We are now facing a crisis in production, cropping and marketing. Despite hundreds of millions of pounds being poured into agriculture by the Government and the EC, the level of <Col N="2196" /> productivity is abysmal and we are seeing a declining number of jobs and lower returns in taxes and rates to the Exchequer.  In 1979 farmers paid £52 million into the Exchequer in taxes and rates.  Last year they paid only £35 million into the Exchequer.  The figure should be well over £100 million now almost a decade later but instead it has dropped.</P>
    <P>Farmers are paying less in taxes than CIE workers.  From figures which were given to me by the Minister it can be seen that the workers in CIE pay more in taxes and PRSI than all of the farmers put together and this despite having received increased incomes from the EC.  It is time that workers made their voices heard on the way agriculture is being developed. They must not rely on those in the EC or the IFA to do what is right for agriculture. Not every farmer, given the various hand-outs, will necessarily do what is right for agriculture if left on his own.</P>
    <P>What is needed is a development plan for agriculture.  We have called for the establishment of an agricultural development authority as we believe that a single Government agency is vital if there is to be development in the agricultural sector, particularly at this time when enormous changes have taken place in a sector which is so vital to the economy. This authority would have the responsibility for stimulating investment, farm modernisation, the diversification of production into different crops, the development of food processing, production and marketing which is being ignored at present and which is now more important than ever with the change in the intervention system.  It would also take over the role of the State in respect of land use policy, research and development and training and the Agricultural Credit Corporation in terms of finance and investment.  In addition, the disease eradication schemes and the various grants for structural development of the land would be administered in accordance with the priorities of the authority.</P>
    <P>In future all State aid should be related to farm development plans, national production priorities, value-added production and employment potential.  In <Col N="2197" /> reply to a question it was pointed out that over £340 million is paid out annually in aid to the agricultural sector and direct grants and subsidies paid to farmers amounted to £82 million in 1982, £97 million in 1983, £151 million in 1984, £181 million in 1985 and £173 million in 1986. This is at a time when the return to the State was £35 million.  Where did this money come from?  It came out of the pockets of those paying taxes.  That is why I say that aid to agriculture should be related to farm development plans. Grants should not be paid without any reference to what the farmer is doing.</P>
    <P>The new authority would be the executive authority of the State in this sector and have on its board representatives of the farm organisations, trade unions, the various development agencies and the State.  It would be similar in structure to the IDA but would have a specific development role in relation to agriculture, and food and land use in general. The authority would examine the possibility of growing different crops and the industrial use of agricultural products. Let us take the woollen industry, for instance.  Because of the payment of grants and subsidies sheep numbers have increased and, consequently, there is an increase in the amount of wool available. However, sheep do not seem to be thought of in terms of wool; it is regarded as a by-product which you send over in any state at a cheap price to Britain. There are no processing facilities in this country and we end up having to import that wool for our own woollen industry. There is now an increased interest in Irish linen.  Such an authority could also be looking at that, would be developing the production of flax, facilities for its growing, and the many other areas of agricultural production and development.</P>

Because of the misstatements he put on the record I shall have to reply formally to a number of the points he made.</P>

I have to say that if Deputy O'Keeffe's definition of &ldquo;disastrous&rdquo; is an increase of at least 20 per cent &mdash; and in my view it will be even more &mdash; in the income level over what it was when Fine Gael were in Government, then that is a very strange definition of disaster.  The farmers, with whom Deputy O,Keeffe should consult, would not share his opinion; they do not experience disaster now as they did four years ago.  I am not interested in the past, but that is a wrong presentation at a time when there is a new confidence, buoyancy and determination among farmers.  It is not helpful, even from the point of view of the Opposition, for Deputy O'Keeffe to describe that as disastrous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Keeffe has also blamed me for the &ldquo;disastrous decline&rdquo; in the national herd.  Here again I have to say that that is turning logic on its head.  I stated in the course of my introductory remarks that the annual decline, recorded in the December 1987 lifestock enumeration, was 47,000 head compared with a decline of 153,000 in the previous year.  Already in the course of the year in which I assumed responsibility there was a drop of three-quarters in the <Col N="2199" /> decline in lifestock numbers.  What I do need to put on the record is that, of course, the decline in the national herd is something about which I am very concerned. However, that decline is a consequence of the failures of three years ago. One does not press a button and suddenly produce a three-year-old bullock for slaughter.  It is because of the failure of the Government of which Deputy J. O'Keeffe was a member to take any action three years ago that we saw a constant decline in our national herd. The good news now is that there is a definite arrest in that decline.</P>
    <P>I will accept blame for that which is within my responsibility, but to be blamed by the Fine Gael spokesman for the failures of a Fine Gael Minister three years ago is carrying the matter too far. As I have pointed out, the reality is that that trend is being reversed.  We are seeing a drop in slaughterings of 20 per cent, an increase in inseminations of between 13 per cent and 14 per cent even within the first few months of this year, and it is my opinion that another month will show an increase of the order of at least 15 per cent.  That adequately demonstrates that what is happening now within the area of my responsibility is very positive.  It adequately illustrates the confidence of farmers, a confidence they clearly did not have three years ago when the previous Government allowed the national herd to go into decline.  If I am to be blamed, please do not blame me for not having the power of miracles to suddenly produce three-year-old bullocks now to make up for the failures of the previous Government.  I should not be blamed for taking action the previous Government failed to take.</P>
    <P>There is now in place a western package I spent some considerable time negotiating. There are increased levels of payment, particularly special support for anti-pollution drives in the west.  I am sure the last man who would want to hear Deputy O'Keeffe's comment this morning would be Commissioner Sutherland &mdash; that that package was concluded by him.  Commissioner Sutherland does <Col N="2200" /> not need a distortion of fact like that.  He would be embarrassed by it, because it is simply not the case.  I negotiated the package with the Commission &mdash; there is no question about that; it is the reality &mdash; and, having done so, I put it through the Council.  I do not think it fair to Commissioner Sutherland that the Fine Gael spokesman should contend that Commissioner Sutherland put it through the Council, because that is not the case. Commissioner Sutherland has sufficient reputation without having that kind of distortion placed on the record.  That package, because it is badly needed, will be of considerable benefit.  Do not blame me for the fact that over the past four years nobody did anything about pollution in the west.  I agree, but the fact that I am now doing something about it should not constitute a criticism of me.</P>
    <P>In relation to the whole structural development of agriculture, I say: yes, it is time for an integrated rural development programme.  There was no sign of such over the last four or five years; there is now.  I want to state specifically that we are the first country in the EC ahead of the decision of the Council of Ministers, or even of the Commission itself, to introduce a pilot scheme, in advance of a decision which probably will not be taken until next year.  Am I to be blamed for moving faster than the others, because that is what I am doing?  And we have got special sanction for this pilot programme for integrated rural development.  If Deputy J. O'Keeffe had made even the most casual inquiries in Brussels he would have learned that if Ireland is exceptional at all, either in relational to the western package or to the integrated rural development programme, it is that we are the only country moving ahead of decision.  I should in fairness say that my officials have been out in Brussels constantly, and their Brussels counterparts over here, and that both have been deligent in relation to this.  God knows, there was some unwarranted criticism voiced this morning in relation to the Department generally.  As Vice-President Andriessen would say, it is our country's experiences that will be used by the Commission when <Col N="2201" /> they draw up their comprehensive programme.</P>
    <P>Those are the facts that must be put on the record whether they be in relation to the western package or to the extension of the disadvantaged areas.  The fact is that the Commission refused within four or five weeks the applications submitted in the course of the last general election campaign by the previous Government. I was in Government only a few weeks when the word came back from the Commission: this application is not acceptable, full stop.  Am I to be blamed for that?  The Commission gave good reasons for their not accepting that application. It was an ill-conceived and hastily put together package.  That being said, I am much more concerned with the future than the past; but I do not want to be blamed for the failures of the past.  I will accept criticism where it is justified.</P>
    <P>The reason I want to put these facts on the record is that we are now in a position of real vigour and buoyancy in the agricultural sector.  It is significant that nobody commented on what I said in relation to agricultural incomes which I believe, even as we talk, are being enhanced <i>vis-á-vis</i> dairy and milk prices and that milk prices will rise again another 2p or 3p during these very days. Therefore, is it any wonder we have a 20 per cent increase in farm incomes?  I want to see them remain that way.  Nobody wanted to comment on the fact that because this Government have put so much emphasis on the agri-food industry in the last few years our exports in the food sector have increased by 60 per cent. We have laid such emphasis on it that we can demonstrate in the way we attack world markets that we are now the largest exporter of beef in the whole of the EC though being one of the smaller member states.  We are the biggest exporters of almost all dairy products in the EC; obviously, we are not the largest in cheese, but are moving in that direction.  We are the biggest exporters of skim milk powder.  We are moving rapidly to adopt a dominant position in world markets.</P>
    <P>In the face of all those signs, in the face of such buoyancy in agriculture and the <Col N="2202" /> agri-food sector &mdash; where we will produce another 1,200 jobs over the next few years, even in import substitution, as my collegues, the Ministers of State mentioned this morning &mdash; it does not do anybody a service to describe that scenario as a disaster.  I had hoped for a serious analysis this morning.  I did not expect plaudits or cheers but if we had a serious analysis we could learn something from it.  Having regard to the experience of Irish agriculture during the past number of years, it is very clear that not alone is it back on its feet again but I believe it will never again be brought to its knees like it was during the past five years because it is going to be a strong and vigorous industry and will actually be the strongest agricultural and agri-food sector in all of Europe.  That is our plan and that will be the result.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £200,522,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1988, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, including certain services administered by that Office, and for payment of certain loans, subsidies, grants and grants-in-aid. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Estimate before us, provides, as <Col N="2203" /> indicated, for net expenditure of just over £200 million in 1988.  This compares with an outturn of £217 million in 1987, an overall decrease of £17 million.  The reduction must be seen in the context of our overall budgetary situation.  The situation was such that, when we came into office, cuts, and severe cuts, in virtually every area were unavoidable.  I am satisfied, however, that taking all factors into account the reductions made in my area of responsibility were achieved in such a way as to ensure that the areas of highest priority from a developmental point of view were least affected.</P>
    <P>The progress made over the past 15 months in controlling public expenditure has been a major factor in the transformation of the environment for private sector investment &mdash; including that for the manufacturing sector.  The evidence of the improved climate for investment over the past 15 months is clear-cut: our rate of inflation is now below the average of our EC partners and is at its lowest level for a quarter of a century; interest rates have fallen by up to 6½ percentage points; each fall of 1 per cent is worth about £16 million in reduced annual interest payments to the manufacturing sector alone; electricity prices have been reduced for industrial users and are now lower for Irish industrialists than for many of their EC competitors; telecommunications charges are coming down later this year; the public finances have been brought under control for the first time in years and the budget projections have been on target in stark contrast to the situation that had prevailed in recent years; considerable progress in the rationalisation of the State industrial promotion agencies has been made and these make the promotional efforts of the State more efficient and cost-effective; and I have initiated a new programme to cut the bureaucracy with which business firms have to contend in dealing with Government Departments and agencies.</P>
    <P>These developments, together with a reasonably favourable international economic situation, have brought about a real change in our economic prospects: <Col N="2204" /> investment in IDA grant-aided enterprises increased by some 14 per cent in 1987 after a 4 year period of continual decline; manufacturing output increased by over 10 per cent last year, one of the largest annual increases over the past 20 years; exports have soared to record levels and the balance of payments on current account showed a surplus in 1987 for the first time in 20 years; the upward spiral in unemployment has been halted and levels are now at their lowest for 19 months; and fuelled by the record export performance real GNP increased by 5 per cent &mdash; the highest rate of increase in economic activity for almost 20 years.</P>
    <P>The progress achieved in 1987 is only the start.  We have put in place, in consultation with the social partners, a pragmatic framework &mdash; the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>&mdash; within which our economic and social problems can be tackled in a coherent and balanced way. The programme charts the way forward for the public finances, taxation reform, social equity and economic development with a mutually consistent set of practical measures, which are now being implemented.</P>
    <P>We are on course to achieve the employment targets set out in the programme and the most recent review of progress undertaken in consultation with the social partners indicates that almost 20,000 new jobs will be created in manufacturing and international services this year.</P>
    <P>In the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>, we have set ambitious but realistic job targets.  At the same time the public finance resources available will remain limited.  The industrial promotion agencies &mdash; IDA and SFADCo &mdash; have restructured their organisation and approach to reflect the new realities. Greater selectivity in approving projects for State aid will be the key to securing better value for money.  Grant payments will be matched tightly to the achievement of specific job performance targets. There will also be a stronger repayable dimension to State assistance in the form of preference shares, equity stake, royalties or repayable grants.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2205" /> We will continue to aggressively promote the suitability of Ireland as a location for foreign companies &mdash; of which there are 900 at present employing 80,000 people &mdash; and to strengthen the base of these companies in Ireland by encouraging their further expansion.  We will encourage, in particular, investment in the areas of research and development, linkages and marketing.  We will continue to seek investment projects from Europe and the United States and will intensify our efforts to secure additional investment in Ireland by Japanese and other Far Eastern countries.  The IDA have targeted a 20 per cent increase in new job creation by overseas firms over the period of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and on the basis of trends to date are confident of their ability to achieve this.</P>
    <P>For indigenous Irish firms the policy changes which I announced in April will result in a new emphasis on management development, strategic planning within companies and product and market development.  These changes are designed to prepare Irish industry for the completion of the single EC market by 1992.  In line with these changes a new directorate has been established by the IDA to promote more intensively the development of mainstream Irish industry which has the potential for growth.</P>
    <P>In small industry too we have revised the incentive package to distinguish between projects which have genuine prospects of creating significant job numbers and export potential and those which will involve relatively small job numbers. Projects with significant employment creation potential will continue to be eligible for the full range of incentives.  Projects, with more modest projections for growth, will be eligible for employment grants of up to £5,000 per employee and payments will be directly linked to actual job creation.  Management development grants will also be available where justified by the need to upgrade management expertise.  The objective is to ensure that scarce resources are concentrated on those small firms with real growth potential.</P>
    <P>Indeed, with the reduction in the level of direct support for industry, grant <Col N="2206" /> assistance will, in all areas, only be paid where it is necessary for the project to proceed and where projects can be shown to have a direct benefit for the regional development of Ireland.  Also, grants will only be paid as and when projects come on stream.  In implementing this policy, no action will be taken which discriminates against goods and services originating in the other member states of the Community.</P>
    <P>As a further means of assisting the development of industry, I recently announced the designation of Counties Louth, Wexford, Wicklow and Offaly and an eight acre site at Mayfield in Cork for the higher rate of industrial grant for a period of three years.  Industries in designated areas may benefit also, at the discretion of the local authority, from a two-thirds remission of rates for a ten year period.  The formal approval of the EC Commission under the Treaty of Rome will be required before the designation of these new areas becomes fully operational.</P>
    <P>Since the beginning of this year, Shannon Development have been given responsibility for the promotion and development of medium and large industry in the mid-west region in addition to their existing responsibility for small industry.  SFADCo were also given responsibility for all aspects of tourism development in the region.  This major innovation is a step towards opening up for the first time real prospects of integrated regional development at local level.</P>
    <P>One of the most imaginative new development initiatives promoted by the Government in 1987 was the establishment of a financial services centre at the Customs House Docks site.  The IDA are responsible for marketing the centre. So far 24 projects have been approved by the financial services certification committee and have been sent to the Minister for Finance for certification as eligible for the 10 per cent corporation tax rate. These projects have the potential to create approximately 1,000 jobs.</P>
    <P>A major element of the Government's <Col N="2207" /> strategy of improving the cost environment and creating the conditions under which enterprise can flourish is to ease the administrative burden of Governmentimposed regulations on industry and business. The Government have taken the first step in addressing this problem through the recent launch of a major programme throughout the public service aimed at reducing the legislative and administrative burdens that modern-day Government pose for industry and business generally.</P>
    <P>The new programme requires a methodical examination in all Departments of existing requirements which affect industry and business generally.  The objective is to do away with those requirements no longer necessary and to simplify those that remain.  A senior officer has been given responsibility for the programme in each Department.  All new proposals which would give rise to any additional paper work for the business sector will be critically examined to see if their introduction is genuinely required.</P>
    <P>The National Development Corporation is now in its second full year of operation and has maintained its momentum in fulfilling the active, innovative and developmental role envisaged in its legislation and in the Government's <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i> The reduced level of grant-in-aid allocated to the corporation for 1988 reflects an increasing level of own resources and the fact that it is required to be self sufficient for administrative purposes by 1992.  By end December 1987 £11.5 million was provided to NADCORP by way of capital for investment purposes and the provision this year is £6 million.  To date NADCORP has approved investments totalling over £12 million in its own right as well as completing over £1.5 million of investment commitments taken over from NEA.  The corporation's current investments in over 40 separate enterprises is valued at close to £15 million.</P>
    <P>Science and Technology is continuing to receive a very high priority from the Government in 1988.  The manufacture and use of high technology products and <Col N="2208" /> processes now represents the greatest potential source for new industrial employment in all developed countries. We have brought together, since the beginning of this year the combined resources of the NBST and the IIRS in a new Irish Science and Technology Agency called EOLAS.  The new agency will bring a fresh impetus to the urgent task of raising the technological capability of Irish industry.  I will leave the details of the science and technology programme to my colleague, the Minister for Science and Technology to elaborate more fully later in the debate.</P>
    <P>The Government have allocated £20.862 million to Córas Tráchtála to enable them to carry out their activities in 1988.  The figure reflects the need to cutback on Government spending overall but the level of the reduction which is not as large as for many other sectors, also shows the continuing importance attached by the Government to export marketing.  Of this figure £19.612 million is being allocated to CTT promotional and strategic marketing schemes and £1.25 million is being allocated to the market entry and development scheme which provides assistance to small and medium sized companies with the initial marketing costs associated with breaking into and developing new markets.  The assistance is in the form of guaranteed loans to companies which are repayable to the Exchequer on the basis of additional sales generated over a period of five years.  The 1988 allocation, together with the recent more commercially focused redirection of CTT, reflects the Government's commitment to improving the marketing capability of Irish industry and is a clear indication of our recognition of the central role of export growth in our national development.</P>
    <P>The work of CTT in developing exports is complemented by that of the Irish Goods Council which provides marketing support for small manufacturing firms in respect of the home market.  The council undertake this important work through marketing programmes and trade shows, the provision of marketing advice and <Col N="2209" /> the operation of an industrial subcontract service.  Irish manufactured goods account for a low share of the domestic market by the standards of our European partners.  If we were to improve on this by a relatively modest amount it would generate many thousands of additional jobs.  These are objectives well worth striving for and the council have a key role in this.  My colleague, the Minister for Trade and Marketing, will elaborate further on the activities of the council later.</P>
    <P>Ireland's economic fortunes are highly dependent on the European market, as a purchaser of our goods and services.  The growth and further liberalisation of that market for our exports under the Community internal market programme is vital for our future prosperity.</P>
    <P>The price paid by the Community for its failure to capitalise on its enormous economic and human potential has been high.  The performance of its major competitors, the USA and Japan, in regard to output, research and development, application of new technology and employment, is far ahead of that of the Community.  In the period 1973 to 1986 the USA created 20 million jobs and Japan 7 million.  In the EC, however unemployment continued to rise and today 16 million of the Community's labour force are out of work.  A major cause of this problem is the fragmented Community market of 12 countries.</P>
    <P>The Commission's White Paper on Completing the Internal Market sets out a programme and detailed timetable for the achievement of that target by 1992. Physical, technical and fiscal barriers are being systematically and progressively removed and the free movement of goods, services, capital and people throughout the Community, ensured.  A recently published study undertaken for the Community &mdash; the Cecchine report &mdash; estimated that up to 5 million additional jobs could be created throughout the Community in the medium term together with an increase of 7 per cent in GDP if the completion of the internal market is achieved and actively built upon.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2210" /> The completion of the internal market is the most important single factor that will affect Irish firms over the next four to five years.  It will create opportunities but there are no guarantees.  Every business firm in the country must examine in detail what the completion of the internal market, and specifically the 300 or so proposals which the Commission has put on the agenda to achieve this, will mean for them.</P>
    <P>The Government have already been active in bringing this message home to firms in speeches which the Taoiseach and I and other Ministers have given over many months.  A number of conferences have already been organised by State agencies on the theme.  We are co-operating very fully with the representatives of business and with the other social partners in assessing the implications of the completion of the internal market and in getting the message across to the business sector.  This campaign of information and awareness will be stepped up further through a national launch at which the Taoiseach will preside shortly.</P>
    <P>As a follow-up to this and the work already underway I will shortly be starting a nationwide campaign to personally make every firm in the country aware of the major implications of the steps being taken now towards the completion of the internal market.  The objective will be to ensure that every Irish company knows what lies ahead and what it must now do to prepare for both the major opportunities and the very real threats that will arise.</P>
    <P>The Government have had considerable success over the past year in reducing the costs faced by the business sector.  High insurance costs is an area where further progress must be made.  The Government are seeking to have insurance costs reduced by the measures set out in the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i> Our court and legal procedures are being changed and a drive to improve safety in the workplace is being undertaken.  I will be pressing to ensure that the benefits of the steps now being taken to reduce costs are passed on quickly to policy holders.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2211" /> The Companies (No. 2) Bill, at present in the Seanad, is the culmination of many years of hard work.  It aims to tackle the many abuses that have eroded confidence in the business community.  The Bill tackles existing problem areas by introducing a wide range of new procedures to deter abuse under company law.  On the positive side, the Bill proposes a radical new form of company rescue and reconstruction to help put firms having temporary difficulties back on an even keel and remove any excuses for trading while insolvent.</P>
    <P>In the area of consumer protection, there have been a number of significant developments over the past year as a result of action which I have taken.  These include: the restructuring of Government agencies involved in competition and consumer protection to give a more effective and efficient use of resources as well as an overall improved competitive environment and an increased level of protection for the consumer; the requirement that the true cost will now have to be given in advertisements which make reference to the cost of credit; the requirement for manufacturers to provide more detailed information about food additives on food packets and labels.</P>
    <P>Other new consumer protection measures which I will be bringing forward include: the EEC Directive on Product Liability, which imposes legal responsibility on producers of products for injury or loss occasioned to any person due to a defect in the product, if it is shown that the defect existed when the product was put into circulation; and a right to a cooling-off period, not less than seven days, in the case of what are known as &ldquo;doorstep sales&rdquo;.  During this cooling-off period the consumer will have a right to cancel the contract.</P>
    <P>The past year will, I believe, go down as a watershed in our economic development. It was the year that we drew back from the path that led to economic insolvency through decisive and coherent Government action.  We have done a great deal to recreate the conditions for significant economic development and <Col N="2212" /> made a degree of progress in a relatively short period that few could have foreseen 15 months ago.  We have started but not yet finished the task that requires to be done.</P>
    <P>The development of our industrial and services sectors lies at the heart of the Government's <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i> Government activities are geared specifically to recreating the conditions within which investment, output and employment in these sectors can resume significant growth.  The progress which we have achieved to date shows what can be done.  We are determined to build on this and in the process to restore again confidence in our own economic future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Industrial policy in Ireland has not been a great success. After 30 years of State spending there are only 180,000 people employed in manufacturing industry, but there are 250,000 people unemployed, and 150,000 have emigrated.  Our export figures give a completely misleading picture of the contribution that manufacturing makes. Ministers know this.  Yet they continue to quote these export figures as if they meant more than they do.</P>
      <P>The fact that Ireland has the lowest corporate tax rate in Europe, 10 per cent, means that firms will locate high profitlow cost activities in Ireland.  Unfortunately, this is not a great policy from the point of view of jobs.  It is the costs, R and D, marketing, etc.  That create the jobs.  If firms have an incentive to locate the profit part of the business rather than the cost part here, we tend to get large financial figures and small employment outputs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Policy should be changed.  Why should we give capital grants at all?  Would it not be better to give grants related to capital equipment in the form of social insurance tax credits?  In other words, the firm would receive a financial benefit only on the basis of people they actually employ rather than on promises to employ.  They would not get the grant up front.  They would only get it when they had <Col N="2213" /> employed somebody and would otherwise be paying social insurance, but for the credit.</P>
    <P>The Government have, I acknowledge, reduced capital grants somewhat, but this further step would be a sensible one.</P>
    <P>I will comment now on the new system of industrial grants announced by the IDA a few months ago.  Broadly speaking, the move to give more aid to the human resources in industry and less to capital equipment is a good one.  But I have a few criticisms.  I think that 90 per cent management development grants are unwise.  The rate of grant should be no more than 50 per cent. If the firm is not paying at least half of the cost it will not have the incentive to ensure that management advice is bought only on a cost competitive basis.  In any event much of the type of advice that firms will get under this scheme will simply involve telling people what they know already but putting it in a more glossy form.</P>
    <P>I am totally opposed to the fact that the Government intend to continue giving 100 per cent training grants to firms.  No firm should get a 100 per cent grant for anything.  Training grants should be paid at no more than 70 per cent of approved costs.  I am afraid that this 100 per cent grant is being retained so that it can be used to beef up grant packages to achieve the targets set by firms in terms of State aid.  This is what happened in the disastrous Hyster case. Training grants were given in a form that essentially meant that the State were paying the firm's employees to work in the factory.  This of course made the package very attractive for the firm, but it was very bad for the taxpayer.  There should therefore be an upper limit on the State share of training costs.</P>
    <P>The new package puts a considerable amount of emphasis on the IDA giving loan guarantees rather than capital an grants.  I am not sure that I think this is a good idea.  Many firms are already over borrowed.  If they are to be told that the only way that they can get more assistance is by borrowing more money they are likely to get themselves into trouble. <Col N="2214" /> If the loan is then guaranteed by the taxpayer the losses and the trouble will be borne by the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>At least, when the State gives a grant it knows exactly what it is paying out.  If it gives a loan guarantee it has no idea of its real potential liability.  The loan guarantees are most likely to have to be met by the State in times of recession. This is when businesses are least likely to be able to meet their repayments and call on the guarantee.  Yet this is the very time, the time of recession, when the State itself is likely to be short of money. So you would have a situation in which the State will be called upon to meet guarantees when it is already struggling with its own financial situation.  Surely this is the type of pro-cyclical financing for industry that the State should avoid.</P>
    <P>I note that the IDA are now going to take equity in firms on a more substantial basis.  Will this solely be in the form of redeemable preference shares?  Will other forms of equity be taken?  What criteria will be used in deciding which firms to invest in?  Has the Minister laid down any industrial policy guidelines in this matter?  Is this not a matter of industrial policy on which the Minister, rather than the IDA, should be making the broad decisions?  I think it is.</P>
    <P>The level of profitability of Irish-owned industrial firms is disastrously low.  It is only 2.4 per cent as against 24 per cent for foreign-owned firms.  I asked the Minister a question about this in the Dáil recently.  He blamed the cost environment and a lack of buoyancy in the domestic market for this discrepancy. Surely foreign-owned industry in Ireland also suffers from the cost environment? There must be deeper reasons for the weakness of Irish-owned firms.  I asked the Minister what he was going to do about it.  He told me that the IDA were now going to invest more of their time and money in domestically-owned firms. This presumably means less time and money on foreign-owned firms.  In other words, we are going to devote more time to firms that are relatively unsuccessful and less to firms that are successful.</P>
    <P>In a sense this is a perverse industrial <Col N="2215" /> policy.  Have the Government any concrete commercial, as distinct from patriotic, reasons for this shift?  Have they set any quantified targets for the IDA in regard to their activities with domestic industry?  If the Government do not set specific targets against which IDA performance can be measured, this could be another black hole.  The IDA could go on pouring money into domestic industry and get nowhere.  There must be externally set, objective, targets for performance and results from the IDA's new thrust in the area of domestic industry. Otherwise, we could waste a lot of money on firms that are intrinsically unprofitable &mdash; the living dead, so to speak, to use the commercial term.  I know that the IDA's answer to this &mdash; and they always have an answer &mdash; will be of course that they will only spend money on firms that are potentially profitable.  We cannot afford simply to take their own word for this. There must be external targets and measurements of performance set by the Minister, not by the IDA.</P>
    <P>The Government's policy in regard to science and technology is not going well. We were promised a White Paper on Science and Technology 14 months ago and it has not appeared yet.  The previous Government established a National Software Centre, in order to give special emphasis to the development of a home owned software sector.  Increasingly it is software, the brain-based part of the electronics business that is taking over from hardware in the electronics industry.  Certainly brain-based activities like software are more suitable to Ireland than equipment-based activities like hardware.</P>
    <P>Yet, the Government continue to give substantial funds to the National Micro-Electronics Research Centre, whose activities are concerned with computer hardware, and in particular microchips. These are technologies that are not suitable to direct development and employment creation here in Ireland as we saw in the case of the two abortive chip plants and one plant that closed down.  At the same time, although spending a great <Col N="2216" /> deal of money on this sector which is not suitable here, they are closing down the National Software Centre.  It is software that is more appropriate than microchip production to the Irish economy.  Why are the Government taking this stand?  I realise the Minister will answer that the decision to close the National Software Centre was a decision of the IDA.  The IDA, however, report to the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister wanted them to keep the software centre open he could have ensured that they did.  Why did he let them close it and still keep the National Micro-Electronics Research Centre open with State aid?  What was the relative performance of the two institutions? Perhaps the Minister will indicate why he took a decision which on the surface does not seem to make much sense.</P>
      <P>One of the effects of IDA capital grants is to encourage people to buy new machinery.  There is evidence that this leads to a mark-up in the price of new machinery sold in Ireland.  Because a grant is being paid a higher price is charged by the suppliers in the knowledge that the manufacturer can pay a higher price because he is getting a grant from the Government.  Has the Minister considered making an investigation of the relative prices of capital equipment here in Ireland, as against other countries where grants are not paid for capital equipment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Commission on Taxation recommended that the corporation profits tax capital allowances should be available for secondhand machinery as well as for new machinery.  This would remove the distortion which encourages people to buy something new, even though it need not be any better than something that can be obtained more cheaply secondhand. Capital is scarce in this country and we should not have a State grant and tax allowance system which encourages its inefficient use.  I would ask the Minister to re-examine the position in regard to <Col N="2217" /> assistance for secondhand machinery in the light of these considerations.</P>
    <P>I would like to say a few words now about the Custom House Docks site, which is being promoted by the IDA. One developer has been given charge of developing this site.  Is the development up to schedule at the moment?  Was a schedule set by the Government for the developer and has he lived up to it?  How do the rents being charged or proposed to be charged by the developer compare with those for similar accommodation that is not within the Custom House Docks area?  Is there any danger that the availability of tax concessions in this limited area will give the developer the opportunity of charging much higher rents in that area than would be charged for comparable accommodation just outside it?  If this happens, will it not mean that the Government's concessions will go to the developer, rather than to the benefit of the new activities to be attracted to the centre?  Why did the Government decide to give the entire works to one developer, anyway?  Would it not have been better to have split the work up and had some competition between them?</P>
    <P>What controls are there to ensure that the activities attracted to the centre will not simply be activities diverted from some other part of the country, with no or little net extra employment?  I see that major banks and the ESB are going to be in the centre.  Surely these would have been doing this work elsewhere anyway. Is it possible, furthermore, for firms establishing in the centre to get both a building allowance and a rent allowance for the same building by clever arrangements? I have been told, but have not heard confirmed, of one firm that is building a building for another and renting it to it in return for having a similar process operated in reverse.  Thus, both firms are able to qualify for a rent allowance and a capital allowance in respect of the same new building.  If this is happening, will it be stopped?</P>
    <P>Why is so much of the centre devoted to non-productive activity under the plan approved?  I understand that a good part <Col N="2218" /> of the area will be covered by amenities of one kind or another.  Surely, the city of Dublin at large could provide these amenities without them having to be in the centre itself.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that the best future for the Irish economy lies in the natural development of small business.  Small businesses will fail from time to time. Those involved in them must be encouraged if they fail to start again.  The Companies Bill, however, says that anyone who carries on a business in &ldquo;a reckless manner&rdquo; may be personally liable without limits for the debts of the company, and disqualified from setting up a new company.  It is not easy to define or anticipate the definition of &ldquo;recklessness.&rdquo; What is entrepreneurial for one person might be reckless for another.  Unlimited liability is a very severe penalty.  Is there a danger that the fear of the consequences of failure will now be so great that people will not set up small businesses in the first place?</P>
    <P>I acknowledge that the legislation which contains these terms was promulgated by the previous Government and I did a considerable amount of work on it.  However, the purpose of legislative scrutiny is to deal with any problems that could arise from the legislation and that issue of the effect of those sections on encouragement for the setting up of small businesses and encouraging people to try, fail and try again is something the Minister might advert to in his reply or later when the Bill comes before us.</P>
    <P>In the review of designation why did the Government not designate part of Dublin in view of the very high level of unemployment in the city and county of Dublin?  Are there not parts of Dublin with far higher levels of unemployment than the areas which were designated? When will the Government be making decisions about the corporation profits tax regime to apply after 11 years from now after the expiry of the 10 per cent in the year 2000?  Why did the Minister not refer in his speech to what he referred to last year, namely, his concern to develop an active market on the Stock Exchange <Col N="2219" /> for smaller firms?  The Minister did not refer to that this year.</P>

      <P>All right, I am raising it.  Has any progress been made on that front?  In regard to the 1992 campaign which the Minister is proposing to launch personally and to travel around the country to offer some personal advice &mdash; there are many good precedents for that &mdash; I am sure he will do it very well but he might be asked to consider that it is not awareness but decisions we should be looking for on this subject.  We all were, or should have been, aware at least a year ago of the importance of 1992.  I hope the Government will take the necessary action and will encourage firms to take decisions now and not simply to attend seminars about this subject.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>Listening to what has been said here this morning, it is obvious that in the area of industrial policy, at last there has been a recognition that industrial policy is at a crossroads.  The Government are attempting to address the areas that need to be looked at for a proper and cohesive future to be guaranteed in the industrial area.  However, while many good ideas are floating about and attempts are made to grapple with them and somehow get them implemented, there is a danger that we are leaving still in place many of the ways of doing things in the industrial area that are now no longer relevant and are going out of date.  It is not enough to identify what is good without identifying the necessary measures to achieve our objective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Bruton this morning referred to industrial grants.  I have heard a lot of comment from economic commentators on this issue and there is no doubt that there is a need for a change in that policy. The Minister told us that the grants amount to £5,000 per employee, but it must be obvious to him that the central feature in job creation is the cost of the <Col N="2220" /> employee from the point of view of taxation. We give grants to create employment but we do not recognise what the problem is.  That is a contradiction there, and it is not the way we should proceed when trying to create jobs.  By giving grants to create new jobs we are not solving the problem; in fact, it amounts to a waste of money.</P>
    <P>It would be better if we changed over to giving preference shares, loan guarantees or interest subsidies.  I do not accept that interest subsidies would mean that we would be helping companies when they are in trouble.  The Government would have an input into how the company should proceed.  They would have access to all available information.  A grant is written off shortly after it is paid out and the firm that receives it either succeeds or not.  If we are to create more jobs we will have to concentrate on establishing smaller industries.  No longer can we depend on multinationals establishing big concerns here, because technology has taken over.  Our future lies in small industrial units; but there is a need to introduce legislation to help such small companies get off the ground.  This was dealt with by the Minister in his speech and I hope he pursues the matter.  There is a need to improve company law as it relates to small concerns.  There is no doubt that the larger concerns must cope with a lot of red tape but bureaucracy hinders the development of small companies. I am referring to companies that may have two directors who must comply with regulations governing meetings and so on.  Such regulations should be removed and we should allow small companies to be more flexible and more relevant to their business.</P>
    <P>There is a need to update competition law in order to break cartel-type arrangements and free-up the markets here.  Such changes should be part of any new industrial policy.  It is correct to say that low inflation, low interest rates and so on are important, but on their own they will not achieve the type of industrial expansion we need.  If we sit back and hope that those features will lead to industrial expansion we will not be successful.  The <Col N="2221" /> Government have not indicated what they propose to do in regard to introducing legislation that would help create jobs.  Job creation should be the priority.</P>
    <P>I accept that efforts have been made to rationalise the agencies involved in job creation and industrial promotion.  The IDA and CTT may have separate functions to perform, but it is wrong that they should operate in the autonomous way they do.  I am not saying that we should amalgamate the IDA and CTT overnight but we should consider establishing a single board for the two organisations. Much of their administration could be dealt with by one unit.  With 1992 in mind, one dynamic unit, under the aegis of the Department of Industry and Commerce, would be better than two units working in different directions.</P>
    <P>The marketing of Irish products has been one of our greatest failures in recent years.  If small industries are to develop the greatest difficulty they will face will be the cost of marketing internationally. We should establish a unit that will be capable of giving all the necessary information on export opportunities available within the EC and outside.  Such information flows from the IDA and CTT, but there is no link between the two.  One single organisation would achieve a lot more in that area.  We should continue to encourage multinationals to establish industries here.  I have no doubt that there are many companies anxious to get access to the EC market before 1992 and we should be selling Ireland as a base for such companies.  There is no doubt that companies that produce an end product will locate on the mainland where the majority of consumers live, but we should try to attract the companies that produce components.  There are many companies in Japan servicing major industrial producers and we should be trying to attract them to establish industries here.</P>
    <P>Up to now the Department of Industry and Commerce have not been at the centre of the formulation of industrial policy.  Too many agencies in an autonomous way have been formulating their own policies and pursuing them.  Some of them have succeeded, but if we are to <Col N="2222" /> have a three or five year rolling plan the Department should be the instigator of such a policy.  Agencies such as the IDA, FÁS and so on should be the implementors of such a policy and should do so in a controlled way under the aegis of the Department.  The Minister appears to recognise the need for this.  I suggest that an advisory committee consisting of representatives of the industrial and commercial sectors should be appointed to formulate such a policy.  All aspects of industrial life should be covered by the inclusion of accountants, financiers and experts in marketing and administration. They should be there not simply to put forward their own vested interests in their own areas but in an overall capacity to advise the Department on the broadbased industrial policy and to monitor what is happening.  They should not simply meet with the officials in the Department every six or 12 months but on an ongoing basis.  Civil servants are not in the marketplace and responsible to employees for keeping them in their jobs and making a profit for companies. People who are in the marketplace have a hands-on effect on the day to day events occurring within the markets.  If that type of element was brought into the Department of Industry and Commerce it would make a great difference and there would be a much more flexible industrial policy.</P>
    <P>The example of what is happening to Irish Distillers at present is a very good one in that if Irish companies do not now recognise that they must instigate their own joint ventures, mergers or partnerships in Europe, their own hostile competitors will be the first to take them over, gobble them up and eliminate competition. I am not trying to be critical of Irish Distillers as a group, but one can learn many lessons from the type of take over that is being attempted there at present.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to his tour around the country to bring home the message of 1992.  The CII have done a very good job in producing, on a weekly or a monthly basis very good information relating to 1992 and they should be complimented on that.  But is the effect of <Col N="2223" /> that getting through to the businesses themselves, particularly small businesses, who are probably more at risk and who in a contradictory way probably have more opportunity than many others? That opportunity will be taken from them if they do not now recognise that to have 40 per cent or 50 per cent of a major company is much better for the future than to have 100 per cent of what ultimately may be nothing.  The Minister should try to get this point across to those in the marketplace.  They have a vague idea that there will be opportunities in 1992 but that there will also be disadvantages. But I do not believe that Irish industry across the board have looked at their own products and their own markets to see how best they can explore the benefits and opportunities that will exist in 1992.</P>
    <P>Some of the things outlined by the Minister are correct.  The Department are approaching industrial policy in the right way, but they must be extremely careful not to simply take the good ideas and try to put them onto another layer of ideas that have either gone out of date or have not succeeded.  There needs to be a root and branch review of the whole area sector by sector and, having done that, we can decide on the areas that offer the best advantages and the type of industries that we could develop to create an image of Ireland for future opportunity throughout the EC in the years ahead.</P>

    <P>I wish to express very great disappointment with Deputy Bruton's speech.  No doubt, my colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, will deal with the long list of questions posed to the Government in this question <Col N="2224" /> paper from Deputy Bruton.  I express real disappointment that nowhere in his address to the House on the Estimates for Industry and Commerce did he address what I understood to be a major challenge facing the economy: the question of marketing and our trading relationships with other countries.  I had understood that by now most serious commentators, in seeking to develop this economy, could not but focus on the need to improve the marketing capability and the need to follow it through with some hard-nosed practical examples.  I can only assume that other members of the Deputy's party will concentrate on this vital area, without which one cannot fully address an industrial debate seriously.  I can only assume that that is an oversight by Deputy Bruton which will be addressed by other members of his party.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to start by expressing that disappointment, which I think is a major oversight.  This country has to be increasingly export driven because we have a very small home market.  In the past few years we have had <Col N="2225" /> an improved export performance which is central to national recovery.  We had a record export performance in 1987, which showed a 10 per cent volume of growth, and a record trade surplus.  There is a £12 billion export figure forecast for 1988 which is equal to a volume growth of about 9 per cent.  I note, quite interestingly, from this morning's OECD forecast that they suggest we might make an 11 per cent increase in volume growth. It will be very exciting if we can make that happen.  They call that a &ldquo;good competitive position&rdquo; and they describe Ireland, as of now, as being in a &ldquo;good competitive position&rdquo;.  That reflects the new dynamism of Irish exporters.  It also reflects strong efforts by Government to improve the competitive position in the economy.</P>
      <P>There has been a fall in interest rates of about 6 per cent over the period.  The Government have given a very strong commitment to currency stability, which is very important for our exporters. Inflation is running at about 2½ per cent. I think there is general agreement that there is a new sense of direction and confidence in our economy, but we have to improve even further on this impressive record.  In particular we will have to get an improved performance from our domestic exporters and ensure that exports lead to increased employment and increased value added.  It is disappointing sometimes to see export figures soaring while no jobs are coming directly from those increased exports. One of my greatest disappointments to date has been that our very impressive export figures do not seem to be seeping through and providing additional employment as quickly as they should. That can only lead to the conclusion that we must concentrate more and more on our indigenous domestic manufacturers because we are more likely to get an immediate increase in employment from that area.  That is a very important point. A major challenge for this House and the country in the next year will be to try to find a clearer way to link the successful increasing exports with real jobs.  That seems to be a very difficult task.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2226" /> I would like to report to the Dáil on some new initiatives which were taken during last year to give a new impetus to the domestic exporting sector.  The first one is the special trading house area. As the Dáil is probably aware, we have licensed two of these houses in recent weeks, with a projected turn-over of £25 million over a period, and there are several more in the pipeline.  The Dáil will be fully aware that these were approved by the European Commission as substantial initiatives to offset the marketing disadvantages of small and medium-sized industries because of our position on the European periphery and the difficulty of marketing our goods in that area.  There will be an immediate pay-off in terms of jobs and exports from this special trading house initiative and this will build up cumulatively, I hope, in the medium term to give some real employment.  I hope to license two more of those houses in the coming weeks and I am happy to tell the House that there are more exciting ones in the pipeline.</P>
    <P>We also launched a fostering scheme during the year, a scheme which we initiated with the Marketing Institute, which provides marketing expertise at no charge from larger companies to small and medium-sized companies.  There are now 50 such schemes in operation and they are working very well indeed.  The larger companies make their marketing expertise available to newer smaller companies free of charge so that they can have a marketing capability as quickly as possible.  As I said, there are 50 schemes in operation and I think we can double that number over the next few months.</P>
    <P>We have carried out a major review of two State agencies for which I have a direct responsibility &mdash; Córas Tráchtála Teoranta and the Irish Goods Council. I have completed an assessment of the activities of Córas Tráchtála Teoranta in 1987.  It is important to remind the House that we gave that organisation some new guidelines towards the end of last year which will make them increasingly self-financing. I am pleased to tell the House <Col N="2227" /> that they have signed a number of contracts based on a royalty system, a payments by results system, where the potential exporter reimburses CTT on the basis of results achieved rather than just on the basis of activity.  We are getting a sort of no foal no fee type of thinking there which is very important.  I take this opportunity to compliment Córas Tráchtála Teoranta for grabbing that new policy initiative so enthusiastically.  As I said, they are becoming an increasingly self-financing organisation.</P>
    <P>They have also been addressing the weaknesses in indigenous industries and are concentrating on trying to build up those industries.  Of course, they have suffered cutbacks like any other organisation, but there will be no retrenchment by Córas Tráchtála because of reduced funding but rather there will be an increased commitment and in the business approach of that organisation, forming business relationships and going ahead in a way which will offset any cuts the organisation have suffered.</P>
    <P>Córas Tráchtála Teoranta have been restructuring with the aim of generating additional indigenous exports of some £750 million in 1988-90.  CTT and other State agencies are looking to improve efficiency and effectiveness in our marketing representation abroad and have been looking at ways of improving that efficiency in New York, for example, and other cities.  The market entry development scheme is being looked at with a view to strengthening it, and I hope to have more to say about this in future weeks.</P>
    <P>The Irish Goods Council are working with what I call domestic exports.  They tell me that of the £9 billion which we imported in 1987 some 15 per cent is immediately substitutionable by homebased production.  That means that, if we were to increase the share of our own market &mdash; we have 43 per cent-to 50 per cent &mdash; that would give us £1 billion of additional sales and would account for up to 30,000 new jobs in Irish manufacture. That is a target we should try to achieve as quickly as possible.  It is a staggering <Col N="2228" /> figure to focus on, that Irish manufactures have only 43 per cent of our own marketplace, one of the lowest in Europe.</P>
    <P>I pose this question: if we can get only 43 per cent of our own market, how will we get a share of the new internal market in the years ahead?  Forty three per cent is too little.  We should have at least 60 per cent of our domestic market to compare with the best in Europe.  That is the target I have set the Irish Goods Council &mdash; £1 billion of additional business for Irish manufacturers to sell at home.  That is the major challenge I put to the Irish Goods Council and to the country today: to develop business which will produce that £1 billion of additional sales which will bring us into line with the rest of Europe.</P>
    <P>The Minister, Deputy Reynolds, spoke about the internal market.  We are all concerned about that because 75 per cent of our exports already go to the EC.  As the CII put it so well recently, there are only 1,000 working days left in the 1992 deadline.  We have the choice of seeing that internal market either as an incoming tide which will swamp us or as a golden opportunity.  I would encourage industry to see it as the latter and to prepare for it.  I do not think there is any need for us to get over excited about massive campaigns and insisting on them at too early a stage.  It is important that industry get practical advice and that we do not scare the living daylights out of them in regard to 1992.</P>
    <P>There are no more than perhaps a dozen directives which affect any one industry.  I would say to Irish industry that they should get those directives and read them very carefully.  If they have not been passed &mdash; and the likelihood is that they have not been because only 70 out of 300 have been passed &mdash; and if they do not like what the directives say, they should make sure their industry representatives, CII or whatever, know.  I advise industry to be very practical about this.  Get the directives and read them.  I do not believe most people in industry have taken this very simple step.  When they read them they will be able to decide <Col N="2229" /> how the directives will affect their industry and they will be able to take the necessary step then.</P>
    <P>I want to comment briefly on the steps we are taking in the insurance industry. The Minister, Deputy Reynolds, has laid out the Government programme to reform the court and legal procedures, changes in the counsel rule, the pre-trial procedures and our initiatives in regard to young drivers.  In all these areas we are beginning to see the effect of insurance costs reducing.  For the first time in many years there is a real market in the motor industry on the insurance side.  One of the reasons is that the industry are looking ahead and seeing the results of these changes we are brining about.</P>
    <P>ICI and PMPA are proceeding satisfactorily and their full recovery is well on target.  However, I will keep the House informed of their progress.  The Insurance Bill, which is increasing the efficiency of the industry generally, is completing the Committee Stage in the Seanad and will be available for the Dáil as soon as possible.  This will take some important steps forward in the insurance area.</P>
    <P>As regards the EC non-life insurance directive, 1992 is the date the insurance industry have to be ready for.  There is a feeling in the industry that because I negotiated a postponement of the most severe aspects of the directives the industry can relax a little.  They cannot do that because 1992 is the date and the additional postponements I arranged at EC level are only for certain areas and will not affect the overall need for the insurance industry to face up to their decisions whether they need to rationalise or to take whatever other steps are available to them.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, our exports are going well and our challenge is to link those exports to employment and ensure that we get growth in employment.  We have been taking steps to make CTT and the Irish Good Council much more effective and efficient, albeit on reduced funding. I want to take this occasion to thank both organisations for their very valuable <Col N="2230" /> work.  I believe 1989 will be another important year for trade, exports and marketing.  I honestly believe, particularly with the trading house initiative, that we have moved the whole question of marketing and trade up the national agenda.  It is only when you consider that this country is proportionately more dependent on exporting than, say, America and Japan, that you see how absolutely essential it is for this country to keep its export performance going &mdash; not just its export performance from the multinational companies; we must make sure our own industries perform also.</P>
    <P>One of my disappointments this year, and one on which I hope to make some progress next year, is that something like one-third of all exports are provided by only ten companies.  We have to broaden our export base and marketing internationally. That means getting small domestic industries into the exporting business.  There are about 7,000 small manufacturing companies in Ireland and only about 2,000 export.  I challenge the remaining 5,000 to get into the exporting business as early as possible because the future success of this economy depends on winning those markets.</P>

      <P>Naturally, I compliment the Minister of State for many of his constructive and innovative remarks and many of the actions he has taken since he became Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the approach of 1992 and the various Directives with which we will then have to comply, the Government and the Minister's Department seem to be falling down drastically on creating an awareness of the implications.  For the last three or four months, on BBC, UTV and other television stations across the water, an obvious campaign has been launched to create an awareness in industry of the coming of 1992.  That campaign got off the ground at a very early stage and is now up and running.  The same applies to France and a number of other European countries.  In this country to date we have not even become remotely aware of all the serious implications of 1992.  There are challenges and benefits, but also <Col N="2231" /> threats, as I said in relation to a previous Estimate.  I suggest that, notwithstanding the proposed promotional campaign of the Minister by way of a tour throughout the country, a great deal more than that is required to alert our business interests as to what we can expect in 1992 and what we must do in order to succeed on and after that date.  I implore the Ministers present and the Government to take on board that serious and constructive criticism.  If we do not very shortly wake up, we shall have a very serious problem on our hands.  That is not just my opinion but that of many business people at the moment.  What we lack in this country is forward planning and anticipation.  We react to something when the unfortunate scene is upon us. We take measures when we see the avalanche descending upon us.  We should take those measures three, four or ten years in advance and then we will avoid the serious problems that have arisen in the past.</P>
    <P>I want to refer very briefly to the Minister's speech in which he said: &ldquo;The public finances have been brought under control for the first time in years and the budget projections have been on target, in stark contrast to the situation that had prevailed in recent years&rdquo;.  The previous Minister, in speaking on his Estimate, made very derogatory remarks on what had transpired in the preceding years. Whether we like it or not, the base line from which this country was pulled in 1981 and 1982 is now a dim vision on the horizon as far as some people are concerned.  Very few people on the opposite benches are prepared to recognise just how far this country has come since 1982 when the public annual wage expectations were somewhere in the region of 20 per cent plus, when interest rates were in the region of 20 per cent plus and inflation rates in the region of 20 per cent plus.  Many areas had gone seriously awry and, for the four years to which the Minister referred critically, all that emanated from the benches of the then Opposition were destructive criticism and calls for more Government <Col N="2232" /> expenditure and a further decline in what the Minister now claims as being something for which he and his Government are directly responsible.</P>
    <P>People should be fair and give credit where credit is due.  In the Minister's speech what has been completely forgotten is the fact that a great deal of hard slogging work without any great deal of encouragement from the Opposition of the day had to be undertaken for the four or five years up to now and a great deal of success was achieved as a result of decisions taken during that time.</P>
    <P>I wish to make sufficient time available for my colleague, Deputy Kelly.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>May I take it that the Deputy seeks to share his time?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no need to share the time because there is sufficient time available, that is as long as there are no other speakers wishing to contribute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to mention the frustrations that some of us have to face in relation to industrial expansion, job promotion, unemployment, etc.  If one puts down a parliamentary question relating, for instance, to the utilisation of IDA lands in a particular part of the country, the stock reply is received that the Minister has no direct responsibility to the Dáil. That is all very fine and probably is quite true, but the Minister should be taking a closer interest as to who has responsibility and who is doing what in relation to the promotion of the various IDA sites which have been lying fallow throughout the country.  There are quite a number of these in my own constituency of Kildare. With all due respect to the Minister, the IDA and the various Departments involved, I might as well not have bothered putting down the parliamentary questions that I did.  There was no information available, no indication that anything dramatic was likely to happen, or that the success rate in the future would be any better than that for the last 12 or 18 months, or two years.  In the present climate and with the greater competitiveness which will emerge in 1992 and thereafter, there is a greater need <Col N="2233" /> now than ever for the IDA, the Irish Goods Council and the Minister's own Department to take on board the serious challenges that lie ahead of them and recognise that what may very well have suited and brought adequate results in the past is no longer sufficient to meet present day requirements.</P>
    <P>The Minister claims a certain responsibility for the job market now being in a rather healthier state.  One of the reasons for that is that 30,000 people have been exported.  That was one of the exports for which no Government seeks responsibility, but it is an unfortunate and unacceptable fact.  I am suggesting today that the Government realise that we cannot allow that trend to continue.  There is no use in saying that we cannot do anything about it; we must.  Others are doing something about it and are opening up new markets in our own backyard.  Other people are selling their products within our immediate market area.  The Minister of State said just now that if we cannot succeed in our own marketplace it is very unlikely that we will be dramatically successful in foreign marketplaces.  We need to take a whole new look at what is happening around us and adopt a much more aggressive attitude in so far as attracting industries here is concerned, be they home based or foreign based.</P>
    <P>There has been much criticism in the past in relation to repatriation of profits on the part of multinational corporations. Multinationals will invest their money in a country which gives the best dividends and the biggest profits.  That is what we should be looking at.  If prospects are sufficiently good, they will make their investment in that country.  That is a matter for us.</P>
    <P>There are a number of other areas to which we could address ourselves.  A redefining of the objectives of the IDA is essential at present.  We have far too many industrial sites and, notwithstanding the present poor economic climate, there is an urgent need for the IDA to come to grips with the situation and do something urgently about attracting people into these sites.  It may mean multinational corporations, local small <Col N="2234" /> industries or cluster industries, but something must be done because the public will lose confidence in the system otherwise.</P>
    <P>I do not want to be parochial in such a short debate but in my constituency Bord na Móna and the ESB have been scaling down their operations and will continue to do so over the next ten years or so, with obvious job losses.  A meat processing plant in Leixlip closed down a few years ago; I remember when over 1,000 people were employed but there is nothing there now.  There has been no replacement factory despite the fact that there is a vast, expanding population in the immediate area who are highly qualified and willing to enter the job market if there is any employment for them. Those people are interested in Dáil questions which I and other Deputies put down to various Ministers but the response is not very encouraging or does not instil confidence in a young population. The replies say that it is the primary responsibility of the IDA to market the various sites and to attract new industries. We heard all that before and it cuts noice with the public.</P>
    <P>In relation to launching new products, which we will experience to a greater extent as 1992 comes closer, we do not take advantage of the established brands already here.  A previous speaker referred to Irish Distillers.  Irish-based companies have an obvious advantage in taking brand products, such as those marketed by Irish Distillers, under their wing and also marketing them in the European or world marketplace where they already have sales.  It is not good enough to be critical of firms who are in trouble at present.  If the new competition gets too much, we must try to steer those firms in a direction which will be beneficial not only to themselves but to the economy generally.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State referred to insurance costs.  From my dealings with the public and business interests, it is clear that insurance costs are the primary cause for lack of investment in certain areas.  The colossal insurance costs, public liability and all that goes with it <Col N="2235" /> discourage people who are anxious to invest to take on employees, to provide services or to manufacture.  They are now not prepared to provide jobs because they cannot possibly carry the high insurance.  It is all very fine to talk about derogations after 1992 but the Minister and the Minister of State should be very wary of the negative effects which some of those derogations might have on the business community who already have to suffer the ill-effects of high insurance costs.  While the derogations could assist the insurance industry, they may well be of no assistance to the rest of industry who have to compete with many other competitors.</P>
    <P>The awareness campaign in relation to 1992 which is already running in other European countries is not taking place here.  The Government should do something about this apart from sending the Minister on a trip to the various constituencies. The IDA and the Irish Goods Council have done very constructive and helpful work in the past but there is now a need for them to take on a new role, to become more aggressive and to launch their activities from a new base.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMcCarthy" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Dr. McCarthy) Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Dr. McCarthy)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Dr. McCarthy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure Deputies are all well aware of the Government's commitment to science and technology.  We have, in our universities, industries and farms all the ingredients to create a high skill, high productivity economy providing real and lasting employment.  However, we cannot sit back waiting for the transformation to come about.  Positive action is needed to put technology to work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Governments all around the world recognise the vital importance of new technologies and this Government are no exception.  We have taken new steps in this area over recent years and are particularly well placed to succeed as a result. One of our first actions was to create the new Science and Technology Agency, Eolas, by bringing together the National Board for Science and Technology and <Col N="2236" /> the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards.</P>
    <P>The creation of this new agency &mdash; Eolas &mdash; is a major step forward. Higher priority for science and technology will better equip our industries to adapt to the change which is essential to their survival.  Even more important, it will create new sources of wealth and lay the foundation for a high-technology, high-income economy.</P>
    <P>I can assure Deputies that Eolas are not sitting back waiting for Irish industry to become aware of their existence.  The task is a difficult one.  The Government see a major developmental role for Eolas not only in science and technology but also in the development and implementation of industrial policy generally. Indigenous Irish industry urgently needs to raise its technological capacity if it is to succeed in today's business environment. Eolas are the vehicle by which the State will support this effort and industry must avail of their services.</P>
    <P>In order that the agency can meet this challenge more efficiently, a number of sub-committees have been established under the chairmanship of members of the board to develop technology-related sectoral strategies.  Committees have been established for electronics, advanced materials technology, software, advanced manufacturing technology and pharmaceuticals and chemicals.  In addition, a further committee have been established to overview the internal activities and business strategy of the whole organisation.  Finally, the National Standards Authority of Ireland have been re-established with an even more important role than hitherto. They will continue to develop and promulgate the use of Irish standards but will now concentrate on increasing Irish industry's consciousness on the need for quality in the run into 1992 and harmonisation in the internal market.</P>
    <P>The creation of the internal market will present tremendous opportunities to Irish industry, large and small.  We can no longer accept a situation in which no more than a dozen companies are responsible for a third of Irish exports.  There <Col N="2237" /> are more than 5,000 manufacturing companies in Ireland, each having the potential to supply this lucrative market on our doorstep.</P>
    <P>It is vital that Irish industry should be fully familiar with the existing and proposed market requirements and be prepared to meet them.  Harmonised standards for quality and reliability must be met and product approval procedures completed.  Up to 5,000 standards will be drafted by the European standards bodies between now and 1992 and the National Standards Authority of Ireland will have the task to transpose those into national standards.</P>
    <P>The NSAI recently launched a membership scheme which has been designed to assist members to meet the challenge of the internal market.  It gives them the opportunity to: participate in the development of European standards thus ensuring that our interests are protected and promoted; gain access to the information needed to trade successfully in Europe; undertake detailed consultation on particular aspects of the internal market relevant to our requirements; and attend regular regional meetings of members to exchange information, discuss the latest developments in Europe and advise the NSAI of their particular needs.</P>
    <P>I would recommend that anyone who seriously wishes to prepare for the single European market should participate in the NSAI's standards membership scheme.  Here, they will receive expert advice on the implications of the technical developments in the European Community.  They will also be able to participate in the development of the European standards that are of particular interest to them.</P>
    <P>Before I leave the question of standards a lot of media attention was focused recently on the problem of flammable foam in domestic furniture.  I announced in this House on 25 February last that new regulations will be introduced in early 1989 relating to the fire safety requirements for upholstered furniture.  I am happy to inform you that significant progress has been achieved since that <Col N="2238" /> announcement.  The NSAI have now drafted and circulated for public comment two new standards on the flammability behaviour of single filling components, foams and fibres, used in domestic upholstered furniture and on the ignitability requirements of mattresses tested with secondary ignition sources simulating unknown bedcovers. An order making compliance with these new standards mandatory is also being finalised by officials in my office.</P>
    <P>I also met on 20 April last with representatives of the foam furniture and bedding trades representing all stages of manufacture, import and export, and retail to explain the details of the new regulations.  While some concern were voiced over certain technical aspects of the regulations, general agreement was voiced at the need for and desirability for tough regulations in this area.</P>
    <P>The electronics and information technology industries have continued to develop and a number of significant expansions and set-ups have been announced or are in the pipeline.  Of significance are the decision of Claris Corporation, one of the world's leading software houses, to establish in Ireland, and a decision by Microsoft to expand operations here.  It is noteworthy that Ireland will now be host to the top four software companies worldwide, an indication of the attractiveness of this country for these operations.</P>
    <P>On the hardware side, Nixdorf announced the establishment of a research and development centre, considerably enhancing their existing operations. A major Japanese company, Alps Electric, announced recently that they are to commence a 160 job investment in Cork.  A number of other significant proposals are at an advanced stage of negotiation.</P>
    <P>There has been considerable activity within the European Community of relevance to our economic development.</P>
    <P>In November last year I announced details of the EC's STAR programme to stimulate supply and demand for advanced telecommunications services. <Col N="2239" /> Ireland will receive £38.8 million of European Regional Fund money over a five year period under the programme. Almost £6 million of this will be for projects which come within the ambit of my brief as Minister for Science and Technology. Matching funding from the Irish public and private sectors will mean a total expenditure in excess of £11 million on this aspect of the programme.</P>
    <P>The EC's policy in the telecommunications are includes full integration of the less-favoured regions, including Ireland, into the emerging Community-wide market.  This should include examination of additional needs for further extension of available Community funds for this purpose.</P>
    <P>In the legal sphere, my office have made a significant input into the text of a proposed Bill on software copyright, to ensure that the legislation will reflect the needs of industry.  In 1987 we decided to initiate a special programme in the area of science and technology.</P>
    <P>Deputies will recall the Taoiseach's announcement, in June 1987, that a special budget was being provided to advance the Government's science and technology development programme. This programme is being continued in 1988 with a budget of £3.1 million.  I would like to inform the House of some of the new initiatives under this programme.</P>
    <P>Biotechnology, which uses living organisms to make new products and to improve plants and animals, is not a new science but there have been developments in recent years which have significantly increased its scope so that it now encompasses areas such as chemistry, medicine and pharmaceuticals, as well as agriculture.  It has been identified as an area which holds real promise for Ireland; an area whose potential has not yet been adequately developed.  I am confident that the national biotechnology programme is the way to exploit this potential.</P>
    <P>In 1987, £600,000 was allocated to biotechnology and that sum, combined with the £1.5 million being allocated in <Col N="2240" /> 1988, has enabled the national biotechnology programme to get off the ground.  Already Bio Research Ireland, the programme's contract research organisation, has set up, equipped and staffed centres of expertise at UCG, UCC and NIHE, Dublin, to carry out research and services for industry on a contract basis and two further centres are planned as soon as additional funding becomes available.  I am told that the centres expect to become self-financing within the next four or five years, through contract income and patent royalties.</P>
    <P>The national programme for technological innovation, which was also initiated in 1987, has a budget of £1.4 million in 1988.  The programme which is being managed by Eolas, the new Science and Technology Agency comprises three main elements, namely: (i) a teaching company programme; (ii) a co-operative research programme; and (iii) a south east region pilot programme.  Each of these elements shares a common theme &mdash; the technological capacity in Irish industry.</P>
    <P>The teaching company programme which subsidies the placement of highly qualified graduates in industry has been developed specifically to assist indigenous industry to develop a nucleus of technical capacity.  This type of capability is a prerequisite to the successful development of any company.</P>
    <P>There have been over 30 placements to date under this scheme and a further 20 are planned in 1988.  The early results of the scheme indicate that this infusion of expertise has enabled the participating companies to reach a level of technological development which would otherwise have been totally beyond their reach.  As a result, their productivity and most significantly, their ability to compete in export markets has been dramatically increased.</P>
    <P>The programme also reflects another key feature of our efforts: to tap the rich seam of expertise within our third level educational institutes and inject it into industry.  It is very important that the two should work closely with each other and we have succeeded in bringing this about.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2241" /> The co-operative research programme involves a number of support programmes to encourage industry and the higher education sector to work together. The key elements of this programme include: (a)  Higher education-industry co-operation projects.  This involves the promotion of collaborative work and partnerships between industry and higher education colleges.  A special emphasis is being given to developing the role of the RTCs in this area; (b) Collaborative research and development which aims to bring together groups of companies with experts in the research institutes and colleges to collaborate on pre-competitive but market-related research and development; and (c) Innovation awards which are designed to encourage and recognise technological innovative achievement in Irish industrial and commercial development.</P>
    <P>Last year, a programme, was established on a pilot basis, to see how technology could be used to accelerate the economic development of the south-east region.  During 1988 the pilot programme will receive further Government funding of £300,000.  My hopes are that the programme will be a living example of how technology can be applied in industry and that it will demonstrate the importance of science and technology to the people in the region through the creation of new and viable jobs.  This pilot programme will pave the way for Irish submissions to new Community Regional Funds earmarked specifically for science and technology infrastructure.  The funding provided for 1988 will cover, <i>inter alia,</i> (1) the establishment of industrial liaison offices in the Regional Technical Colleges at Carlow and Waterford; (2) research and development projects involving local industries and higher education co-operation; and (3) the provision of technology audits for industry in the region.</P>
    <P>All over the world Advanced Manufacturing Technology (AMT) is being applied in industry to cut costs and raise output.  AMT is especially relevant to Ireland because it allows smaller manufacturers to achieve these objectives and to increase significantly the flexibility of <Col N="2242" /> their operations.  By building on existing AMT expertise in the third level sector I am endeavouring to make the most prudent use of State funds.  In fact, the bulk of the personnel employed by this programme are funded by contract research undertaken for industry.</P>
    <P>The increased funding for this programme in 1988 (£200,000) reflects the first full year cost of the programme. However, it is intended that this programme should move towards self-sufficiency over the next two years with the AMT Research Units at UCD, TCD and NIHE Limerick becoming self-supporting from their industry contracts.</P>
    <P>The National Microelectronics Research Centre was established at UCC in 1981 in order to provide research and development in microelectronics and educational support for Irish industry. The centre both undertakes contract research on behalf of industry and co-operative projects in conjunction with industry.  In addition, the centre caters for some 150 undergraduate students and ten post-graduate students per annum.</P>
    <P>The NMRC is widely regarded throughout Europe as a centre of excellence: it has established links with both European industry and research institutes.  It has been noticeably successful in winning research contracts and has been a major participant in the EC Strategic Programme in Information Technology (ESPRIT).  An index of the centre's success is the fact that contract income now generates employment for 42 researchers at NMRC.</P>
    <P>Funding provided in 1988 allowed the centre to make a major change in its integrated circuit fabrication process, moving from the three to five inch silicon wafers which have now become the industry standard.  In addition, a computer-aided design system was installed to cater particularly for the design of application specific integrated circuits. These circuits are designed for low volume production runs and, as the name suggests, product-specific applications. Together these developments will maintain the centre's competitive standard <Col N="2243" /> and increase its capability to meet the needs of Irish industry.</P>
    <P>Technological development is essential, not only for Ireland's prosperity but for the future welfare of Europe.  By whole-hearted participation in EC programmes of research and development we can tune into the best brains in the world and take part in projects beyond the scope of our resources.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>I will conclude by mentioning the European Space Agency (ESA) another important international organisation of which Ireland is a member.  The agency has three main activities, first, the development of high technology industry in the member state, secondly, construction of applications satellites and thirdly, scientific research. In deciding to join the agency, Ireland took account of all these elements but the primary motivation was the opportunity ESA membership offered for the development of the high technology manufacturing sector in Ireland.</P>
      <P>The &ldquo;just return&rdquo; principle on which the agency operates ensures that Ireland's financial contribution to the agency flows back in the form of industrial contracts for the design and production by Irish firms of space-related components and systems.  Frequently such development is undertaken in collaboration with major international consortia. This has proved to be a very effective means of transferring technology to the Irish companies involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2244" /> The signing, earlier this year, of an agreement with the space agency for the establishment of a high technology space research facility in Cork is the newest and most exciting development yet in terms of Ireland's involvement with the space agency.  This new facility will be set up by the space agency, staffed by ESA personnel, and will involve Ireland in the most advanced, high-technology research and testing carried out by the agency.  This represents a tremendous opportunity for this country to develop expertise in this area.</P>
    <P>Deputy John Bruton was worried about the fact that a White Paper had been promised and has not yet been produced. We have not ruled out the presentation of a White Paper.  However, I am sure he will be happy in the knowledge that the Government are moving ahead in the field of science and technology and are making progress.  One can have all the White Papers in the world &mdash; which may achieve nothing &mdash; but we are acting.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I notice that in the entire speech of the Minister of State who introduced this Estimate, Deputy S. Brennan &mdash; although there is a great deal of sunburstry in his remarks; the whole thing is very up-beat, to use the kind of language one's children use &mdash; there is not a word about the two or three absolutely dominant features on the Irish industrial scene of 1988.  There is not a word in it which would appear to show that the Minister realises there are substantially fewer people working in industry now than there were in 1981 or 1982.  That appears to me to be something that should make him worry.  One would expect the odd word thrown in by any Government to the Dáil on that theme but nothing of the sort appears in the Minister's speech.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The two absolutely topical matters in the industrial arena, which have had a very high profile in the newspapers here over the past ten days, do not seem to have happened in a form which would penetrate the Department across the street under its present leadership.  There is not a word in the Minister's speech <Col N="2245" /> either about the Longford factory closure, which has been making headlines for the past ten days, or about the proposed take-over of Irish Distillers.  I quite appreciate that both of these are matters within the private domin and that the Minister does not have direct, or perhaps any, control over what happens in either of these cases.  Nevertheless, they are both highly relevant to the general industrial outlook, prospects and conditions of this country.  Again, I would have expected that the Minister would show some sign that he and his Department were watching what was going on and were willing to share their thoughts on these subjects &mdash; if they have any &mdash; with the Dáil.</P>
    <P>I do not know the owner of the Longford ambulance factory, nor do I know any of the workforce or about the manufacture of ambulances.  However, I certainly can appreciate that in a relatively small county town of a small not particularly prosperous county the loss of an undertaking like that would be an extremely serious blow, the sort of thing they might expect to encounter perhaps once in a century.  When it happens because of a dispute between the management and workforce, and not because &mdash; as is so often the case &mdash; there is suddenly a slump in the market for their product, not because world trading conditions are difficult it is all the more regrettable.  On the contrary, as far as I understand it, this firm is able to sell as many ambulances as they can turn out. But, for reasons which I am perfectly certain Mr. Hanlon thinks are good &mdash; and, since I am not in a position to dispute them with him, I do not intend to take sides in the matter one way or the other &mdash; he feels he must apply economies on the labour side.  The people in Longford, rightly or wrongly &mdash; it may indeed be wrongly &mdash; are faced with the stark choice of having to accept that those economies will be effected by the man who started and owns the business, or there will be no business there at all.</P>
    <P>As I have said, I do not take sides in the matter and I do not want to have it thought that anything I say here is <Col N="2246" /> intended as a reflection on either side.  It is not but I do think that the whole scene shows something is radically wrong with our whole industrial policy.  While it is not the Government's business directly to take over the factory &mdash; as I know was suggested by our friends on my right who have not troubled to show up for this debate today &mdash; we might have expected a few words in the Minister's speech on the subject.</P>
    <P>Before I leave our absent friends over here &mdash; who are probably out distributing scripts to the media that will get a prominence far above that which the proportion of votes which they harvested would appear to justify; they are very well placed there when it comes to debating in the national Parliament issues in respect of which they have all the answers at the seminars and workshops, they are conspicuous by their absence.  They wanted us to set up a National Development Corporation with a budget of £200 million.  I must say I do not see what that corporation are doing spending even a fraction of that sum that other bodies there for much longer could not do but that was the idea of the geniuses over there.  They are not here when the actual Estimate is being debated; they have better cats to whip somewhere.  Possibly they are promoting measures of social reform.  Possibly they are ascertaining whether there is some way they could stand the Constitution on its head in such a way as to flatter some pluralist crank somewhere, but they are not in here doing what they always pretend to have all the answers about, namely, debating industry and commerce.</P>
    <P>Neither is there any word in the Minister's speech to which I will revert &mdash; there is not a lot of satisfaction in hopping off people who are not there to listen to one &mdash; any more than there is about the Longford factory, about the attempt to take over Irish Distillers.  Again, that is a matter in the private domain.  I do not want to appear to be shifting to the left in saying that the State ought to stick its nose unduly into the operations of private capital but I do think there is something <Col N="2247" /> rather special in regard to the Irish Distillers and I hope that the matter which so easily lends itself to facetiousness or to being treated lightheartedly will not seem to be so when I put it in this perspective.</P>
    <P>Every nation which is trying to do business and sell its products depends very heavily on having a number of products with which it is peculiarly associated. These products must be of the first class, unique and distinctive.  Most European countries which have been much longer in various departments of industry than we have been have a large range of such products &mdash; and I do not need to waste my few minutes by giving examples &mdash; but we have extremely few.  I am afraid that the few we have, so far as industrial techniques can adapt them and apply standards of taste to them which may be presumed to appeal more to outside markets than to objective standards or our own standards, have already somewhat twisted the nature of the product.</P>
    <P>I hope I will not stand on too many corners by mentioning two things which are peculiarly Irish.  One which is produced just outside the frontier of the State, and I have no doubt the workforce includes people who live within the State, is Belleek China, and the other is Waterford Glass.  I must say frankly &mdash; and I am probably one of a very small minority on this as I am on other matters &mdash; that I do not like either of these products.  I simply have no taste either for Belleek China or Waterford Glass.  I am not even very excited at the sight of antique 18th century Waterford Glass, let alone the new stuff.  I will say that the Waterford Glass Company, whatever their achievements &mdash; and they are very considerable achievements indeed in commercial promotion &mdash; have succeeded in producing a certain number of products of surpassing beastliness.  Unquestionably, there are products in the range produced by that factory which would be in the short list for anyone's prize for something which is tasteless and hideous.  That is done not because they are short of taste but it is in response to what they suppose other <Col N="2248" /> people's &mdash; foreign &mdash; standards of taste are going to be.  That is fine in the short run but in the long run it will undermine the prestige which attaches to this product and which the, company concerned have most admirably sustained and built up over the years.</P>
    <P>In 1981 when I was Minister for Trade I was forced to go to New York &mdash; I do not like these long exhausting, being on your best behaviour sort of trips &mdash; by Córas Tráchtála in connection with an Irish trade promotion in the biggest or most famous store in that city.  It was indeed very impressive but in the course of this promotion I passed a production which I was told was one of three made to the order of an Arabian sheikh.  I cannot describe to the House what it was but it was a nightmare in crystal.  It stood about 5 feet tall and occupied a space &mdash; by the time there was a respectful path left around it for the admirers to give it living room &mdash; roughly equivalent to the middle of the floor of this House.  If there had been a poker nearby I believe I would have done that nightmare fountain an injury.  That is the sort of thing that happens when a firm get obsessed by the necessities of marketing, exporting and making anything that will sell.  I am all for doing that at a certain level but when one is dealing with a unique national product one has to apply more restrained standards.</P>
    <P>I am afraid that what I have described as having happened with Waterford Glass &mdash; and I accept that what I am talking about is purely a matter of taste on which others will certainly disagree &mdash; will happen in regard to whiskey.  No one must suppose that a product like whiskey is less valunerable to change and adaptation than a product like Waterford Glass; the opposite is the case.  It is possible over a relatively short period of time radically to change the taste of something of that kind which is difficult to appraise and to which ordinary chemical standards and so forth are not easily applied in such a way as to guarantee a standard product.</P>
    <P>I have at home the remains of a small quantity &mdash; and I have it by accident &mdash; of 1948 Kilbeggan Whiskey.  On very <Col N="2249" /> special occasions I give a friend a nip of this drink and have one myself.  I have to tell the House that although it is not something I should like to spend an evening on it is an extraordinary experience. The taste of a vanished Ireland comes back through that small sip of 1948 Kilbeggan Whiskey.  I am assured by people who are much older than me that in those days all Irish whiskey tasted like that but impalpably and imperceptibly over the years the taste has been changed in response to what people imagine are the wishes and preferences of consumers but in the process something unique has disappeared. A sip of that whiskey brings me back &mdash; and I was not a whiskey drinker in my schooldays &mdash; to the earliest perceptions I have of Ireland, the smell of steam locomotives in Limerick Junction or some now vanished moment that connects in one's mind with a taste or a smell in a way which everyone can recognise instinctively but which naturally does not lend itself to rational explanation.  These things are unique. Irish whiskey, even in the modified, less turf smokey form that it now has, is still a unique Irish product and I am afraid, perhaps even under existing management, but most certainly under the ownership of a foreign company, it will simply be used as a product like any other product to be adapted according to the formula which is calculated to produce the greatest number of sales.  It would be a tragedy to allow that to happen.</P>
    <P>During the 1975 or 1976 distillery strike an awful period ensued during which there was no proper Irish whiskey to be had.  Certainly stuff was sold as Irish whiskey which reminded me of the description given by Myles na gCopaleen to the bootleg which used to be put up by people to fool unsuspecting Northern Ireland visitors during the War, compounded Myles na gCopaleen thought of Portuguese brandy and turps.  It may not have tasted quite like that but it certainly was an exceedingly inferior product.  I should like to know what assurance there is that a product like Irish whiskey can be protected no matter who owns it.  As I said, I believe even the existing ownership <Col N="2250" /> would be capable of making this change but I would suspect it particularly if it passes out of Irish hands.  What can be done to preserve, so far as a taste can be maintained and preserved, a product of that kind which is unique and which will impoverish the world if it disappears?  We ought to have a system, which should perhaps be grounded in statute, whereby a product carrying a certain brand name can be subjected to whatever analysis is possible &mdash; and no doubt it will be possible only in terms of a minute prescription of the recipe according to which it is distilled &mdash; and no product deviating in any single respect such as might be chemically significant from that prescription should be entitled to carry that label.  In other words, it will be free and open to people distilling in Ireland to distill what they like but they must not sell it with a &ldquo;Paddy&rdquo;, &ldquo;Jameson&rdquo; or &ldquo;Powers&rdquo; label.</P>
    <P>I believe that is the right way to treat a national product like whiskey.  It is not simply a matter of selling it in the way Jameson is being very expertly marketed in England now as simply an Irish product. There was a time when branded Irish whiskey was well known all over the world.  When I lived in England I spoke to people who were a lot older than me who told me that before the war at certain levels of English society one would have expected a gentleman to have a bottle of Irish whiskey and a bottle of Scotch for his guests.  I remember reading a very early detective story written about a city of Sydney or Melbourne, I forget which, in the 1880s or 1890s by Fergus Hume &mdash; it is a sort of collectors item &mdash; called &ldquo;The Mystery of a Hansom Cab&rdquo; in which characters offered one another glasses of DWD, which is a long since vanished Dublin whiskey.  It was known in Australia and was spoken and written about by someone who did not have any special point to make in the course of a novel, and a detective novel at that.  That product was known by its name and, presumably, valued for its name.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister &mdash; although I know he is not a serious drinker &mdash; will understand that some of the products which <Col N="2251" /> represent parts of Irish industry are unique and must be subject to some standardisation. They must have some security, whoever owns them, so that they will not be indefinitely tampered with in response to what are assumed to be market preferences.  Naturally that respect for market preferences must exist and I constantly deplore the absence of it in other fields, for example, the inability of the dairy industry apprently to explore with sufficient diligence the wishes of the market when it comes to different varieties of cheese.  We all know that problem.  There are some things which for one reason or another have a certain uniqueness, a peculiarity about them in the Irish setting, and one of those things is whiskey.  We should not be lighthearted about what is happening under our eyes.  I am speaking not merely about the question of the financial control of a large operation but about the stability of a very modest range of Irish products for the loss of which the world will be a great deal the poorer, not least ourselves.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister when replying tell us exactly what his Department do and what is their role?  Will the Minister outline the Department's successes over the past number of years? This year it is claimed that we have had 4½ per cent economic growth.  For the past number of years our inflation rate has been in single figures and is now as low as 2 per cent, which is half the British rate.  We certainly have one of the lowest inflation rates in the developed world. Interest rates have also come down by as much as 6½ per cent, and yet employment has been reduced by only 25,000 in the past year.  I presume the Minister sees the principle role of the Department of Industry and Commerce as being to order things for industry so that there is growth in industry leading to growth in employment. If that is the mission of the Department it is time that this House challenged the way in which the Department do their business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department of Industry and Commerce affect industry directly and <Col N="2252" /> indirectly and the policies of other Ministers can seriously hamper industry.  Over the years the costs of post and telecommunications services for industry have grown steadily to the extent that they have become a burden on industry.  What have the Department of Industry and Commerce done to try to moderate or stop those increase and what are they now doing to reduce postal and telecommunications charges, which are higher here than in many of our competitor countries in the EC and the OECD?  What role have the Department played in relation to transport costs, which are 20 per cent to 30 per cent higher than in the UK?  What role have the Department played in trying to prepare industry for 1992?  Do the Department see themselves as having a role in convincing Government that there must be an effort now to get our transport costs into line by 1992?  Energy costs must also be tackled.</P>
    <P>The cost factors I have outlined relate to Government decisions.  Many of the drawbacks and the penalties on industry have arisen directly from Government decisions, whether Government decisions in the late seventies and early eighties to force the escalation of postal and telecommunications charges or whether by decisions of Government over the last ten to 15 years to escalate the cost of fuel, which greatly adds to transport costs.  Government policies in relation to excise and taxes have greatly increased export and energy costs.  In this year's Budget, for instance, there was a raid on the ESB by the Government seeking £30 million.  That will be reflected in high costs to industry at a time when 250,000 people are unemployed and at least 30,000 people are leaving the country each year.  Where have the Department of Industry and Commerce had an influence?  It seems to me that the Department of Industry and Commerce, whatever their efforts, have not been particularly successful in bringing sense to Government in this area.</P>
    <P>The IDA are the direct responsibility of the Department.  Some years ago from <Col N="2253" /> these benches I challenged the job creation figures of the IDA.  The IDA have always been very good at parading their Minister around the US and elsewhere and they have been good at making excessive claims about job creation.  We have heard them claim that they created 30,000 and 40,000 jobs in a given year only to find at the end of the year that unemployment figures had increased.  I challenged the IDA figures and I was invited to IDA Headquarters by the chief executive and treated to a slide show which Deputy Kelly would have really enjoyed.  They tried to persuade me that 2+2 amounted to 50.  They were creating jobs, but nothing like the number they claimed they were creating.  Mostek in Blanchardstown were supposed to create 2,500 jobs in five years.  Within five years they did not produce 200 jobs; yet the IDA claimed that 2,500 jobs would be created.  Of course, this made the grant per job look relatively small.  What are the IDA doing now?  Are they any longer the most relevant vehicle for job creation? Have they got into a public relations groove in which they are good at selling themselves but are not good at selling Ireland and at getting investment here?  Given what is continuing to happen to employment, where there is a consistent decline in the numbers employed, notwithstanding good indicators like low inflation and good industrial relations generally and lower interest rates, the Minister for Industry and Commerce should tell this House the reason unemployment is so high and why his Department and the agencies under his control have not been more successful in job creation and job maintenance.</P>
    <P>Industrial relations throughout the country are generally good, so it is sad that in this very week in the Minister's own constituency 200 jobs will be lost because of a breakdown in industrial relations.  What happened in Longford despite the best efforts of many people, including the Minister, is that 200 jobs have been lost.  I do not know whether there is still a chance to reverse that decision; if there is, I would appeal to everybody concerned, in circumstances <Col N="2254" /> in which we are losing jobs daily, to think again and to try to come to an agreement to save those jobs.  I will not go into that issue at any length here today.</P>
    <P>I want to deal with the question of jobs because that must be our central occupation and it must also be the central role of the Department of Industry and Commerce.  Jobs depend on selling goods, and selling goods is influenced by a number of things such as price, which we have greatly improved, competitiveness, which is related and which we have also improved but still needs further improvement, marketing and getting our goods to the marketplace.  The Minister has a Minister of State with responsibility for marketing.  I hope that there will be ever-improving standards of marketing of Ireland generally and of the individual products.  The agreement from the EC to allow us set up trading houses is a very significant development.  It is the <i>via media</i> used by Japan to sell their goods so successfully around the world.</P>
    <P>I want to put to the Minister &mdash; I put it before in this House on other relevant Estimates &mdash; the idea of a transport trading house in Europe.  One of the major problems we have as a country is that we are an island off an island off the mainland of Europe.  Our industry, therefore, is at a major disadvantage in having direct access to the market compared to, say, continental and even British industry because of the short sea haul across the Channel, and even that will be gone in a few years time when the Channel tunnel is built.  Getting goods to the marketplace of Europe can be a major problem especially if there is inclement weather over a prolonged period, which can happen every winter and sometimes in the summer or, if there are strikes or go slows just as we had a few weeks ago in Britain.</P>
    <P>If we are to make the most of the opportunities of 1992 in relation to supplying the market there is a major case for a national Irish distribution centre on the north west coast of the Continent of Europe.  In this I would see a major warehousing and distribution facility where Irish lorries, with Irish crews, <Col N="2255" /> could base themselves in continental Europe and have the catering, overnight, office, photocopying, telecommunications, translation and garage facilities, and thereby would not be at a major disadvantage, and Irish industry could forward advance goods which could be sent on to the marketplace.  This is relevant both from an export and from a transport point of view because the market of Europe with 320 million people &mdash; even 1 per cent of the transport aspect of that market &mdash; could employ some thousands of Irish drivers.  We have plenty of qualified drivers.  I would ask the Minister with the Minister for Tourism and Transport to engage in urgent discussions with CTT and with the transport industry &mdash; the Irish Road Haulage Association etc. &mdash; to advance the idea of a major national Irish distribution and warehousing centre on the north-west coast of Europe as a bridgehead to make major inroads into the markets of Europe and as a major bridgehead to create thousands of Irish transport jobs based on the Continent of Europe.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The point must be made in relation to this debate on Industry and Commerce that jobs and job creation, as a topic, is very rarely discussed in this House.  Despite the fact that unemployment is still close to the 250,000 mark and emigration from the State is in the region of 30,000 per year and has been at that level for at least the past five or six years, the question of how job creation can be approached is rarely dealt with as a major topic of debate in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as The Workers' Party are concerned the industrial and economic policies of successive Governments have been hopelessly inadequate to deal with the type of growth which is needed in this economy.  It is not that no growth has occurred; indeed, the output of manufacturing industry has increased by nearly 50 per cent since the start of the eighties. The problem is that in the same period, over 40,000 manufacturing jobs were lost, industrial employment dropped by <Col N="2256" /> nearly 20 per cent and employment growth is our primary need.  A few years ago the right wing consensus was that competitiveness was the key to growth in jobs.  There was a substantial slow down of wage and other labour costs relative to our major trading partners but the promised growth in employment still did not materialise and now the right wing consensus has shifted its attention elsewhere. The latest dogma is getting at the national debt by cutting public expenditure. There is no doubt that we agree that labour costs must be kept within reason but in the context of planned development and the control of all incomes and costs.  Yes, the national debt must be reduced and kept under control but primarily through the expansion of both output and employment.  However, none of these things will happen without a clear break from the ineffective and hugely expensive policies of the past and of the present.</P>
    <P>At present Irish industry is getting £900 million in tax breaks per year and another £400 million in direct subsidies and grants.  The various fiscal incentives encourage the use of capital rather than labour and the result is that employment is still contracting and exports are booming &mdash; exports of goods, services and increasingly, of course, our own people. Nor should we have any illusions about the notion of reducing the national debt through cuts in public expenditure.  The frenzied hacking and axing of recent times consists, for the most part, of utterly false economies which, apart from creating more misery and poverty in the short term, will lead to much higher and increasingly uncontrollable costs to the State in the future.  The cuts in health services are a case in point.</P>
    <P>The same arguments apply broadly in the case of privatisation of other services, hitherto provided by the State.  Ultimately, the cost of providing local authority services, health services and social services by private rather than public enterprise is bound to escalate uncontrollably simply because there can be no real control in a private enterprise econmy over the hunger for profit.  Publicly <Col N="2257" /> owned companies have not been without flaws but these, in my view, will pale into insignificance for Irish society by comparison with those created by private companies in their relentless pursuit of private profit.  The difficulties for public enterprise in Ireland have been well trumpeted by its opponents but the fact is that any enterprise has difficulties in the present situation.  Historically, public enterprise has been more successful in more difficult sectors of the economy than private enterprise has been in more favourable circumstances.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer briefly to a number of other specific areas.  I would like to refer to the question of the Irish Distillers takeover which is being proposed at present.  I would welcome the Minister's proposal to refer any such takeover to the Director of Fair Trading.  Given the enormous implications of the proposed takeover, it is essential that every aspect of it be considered in full and the Director of Fair Trading is the person most appropriate to undertake that task.</P>
    <P>The interests of Irish Distillers' 1,100 employees must be a crucial factor in determining whether the takeover should be allowed to proceed.  In this context talks by those behind the takeover bid on rationalisation plans seem ominous.  This is unique as the bid involves not simply the takeover of an individual firm but of, in effect, an entire industry.  There must be concern at the prospect of such an important industry passing out of direct Irish control and the implications this would have for the future development of the Irish distilling industry.  It is ironic that this bid should be made for an important Irish industry by foreign interests when so much Irish capital which could and should be invested to create jobs at home is going out of the country for investment abroad.</P>
    <P>I want to deal with the Hanlon closure. The decision by Mr. Noel Hanlon to close his ambulance plant with the loss of almost 200 jobs is despicable and will cause untold hardship in that area.  This is a case of one individual putting his own interests before those of almost 200 <Col N="2258" /> workers and their families and the welfare of the entire community in Longford. Mr. Hanlon has displayed what can only be described as a Victorian attitude to management and industrial relations since this dispute started and is apparently now prepared to deliver an economically crippling blow to the town of Longford by robbing almost 200 workers of their jobs.  It is astonishing that somebody who has displayed these attitudes should have been considered suitable by a previous Fianna Fáil Administration for appointment as Chairman of Fóir Teoranta and the board of Aer Lingus. Securing replacement jobs must now be a priority for the Government and the IDA.</P>

      <P>There are Standing Orders and orders which have established themselves by tradition.  The Deputy will appreciate that in fair play you do not attack somebody who is not in a position to defend himself or herself. If the Deputy does not accept that that is a fair, decent and honest standard to have, I do not know how I can convince him further.  Personally I think it only fair that anybody who is under attack outside should have an opportunity to defend himself.  Similarly, we in this House should not attack anybody who is not in a position to respond to the attack being made.</P>

      <P>I do not accept your interpretation of the tradition of the House, perhaps because I am not as long here and as engrossed in the tradition as you are.  I take from what you have said that there is not a specific Standing Order which I have breached; therefore, I will continue with my contribution.</P>
      <P>Securing replacement jobs must now be a priority for the Government and the IDA.  The <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> referred specifically to the job creation potential of the automative components and mechanical engineering sectors. A number of companies including Aer Lingus, Bord Na Móna and CIE have considerable expertise in these areas and consideration should now be given to taking the Longford plant into public ownership and ensuring that the experience and expertise developed by the Hanlon workers is not lost to the country. There must also now be full disclosure of all the financial assistance paid to the Hanlon company by the IDA or other State agencies over the years and the Government have a duty to the taxpayers to ensure that this money is recovered in full.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I make these points.  Because of limited time I am not in a position to go further <Col N="2262" /> into the question but before I sit down I want to refer to Dublin North-West, which you and I, Sir, have the honour to represent.  As you and I am sure, the Minister knows there is a very high level of unemployment in that area.  Indeed, in some parts there is 60 per cent unemployment and in many cases it is young people who are unemployed.  Many young people have emigrated to Britain, Australia and the United States.  I raised questions yesterday about some of my constituents who have gone to the US, unfortunately without visas, and it appears that they are being exploited there more than they were at home.</P>
    <P>In the Ballymun area a task force has been established, consisting of local residents, public representatives, corporation officials, representatives of the health board and others interested, in an effort to come to grips with the problem of deprivation, social decay and dereliction in the area.  In the course of a report, that task force suggested a number of measures to upgrade the environment and improve the services in the area.  One of the main conclusions of the report was the need to tackle the problem of jobs if there is to be any improvement in the area.  I should like to urge the Minister to request the IDA, and the other job creating and training agencies under his jurisdiction, to consider declaring Ballymun and Finglas priority areas. If that is not possible he should select districts where unemployment is serious for the location of major industries.  I am not thinking in terms of industries and that would provide two or three jobs, although they would be welcome, but if we are to tackle the problems of Dublin North-West we need industries that will provide a big number of jobs.  If that does not happen the efforts of local people and agencies to deal with the problems of dereliction and social decay will come to nothing and we will have to face greater problems in the future.</P>

      <P>Many questions have been put to me by those who contributed <Col N="2263" /> to the debate but it will not be possible to deal with all of them.  I should like to ask the last speaker to listen attentively to what I have to say in regard to the grants paid to the Longford firm.  The total amount of grants paid to N. Hanlon (Ireland) Limited since the industry was set up was £336,663.  There was a total employment peak in that industry of 280. If the Deputy takes the employment figure at 280 or 230 he can calculate the cost per job.  At 230 employees the cost per job was £14,063.  That matter was referred to in the Telesis Report, a review of industrial policy.  The industry was referred to as one that was very suitable for Ireland.  I hope that information takes away some of the unnecessary attention paid to this matter by the Deputy, the Leader of The Workers' Party who do not have a branch in the constituency of Longford/Westmeath.  I find it unusual that the Deputy is taking such an interest in that matter.  Most Members are aware of the facts but for some unknown reason The Workers' Party are anxious to paint a picture that is at variance with the facts. I hope the Deputy will take that information with him.  The suggestion has been made that a fortune was paid out in grants.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy tables questions between now and the end of term I will be only too delighted to answer them.  I should like to remind the House, in response to the query about Irish Distillers, that I have a statutory responsibility in relation to any mergers or takeovers where a turnover of £10 million and assets of £5 million are involved. Notification was given to my Department two evenings ago.  It is very extensive and I will be examining it in the normal way before deciding whether to refer the matter to the examiner under the Mergers and Monopolies Control Act, 1978. It would be inappropriate for me to comment any further on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Kelly referred to the traditional and unique taste of Irish whiskey and was worried about that being changed.  I am not an expert on that and I cannot comment with any authority on the question.  However, I imagine that companies will only change their tastes or presentations having undertaken long and detailed market research.  If they did not do so on that basis they would be very foolish because it would not take a customer long to reject the product.  I agree that there is a certain uniqueness about many Irish food products.  In fact, many of the old tastes are coming back <Col N="2265" /> in high quality products and there will always be a place for them.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cullen stressed the need for co-ordination on industrial policy.  I should like to tell him that there is a committee in existence representing the Department and the agencies under it. The committee meet on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis to discuss issues which arise from time to time, and they co-ordinate industrial policy.  I have also established a small industries forum which gives small industries an input on industrial policy as it concerns small businesses and small industries.  That is a good forum and we get the views of the real world.</P>
    <P>I should like to remind the House that I have made changes in the system of paying industrial grants for those employing from one person to 15 people.  We removed all the red tape and pay on a job-in-place basis, half of the grant when people are employed and the other half six months later.  I am referring to small companies that do not have great growth potential but have a certain contribution to make to economic development.  A grant of £5,000 is involved.  In spite of all the speeches I have made there is still a misconception about grants.  No longer do the IDA pay grants on job approvals. They pay grants on jobs created.  Grants are paid if there is compliance with performance agreements.  The old system has been changed and we are rigidly adhering to the terms of the new scheme.</P>
    <P>Some Members hold the view that manufacturing industry is the sole component that will solve our unemployment problem.  Other speakers have made this general point.  I would like to point out that manufacturing industry is one single component in contributing to job creation. In manufacturing employment, the services industry, including international services, and other industries have their own inputs.  In the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> we identified the areas where we saw growth and we put targets on jobs in those areas which are not under the remit of the Minister for Industry and Commerce but they will make their own <Col N="2266" /> individual contributions towards the solution to the major problem facing this country which is unemployment.</P>
    <P>I would remind Deputy Jim Mitchell that the upwards spiral in unemployment has been halted and levels are now at their lowest for 19 months.  He asked what is the role of the Department of Industry and Commerce.  It would take longer than the short time that I have available to me to point out the role.  The lead role is taken by the Department of Industry and Commerce, and I am sure was taken by my predecessors in Government, in firstly identifying what decisions will impact on industry, on industrial development and the costs that will appertain to any decisions.  The Deputy also asked what have we to show. We have taken that lead role in many areas.  We constantly remind everybody that the return to a competitive cost environment is the first prerequisite for economic development and recovery.</P>
    <P>What have we achieved in that regard? The rate of inflation is now at its lowest for 20 years.  Interest rates have fallen by up to 6½ per cent since we came into office.  The total borrowing in the business sector is over £6 billion.  Every 1 per cent reduction in interest rates means a saving of £60 million.  The reduction of 6½ per cent in interest rates represents relief to the entire business sector of £390 million.  The manufacturing sector has borrowed £1.6 billion.  Every 1 per cent drop in interest rates represents £16 million to that sector.  That is an immediate relief of £104 million to the manufacturing industry.  One can quite clearly see the huge impact that the reduction in interest rates can have on the cost environment of manufacturing industry. I did not, and would not, apologise for reducing IDA grants because I have always believed that to produce a better cost environment would provide the Government or the Minister of the day with the opportunity of putting away grants and that is the policy we are pursuing.</P>
    <P>I have always taken a leading role in focusing Government attention on other <Col N="2267" /> input costs which are not my responsibility. Benefits can flow from them such as the creation of a cost-competitive environment.  Deputy Mitchell asked what we had achieved since we came into office.  There were no increases in postal and telecommunications charges or in electricity charges in 1987.  There was a 5 per cent reduction in electricity charges to industrial users in the budget this year. Later this year reductions will be made in international telephone charges.  That is what we have achieved in that area of cost environment.  All areas make their own contributions to a better cost environment. That is the only way we will stop job losses on the one hand and create a better climate for investment on the other hand.</P>
    <P>Irish exporters to the British market will now enjoy an inflation rate of less than 2 per cent, almost half of that in Britain.  I cannot remember when the Irish inflation rate was below the British inflation rate to that extent.  We also dealt with rationalisation of State agencies and bringing them together in a more costeffective way.  The merger of the NBST with the IIRS is one area which represents part of the whole industrial cost that Deputies referred to.  Those two bodies were brought together so that there would be a better co-ordinated approach to industrial development. Above all we will get better value for the money spent.</P>
    <P>The area of exports has been dealt with by my colleague, Deputy Séamus Brennan.  As I have said, we reached record levels in 1987 and expect to export approximately £12 billion worth in 1988. There are other people-related industries such as the software industry referred to by Deputy John Bruton which will be major contributors to employment in that area in the years ahead.  I would remind Deputy Bruton that there was open tendering for the physical infrastructural development of the Financial Services Centre and that was dealt with by the Department of the Environment.  The taxation area which the Deputy talked about is dealt with by the Department of <Col N="2268" /> Finance.  That project is another one of the people-related industries.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton asked why continue to give money to the National Micro Electronics Centre while at the same time allowing the National Software Centre to close down.  As he said, the IDA decided to close it down.  I was fully appraised of the situation and if my approval was needed it would have been forthcoming. They were given a period of time during which their prospects would be evaluated and they were not successful.  I can assure the Deputy and the House that no gap will be left in the development of software in the future.  One of the new trading houses that was set up markets our software abroad.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The suggestion that the Irish industry should not be involved in electronics hardware is misconceived and false.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not what I said. I said there is a discrepancy in the Government's policy of getting out of software.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>There is not.  The decisions in relation to the National Software Centre and the Micro Electronics Centre were very clear-cut and did not demand my approval.  Had I been asked I would have totally approved of that decision and I have made that clear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was stated that Irish industry should not be involved in electronics hardware. Micro electronics technology goes far beyond computers.  For instance, integrated circuits are used in products as diverse as telephones and sophisticated production systems in industry.  The National Micro Electronics Centre is <Col N="2269" /> geared towards the whole computer industry.  Research and development relevant to the needs of Irish industry has been extremely successful.  Much work has been done on a contract basis and it brings in quite a considerable amount of income.  It is a necessary part of the infrastructure as I and the Government see it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>But the National Software Centre is not a necessary part of the infrastructure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course it is, but it is a question of how it is operated.  The Deputy has not done any great study into the development of software because if he had he would not be saying things like that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has not explained it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has explained that the National Software Centre was closed for obvious reasons and that there will not be a gap as a result of its closure.  The National Micro Electronics Centre is an essential part of the infrastructure and it is being helped along the way.  It is continually expanding into the area of commercial contracts and will continue to do so.  As long as it is successful we will continue to support it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of stock markets for smaller companies was raised.  Deputy Bruton took initiatives in that regard when he was Minister and I am following them up.  Considerable progress has been made in the past year in enhancing the role of the stock market as a fund raising vehicle for small firms and quite a number of them have availed of it.  Seven companies were listed in the small companies market as of December 1987 compared with one at the end of 1986.  Despite the slowdown caused by the October crash in world financial markets the momentum is expected to be maintained this year. Many of these companies are in the business expansion scheme and the continued progress being made by that scheme will ensure that more and more companies <Col N="2270" /> will be looking to the Stock Exchange for additional growth.</P>
    <P>At my request the Stock Exchange and the IDA are currently drawing up a joint programme to promote the exchange as a vehicle for industrial development.  They will, as part of that programme, focus on the company preparations necessary to ease the cost of obtaining a quotation.  I am sure the Deputy and the House will be aware that we are trying to put together a package that will reduce the cost for small companies going on the market.  It will be a package involving the accountancy functions, legal functions and so on.  The Stock Exchange recently produced a booklet giving full information to facilitate small companies which might be thinking about going on the Stock Exchange.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cullen said the Department of Industry and Commerce should be the instigator of policies.  We are.  The policy function which had been undertaken by other agencies has been returned to the Department in recent years and the policies are being written and directed&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I said it was beginning to go in that direction and I hoped it would continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to misrepresent the Deputy.  Lacking marketing ability in Irish companies is a major weakness and has been identified as such for a long time.  The special trading houses will make a fairly decent contribution for the companies which do not have the financial strength or the marketing expertise to get their products on the international markets and hold their position there.  Now they can do what they are good at, and that is produce.  We have been production-oriented for far too long and this new initiative will provide the initiatives for small and medium-sized companies to continue in the areas of product development, improving efficiency and leaving the marketing to experts in the trading houses area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Mitchell asked what is the real focus of an improved investment climate <Col N="2271" /> and how do we go about it.  The Government do not create jobs.  The Department of Industry and Commerce do not create jobs.  We are continuing to focus on an improved investment climate and a better cost environment.  However, there are still other areas to be tackled.  Deputy Mitchell mentioned the cost of petrol and oil.  I tackled these problems earlier this year.  The cost of distribution in this area is very expensive because of the makeup of the Irish market.  My colleague, the Minister for Energy, is looking at that now.</P>
    <P>The cost of insurance has been the subject of much debate during the passage of the Courts Bill, the Final Stages of which will be debated in this House next week.  If both Houses pass this Bill before July, it will remove juries in personal injury cases from 31 July 1988 and reduce legal costs appertaining to claims on a personal injury basis.  That will make its own contribution and we will ensure that the cost reductions are reflected in the insurance industry because insurance is a major cost factor in employers' liability and in public liability.</P>
    <P>Training grants have been reduced to 50 per cent in the expansion area&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Why not have 50 per cent overall?  Why have any 100 per cent grants for anyone?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Training is being directed more at management and other areas where there is a major weakness and there is an ongoing evaluation as to what other changes will be made during the year.  Developing policy is an evolving matter.  This is one of the areas which is under close examination at the moment. As I said, we have already reduced the grants to 50 per cent in the expansion area and we will continue to look at different aspects as we evolve policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Durkan asked why I do not give more details in the House about the location of industry.  It is an accepted fact that the location of industry is a matter for the day-to-day functioning of the IDA.  It is not my intention to get <Col N="2272" /> involved in locating industry.  At different times in this House Deputy De Rossa and Deputy Mac Giolla asked what was my role in relation to the location or relocation of private companies.  I do not have any function, good, bad or indifferent, as to where private companies locate or relocate.</P>
    <P>The closure in Longford was a disaster and a calamity for industry in County Longford.  It creates a bad image not alone in Longford but nationally, and will wipe out the good image which has been built up for this country abroad.  It is a matter of regret that it should ever have happened.  As Deputy for the area, I spared no effort in trying to find a basis for a resumption of work.  There has been a problem in this industry for the past 18 months or two years, despite the fact that the industry enjoyed industrial peace for 18 years and managed to gain 60 per cent of the British market.  This was an industry nobody thought could succeed and it is a matter of regret for everyone in this House that that black spot should occur in our industrial development at this juncture.  As I said, no effort was spared to try to resolve the problem and get a resumption of work but, unfortunately, we were not successful.  This will not help the image of this country or the image of Longford.  It is a tragedy for a very good workforce and their families, because they will feel the brunt of it in the long term.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree to look at the criteria used by his Department in ruling out or refusing to answer questions on the IDA?  I understand that at the moment his Department freely provide information at Question Time about the activities of SFADCo, but when it comes to the IDA, virtually everything we ask is considered to be a matter for the IDA and not for the Minister.  Perhaps he would agree to look at this because it is very difficult to raise legitimate policy questions about industrial development in certain circumstances when the questions are not being answered on the grounds of lack of responsibility.</P>
