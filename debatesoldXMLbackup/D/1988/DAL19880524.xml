      <P>asked the Taoiseach the guidelines which have been laid down for Ministers and Ministers of State to declare their financial interests and, where appropriate, the financial interests of their close relatives; if any such declarations have been made by any Minister or Minister of State; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Ministers or Ministers of State are informed on taking office of the general principle that they should not engage in any activities that could reasonably be regarded as interfering or being incompatible with the duties of their offices.  Ministers are required to draw the attention of the Government to any matter before Government in which they or their family have a material interest, and not to participate in decision-making in the matter unless the Government decide otherwise.  These guidelines have been applied by successive Administrations over a long number of years and continue to apply.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach the way in which he intends to respond to the comments made by the leader of the Official Unionist Party in a report (details supplied) in which he indicated that he would welcome an exchange of views with the Government; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 and 3 together.</P>
      <P>As I stated last weekend, I greatly welcome the positive response of the Official Unionist leader, Mr. Molyneaux, and his interest in exploratory discussions at an intermediate level and I hope we can proceed fairly rapidly with these arrangements.</P>
      <P>I will be glad to inform the House as soon as I have anything further to report on this whole issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Has a formal invitation been issued at this stage to Mr. Molyneaux or to any other Unionist leader? Secondly, have the Government made a decision that these talks should commence?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No formal invitation has been issued.  The policy of the Government is enunciated by me on these matters from time to time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>Press reports have indicated that the Taoiseach's response is likely to be in public.  Is that so, and when is it likely to take place?  Secondly, Mr. Molyneaux indicated that he would be prepared to meet the Taoiseach in certain circumstances.  Has the Taoiseach any idea of what these circumstances are in which Mr. Molyneaux would be prepared to met him?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is stretching things a little to ask me to say what Mr. Mollyneaux has in his mind.  The Deputy should accept that there is a very definite possibility for dialogue and I would hope that that would be warmly welcomed on all sides.  It is my intention to progress this matter as sensitively and with as much understanding as possible.  As I have said, I will be happy to report to the House as soon as I have anything specific to report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Taoiseach that I would welcome any possibilities of dialogue taking place with the Unionists. I certainly would regard it as a major breakthrough if the possibility we are now discussing here is actually brought to fruition.  Following on the Taoiseach's reply to my supplementary question, may I ask him further if it is his intention to issue a formal invitation?  Surely, even though the Taoiseach obviously can do as he wishes in his office, a formal Government decision should be recorded?  If we are going to formalise any possibility of an invitation or otherwise, surely that would require a formal Government decision?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I would not think so.  I think that would be most unusual. If the issuing of a formal invitation would appear to me to be helpful at any stage, I would immediately issue one.  I would acknowledge the fact that Deputy Spring some considerable time ago made a suggestion for progress along the lines that are now taking place.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>Following on my <Col N="2172" /> last question, if one of the circumstances in which Mr. Molyneaux would be prepared to meet the Taoiseach were that it would be for the discussion of a new agreement within the context of Northern Ireland, would the Taoiseach be prepared to go ahead with discussions on that basis?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The duties of the aide-de-camp to the Taoiseach by long practice and precedent are to attend with him, when required, at certain formal functions and to represent him on ceremonial and other occasions, such as funeral ceremonies, when it is not possible for the Taoiseach to be present personally.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach tell the House if in recent times the aide-de-camp is being used not just for ceremonial and formal occasions but for every fair and crossroads occasion in the country?  Will the Taoiseach tell the House what this has cost the State?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach (a) the terms of reference (b) the remuneration paid to and (c) the status of the special projects manager at his Department to whom reference is regularly made in media reports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The officer in question is on secondment from the Industrial Development Authority to advise and assist from his specialised industrial development background on projects likely to give extra employment particularly those arising across the semi-State sector and those involving more than one Department.  He retains the same salary, conditions of employment and status as apply to a divisional manager with the Industrial Development Authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach tell the House if this projects manager recently received a project with regard to an underground development in O'Connell Street, Dublin?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Would that sort of development where a local authority is involved come under the aegis of this projects manager, and is local democracy being bypassed?  What are the functions of this projects manager?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should not worry about things like that.  First, he is not a projects manager but a person given to me on loan by the IDA because we recognise the need to help progress certain projects which cross departmental lines and demarcation and also because <Col N="2174" /> there is a view in the Central Review Committee on the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> that something more should be done to help to co-ordinate the efforts of the semi-State sector.  As the Deputy may know, individual semi-State companies are responsible to individual Ministers but situations arise where individual semi-State companies should co-operate with each other and to that extent they cross departmental lines of responsibility. It seemed to a lot of people to be desirable that somebody should have a general role of co-ordinating the efforts of the semi-State sector where development projects and the creation of employment opportunities may be concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the Taoiseach's assurance that the O'Connell Street development has not been considered by this projects manager.  Is the Taoiseach aware that the press reports on this matter said that it had been considered and will he agree that this projects manager, or whatever the title is, does not have a role in local authority development?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The project is one which comes entirely within the ambit of the local authority, but if it were a question of some desirable project which happened to have the potential to create employment impinging on the area of responsibility of a State company and a local authority and perhaps a Government Department, then I would visualise this officer, now attached to my Department, as having a role to try to co-ordinate the efforts of those concerned.  The situation with regard to employment is urgent enough to demand that we neglect no opportunity to provide employment. If something can be achieved by helping to co-ordinate the activities of different agencies of Government in the provision of employment that is entirely desirable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will make a report on his <Col N="2175" /> discussions on 18 May 1988 with representatives of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions regarding the implementation of the job creation commitments in the <i>Programme for National Recovery;</i> the number of additional jobs which have been created under the programme; if any new initiatives are planned following his talks with Congress; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Joint Government/ICTU statement that issued following on the meeting Ministers and I had with representatives of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions on 18 May summarises the discussions that took place.  This statement is available in the Oireachtas Library.  A detailed statement on the progress made under the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> in achieving the targets for job creation and the major policy initiatives which the Government have taken since the programme was published is now being prepared in accordance with the agreement reached at the meeting.  I will arrange that copies of this statement are made available in the Oireachtas Library when it is published in a few days.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the 20,000 jobs mentioned in the programme and in the statements before and after the meeting by Congress, can I take it that the 20,000 extra jobs means 20,000 jobs above job losses?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is 20,000 new jobs. It is not and never has been stated to be a net increase of 20,000 jobs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the point I wished to clarify, because the understanding was that &ldquo;extra jobs&rdquo; were different to &ldquo;new jobs&rdquo; and since 20,000 new jobs was not referred to but 20,000 extra jobs thought it meant over and above job losses.  Is the Taoiseach saying there will be no net increase in jobs since January this year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not saying that at <Col N="2176" /> all.  What we are committed to and what we planned to achieve in the programme is the provision of 20,000 extra or new jobs this year in different sectors of the economy.  If there are no job losses there will be a net increase of 20,000 jobs but if there are job losses they will have to be set off against the 20,000.  The important thing is, and the ambition of the programme is, to bring about the creation of 20,000 new jobs this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>When was the last time during which there were no job losses?  It will not be difficult for the Taoiseach to estimate the number of job losses in any area, taking the last decade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am trying to illustrate to the Deputy exactly what was agreed in the programme with the social partners. What was agreed was that we would make our best endeavours to create 20,000 new job opportunities in this year, and that is what has been done.  There will probably be job losses, but what the programme speaks about and seeks to attain is 20,000 extra new jobs this year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach indicate whether any percentage of that 20,000 has so far been created?  Have 1,000 or 5,000 jobs been created?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>A considerable number have been created but the important thing from the Deputy's point of view is that the different agencies concerned, the IDA and so on, are confident that the 20,000 will be reached this year.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept that figure but that is not the point.

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach not agree that it is unfair to create false expectations in talking about 20,000 new jobs being created when the reality is that the number of jobs is declining?  A great number of young people and old people are looking for hope and it is unfair to them for the Taoiseach to talk about 20,000 new jobs being created which are not going to materialise&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The programme from the beginning made it absolutely clear what its target was and that was to provide conditions and circumstances in which 20,000 new jobs would come on stream.

      <P>As I mentioned previously in the House, the Tourism Task Force was established by the Government specifically to advise on how the additional £4 million provided in the 1988 budget should be allocated so as to obtain an increase in tourism numbers and revenue in 1988 in line with the targets set out in the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i></P>
      <P>On 3 March 1988, the Government approved a series of recommendations from the task force for a special £4 million programme of measures for 1988 as follows:</P>
      <P>A National &ldquo;Write and Invite&rdquo; campaign.</P>
      <P>A new campaign directed at the special interest holiday segments of our main markets making extensive use of specialist tour operators and journalists in special interest magazines and publications.  Bord Fáilte have targeted angling, golf, equestrian, cycling, walking, religious, cultural-heritage-language, incentive-conference, cruising and senior citizens.</P>
      <P>New campaigns in North America and Australia-Japan concentrating on back-track traffic from Europe and Britain.</P>
      <P>Special campaigns in Continental Europe and Britain.</P>
      <P>A special Entrepreneurial Tourism Fund to assist innovative tourism projects designed to increase visitor traffic in 1988;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2182" /> A Conference Ambassador Scheme aimed at attracting increased international conference business.</P>
    <P>This programme of measures is already being implemented by Bord Fáilte and I am confident that it will lead to a substantial increase in overseas visitors in 1988 and afterwards.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I am replying to the Deputy's question which, in fact, relates primarily to the national cultural institutions which are under the general aegis of the Department of the Taoiseach.</P>
      <P>Cultural tourism has been identified in the recent Price Waterhouse report on <i>Improving the Performance of Irish Tourism</i> as an area with major growth potential. In order to develop this potential, the Minister of State at my Department, Deputy Denis Lyons, in the context of the Interdepartmental Policy Co-ordination Committee on Tourism has been holding discussions with relevant interests.</P>
      <P>A development programme is now in place to promote this sector.  National lottery funds have been allocated to renovate and upgrade facilities in our major cultural institutions, including the National Museum, the National Gallery and National Library.  The Heraldic Museum at 2-3 Kildare Street has been opened to the public.  There has also been significant investment in arts centres throughout the country in order to further extend the tourism infrastructure. The question of the improvement of genealogical services for tourists is also being examined.</P>
      <P>Allied to these works, a major effort is being made by individual cultural institutions to encourage more visitors by ensuring that institutions are included in itineraries drawn up by tour operators. Tour operators are being encouraged to develop tours based on our cultural heritage. Aer Lingus have already launched such a series of tours in the United States.</P>

      <P>CIE, with my support and encouragement, have been endeavouring to develop spin-off industries, based on their engineering resources and expertise, in the interest of the organisation as a whole and of developing employment opportunities.  While the possibilities for CIE engaging in general engineering work for other organisations here are limited at present &mdash; because there is a very substantial capacity for this type of work already available in the market &mdash; the board are continuing their efforts to develop industrial activity on portion of their Inchicore site.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy that there is a great reservoir of engineering skills at Inchicore.  Comparatively recently in similar circumstances in Denmark, as was outlined in the economic survey of Denmark, Mr. Kennedy, now a director of the ESRI, indicated that in Denmark many young people working in these engineering works have set up their own private engineering ventures.  It was pointed out that the vast majority of the increases in industrial production in that country arose from that kind of innovative and entrepreneurial spirit engendered in the larger works there.  I do not see any reason that the deployment of the vast reservoir of skills that exists in Inchicore would not result in the same kind of entrepreneurial activity here.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that there is a general perception that our transport costs, and in particular road haulage costs, are higher than those which apply in Northern Ireland although it is not possible to quantify accurately the extent of the differentiation.  Many of the key factors involved in the composition of both access and internal transport costs, such as fuel prices, insurance costs and port and sea freight charges, lie outside the scope of my remit as Minister for Tourism and Transport.  As regards those elements within my area of responsibility, I should like to emphasise that my on-going policy of securing increased competition and efficiency in the various sectors of the transport market in respect of both national and international operations is aimed at providing a more effective service for transport users at the lowest possible cost.  Substantial benefits have already come from that policy, particularly in relation to access transport by sea and air.</P>
      <P>In order to allow my Department to look critically at the whole question of relative costs in the road haulage industry, the hauliers' trade associations have recently been asked to provide data on which an accurate and realistic examination could be made of comparable costs affecting road haulage in the Republic of Ireland, Northern Ireland and elsewhere in Europe.  Those data are awaited.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Tourism and Transport if his Department have calculated what constitutes an economic air fare on all internal and cross-Channel routes; if he has satisfied himself <Col N="2191" /> that Aer Lingus are not applying uneconomic fares in an effort to undermine opposition from independent airlines; and if he has not so satisfied himself, the proposals he has to protect the principle of fair competition and the future of independent airlines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is no doubt aware one of the priorities outlined in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> is the development of the Irish tourist industry with a view to creating an extra 25,000 jobs and attracting an additional £500 million of foreign tourist revenue during the five year period of the programme. With this objective, I have encouraged Irish airlines to charge the lowest possible fares consistent with economic operation.</P>
      <P>In examining applications for approval of air fares, I am obliged under EC law to take into consideration a wide range of criteria, including the costs of the applicant airline, the needs of consumers, the need for a satisfactory return on capital, the competitive market situation, including the fares of other airlines operating on the route, and the need to prevent predatory practices.  However, and here I quote directly from the relevant EC Directive: &ldquo;the fact that a proposed air fare is lower than that offered by another carrier on the same route shall not be sufficient reason for withholding approval&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The range of fares offered by any airline on any of its routes is primarily a matter for that airline to decide by reference to its own costs, the demands of the market and the general competitive environment, within the parameters laid down by the EC Directive to which I have already referred.  It would be inappropriate for my Department arbitrarily to fix specific fare levels in respect of any particular route because the economics of individual airline operations vary considerably in accordance with the flexibility which carriers have in terms of pricing, frequency of operations and class of service offered.  In any event, I do not <Col N="2192" /> consider that current market circumstances warrant any measures of an interventionist or protectionist nature. Indeed, as we have seen down the years, such measures stifle rather than encourage competition.</P>
    <P>It need hardly be said that Aer Lingus fares applications are dealt with on exactly the same basis as those of other Irish carriers and on that basis I am entirely satisfied that the competitive situation is both equitable and healthy. Since coming into office as Minister for Tourism and Transport I have given every encouragement and support to the development of competition in the air transport field.  In particular, I have encouraged independent Irish airlines to become more involved in servicing routes to and from Ireland by giving them access to a large number of international routes. The development of such competition has contributed to the development and expansion of the Irish air transport industry through the advent of lower air fares and I am particularly anxious to ensure that this situation should continue, since low air fares, particularly for tourists visiting Ireland, represent a critical element in the Government's strategy for the accelerated development of the tourism industry.</P>
    <P>In relation to the principle of fair competition, rightly emphasised by Deputy Deasy in his question, I would refer him to my previous reply on this subject on 23 February 1988.  As I said then, I regard competition as very important.  I have already assured the Deputy that I would step in, within the powers I have, if there was any indication that competition was being eliminated.</P>
    <P>As to the future of independent airlines, I intend to continue to encourage them in the interests of fostering more services, greater competition and lower fares.  I see no reason independent airlines should not flourish in the new climate we are creating both here and in Europe.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Tourism and Transport the estimated number of persons using the DART system in Dublin; if any estimate has been done of the savings arising from the greater use of DART in terms of reduced traffic congestion and travelling time saved by commuters; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1987 the DART system was used by approximately 15.367 million passengers.  On the basis of experience for the early part of 1988, Iarnród Éireann expect carryings for the full year to be about 16.2 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am informed by the company that a survey carried out in 1986 showed that approximately 1,500 fewer cars were entering the city centre in the morning peak period as a result of DART.  The survey also indicated that the average time saving for those using the DART <Col N="2195" /> system was 8 minutes per passenger journey.</P>
    <P>I should like to see many more motorists leaving their cars at home and availing of the public transport services, rail and road, to improve the traffic environment in the city and its environs particularly during the peak periods.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that in view of the very good results achieved by Iarnród Éireann in developing the DART that there is a real need for him to reconsider his decision of October 1987 with regard to the non-development of the DART system in the rest of Dublin?  Has he any proposals in that regard?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>With my hand on my heart I can say I would love to be in a position to apply the DART system elsewhere, particularly in the areas that this House and all the citizenry know about.  It is simply a question of not having any money to do so.  Last October's decisions were taken in the light of that when we told CIE to formulate their plans on the basis of the use of diesel on existing rail tracks and road services.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>How does the Minister reconcile that with the fact that Dublin City Council are proposing to spend an estimated £20.5 million per kilometre to develop and complete the inner tangent road?  Is it not an option to curtail road building and invest in public rail transport? Alternatively, could the Minister tell us if moneys are available through the EC funds for this kind of development?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The moneys mentioned by the Deputy would be peanuts compared with the cost of another series of DART projects in the city.  I was a member of the Government that decided on the DART project and there was great discussion and debate about it at the time.  We got very little encouragement from any source but it was the right thing to do and it is serving its purpose.  I would love to <Col N="2196" /> be in a position to extend this system, but I am not and I cannot.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot do that although I did see at some stage what each passenger cost.  In fairness, it must be said that the capital cost, interest rates and so on were being charged to that account.  What Deputy McCartan mentioned a moment ago is relevant in that the cost of the permanent way is not taken into account when comparisons are being made between the cost of travelling on DART and travelling by bus so that the comparisons are not appropriate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">

      <P>The cost of car hire in Ireland is high relative to some European countries and the US.  This is due primarily to our higher levels of insurance premia and excise duties.</P>
      <P>The Courts Bill, 1986, which provides for the abolition of juries in personal injury cases, is currently before the House and should be enacted by the end of July.  The Bill should result in reduced legal costs and greater consistency in awards which should ultimately be reflected in lower premia to the car hire sector and thus lower rental costs to the tourist.  We must keep an eye on that to make sure it happens.</P>
      <P>The current state of the public finances precludes a lowering of excise rates on cars for the time being.</P>
      <P>However, lower access fares, lower inflation rates and improved competitiveness in the pricing of our accommodation product have helped to keep the overall cost of motoring holiday packages in Ireland competitive with other tourist destinations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has <Col N="2200" /> acknowledged that car rental costs are high here in comparison to other countries. Given that access costs are coming down, particularly air fares to this country, would he not agree that there is an opportunity to encourage fly-drive holidays, which are popular elsewhere, and that one of the factors preventing that kind of development is car rental costs.  If car rental costs were cheaper it would obviously enable people who arrive by air to visit the regions and would encourage the sale of other tourist products as well.  This is a very important matter which deserves to be seriously addressed by the Minister.  Apart from relying on the improvements that would be brought about by reducing insurance costs, are there not other measures which he could take to reduce the high cost of car rental?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree fully with the Deputy that the costs are very high. Before the application of VAT we are the most expensive of 12 counties &mdash; Canada, the US and ten European countries; after the application of VAT we are number three after France and Italy.  I can tell the House that the Government have made a decision to give vouchers to US visitors worth $150 in this regard.  The details of the scheme have not been worked out as yet, but as over 50 per cent of the people who rent cars when on holiday here are from the US, this should have an impact and should help in some way to offset the disadvantage that the US visitors have because of the weakening dollar.</P>

In relation to reducing the high car rental costs and the reliance which the Minister is putting on insurance costs to bring down VAT in line with other countries, has he considered a deferment of the payment of duty on cars &mdash; which is very substantial in this country &mdash; until the car companies are replacing their fleet?  Would the Government not consider deferring the duty payment until such time as the cars are being sold?</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Tourism and Transport if his approval has been sought by Aer Lingus to acquire shares in any other European, foreign or domestic airline; if so, if he will grant approval; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 17 and 31 together.  I have no plans for private participation in the Aer Lingus Group or plans to permit a joint venture between Aer Lingus and any other airline privately owned or otherwise which would affect the ownership or shareholding of the company.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, Aer Lingus as part of their normal day-to-day operations participate in joint venture operations with other airlines involving, <i>inter alia,</i> leasing and maintenance contracts. Such participation is a matter entirely for the company and my approval is not required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a radically changing regulatory environment, Aer Lingus are constantly reviewing the possibilities for joint ventures and co-operation with other airlines on a shareholding basis.  The company have recently announced the formation of a joint venture with Securicor to develop the rapidly expanding door to <Col N="2202" /> door delivery business in Ireland, Britain and the Continent.  They are also contemplating taking up a minority shareholding in a small UK regional carrier.  I am not, however, for reasons of commercial confidentiality, in a position to give any further details at this stage but I can say that I have no objection in principle to what is proposed.</P>
    <P>I am aware that Aer Lingus are also exploring the possibility of taking up a shareholding in a foreign-based airline, but again for reasons of commercial confidentiality and since the whole matter is at a very early stage, it would not be appropriate for me to give any further details.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said that his permission is not necessary in regard to Aer Lingus participating in joint venture operations with other airlines.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is expanding beyond the terms of my reply.  I said that Aer Lingus, as part of their normal day to day operations, participate in joint ventures and that my approval is not required.  However, I am a shareholder and my permission would be required for major decisions.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister enlighten us on his attitude to the possibility of encouraging Aer Lingus to seek joint partnerships along the lines of SAS in relation to the three Scandinavian countries?  In the light of developments in Europe, does he foresee a situation where there is a multinational airline within which Aer Lingus can participate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a major policy decision.  I am aware that the Austrian airlines have sold 90 per cent of the State shareholding and that the SAS share ownership of the Norway, Sweden and Denmark share.  However, I have not made any request along those lines and I do not see any possibility in that regard <Col N="2203" /> in the near future.  I realise that we are entering a different phase in European transport.  British Airways bought Caledonian and they are starting a very aggressive transatlantic marketing programme. We must be subtle and keep our minds as open as possible in relation to all events.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Tourism and Transport arising out of the complete liberalisation of road transport in the EC by 1992, the plans he has to eliminate the competitive disadvantages of the Irish road haulage sector; if he will consider setting up a major Irish distribution centre in a suitable location in north-western continental Europe where Irish industry could warehouse goods in advance and have telecommunications, translation, office, garaging, sleeping, changing, canteen and recreational facilities for Irish road crews adjacent to ferry and air services; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>While a number of recent studies have concluded that Irish hauliers <Col N="2204" /> operate under a cost disadvantage, particularly in relation to Northern Ireland hauliers, the actual extent of that disadvantage is in some doubt at present, since these studies did not appear to compare like with like.  In order to assess accurately the level of cost disadvantage, my Department have recently asked the haulage industry to provide data on their members' costs on which a more precise comparison can be based.  While my room for manoeuvre may be limited, I shall keep the matter under careful review in the light of the outcome of this latest comparison.</P>
      <P>While the concept of a major Irish distribution centre on continental Europe is an interesting idea, I have no evidence that any demand exists among Irish operators for such a facility, not that it would give a return to the Irish economy commensurate with the costs of establishing and running such a centre.  I cannot envisage a situation, in the light of present policy on public expenditure, in which the Government could directly fund the costs of such a facility.  Indeed, if the industry felt that such a centre were essential to the development of their business activities, I would expect that they themselves would take the initiative in this regard.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that, as we are an island off an island off the continent of Europe, we are at a major disadvantage in terms of access to, and distance from the market, which is susceptible not only to stress but also to climate?  In the light of that and acknowledging the restrictions on the public finances, will the Minister take the initiative to see if the industry could come together, under the aegis of a form of trading house, to explore the idea of an Irish distribution centre on the north west coast of the continent?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be delighted if the various people involved &mdash; exporters and hauliers &mdash; came together and my Department would give them every encouragement to do so.  The fact that we are an island off an island does not <Col N="2205" /> necessarily mean that we cannot compete. Japan has to export its goods a very long way and it competes very successfully in Europe.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Energy (Mr. R. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take the four questions together.  The leak of plutonium nitrate which occurred on Sunday last was reported to my Department under an agreed, informal arrangement.  On the basis of the information available no radiation was released to the atmosphere on this occasion.</P>
      <P>As regards the serious allegations of breaches of safety at Sellafield, this is a matter of grave concern and, on my instructions, officials of my Department have been in contact with the British Ministry seeking clarification.  In addition, officials of the Nuclear Energy Board have been in contact with the British Nuclear Inspectorate expressing our concern and emphasising the need for an early report.  If these allegations are true, they serve to strengthen Ireland's case to have Sellafield closed.</P>

      <Col N="2207" /> As I have indicated, I intend to pursue every opportunity to secure the closure of nuclear plants in the United Kingdom as soon as possible.

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that all options for the closure of this menace off our east coast are being considered. For example, for the meeting of the Paris Commission to be held in Lisbon in mid-June I submitted, in early May, two resolutions for consideration once again calling for the closure of Sellafield, as we did last year and, secondly, asking for a report on the progress of the resolution regarding best available technology which was passed last year. With regard to the question of legal action, the Deputy will be aware that we have intervened in the Cattenom case in the European Court of Justice.  That was the first time that an Irish Government moved away from the purely political arena to the courts.  That action was taken under Article 37 of the EURATOM Treaty.  The Irish legal case was made in mid-April and my understanding is that a ruling will be handed down in mid-July or August.</P>

There are a number of Ministers involved, the Ministers for the Marine and the Environment, but I <Col N="2208" /> should like to know if the Minister for Energy would consider it useful, if not imperative, to call for the establishment of a special sub-committee of the Intergovernmental Conference to deal with this problem so that the <i>ad hoc</i> arrangements and responses can be replaced with a more permanent and, therefore, more effective system to deal with this problem?</P>

We are in constant contact with our British opposite numbers.  It is more an East-West matter than a North-South one.</P>

I should like to ask the Minister if the assurances, by which he seems to have been consoled, from the British authorities, having emanated from sources that are deeply suspect in the light of last week's revelations, are no longer of the highest integrity and need to be looked upon with deep suspicion because there is a deficiency in the procedures and practices in the work place at Sellafield.</P>

The matter will be raised at the Paris Commission meeting in Lisbon in mid-June. The Deputy seems to have misunderstood what I said in relation to legal action because it is not a question of when we will take legal action; we have taken action in relation to this issue.  The Government are anxious to get the European Commission to play a more active role in relation to the appointment of an independent inspectorate.  That is the basis of the case under Article 37 that is being pursued in Europe and on which we should have a ruling in July or August. The suggestion of establishing a committee under the Anglo-Irish Agreement is something I will consider.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Collins) Gerard Collins">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 5, to delete lines 32 and 33, and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;&lsquo;waiting area&rsquo; means an area&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2311" /> (a)  that is set aside as a waiting area in a restaurant for the purposes only of accommodating persons waiting to enter the dining area of the restaurant for the purpose of consuming a meal, and</P>
    <P>(b)  whose floor area does not exceed 20 per cent. of the floor area of the dining area of the restaurant.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This amendment makes two changes in the definition of &ldquo;waiting area&rdquo; from that in the Bill as initiated.  As suggested by Deputy Barrett, I have ensured that waiting areas can only be used by persons waiting for a meal.  I accept that under the original definition there was a chance that these areas could be used for some other purposes.  I have written into the definition the maximum floor area that a waiting area can have in relation to the dining area.  At 20 per cent, this will ensure that restaurants cannot build waiting areas which are out of proportion to the area of the dining area.  This could have turned waiting areas into large lounge-type rooms where persons could drink at length before a table in the perhaps smaller dining room would become available.  One effect is that if a restaurant has a waiting area which is more than 20 per cent of the dining area drink cannot be supplied or consumed in it.</P>
    <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>

      <P>I should like to hear the Minister's comments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I pointed out to the House on Committee State that the intention of section 8 (1) is that the applicant for a special restaurant licence must show to the satisfaction of the Circuit Court that a Bord Fáilte certificate in respect of the <Col N="2312" /> restaurant is in force.  It would be inappropriate that any provision as to the content of a certificate should be included in section 8 (1).  I note that under the Deputy's amendment the map or plan would merely show the area of the restaurant concerned but would not apparently show the disposition of the accommodation.  The Deputy's amendment states that the area will be delineated. I presume this would already have been done before the issue of the certificate. The waiting area and the dining area of the restaurant will be the only areas in which liquor can be sold and consumed.  The maximum floor area of the waiting area in relation to the dining area is now given in the definition of &ldquo;waiting room&rdquo; and the maximum accommodation which the restaurant as a whole can contain can be provided for in the standard regulations.  Any provision requiring the attaching of a plan to the Bord Fáilte certificate would be a matter to be examined by the Minister for Tourism and Transport in preparing the restaurant standard regulations and would not be appropriate for specific mention in this Bill.</P>

      <P>I originally tabled this amendment on Committee Stage to tighten up on possible abuses.  I am pleased the Minister in his amendment accepted the principle which I enunciated, that abuses could take place in relation to the special restaurant licences.  Whereas we are all anxious that genuine, bona fide restaurants will be able to serve drink to a person, none of us would want to see abuses creeping in as a result of this new legislation.  I am quite satisfied that the Minister has accepted the principle of my original amendment by way of Government amendment No. 1.  For that reason I do not think there is any great necessity to proceed with amendment No. 2.</P>

I think, Sir, I am in order in raising it at this point because we are on the area of definitions.  Is the Minister in a position to clarify the point which he said he would examine on Committee Stage, because I do not see any specific reference to it in his own amendments?</P>
      <P>I am aware we are on Report Stage and that I am limited in the number of times I may speak.  I think, if I am correct, I can only speak once on any particular item.  I would put it to the Minister&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am only anxious to make a point which Deputy Quinn made last day, and I am surprised he has not made it again &mdash; perhaps he has been satisfied about it in the meantime &mdash; that is that the restriction on the waiting area, with which I absolutely agree, will not at the same time be so interpreted as to prevent the restaurant owner from putting into <Col N="2314" /> that area whatever decor he chooses and from adopting whatever mode he wishes of serving drink during the waiting period, and even if it should be a bar of the sort which might look more like a dressing table or something like that, with buttoned imitation leather and chrome buttons in the glass and so forth, I hope it will not be seen as in breach of the law which generally prohibits them from having a bar on their premises.  I really think the Minister might give a very simple answer to that in a couple of words, because the two of us have raised this a number of times today and the last day.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">

      <P>There is no specific amendment dealing with this particular point.  I want to refer briefly, if I am in order, to assurances I gave Deputy Kelly on at least two occassions during the course of Committee Stage.  The Minister for Tourism and Transport who will be involved in the making of regulations in this area has no intention whatsoever of dictating to any special licence holder on the decor or on the number of drinks &mdash; another part of the same question raised by Deputy Kelly &mdash; to be served on the premises.  It will not be a bar, and this is clearly laid out in the definition; it is a waiting area where drinks will be served. People may have whatever drinks they want but it will not be a bar.</P>

The Deputy, in whose name the amendment appears, will move it, make his or her contribution and then everybody else, including the Minister, will speak once.  Then, the move of the amendment will conclude, but when the Deputy in whose name the amendment <Col N="2315" /> appears has concluded we take that to mean what it says and that there will be no more contributions.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 6, line 32, after &ldquo;satisfied&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;including <i>inter alia</i> by annual inspection&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I understood that the Minister was amenable to this amendment the last day and I thought he would bring forward something himself.  I just want to make it quite clear in the legislation, that an annual inspection should take place &mdash; bearing in mind that we are talking about special restaurant licences &mdash; before Bord Fáilte would be in a position to issue the appropriate certificate, which in effect is the real means of obtaining a special restaurant licence.  The official responsible should have the opportunity of actually inspecting the premises and seeing that they accord with the principles laid down in the legislation and with the regulations to be made by the Minister for Tourism and Transport.</P>
      <P>I do not see an amendment from the Minister dealing with this point and I am more than anxious to see to it that the legislation makes it quite clear that Bord Fáilte will be obliged to carry out an annual inspection.  Indeed, as I said the last day, the taxpayer should not be expected to fund the cost of such an inspection, which should be built into the regulations.  We should make certain that whatever cost falls on Bord Fáilte to provide this service should be borne by those seeking the licence.  I would assume that a standard charge would be appropriate because an inspector would be covering an area and would not be visiting just one premises.  Inspections would be carried out in the course of inspecting a number of premises in the area and I assume a standard charge should apply.  I am anxious that we should make it quite clear that in order to obtain a certificate from Bord Fáilte, an inspection must be carried out whether it be an initial inspection or an inspection for renewal purposes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the thrust of Deputy Barrett's amendment.  While he is right when he says it is not referred to specifically in the Bill, it is not necessary to refer specifically to this in the Bill.</P>
      <P>First, I will deal with the fees charged to the applicant.  That will be covered in the regulations, and as the Deputy knows, at his own request and that of Deputy Colley, the regulations will come before the House for discussion before they are actually in operation.  That will be covered by regulations.</P>
      <P>Of course, there will have to be an inspection and this will be part of the responsibility of Bord Fáilte, and as a result of an inspection of the applicant's premises, they would then make a decision as to whether the premises should be licensed.  We do not intend that there could be only one inspection in the year, which could be interpreted from Deputy Seán Barrett's amendment because it only provides for one annual inspection, but I am satisfied that it could happen that in some cases Bord Fáilte would want to inspect a particular premises more than once a year.  This would be referred to in the regulations and it is more appropriate that it be covered by regulations than in the Bill proper.</P>
      <P>There is no difference in intention between us.  We both want to achieve the same thing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>When I saw this amendment I thought there should be an &ldquo;s&rdquo; after the word &ldquo;inspection&rdquo; because I think the premises should be subject to inspections by, for example, the local authority, the health board, and to see that they comply with fire regulations. The normal procedure is that most publicans and hoteliers, who hold licences, are inspected annually and sometimes twice, as the inspector may have to come back to be satisfied that the recommendations made by the local authority and the health board have been carried out.  In the case of Bord Fáilte I expect that the same criteria will apply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnneMarieColley" hpid="Miss Colley Miss Colley">
      <NameTxt>Miss Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the thrust of this amendment.  It could not be construed, <Col N="2317" /> in its present form, to limit the inspection numbers to one per year.  It sets an annual inspection as the minimum inspection rate but I take the Minister at his word that it is intended that there should be more than one inspection.  To include a phrase such as &ldquo;including <i>inter alia</i> by annual inspection&rdquo; sets out for Bord Fáilte that that is to be part of the process.  It is worthwhile putting it into the legislation because it does not just deal with one aspect of the granting of these licences, it covers many of the conditions that will be involved.  An annual inspection will ensure on a number of fronts that the regulations and the legislation are being adhered to.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy Barrett's amendment.  It is a useful base line to have in the legislation.  It lays a statutory duty to carry out a minimum inspection of once a year, on each premises operating.  I would be more concerned that in the climate of cutback in resources, there would be an inclination on the part of Bord Fáilte to visit premises less frequently than annually.  The Minister hopes that inspection would be on an annual basis.  The principle should be written into the Bill and it would be a matter for regulations to build on that principle and to expand on it if necessary. I am concerned that as resources become scarcer the longer the present Government continue in office, there will be a greater likelihood that there will be no inspections at all because of the absence either of staff or finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T. Fitzpatrick Mr. T. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>One fear I have about this legislation in general &mdash; I think I can state it on this amendment &mdash; is that the extension of the licensing provisions to restaurants and, as a result, the vast increase in the number of restaurants looking for licences will lead to a lowering of the standards of restaurants.  Instead of doing the tourist business good, as is intended, it could very well damage it. We are very good at making provisions, especially in relation to licensing laws, that they will be tightened up, that certain <Col N="2318" /> things will be done and that severe penalties will be imposed but as time goes on the enforcement of these regulations becomes more lax until we reach the point where they virtually disappear. Unless we ensure that inspections are carried out, as is provided for in this amendment, or that objections are made at the annual licensing District Court, the standard of restaurants will become dangerously low.</P>
      <P>We are also very good at providing regulations that cannot be enforced.  Just as I came into the House a discussion was taking place on the waiting area.  I do not think it will be more difficult to control or to monitor any other area than this one. How are the authorities to know whether people who are having a drink in the waiting area will ever get as far as the eating area?  If the gardaí come in and find them sitting there, they will go and have a hearty meal but if the gardaí do not appear they might feel they do not want a meal and will just go about their business.  Maybe there is provision elsewhere in the Bill for dealing with that matter.  I am wholeheartedly in favour of Deputy Barrett's provision about inspections in so far as they will go some of the way to ensuring that the law dealing with the licensing of restaurants for the full service of drink will not be abused.  I believe it will be grossly abused.</P>

This amendment is built into a section which deals with application for Circuit Court certificates.  That section specifies procedure for applying initially for a licence and for the renewal of licences.  It will not do the legislation any harm if we make it quite clear that this House wants to see an annual inspection being carried out, just as an initial inspection will have to be carried out before the Bord Fáilte certificate will be granted. That does not prevent Bord Fáilte in any <Col N="2319" /> way from carrying out any other inspections at any other time during the year. Section 13 makes provision for the cancellation of a Bord Fáilte certificate.  I am quite certain that if such a serious step were to be taken as to cancel a Bord Fáilte certificate the very minimum that would be required is that somebody from Bord Fáilte would visit the premises.  It is worthwhile to make it quite clear in the section dealing with the application for Circuit Court certificates that we want an annual inspection carried out.  I think all parties in the House appear to be in agreement on that.  I ask the Minister to accept this amendment which is worthwhile.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 7, between lines 10 and 11, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(5)  If, in any case, the Board refuses to grant a Bord Fáilte Certificate it shall as soon as may be, by notice in writing, inform the person who applied for the Certificate of the refusal and of the reasons therefore.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Taylor had an amendment on Committee Stage which would have allowed an appeal to the District Court against refusal by Bord Fáilte to grant a certificate.  For reasons explained by myself and other Deputies, particularly <Col N="2320" /> Deputies Kelly and Ahern, I could not accept the amendment.  However, it would be desirable that where Bord Fáilte refuse to grant a certificate they should give full particulars in writing to the unsuccessful applicant of the reasons for such a refusal.  In that way the applicant would be left in no doubt as to what he would have to do before making a fresh application.  This amendment proposes accordingly.</P>
    <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 7, between lines 10 and 11, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(5)  In the event of a refusal by the Board, of any application for a Bord Fáilte Certificate to grant the said certificate, an appeal against that decision by the Board shall lie and the suit of the applicant to the Circuit Court.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>On Committee Stage my amendment said that in the event of a refusal of an application for a Bord Fáilte certificate an appeal would lie at the suit of the applicant to the District Court and that amendment was debated.  I have thought about it very carefully and, if anything, my view is reinforced that an appeal on this issue is essential.  As I indicated at that time, the reality of what is involved is that an inspector appointed by Bord Fáilte will carry out the inspection and on him, and on him alone, will rest a very important decision, possibly involving the livelihood of many people.  I am given to understand that if certain restaurants do not get the special certificate, they will have to close because they will not be in a position to compete with nearby restaurants which have this licence.  I was told that by a person who runs a restaurant. That is reality.  The granting of this certificate will make a very big difference to the restaurant trade, we all know that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are decisions of fact involved here.  The inspector will be an employee of a semi-State body.  There could be <Col N="2321" /> some bias involved.  He might not like the politics of the person running the restaurant.  He may have a personal view about the particular restaurant, or his standards may be exceptionally high or exceptionally difficult.  He may decide, in his view, that the restaurant does not measure up.  It is fair enough that any person should have a view on whether a restaurant measures up to his standards, but let us look at some of the matters of fact.  An inspector will have to determine whether the restaurant provides a high standard of catering, for example.  This is an area where the standard might slip one day and not on another, and one person might have one standard of catering, while another person would take another view.</P>
    <P>Another criterion is that the restaurant is well furnished.  The inspector might take the view that the restaurant is not well furnished but the owner might take the view that it is well furnished and that he should get the special restaurant licence.  Will such an important decision be taken by a civil servant and that will be the end of the matter so far as the applicant is concerned?</P>
    <P>Admittedly, under the Minister's amendment, for which I am grateful and which goes some way towards resolving the matter, but not far enough, the inspector is now obligated to give the reasons for his refusal.  If minor matters only are involved, that might be of help, but there could be major matters involved.  It could be that the furnishings in the restaurant do not measure up to the inspector's standards and he will not recommend that Bord Fáilte grant the special restaurant licence.  Trying to measure up to the inspector's standards might involve the restaurant owner in considerable expenditure, which he might not be able to meet.  The reality might be that while the restaurant owner would maintain &mdash; and others might agree with him &mdash; that his restaurant had reached the required standard, there would be nothing he could do about the inspector's refusal to grant the licence and his livelihood could be at risk.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2322" /> Issues of fact are a person's appreciation of whether furnishings are of sufficiently high standard, whether the staff are competent, whether the restaurant is comfortable and so on.</P>
    <P>Issues of fact are determined by tribunals and courts every day of the week and can be appealed, and very often their decisions are overturned.  District Justices, for example, hear evidence on matters of fact and come to a decision, doing the best they can in the circumstances, but very often their decisions are appealed to the Circuit Court where a rehearing takes place and evidence of fact is given again.  It is by no means unusual that the Circuit Court judge takes an entirely different view of the facts and overturns the decision of the lower court. The same may apply when a Circuit Court decision is appealed to the High Court.</P>
    <P>Yet we are saying here that this inspector's findings of fact, possibly determining a person's livelihood, are special and that no appeals tribunal, be it the District Court or the Circuit Court, could possibly hold, for whatever reason, well intentioned or otherwise, that he formed a wrong view on those facts.  It is entirely unjust that so important a decision should rest on the decision, which cannot be appealed, of one civil servant.  This matter is far too important to leave in his hands, and in his hands alone.  As I said, this could mean the difference between a person's livelihood and the loss of his livelihood because the requirements put forward by the inspector could be beyond the financial means of the applicant.</P>
    <P>In the interests of justice it is essential on this issue, as it is on virtually all other issues of importance, that an appeals procedure should be provided.  I would prefer the appeals procedure to be the District Court, as it was in my amendment on Committee Stage but I understand that, according to Standing Orders, I cannot table my Report Stage amendment in the same form.  That is why I put in the Circuit Court, the court given the function under section 8 of dealing with the application.  I believe it would be wrong to leave the matter solely in the <Col N="2323" /> hands of one person who might get it wrong on some occasions with disastrous consequences for many people.</P>
    <P>I ask the House to accept this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I was always under the impression that anybody had the right to appeal a decision.  The Minister might brief me on this point, since I am not in the legal profession.</P>
      <P>Being in the licensed trade, I am fully aware of what we are discussing today &mdash; the granting of facilities to sell intoxicating liquor in properly conducted restaurants approved by Bord Fáilte.  Is Deputy Taylor talking about fast food joints, fish and chip shops or take-aways? There are standards laid down for the selling of intoxicating liquor in the ordinary public house and in hotels, and these standards must be adhered to.  We are subject to regulations from health boards, local authorities and fire laws. Meath County Council get reports every two or three months on the number of inspections carried out on licensed premises, the number of prosecutions, if necessary, the stipulations in regard to these inspections and so on.  We must adhere to certain standards.</P>
      <P>It is nonsense to state that the granting of a licence will depend on the humour or the behaviour of some inspector who visits a restaurant or a public house and that if they do not meet his standards, their licence will be taken from them.  Let us call a spade a spade and deal with the matter we are discussing, which is the granting of special licences to restaurants which have reached a specific standard.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>As on Committee Stage, I support in principle the thrust of Deputy Taylor's amendment and hope that the Minister will see the fairness of it and the reasons behind it.  The Workers' Party support it if for no reason other than that, in all areas of licensing in the vintners' restaurant trade or industry, recourse to the courts is used.  It is in part employed in the Bill itself in terms of the original application for a licence.  In all <Col N="2324" /> other areas of law where applications for licences are considered, for example, for guns, public service vehicles, betting shops, in which a superintendent of the Garda Síochána has a function and duty at first stage, appeal is universally available for review of the decision of that officer, as an administrator, to the District Court.  That is so for the very fundamental constitutional reason that, in all areas of administrative law, there must be fairness of procedure.  I put it to the Minister that it is a constitutional requirement that may well raise its head in the context of this Bill if this issue is not addressed.</P>
      <P>The absence of the right of appeal to, or review by, a higher authority of the initial decision by An Bord Fáilte may well smack of administrative unfairness and have constitutional implications.  I should like to hear whether the Minister or his officials have considered this aspect, particularly where that decision when taken, even on the best founded reasons and best information, results in or amounts to the denial of some proprietorial or property right.  That aspect has been touched upon by Deputy Taylor.  The effective absence of this certificate will lead to a restaurant owner not being able to get a special restaurant licence.  That will have very strong repercussions on the trade.  This is undeniable and that fact can be established without difficulty.  For that reason this is an amendment that should be supported.</P>
      <P>Like Deputy Taylor, I would much prefer if recourse were to the District Court which is the quickest, most effective and least costly arena.  That cannot be achieved by Deputy Taylor in his amendment but I would invite the Minister, if he accepts it as being necessary or desirable, when the Bill goes to the Seanad to consider bringing the amendment back in the original form suggested by Deputy Taylor on Committee Stage.</P>

I do not accept the fears <Col N="2325" /> expressed by Deputy Taylor that an individual could have a grudge against an applicant, perhaps for political reasons. I cannot see a letter being sent out from Bord Fáilte refusing a certificate because the applicant is a member of the Fine Gael Party or Fianna Fáil Party.  As was stated on the last occasion, there are certain functions which have to be entrusted to qualified professional people.  It would be dangerous to insinuate that there are people employed in bodies such as Bord Fáilte who would be vindictive to the extent of not granting a certificate, thereby depriving the applicant of a special restaurant licence.  I think it was Deputy Kelly who mentioned on the last occasion that with every certificate refused there will be an appeal now to the Circuit Court.  A fish and chipper, for which it was never intended to grant a special restaurant licence, on receipt of a refusal will appeal now to the Circuit Court.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;to judge the situation. With the greatest respect to the Judiciary, if we ask a Circuit Court judge to make a decision, will he leave his court to examine the premises and say, for example, that the decision of Bord Fáilte was correct, that the chair cushions are too hard or whatever?  That is not the function of the Judiciary.  They are there to do a different job.  Professional people are employed by Bord Fáilte.  It can be built into the regulations, if so wished, that there is a right of a senior official to visit the premises if the inspector has produced a negative report.  That is happening at the moment in other areas.</P>
      <P>When grants were still available, others had the experience that when an application was made an inspector might decide that, for example, the windows were not in need of replacement and the person would not be entitled to the grant. I have come across a case where three inspectors were sent to visit the premises as a result of an appeal, right up to the senior inspector.  I do not know if a judge sitting in the Circuit Court or the District Court would be any better qualified to take such a decision.  It is a dangerous principle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would go along with the Minister's amendment because it would be obligatory to state the reasons for a refusal. That goes down in writing and gives people the right to pursue the matter when what is stated in writing is not accurate. Once the reasons are put down in writing, any responsible agency, be it Bord Fáilte or a similar State body, would be very careful about making a negative decision on an application of this type. Let us not clog up the courts even further with appeals against refusal of a special restaurant licence to the Circuit Court and eventually to the Supreme Court.  We are always complaining that the courts cannot deal with the present workload and now we are asking them to take on a further burden when there are other <Col N="2327" /> qualified people quite capable of doing the job.  My experience is that such people do the job in a fair fashion and adhere to legislation and regulations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with every word I heard Deputy Barrett say and for the reasons which he gave.  I just want to add a few more general reflections here.  No modern State could possibly operate if a judicial element, in the strict sense of the word, were injected into Government to administer a function at every stage. There is no more difficult area in law than the demarcation between what is a judicial and what is an administrative function and this is something which will always chafe.  There will always be a friction at the edges at these two plates, if I may draw an image from geology.  There is always that difficulty of deciding on which side of the line a particular function falls.  It is easy to be wrong about these matters, but I would have no doubt that the entrusting of this function to a purely administrative authority without an appeal to a judicial body is perfectly constitutional. I have no misgivings about this but I would have misgivings about the opposite because, as Deputy Barrett says, it would make impossible the work of the board and of any other board saddled with a system like that.  It would slow it up and would likely result in bad decisions.  As Deputy Barrett says, it should be an honest official trying to achieve decent standards in an area in which he has some technical understanding.  I would far sooner trust a person such as this to get a decent level of restaurant service, than a District Court justice or a Circuit Court judge who might be as honest as the day is long but might not know anything about the problems of hygiene in the kitchen.  One could not expect a judge to know anything about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is nothing in the legislation to prevent somebody who has been shot down by Bord Fáilte from putting right the things of which the board complained and applying again the following week.  I also have no doubt &mdash; I see the Minister <Col N="2328" /> nodding his head and I hope he will continue to nod &mdash; when I say that this amendment with which I agree, and which he has promoted, will not inhibit the board from communicating privately and informally with the applicant before any formal decision is made either to issue or to refuse a certificate, telling the man or woman what is wrong and what needs to be put right before the application can be formally adjudicated upon. My misgivings relate to Bord Fáilte and I do not mean to offend anyone in Bord Fáilte when I say that far from the standards imposed by Bord Fáilte being too severe, if there is a fault at all it is on the other side.  I am not alleging that is so but certainly I see establishments with which I have had some passing acquaintence listed in the hotel guide as having three stars or four stars and I would not give them three stars.  I am not conscious of having specially noticed failings in the opposite direction.  I appreciate Deputy Taylor's anxieties for fair play and justice in putting this amendment down but I would ask him to consider whether if the principle he is arguing for here were applied across the board in administrative areas, the government of the country would be any longer possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the same amendment as the one rejected by this House on Committee Stage except that &ldquo;Circuit Court&rdquo; has now been substituted for &ldquo;District Court&rdquo;.  The same arguments apply here as applied on Committee Stage.  Deputy Taylor's amendment does not appear to relate to an appeal on legal grounds to the court but rather seems to envisage that there should be an appeal to the court in relation to a finding by Bord Fáilte as to whether the restaurant in question complied with the requisite standards.  A provision of this kind would probably have the effect that there would be an appeal in every case to the Circuit Court against the refusal by the board to grant a certificate.  This would mean that the Circuit Court would become an inspecting body in such cases, so as to decide whether the restaurant in question was equipped to provide a high standard <Col N="2329" /> of catering or whatever.  This would not be an appropriate function for the court. It is clearly a matter that should be left for decision by Bord Fáilte on the basis of the professional expertise available to them.</P>
      <P>Most Members of the House would agree that amendment No. 4 goes a long way in meeting the problem here in that the board have to tell applicants what has gone wrong with an application and why an applicant was not successful.  There is a lot of merit in what Deputy Kelly said that during the course of consideration of the application the Bord Fáilte representative, before he reports back to the board, would advise the applicant on what should be put right to ensure that the application is successful.  It is not fair for anybody in this House to make the sort of case that Deputy Taylor has made, that this one civil servant from Bord Fáilte would go anywhere to meet an intending applicant and if he were in bad humour or had a grudge against a person or type of person, or if there was political bias, it would affect the outcome of the application.  I do not accept that.  It is not left in the hands of one civil servant or one inspector in Bord Fáilte.  It is a decision by Bord Fáilte and it is a grave responsibility. It is not good enough to knock this by saying that there may be one man with a grudge or in a bad mood or who is politically biased.  I do not accept that at all.  These are very professional people who will not be dictated to by petty humours, moods or grudges.  They will do a job for which they are well trained.</P>

      <P>I intervene to pose a few questions rather than to come down strongly on one side or the other.  Deputy Lynch said that regulations were regulations and that they were clear for everybody to see, but it is the interpretation of regulations with which we are dealing here, the interpretation as to whether the regulations have measured up.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T. Fitzpatrick Mr. T. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>The case that someone for political reasons would <Col N="2330" /> come down on one side or the other was not seriously made.  However, we must bear in mind that we are dealing with human nature and that one person can come down on one side and another can come down equally heavy on the other side.  There is no group of professional or quasi-professional people in this country who differ so much or who are assessed so differently by the general public with whom they come into contact as health inspectors.  Even Deputy Lynch would agree that some health inspectors are so utterly unreasonable as to be unbelievable. Deputy Kelly says that because the judge is not a cook, a chef or a head chambermaid he is not in a position to judge.  A judge hears cases every day about aeroplanes, Swiss watches, medical negligence and so on.  He is not an authority on any of those things but he can hear evidence.</P>
      <P>I agree it will be the exception rather than the rule to deny a person who has been refused a certificate the right of appeal to some judicial tribunal.  Fools rush in where angels fear to thread and far be it for me to contradict Deputy John Kelly, not as a constitutional lawyer but as a retired mountainy attorney.  I would not be so sure that some court might not some day say that this is unconstitutional and that the person has the right of access to some judicial tribunal or another.  I will not be voting if this comes to a vote because I understand that my party take one view and I will not be voting.  If a person is refused a bookmaker's licence or a certificate of personal fitness to conduct the business of bookmaking, he can go to the court.  There are umpteen other professions where licences are required and they have the right of appeal to a court.  I would be happy if the person who is refused a certificate had the right to appeal to the court.  If it is granted indirectly, there will be the right to object, if not at the granting, then at the ensuing court.  Therefore, if one can object to the granting of a licence one should also be able to object to the refusal to grant one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnneMarieColley" hpid="Miss Colley Miss Colley">
      <NameTxt>Miss Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me say that I can <Col N="2331" /> appreciate the principle which Deputy Taylor is trying to push here which is the principle of fairness particularly where it is related to somebody's livelihood. Deputy Fitzpatrick has said he believed that an unreasonable decision would be the exception rather than the rule but I think we have to look at the effects this amendment, if accepted, would have.  I believe that if there was an automatic right of appeal to the Circuit Court many spurious claims could be made and invited by virtue of there being a chance of overturning the decision of Bord Fáilte.  I go along entirely with Deputy Barrett and the Minister when they say that Bord Fáilte are the proper authority in this case, and my understanding of what the Minister said on Committee Stage was that the regulations to be issued by the Minister for Tourism and Transport would be extremely comprehensive and little discretion would be left to the Bord Fáilte inspector.  It would be almost as if he would have a checklist to go through and if complied with, the discretion which the Bord Fáilte inspector would have would be nil.</P>
      <P>We will come to an amendment later which deals with whether the regulations would be made but if they are made and are comprehensive there would be no need to safeguard against unreasonable behaviour on the part of an inspector.  In any case we have at present and will continue to have an appeals procedure and any improper action taken by the board or an inspector of the board can be appealed against to the courts.  I would not favour automatic appeal against any decision taken by an inspector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened to the contributions which have been made with care and attention but I have not been convinced by their arguments.  Deputy Colley said that it would be almost as if the inspector would have to go through a checklist but that is not so.  It would not be a case of checking whether there are three switches in a hall or a 60 watt bulb in the bathroom but objective decisions <Col N="2332" /> would have to be made.  The crucial decisions would be made by the inspector and not Bord Fáilte.  He will make a recommendation and Bord Fáilte will act on it.  Objective decisions would have to be made on the basis of the furnishings, the comfort of the seating, standards of catering, standards of hygiene and the experience of the staff.  These would have to be looked at and a decision made.  A substantial discretionary element must be involved and it is on that basis that I have moved this amendment.</P>
      <P>The question of unreasonable behaviour might arise but leaving that aside this is a question of the view which would be taken from a particular set of facts.  I think it was Deputy Kelly who said that these people are very professional.  They ought to be very professional and I am sure they are, but so what?  Judges are very professional people, yet their decisions can be appealed.  Just because a Circuit Court judge is a professional person does not mean he cannot take the wrong view.  They do take the wrong views all the time and High Court judges overrule them.  They are also human and can take a wrong view on occasion.  I do not accept that there would be a flood of appeals to the Circuit Court.  It is far too expensive a procedure to take an appeal to the Circuit Court in this day and age and to retain a solicitor, a barrister and a professional assessor who would have to give evidence to the court.  As Deputy Fitzpatrick rightly pointed out, that is the way it would be dealt with and the court would then make up its mind.  There would be no flood of appeals on this issue any more than there is an appeal on every decision which the District Court makes or the Circuit Court makes or the High Court makes or any of the other tribunals make.  Of course, there are appeals from time to time but there is no reason to suppose that the proportion of appeals on this issue would be any higher.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Lynch made the point that standards must be adhered to.  Deputy Fitzpatrick rightly took him up on that point and gave the same response I was going to give.  We are all agreed that standards must be adhered to and that <Col N="2333" /> standards are very important but what we are talking about is the decision which would be made on whether those standards have in fact been met in a particular case.  That is the issue and on that issue people's views can vary even with the best will in the world.</P>
    <P>Obtaining a Bord Fáilte certificate is a condition precedent to getting a special restaurant licence.  It is the first hurdle which would have to be jumped.  According to the scheme of things it seems that these hurdles would have to be jumped. The first is the obtaining of the Bord Fáilte certificate followed by the Circuit Court application and finally the issuing of the licence by the Revenue Commissioners. If one does not get over the first hurdle of obtaining the Bord Fáilte certificate they are out and would not get before the Circuit Court.</P>
    <P>If the Circuit Court is such a non-body so far as this issue is concerned why are applicants going to be put through the Circuit Court hoop as well as the Bord Fáilte hoop?  Why should we leave it open for the Circuit Court to decide if an objection is received as to whether premises are unfit?  Under section 8 the Circuit Court would have to be satisfied, and reach a decision on the facts, that the premises are fit or unfit if someone objects.  I thought the Circuit Court was not involved here and no judicial decision was involved.  Therefore, how is it that having gone through the Bord Fáilte hoop one would still have to go to the Circuit Court and argue that the premises are unfit or inconvenient?  How is the Circuit Court judge going to decide on that?  Is he going to have to visit the premises?  Of course not.  He would decide it on the evidence provided by professional people in the same way as all other cases are decided.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barrett made the point that a judge would have to walk into every premises, and Deputy Fitzpatrick has adequately dealt with that point.  I can only re-emphasise what he said and that is that the judge would hear evidence on the suitability of the premises and on the facilities of that restaurant.  This is not comparable to the payment of a grant, as <Col N="2334" /> Deputy Barrett has said.  This is very different from a person applying for a grant.  Where a person applies for a grant their livelihood is not at stake.  Second, this is something which is given if certain circumstances are met and a person would not incur expense unless they knew they were going to get the grant.  This is very different in that the procedure for obtaining these licences is being laid down by the Oireachtas.  It would be of crucial importance to a person's livelihood whether they obtained one and that case is very different from that of a person not getting a grant for his windows.  The Minister said this was a grave responsibility on the part of the inspector who would be sent down by Bord Fáilte.  That is the very point; it is a grave responsibility on a very serious and crucial matter.  For that reason I urge as strongly as I possibly can that so grave a responsibility should not be left to the final decision of one person without an applicant having recourse to an appeal. Appeals on matters of importance like this, affecting people's livelihoods, are endemic, basic to our scheme of things, not only in the judicial but in the administrative field as well where there are appeals procedures laid down.  For example, there are procedures laid down for appeals against inspectors of taxes' assessments to the Appeal Commissioners, an appeal against a local authority decision on a planning matter to An Bord Pleanála and so on.  Also, administrative decisions are appealable in virtually all cases of substance and importance.</P>
    <P>What is so special about this?  Why is there this determination to leave so important a matter, one involving, as the Minister has said, so grave a responsibility, in the hands of this one person that could have such far-reaching effects on the lives of people seeking one of these special restaurant licences?  I do not understand it.  It constitutes a departure from the general principle we have established here on both judicial and administrative matters.</P>

    <P>Amendment declared lost.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
      <P>In page 7, line 33, after &ldquo;situated&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or any inhabitant of the parish or health authority within the meaning of the Health Act in whose functional area the restaurant is situated&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I put down this amendment on Committee Stage and the Minister explained <Col N="2337" /> to me, and he was quite right in what he said, that persons have a right to object. However, I thought about this again and section 10, to which this amendment refers, states:</P>
    <P>Where application is made for the renewal of a special restaurant licence, the superintendent of the Garda Síochána for the Garda district in which the restaurant, the subject of the application, is situated may, without prejudice to any other ground of objection available to him under the Acts, object to the renewal of the licence on the following ground, namely, that the premises concerned have not been bona fide and solely used as a restaurant within the meaning of this Act...</P>
    <P>This section picks out a specific objection as distinct from other objections that can be made under the licensing Acts.  The section states that the superintendent of the Garda Síochána &ldquo;may, without prejudice to any other ground of objection available to him under the Acts...&rdquo; so that he, like an inhabitant of a parish or a member of a health authority, may object under the licensing Acts to the renewal of a licence.  This section is about the renewal of a special restaurant licence and a specific ground for objecting is that it has not been bona fide and solely used as a restaurant.  I am afraid that the courts' interpretation of this section would be that only a superintendent of the Garda Síochána could go into court and object on this specific ground.  I recognise that one can object to the renewal of a licence under the various Acts, but this is picking out a specific ground on which one can object to the renewal of a special restaurant licence, that is that it is not a bona fide restaurant. I would be afraid that, if a member of the public objected on the grounds that a restaurant was applying for the renewal of a special restaurant licence, he would not be heard because the Act specifies that only a superintendent of the Garda Síochána may object on those grounds. Why else would that section be there? What would be the need for the wording <Col N="2338" />&ldquo;without prejudice to any other ground of objection available to him under the Acts&rdquo;?  Why is the section worded in that way?</P>
    <P>I do not think it is that important, but it is worth while to avoid any possible confusion at a later stage when the Act is interpreted by the courts.  It would be worth while including my wording in that section which I have copied from another Act: &ldquo;any inhabitant of the parish or health authority within the meaning of the Health Act in whose functional area the restaurant is situated&rdquo;.  In that way we would be making it quite clear that either a superintendent of the Garda Síochána, an inhabitant of the parish or the health authority in whose area the restaurant is situated, may go to court to object to the renewal of a special restaurant licence on the grounds that the restaurant is not a bona fide restaurant. It is worth while including those few words in the section.</P>
    <P>I recognise that any member of the public can object to the renewal of a licence on various grounds, such as, that the holder of the licence is not a fit person to hold the licence, or that the premises are not suitable, but according to this only the superintendent of the Garda Síochána may object on the grounds that the premises concerned have not been bona fide and solely used as a restaurant within the meaning of this Bill.  That would be dangerous because others should be able to join with the superintendent of the Garda Síochána, if necessary, to object on the grounds that the premises have not been used solely as a restaurant.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree in general with what Deputy Barrett said.  The fact that section 10 specifically gives the superintendent of the Garda district in which the restaurant is situated the right to object to the renewal of the special restaurant licence on this ground could be construed to exclude the right of any other person who is entitled under the Acts to object.  It could be construed as preventing any other person from objecting on this ground.  It would probably be <Col N="2339" /> worth while to include Deputy Barrett's wording in the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to draw the attention of Deputies to section 3 of the Bill, the effect of which is that it will be construed together with the other liquor licensing Acts, and also to section 7 (2) by virtue of which a special restaurant licence will be deemed to be a non-licence for the purpose of the Finance Act of 1910.  One effect of this is that the existing power to object to the grant of a court certificate which is required before a liquor licence is renewed will apply also in relation to special restaurant licences although, under the licensing Acts as they stand, there are some restrictions on the categories who may object to the initial grant of a liquor licence.  Any member of the community can object to the renewal certificate and this will be the case in relation to the special restaurant licences.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>No, not on that ground. In the ordinary way such objection may be made on the grounds of the character of the licensee or the manner in which the premises were conducted during the year or the unfitness of the premises.  I am advised there is sufficiently wide scope under the existing law for objection to renewal in these cases.  Anybody may object.  I understand that, where a person is making the application for a special licence, the same provisions are there for anybody to object as are there in the case of anybody making application for another sort of licence.  There is very little between us but I am told that what we have is sufficiently good.</P>

It is just that I am at a loss to know why this section was put in and why the right to object is restricted to the superintendent of the Garda Síochána. The section is quite specific.  It says that only a superintendent may object on those grounds and he may do so without prejudice to any other grounds of objection available to him under the Acts, which implies that the section recognises that under other Acts the superintendent may object on other grounds also.  This section restricts the right of objection to the superintendent of the Garda Síochána. It does not make sense.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
      <P>In page 7, line 44, to delete &ldquo;may&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I will be brief because the rationale behind this amendment has been well laid out on Committee Stage.  The regulations in question in this section may be issued by the Minister for Tourism and Transport. I understand the Minister for Justice has said it is intended these regulations will issue before certificates are granted under this Bill.  The Minister has indicated further evidence of his wish to do so in another amendment but it seems to me that we can still ask that the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; be substituted for the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; because the Minister is still not under any obligation to issue these regulations. There is an alternative available in the Bill which lays down what Bord Fáilte must look for in the absence of regulations.  In order to copperfasten the fact that we have specific regulations, we should insist that the Minister for Tourism and Transport &ldquo;shall&rdquo; make these regulations.</P>
      <P>It is crucial to the operation of the Bill that these regulations, in detail, are issued.  It is not a matter about which I would go to the wall but it is very important and I know that the Minister regards the issuing of these regulations as important. If that is the case I ask him to accede to the proposed change.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 12, as it stands, empowers the Minister for Tourism and Transport to make restaurant standard regulations.  The effect of these amendments would be to oblige him to make those regulations.  This specific point was <Col N="2342" /> raised when the Bill was being drafted and the advice received from a senior officer in the Attorney General's office was that it was not appropriate for a statute to impose an obligation on the Minister concerned to make regulations to act in such circumstances.  It was not appropriate or necessary to put the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo;, the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; would suffice.  I am advised by the Attorney General's office that it is a legal tecnical point.  I repeat for the benefit of Deputy Colley and Deputy Barrett that the intention is that these regulations will be made before Part II of the Bill is brought into operation.</P>
      <P>Regarding the proposed amendment to section 12 (2) it is not clear that this would add to the sense of the subsection as it stands.  The effect of subsection (2) is that regulations may make provision for all, or any, of the specified matters. To say that the regulations shall make provision for all or any of the specified matters would not, it appears, significantly alter the scope of the provision. I am advised by the technical expertise available to me in the parliamentary draftsman's office that it is not necessary. We are all in agreement with what must be done and what we want to see done and I am advised there is sufficient provision here to ensure that that will happen.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 9.</P>
      <P>In page 8, between lines 39 and 40, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(4) In the event of a decision by the Board to cancel a Bord Fáilte Certificate pursuant to this section an appeal against that decision by the holder of the special restaurant licence shall lie to the Circuit Court.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2343" /> This amendment refers to the cancellation of a special restaurant licence by Bord Fáilte and would give the right to a person who held such a licence, which was cancelled, to appeal it to the Circuit Court.</P>
    <P>We seek to draw a distinction between the objection to the licensing end of the licence and to the restaurant end of the licence.  In the case of the licensing end of the licences, the court procedure applies. The House has now accepted an amendment to provide that any member of the public can put in an objection on the grounds that a restaurant is no longer bona fide used as a restaurant.  That opinion by a casual member of the public can bring about a whole court procedure in the District Court and, on appeal, in the Circuit Court.  On the other hand we provide that on the restaurant side where some of the matters at least would be in common between the two procedures, in this case there is no appeal and Bord Fáilte alone through their inspector would be in a position to cancel the licence.  If that is done there is no appeal from that procedure.  There seems to be a grave variation in import between what a restaurant owner would have to face in the event of a problem under the licensing end, or under section 10 and under the restaurant end.  It seems totally logical. The same arguments which I adduced in relation to the earlier section giving right of appeal to the Circuit Court would apply with equal force on this particular issue.</P>
    <P>When a licence has been granted and is up and running, if the restaurant has fallen below standard, it is quite in order for the board to come along and make a decision to cancel the licence.  That is fair enough but it is equally reasonable to provide that that decision to cancel the licence and cancel that person's livelihood be subject to an appeal to the Circuit Court.  That seems to be a reasonable provision and it seems to be the other side of the coin to section 10 and the provisions under the Licensing Act under which there is an appeal procedure where the licence is called into question.</P>
    <Col N="2344" />
    <Speaker pid="AnneMarieColley" hpid="Miss Colley Miss Colley">
      <NameTxt>Miss Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to refer to something which relates to this amendment.  It was mentioned on Committee Stage that there was reference in section 10 to the District Court and that there was not any specific jurisdiction given to the District Court in the Bill.  The Minister undertook to investigate the renewal of licences and to come back on Report Stage.  Perhaps in his reply the Minister might refer to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Taylor proposes that there should be an appeal to the Circuit Court against the decision by the board to cancel its certificate.  Clearly, this would mean that there would be an appeal in almost every case to the court where Bord Fáilte found that standards had not been met or maintained in the restaurant concerned.  This would mean that the court would have to involve itself in the question of whether furnishings, catering and equipment were up to standard in the restaurant concerned so that, in effect, the Circuit Court would take over the functions of Bord Fáilte.  Apart from the question of whether this would be an appropriate function for the court, the result would make it impossible to implement effectively the relevant provisions relating to the special restaurant licences.</P>
      <P>In any case under section 13, the holder of a restaurant certificate which no longer complies with the standards specified in the regulations, in effect gets a second chance to bring his premises into compliance with the regulations.  Thus, where it appears to Bord Fáilte that a restaurant's standards have fallen to the point where it no longer complies with the regulations, the inspector must notify the holder of the certificate of the steps that must be taken within a specified period to bring his premises back into compliance with the regulations.  Only if those steps have not been taken in the specified time would the certificate be cancelled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Accordingly, I cannot accept this amendment.  I should add that the applicant for, or the holder of, a special restaurant licence will continue to have available to him any recourse to the court <Col N="2345" /> which is available to him under the existing law in relation to the activities or decisions of the board.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support the amendment.  I am not impressed by the Minister's arguments that we are putting an unusual burden on the court and that we are asking the court to be, in effect, the assessor of the standards of the restaurant concerned.  Courts are asked to make assessments in a whole variety of areas of life every day of the week.  They have to adjudicate when bureaucracy and the citizen come into conflict.  The amendment is asking that the court would be the adjudicator in the case of a conflict.</P>
      <P>Let us consider the reality of what is concerned here.  The section talks about Bord Fáilte refusing a certificate or Bord Fáilte serving this notice or that notice requiring work to be done.  Of course, what happens is that an official of Bord Fáilte will be doing all this and he will be subject to human fallibility, bias and prejudice.  It is possible that this will happen, and traditionally the system provides that the court is where a citizen goes for redress if he feels he is badly done by in any area of the administration of the State.  Consequently, if the law provides for this new system of licensing, based on the special restaurant certificate, it immediately gives that certificate a high commercial value.  In this case we are creating something of considerable commercial value, the special restaurant certificate and licence, and charging the person who gets it a sum of £3,000.  I presume that if a restaurant certificate is cancelled by Bord Fáilte and if the owner subsequently has to apply for a new one &mdash; as opposed to a renewal &mdash; he will have to fork out another £3,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a question of renewal, this is in a case where it has been cancelled by Bord Fáilte, but if the person involved puts his house in order he will have to get a new licence and, presumably, pay another £3,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2346" /> An independent arbitration forum should be set up to adjudicate on any issue of contention between a citizen and State bureaucracy as represented by the official of Bord Fáilte who will be charged with inspecting and making a decision on the suitability of the premises.  That is what the courts are for and I am not impressed by the Minister's argument that the court will assess the suitability of the premises.  Courts have to make such assessments every day of the week in a whole variety of areas; it is part and parcel of a court's business to make such adjudications.  It is very important to have an appeal process to an independent arbitration &mdash; which is what the court would be &mdash; in a case where a citizen has a grievance against an act of bureaucracy. If there is no case and if Bord Fáilte are clearly in the right, then the court will obviously see that but, if there is a doubt, it should be adjudicated upon by an independent authority.  Do not let us have a situation where the body depending on the doubt is one of the parties with a vested interest in the matter.  I ask the Minister to reconsider his attitude towards this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to clear up this whole issue in regard to appeal, inspection and standards.  Standards and regulations must be complied with. Public houses, lounges, hotels and restaurants must comply with certain standards and these places are subject to inspection by local authorities and health boards.  If they have not complied with the standards laid down, an objection is lodged, especially in the case of a public house, with the local superintendent.  He has the right to object and his objection is usually upheld.  Anybody who wishes to improve their business should seek the advice of the local authority, the health board and Bord Fáilte, whose advice is freely given.  The applicant may then carry out the works as advised by the authority.  That is the normal procedure and it is the advice I, as a businessmen, give to anybody who is seeking a licence. Over the last ten years, local authorities, health boards and Bord Fáilte have taken <Col N="2347" /> steps to improve the outlets referred to and standards in public houses, hotels and restaurants, while in some case leaving a certain amount to be desired, have improved tremendously.  If conditions are not up to standard, there is no point in appealing to a court.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support in principle the idea behind this amendment, the right of recourse by a restaurateur to a court by way of appeal against a decision in regard to regulations.  In the analagous or similar amendment moved earlier by Deputy Taylor, I indicated support on the basis that it was the general order of things in the area of licensing law and which exists right across the board in many different instances such as gun, PSV and betting licences.  It is remarkable that Deputies might object to the idea of judges being asked to adjudicate on matters pertaining to restaurants when we ask them to adjudicate on any and every issue arising in civil life.</P>
      <P>In regard to regulations governing the condition of buildings, there are many instances of precedent where a local authority tells an owner-occupier of property that it is in a dangerous condition and orders him to put it right.  It is up to the owner-occupier to appeal that directive to the District Court to adjudicate on whether he is complying properly with the requirements under statute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The same applies with regard to fire regulations where the fire officer can compel someone to carry out works.  The same is true in regard to planning or building by-law regulations which are enforced by the local authority.  There is access to the District or the Circuit Court by the property owner.  I do not agree with Deputy Kelly's views on this matter. It is not a question of the invasion of the administrative workings of the State by the courts.  It is leaving open the right of appeal which exists, under the Constitution, in regard to all forms of litigation. There is a body of law which says that, where one comes down to administrative decisions and those of the civil authority that impinge on people's rights <Col N="2348" /> of property, entitlement or whatever, there should be a higher authority to review or oversee such decisions.  Deputies said that an individual member of Bord Fáilte might be capricious.  I do not seek to impugn decisions that might be made by a particular individual and it is not correct to say that it would be a decision of the board.  The principles of administrative fairness are based on recognising that there should be a right of review by a higher authority, one independent of the person or persons who originally make the decision.  For that reason the introduction of such a concept into the legislation is desirable.  In the case of licences issued to restaurateurs we are seeking to cut in on the trade mid-term and impose conditions.</P>
    <P>As I understand it the Circuit Court is the vehicle for issuing a certificate which enables the applicant to approach the Revenue Commissioners for a licence.  The decision of the judicial authority is crucial to the process.  If Bord Fáilte reach a conclusion that a licence should be cancelled mid-term, I wonder if that represents an interference with the judicial order or judicial decision.  From what authority in law will the decision of Bord Fáilte emanate?  Will the restaurant certificate continue to exist in such a case?  There is authority available to the fire and other building regulators to close premises or carry out works themselves, but I am not certain of the status of the Circuit Court decision if Bord Fáilte intervene and decide that a restaurant must cease trading because it is not complying with their regulations.  I invite the Minister to respond to that query, if permitted to do so by the Chair.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>It is obvious that views on this issue are divided.  There was a division of views in regard to that last section which dealt with the refusal to grant a certificate in the first place.  There has been a lot of talk about the possibility of difficult inspectors from Bord Fáilte <Col N="2349" /> causing people problems.  This section lays down certain requirements and an inspector must put in writing what he finds objectionable.  That inspector must invite the restaurant owner to rectify the problems within a specified period. However, we must remember that there are difficult restaurant owners, people who will not conform to certain standards. The difficult people do not all hang out at Bord Fáilte.</P>
      <P>I fail to understand why we cannot accept that officials of Bord Fáilte are better qualified in most cases than a Circuit Court judge or a district justice to decide such issues.  We must remember that the provision is designed to improve standards and get people to comply with the law.  If it is not retained people will not comply with the law and will be content to wait for the annual licensing court to answer any objections.  In my view it is better to ask inspectors to give notice to restaurant owners to carry out certain improvements within a specific period or otherwise they would lose their licences. The alternative is to wait until the annual licensing court when Bord Fáilte could object to the renewal of a licence.  That would cause confusion and a great deal more expense for the restaurant owner.</P>
      <P>I do not see Bord Fáilte officials setting out to get at people.  They have enough on their plate.  In the case of an application for planning permission if a health inspector decides that an area of ground is not suitable for a septic tank, planning permission will be refused and that will be the end of the matter.  As Deputy Taylor is aware, that happens regularly and there are very few appeals to the District Court or the Circuit Court on the basis that the ground is capable of taking a septic tank.  Professional standards must apply and we must depend on professional expertise.  We have been carrying on in that way here for the past 60 years and in 99 per cent of cases the inspector is right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We appoint directors to Bord Fáilte to see to it that individuals in the company behave themselves.  There are superiors there, a chief executive and many inspectors and I do not see one member <Col N="2350" /> of the staff of Bord Fáilte being able to get massive powers for himself to decide that he will not grant a licence because he does not like the colour of the eyes of the applicant.  I do not think any inspector will cancel a licence without good reason. That individual will be obliged to set down in writing the defects that need to be attended to.  Such officials are as qualified to make a rational decision in regard to such premises as any judge sitting in a court.</P>
    <P>If we do not have this provision Bord Fáilte officials will be obliged to wait until the annual licensing court to object to the renewal of a licence.  Restaurant owners will not get any advance warning of what is required under section 13.  There is another side to this argument than talking about possible monsters in Bord Fáilte. We will be leaving it to professional people to see to it that restaurant owners comply with the regulations.  It will be our job to consider the regulations when they are brought before us and if we consider them unreasonable or unfair we can seek changes.  We should not be endeavouring to clog up our courts with appeals under this system.  If we have an appeal procedure we may get a difficult restaurateur disagreeing with the Bord Fáilte official and appealing to the court. We could get restaurant owners appealing simply because they did not like the Bord Fáilte inspector.  I cannot support the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>At one level, taken in isolation, this appears to be an innocent type of measure, that we will invest a power in Bord Fáilte inspectors and that will be the end of the story.  It seems to be an innocuous measure but there is a lot at stake here.  Serious issues are involved and this trend has been growing in our society over the years.  It nibbles away at a very important democratic principle which is, and must be, a basic principle of every democracy.  Indeed, it is enshrined in An Bunreacht, and rightly so.  Before important decisions affecting the lives and livelihoods of our people <Col N="2351" /> are made, they must have access to independent tribunals established by An Bunreacht, namely our courts of justice. There is a great desire by many to erode and take away that basic democratic right.  That is why we find that we have a plethora of non-judicial, Government-appointed, executive staffed, institutions.</P>
      <P>I am referring to those faceless tribunals before which one cannot argue one's case.  More and more of the important decisions affecting our daily lives are made by such tribunals.  This amounts to another straw on the camel's back.  Once again we are giving power to a faceless body of men to make dicisions that could affect the livelihoods of many people.  An inspector comes down and decisions are made and laws laid down by him as to what is to be and that is it.  That basic right established under the Constitution of recourse to the courts is being taken away from people and Deputies, regrettably, are supporting that.  They are putting yet another nail in the coffin of that open accessibility to the courts which is, or ought to be, the basic right of every citizen in this State whose livelihood is affected.  He should come face to face with the person who is vetting him, be heard and seen and call evidence.  An inspector could say that if a place is not completely refurbished at a cost of, perhaps, £10,000, he will close the place down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sorry to have to say that Deputy Barrett totally misunderstands the purport of the amendment.  It has nothing to do with denigrating the standards that we are setting for these licences.  Of course, standards must be set and must be observed but this amendment is about a different matter altogether.  It is about deciding whether those standards have been met and who decides ultimately that they have been met.  Is it the man with the brief case and umbrella, sent down from the plush offices of Bord Fáilte, who lords it over the applicant?  If he does not pay that £10,000 for refurbishment, the unfortunate person is left with no <Col N="2352" /> recourse whatever to our courts which were set up by An Bunreacht.</P>
    <P>We are engaged in a very dangerous procedure here.  It is symptomatic of an invidious erosion of the rights of citizens, placing their lives and livelihoods more and more in the hands of the executive. The executive love to get all the power they can into their hands and to keep that power away from examination in the cold light of day in a court in the presence of the press who can hear evidence called. They can hear a witness saying on oath that the premises are reasonable, the furnishings are reasonable, the standards are fair and let Bord Fáilte bring in their inspector to say that in his opinion they are not.  That is fair enough, but let him answer a few questions on his opinion. he must be asked if he is being reasonable and if he has compared the specific restaurant with another in the next town whose standards perhaps are worse and whose fate was decided by a different inspector.  Let the press be present as a protection of the rights of individuals. However, the position is that the inspector comes down and there is no publicity and no answers to questions.  He gives his opinion and that is it.  There is no judge to decide on the basis of comparison.</P>
    <P>How many inspectors will assess the various restaurants?  Will there be one, five or ten?  Let us assume there are ten. They are human beings, they have different standards, different notions, as to the class of restaurant appropriate for such a licence.  Are the Minister and Deputy Barrett telling us today that all these inspectors will be clones one of the other, having precisely the same ideas, precisely the same notions, as to what standards should apply in each restaurant?  Is it not likely that a restaurant in county A will be passed on one type of standard because the inspector for that area takes a more moderate, perhaps lenient, view of the standard required for these licences, whereas an inspector in county B might have different notions?  He might have very high-class notions and his background might be different.  He might think that the seats have to be upholstered in velvet and that the carpet must <Col N="2353" /> be three inches deep.  There would be no uniformity.  On the other hand during an appeal to a court professional persons could give comparable evidence.  The restaurants of comparable standard could be named and a divergence of opinion highlighted.</P>
    <P>The balancing of standards around the country cannot be achieved by this procedure because there is realy no impartial person making the ultimate decision, as applies in the case of a court.  That is where the weakness of this procedure shows itself.  It is totally unacceptable to leave this very important matter in the hands of one person, for decision behind closed doors, without being answerable, without having to get into the witness box, take an oath and justify himself. Such a person is making very important decisions.  He can say that premises are not up to scratch or up to standard.  When people are empowered to make such decisions, they should be answerable to somebody.</P>

      <P>To whom are they to be answerable?  They should be asked to explain under oath in court why a restaurant in the next town, perhaps worse than the one in question, has been given a licence.  Such publicity would not suit the executive.  To make comparisons is too much trouble.  What is this nonsense about clogging up the courts?  Perhaps it is thought that there should not be appeals on anything, that we should just have tribunals, that the Ministers of each Department should set up an officer to decide everything because otherwise it would clog up the courts.  That is no answer.  If the matter is appropriately a matter for the court &mdash; and I say it is &mdash; and the courts are provided, as is obligatory under the Constitution, they should be used.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many of the courts in the High Court have been clogged up for years dealing with other matters and nobody becomes unduly fussed about that.  If a matter is appropriate to a court and judge, to say <Col N="2354" /> that it will clog up the courts is no answer. If that kind of argument were to be accepted, it would be a bad day for the rights of the individual.  It is typical of the line of argument being brought in on this issue.  It is a very dangerous principle to be establishing, taking away the basic right of access to the courts.  The House should exercise great caution before it would agree to take away that basic right from the individual citizen.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 10:</P>
      <P>In page 9, lines 6 and 7, to delete &ldquo;or between the hours of three o'clock and six o'clock in the afternoon.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>On Committee Stage, I introduced an amendment which was to the same effect as this and it was argued at quite a length. However, it is worth while to bring the matter forward again because there is a principle here which is being missed in this Bill, or will be missed if these amendments are not accepted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill as it is framed at present prevents those restaurants which apply for and are granted special restaurant licences from serving alcohol between the hours of 3 p.m. and 6 p.m.  This is despite the fact that they may be serving a substantial meal.  I think we agreed on Committee Stage that the purpose of this part <Col N="2355" /> of the Bill is to allow restaurants of a certain type, serving a substantial meal, to provide alcohol with that meal.  There is a very strong sense of incongruity in this situation.  When this Bill is passed, we will have three types of licence enabling the punter to have a meal during the day with an alcoholic drink.  The first is a public house.  We are also in this Bill abolishing what was known as the &ldquo;holy hour&rdquo;.  We are now going to allow the public house to serve food, as many of them do, together with drink throughout the day and during the hours between 3 p.m. and 6 p.m.</P>
    <P>The existing restaurant licences will also be affected.  After this Bill has been passed some restaurants will retain their existing licences and they will be enabled to serve meals, whether substantial or not, and alcohol in the form of wine or other light drinks with this meal. Remarkably enough, the special restaurant licences which are to be granted under this Bill to restaurants of a high quality which serve a substantial meal and which have to meet very stiff regulations and prove on a number of counts that they have reached a very high level of service, are the only restaurants which will not be enabled to serve alcohol between the hours of 3 p.m. and 6 p.m. with a substantial meal.</P>
    <P>I make no plea for restaurants which do not serve a substantial meal or for those people who will try to take advantage of the system by sitting around all afternoon in a restaurant without having a meal.  I am particularly concerned with the difficulties that this prohibition will present to legitimate restaurants, for instance, those restaurants with a wedding trade with wedding parties coming in regularly after a wedding at 3 p.m. They arrive at the restaurant between 4 p.m. and 4.30 p.m. and they would normally expect to have a sherry reception, but under this Bill they are not entitled to do so.  The restaurant cannot serve even wine type drinks to the guests. Generally these restaurants would be of high quality and would serve substantial meals and in all the other circumstances <Col N="2356" /> they would wish to obtain special restaurant licences and would wish to serve the public need in that way.  It would be unfortunate, and quite unfair, to deprive them of this type of trade.  For example, I know restaurants in my own constituency whose business will simply sink if they cannot have this type of licence and continue to serve drink during the afternoon. A great proportion of their trade will be affected.  It has been said to me by some restaurant owners that as much as 1,000 hours per year will be affected if this provision is not changed.</P>
    <P>It was also mentioned on Committee Stage that there would be very great problems in enforcing the provision not to allow restaurants to serve alcohol between 3 p.m. and 6 p.m.  Those very enforcement problems bring the law into disrepute, apart altogether from the incongruity of not allowing high class restaurants to serve alcohol when lower class or ordinary restaurants and pubs can serve food and alcohol together all day.  The law should not be brought into disrepute unnecessarily.  Indeed it should not be brought necessarily into disrepute and we should avoid this if at all possible.  This is one of the areas where I believe we can avoid this situation.</P>
    <P>I have to ask: what is the rationale behind this proposal?  What is the purpose of these prohibitions?  It has escaped me even after hearing the debate on Committee Stage.  It could be argued that the licensed trade, the pubs themselves, see that they will lose a substantial amount of business.  I have made it my business to talk to some publicans about this and they do not believe that is the case.  We are talking about two different needs being served.  We are talking about substantial meals being served in the afternoon and not simply late night drinking. Those restaurants which have a functions trade would be particularly affected.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister fears that the situation may get out of hand.  If that is the case, what about the other restaurants which continue to serve wine or the pubs which serve the full range of drinks?  I am looking for an extension of hours for <Col N="2357" /> quality restaurants serving alcohol with substantial meals.  I believe the amendments are reasonable and deal with different situations.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 10 deals with the hours between 3 p.m. and 6 p.m. on a week day, amendment No. 11 deals with those hours on a Sunday and amendment No. 12 deals with the hours between 3 o'clock in the afternoon and 7 o'clock in the evening on Christmas Day.  I would like to outline why I believe amendments Nos. 11 and 12 differ in some way from amendment No. 10.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 11 deals with Sundays and allows for families who go out for a late Sunday lunch to a restaurant and quite legitimately do not wish to rush themselves.  Sunday has taken on a leisurely pace for many families.  Many people would be in a restaurant at 3 p.m. or 4 p.m. and would reasonably wish to have a leisurely meal together with a bottle of wine, or a glass of beer, or whatever.  It is reasonable to allow them to do so.  Again it is confining it to these specially designated restaurants &mdash; high quality restaurants &mdash; and not any hole in the corner restaurants.  In fact there would be very few of them.  In terms of the whole community the numbers would be quite small.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 12 deals with Christmas Day.  It seems to me incongruous that a restaurant which serves Christmas dinner must do so between the hours of 1 p.m. and 3 p.m.  As far as I know, most Irish families do not eat their substantial meal on Christmas Day between the hours of 1 p.m. and 3 p.m. and why they should be expected to do so if they are eating in a restaurant is beyond me.  It is unreasonable.  Most people eat later on Christmas Day and it would be quite reasonable, in fact, to allow restaurants to serve alcohol between 3 p.m. and 7 p.m. only instead of preventing them serving alcohol at this time.</P>
    <P>I believe they are reasonable amendments. I do not believe they would affect the licensed trade in any great way, if at all.  They are serving a different need and a different trade.  Acceptance of these <Col N="2358" /> amendments would further a uniformity of approach in licensing regulations, which I think would be welcomed.  The general legislation on licensing is acknowledged to be very difficult and very complex and the more we can do, while enacting further legislation, to bring it into line and not make it more complex, the more it would be welcomed by the general public as well as licensees.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the debate on Committee Stage I have had second thoughts about this proposal.  Like Deputy Colley, I have spoken to a number of people and I have come across a number of restaurateurs who have a wine licence at present and who are dependent to a great extent on wedding receptions for a great portion of their business.  They are now faced with the option of either giving up the wine licence in order to get a special restaurant licence, or retaining the wine licence.  If they do that they become uncompetitive as a restaurant.  Not being able to serve a drink they would not be long in business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In view of the fact that we have abolished the &ldquo;holy hour&rdquo; and that the pubs remain open on week days between 3 p.m. and 6 p.m., I do not think we could be accused of unfair competition if restaurants were to stay open during that period also because all licensed premises would be opened at the same time.  It would also help restaurants which cater for wedding receptions.  Normally if people get married in the afternoon, which is a common practice now, they arrive at the restaurant at 3 p.m. or 4 p.m.  I would ask the Minister to consider amendment No. 10 which refers to weekdays. I believe that quite a number of the restaurants we are talking about will not avail of this extension.  They will automatically close at 3 p.m. or 4 p.m. because that is the way they schedule their business, particularly family run restaurants where people have to have a break before the evening session.  By doing this we are not being unfair to publicans or hotels because they will be open anyway.  We will be protecting jobs in some restaurants which depend on <Col N="2359" /> weddings and so on for business.  As Deputy Colley has said, between 3 p.m. and 6 p.m. when pubs are open it will be difficult for the police to do anything about those who break the law.</P>
    <P>In relation to Sundays and Christmas Day, that is a different issue.  Sunday is a family day.  That may be an old-fashioned view but I will say it anyway because there is not enough mention of the family. I am glad that on Sundays the pubs close at 2 p.m.  I am like many other people; I enjoy a pint after a game of golf on a Sunday morning.  I am glad that I have to go home at 2 p.m. because otherwise, instead of going to Croke Park with my son I might be tempted to stay on in the pub.  All of us need controls and discipline. That may be an old-fashioned thing to say but that is what I believe.  Equally, Christmas Day is a family day and it is about children.  I do not think children like spending their time in a restaurant while their parents tank themselves up.</P>

      <P>If people want to go out for a meal and want to bring the children with them, let them do so and let them have a drink with their meal, but we should not put ourselves in the position that if we agree to this on Christmas Day the publicans, the hoteliers and other people will want to compete on an equal basis, will want their premises open on Christmas Day and will not want any break on Sundays.  The same argument cannot be used for weekdays because the same licensing laws will apply throughout the afternoon.  I would ask the Minister to accept amendment No. 10 in the light of the very valid point put forward by Deputy Colley in relation to those restaurants.  I have spoken to some of the people who depend on a wedding trade in the afternoon, and I agree to that provision but I would be slower in agreeing to the provision regarding Sundays and Christmas Day because we would run into difficulties.  If the pubs are asked to close between <Col N="2360" /> 2 p.m. and 4 p.m. some difficulties would arise in that area.  For other reasons I believe it is not a bad thing to have these restrictions.  I am in favour of amendment No. 10.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the amendment which deals with opening hours between 3 p.m. and 6 p.m. on weekdays.  It is hard to see why this close-down between 3 p.m. and 6 p.m. is imposed by the Act.  It is certainly not a time when a restaurant would be abused. It is only people in search of a genuine restaurant, and in search of food, who would avail of it.  If a person is travelling between those hours he could travel 50 or 60 miles without finding a place to get a meal.  The hotels close at about 2 p.m. and they will not serve a substantial meal again until about 6 p.m. or 6.30 p.m.  If people are not in a position to eat at mid-day and if they want to eat before evening, they find themselves in a very difficult position.  One of my main objections to the change in the law is that restaurants will be abused.  Premises will be licensed as restaurants simply to avail of the sale of intoxicating liquor.</P>
      <P>The point that Deputy Colley made about Christmas Day is a very valid point. I am probably of the age group that thinks that people should eat at home on Christmas Day but if they want to eat out they should be able to go to a restaurant after 3 p.m. and have a meal, with liquor served.  I cannot see the sense of these provisions.  If they were excluded it would encourage what is very badly needed &mdash; the small family restaurant which is run by a husband and wife.  There are not enough of those premises.  These amendments would encourage that and would not be detrimental to the interests that Deputy Michael Lynch is concerned about.</P>

I would ask the Minister to accede to all three amendments.  The purpose of the amendments is to bring a <Col N="2361" /> degree of uniformity and regularity into the licensing laws.  I do not want to get into the area of tourists, but as Deputy Kelly is not here I think I can do so with some degree of expectation that we will not be here for too long talking about that matter.  We have to take into account the whole question of policing and the job that would be expected of the Garda Síochána in trying to give some control and effect to the laws.  I welcome the amendments.  They are sensible.  If there is a fear from the publicans' point of view, the Minister has some authority in terms of the fee to be charged as a means of regulating the proliferation or otherwise of the restaurants.  I hope these amendments will be acceded to in their entirety.</P>

Bearing in mind the case put by Deputy Colley, and more importantly the case put by Deputy Seán Barrett, on the amendments generally, we could meet amendment No. 10 put down by Deputy Colley and agree to what is being sought regarding weekdays.  With regard to amendment No. 12 which deals with Christmas Day, I agree with the arguments put forward by Deputy Barrett, as indeed do I agree with the arguments put forward against amendment No. 11 regarding Sundays.  No Minister for Justice would be able to hold the line as it is with regard to Sunday drinking generally. If we open the door here, there is no way we will be able to argue against those who want a straight run through &mdash; and all the interests in the trade would want a straight run through &mdash; but I do not believe any of us want that.  As I said, I can accept amendment No. 10, but I cannot accept amendments Nos. 11 and 12.</P>

      <P>I appreciate what the Minister says about amendment No. 10, <Col N="2362" /> but may I say a few words about amendment No. 11 which deals with Sunday opening?  I understand the Minister is very keen not to be seen as giving in to wholesale drinking on Sunday, but could I remind him that the hours we are dealing with here are between 3 o'clock and 6 o'clock in the afternoon?  As far as I know, the pubs open at 4 p.m., and we are talking about the difference of one hour.</P>
      <P>I would not have any objection to restaurants not being able to serve alcohol as early as is stated in the Bill but starting later.  If the Minister does not want lengthy drinking hours on a Sunday, I can understand his concern, but I believe the purpose of the Bill is being thwarted if we do not accept an amendment such as this, because the purpose of the Bill is to allow substantial meals to be consumed in high quality restaurants, with alcohol. It appears that Sunday is more and more becoming a day for the family, as Deputy Barrett said.  I am just as old-fashioned as Deputy Barrett&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Sometimes, not very often, I like to have Sunday lunch out but I cannot remember the last time I have done so before 3 o'clock and I think I am not that untypical. There are many people who wish to have a lazy Sunday dinner with their children and not rush to be finished at 3 o'clock.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The uniformity in licensing laws and hours should be stressed.  We should not be creating problems for licence holders or for the general public who will be mesmerised by the changes in the hours. <Col N="2363" /> Let us keep uniformity.  Let us allow restaurants to serve alcohol during the same hours each day.  I will not press the idea of serving alcohol until 7 o'clock on Christmas Day, but it is unusual to ask people to eat their full Christmas meal before 3 o'clock on Christmas afternoon. I agree with Deputy Fitzpatrick: I would much prefer to have Christmas dinner at home &mdash; I have never had it anywhere else &mdash; but there is a growing number of people who eat their Christmas dinner out and we are telling them they must eat within the two hours mentioned because it suits the licensing laws, or the supposed morals inherent in the licensing laws. What about suiting the public need?  That is what this legislation is about.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to reconsider the amendments.  I am not sticking to the hours in amendment No. 12, but I earnestly ask him to reconsider amendment No. 11 which is very reasonable.</P>

    <P>These amendments deal with Christmas Day.  What I am suggesting in this amendment is that on Christmas Day the licensing hours should be the same as other days.  In this Bill we have agreed to abolish the 10 p.m. closing time on Sunday. I put further my case for uniformity in <Col N="2364" /> licensing laws because the Bill, as passed in Committee, insists that the premises close and that alcohol not be consumed after 10 p.m.  The point is that we have achieved uniformity in other areas in licensing and it is worth extending it to this provision.  I ask the Minister to consider that.  Section 14 deals with special restaurant licences and amendment No. 21 is to section 28.  I appeal to the Minister to consider these amendments which are put down for the purpose of achieving uniformity.  They do not have any moral import.  These amendments are reasonable.</P>

      <P>I am in agreement with this legislation.  I own a public house but I firmly believe alcoholic drinks should not be served in a public house on Christmas Day.  Christmas Day is a day for the family.  Christmas Day and Good Friday are the two days of the year the public houses should not be open to the public.  I go further and say that alcohol should not be freely available in a public house on Christmas Day or Good Friday. It is a different story on St. Patrick's Day, New Year's Eve or New Year's Day. They are days for celebrating.</P>

      <P>I support this amendment, first, for uniformity and, second, because many of us are not so hard pressed or sectarian, to be direct about it.  The general principle of the Bill is to make a range of alcoholic beverages available to people having a meal in a restaurant.  The logic of the Deputy's argument is that people not only should not drink abroad on Christmas Day, but <Col N="2365" /> should not meet abroad either.  I do not think the Deputy wants to make that case, but that is what he is arguing.  We have to keep this argument in proportion. To use the Deputy's language, Christmas Day is a day of celebration, and within Christian lore, it is supposed to be the most celebrated day of the year.  It is certainly a time of alcoholic consumption. It is also unfortunately a time of tragic deaths on the road.  I see this provision as being very sensible and designed to achieve uniformity.  We should accept it.</P>

      <P>I would have difficulty in supporting amendment No. 21 which seeks to amend the section providing for the terms of special exemptions in hotels and restaurants.  As I understand it, the special exemption order is not applicable to special restaurants.  I certainly would not support extending special exemption hours on Christmas Day.  It is a pity that special exemption orders are now being provided for Christmas Day in hotels and restaurants.  I suppose there is a trend emerging and these days are not as private as they used to be.  People want to socialise in public places, particularly licensed public places.  I think this trend should be allowed to develop slowly.  It is a little too soon to extend a special exemption to 11 p.m. on Christmas Day. In a few years' time it might be appropriate, but not yet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of these amendments is to allow specially licensed restaurants and licensed hotels and licensed restaurants to serve drink until 11 o'clock on Christmas Day.  In licensed premises generally Christmas Day is a closed day, but since 1960 hotels and restaurants have been allowed to serve drink with substantial meals between 1 p.m. and 3 p.m. and between 7 p.m. and 10 p.m.  Section 9 of this Bill proposes the same permitted hours on Christmas Day for specially licensed restaurants.  I have received no significant demand for an extension of these hours in hotels and <Col N="2366" /> restaurants and it appears that the general public are happy with them.  Accordingly, I see no need to change them for hotels and restaurants or for specially licensed restaurants.</P>

      <P>My amendment No. 21 applies to hotels and restaurants and special exemptions.  As Deputy Cooney has rightly pointed out, the Bill does not allow special restaurant licence holders to apply for special exemption orders but I have an amendment which I hope to push later on this point.</P>
      <P>I am not particularly happy with the idea that special exemptions should be available on Christmas Day.  I am looking for some effort on the Minister's part to bring uniformity into the licensing laws. The original reason for 10 o'clock closing was that Sunday closing time was 10 o'clock.  That has now been changed to 11 o'clock, so why are we retaining 10 o'clock closing on Christmas Day?  If it is on moral grounds, then we should abolish special exemptions on Christmas Day.  I would not shed a tear if that happened. If special exemptions are to remain, we should at least bring them into line with other legislation.  The Minister says there is no demand for it but is it not reasonable to make the laws uniform?  If it is, it is in his hands to do so.</P>

    <P>Under section 24 of the Bill as initiated regulations made under Part II of the Bill would have come into operation before Deputies would have had an opportunity of examining them and, if a majority so desired, of having them annulled.</P>
    <P>There was unanimity on the other side of the House that the regulations should come before the House before coming into operation.  I accept the argument and the wording of the new section 24 is almost identical to that put forward by Deputy Barrett.  The form now adopted is that most favoured by the draftsman.</P>

    <P>I tabled this amendment on Committee Stage and the Minister gave an undertaking to see what could be done to facilitate the spirit of the amendment.  We should make a distinction between a publican serving drink after hours and a person found on the premises after hours. There is a great difference between somebody breaking the law by providing alcohol after the allowed hours and somebody who is endeavouring to clear his premises. The fine will be £400 if a publican <Col N="2369" /> is found actually serving drink after the allowed hours.  I would like to hear from the Minister if it is possible to facilitate us in this regard.  I appreciate there may be some difficulties in implementing the law but the spirit of the law should be there to show that this House regards the two offences as being different.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>In discussing this Bill we must recognise the very genuine achievement of the two companies concerned, since their inception.  They have made very considerable progress in meeting financial targets.  They have pulled the companies around and are providing a better service generally in that area. However, it is crucial that the Dáil be particularly vigilant in seeing that customers get a fair deal when dealing with the monopoly companies of Telecom Éireann and An Post.  It is also crucial that the Dáil take a very special approach to overseeing the affairs of its State commercial companies.  There must be an emphasis on performance from these companies if we are to achieve new economic opportunity in this country.  I am convinced that it is in large measure the State companies and the sort of environment for costs and performance that they engender, that create the sort of economic environment we need for a thriving business economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It must be borne in mind by the Dáil that these are companies that are relatively immune from market pressures, holding as they do a monopoly position in the market, and that they command enormous resources.  These two companies have a total expenditure and turnover of £700 million between them. There is immense scope for achievement <Col N="2370" /> in this area and the Dáil must be vigilant in seeing that they perform economically to the very maximum of their ability. Those two objectives have motivated this Bill &mdash; the desire to seek protection for the customer and the desire to see the best possible economic performance by these companies.</P>
    <P>In relation to the position of customers, I am very disappointed that the approach of this Government since coming to office has been consistently to show their determination to destroy any independent agencies acting on behalf of the consumer. We have seen this approach in relation to the National Social Service Board and we have seen it to a very great degree in this area.  A few months ago the Minister abolished the Users Councils, ostensibly on the grounds of achieving savings, but the Minister of State recognised in the Dáil that the total cost of running these two councils was £80,000 for a year.  The Government decided that for a saving of £80,000 they would abandon the consumer watchdog that was to oversee the spending of £700 million by these companies.  Those involved in serving on those councils were redeployed to other duties so that it was not a net saving to the Government at all.  We can only see this as being motivated to remove from the customer the voice that had been given to him by the Dáil when that Bill was enacted.</P>
    <P>We have seen a similar approach in the attitude to the Ombudsman who has been strangled in his operations in recent times. His investigative staff has been halved as a result of cutbacks and it was widely rumoured that the Government's intention was to withdraw the postal and telecommunications services entirely from his remit when they made those cutbacks but they were not willing to come into the Dáil to propose that.  It must be borne in mind that the Ombudsman's office was one of the great protections given by the Dáil in the past ten years to consumers. We have seen both the Users Councils set up by the Dáil and the Ombudsman's Office frustrated in their approach to these two monopoly companies.  That is to be regretted and it is obviously an <Col N="2371" /> important consideration that makes the contents of this Bill all the more important.</P>
    <P>When this legislation was drafted in 1982-1983, the legislation fudged the issue of customer service and the rights of the consumer.  It decided that these two companies would, uniquely, be exempted from the provisions of the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act, 1980.  This meant that the ordinary consumer did not even have the right to go to court if he was not satisfied with the service he obtained from them.  It also provided that there would be no requirement for the companies to have a code of practice.  The Director of Consumer Affairs at the time very eloquently summed up the difficulty when he said that, in effect, the telecommunications and postal services would be judge and jury of their services as regards the consumer and that it could inspire little confidence in a consumer no matter how the companies may say they are striving to provide a good service if at the end of the day when he has complaints he does not have the right of redress to court or the right of redress to a fair code of practice. As a result of the Government's determination to wind down the independent voice that was there and as a result of the weakness of the legislation at the outset, the consumer is now being plunged back into a state of total powerlessness as regards these companies.</P>
    <P>I recognise the progress of these companies since they were first established.  I also recognise the frustrations of consumers dealing with them.  There are numerous examples that could be cited to illustrate that.  The highest issue of complaint going to the Ombudsman is from the users of the telecommunications services.  A massive 43 per cent of his total complaints come from the users of the telecommunications services and that share has been growing over the years since the Ombudsman took on this responsibility.  It is higher than all of the other Government Departments put together.  This is a very serious indicator of the extent of consumer frustration with <Col N="2372" /> the services and particularly with the billing procedure.</P>
    <P>We have other indicators of growing frustrations.  In recent months particularly, the public have become very frustrated with the speed of delivery of post. An Post claimed recently that they are meeting 85 per cent to 90 per cent delivery on the following day.  That has been disputed and the evidence of one's own eyes is that it is not being achieved in practice.  It may be possible to show an 85 per cent next day delivery service between one part of Dublin and another but great frustration is being felt in other parts of the country because they are not getting that kind of service.  This has become such a serious issue that many radio programmes are now carrying regular items on it and it is important that we recognise this is an indicator of frustration.</P>
    <P>The condition of telephone boxes is another source of frustration for the public, with phone boxes persistently out of order.  Obviously, vandalism is one of the major causes of this but that is little consolation for consumers who feel their rights are not being properly upheld by the company.  The uncertainty of the repair service is always on people's lips. When their phones are out of order they are never sure how quickly the service will be restored.  They feel they have no redress &mdash; which they do not &mdash; for undue delay on the part of the telecommunications company in restoring the service.</P>
    <P>All of these are important elements but perhaps the greatest source of frustration is the high level of charging we have to face.  The Minister has provided figures indicating that the average phone charges in Ireland are running around 60 per cent higher than those in the rest of Europe and the position in regard to postal charges is little different, with charges running at around 25 per cent higher than in other European countries.  This is a source of frustration for the consumer and we are all aware of it.  No one can expect the companies to solve these problems overnight and no one is suggesting it is possible to do so but it is not enough <Col N="2373" /> for them to say they share the aim of resolving the problems.  There must be some agent independently evaluating progress on behalf of the consumer and there must be an adequate forum through which the consumer can seek redress.</P>
    <P>At the heart of this Bill is the proposal that the balance be titled back in favour of the consumer.  It contains a number of reforms which I believe would help to do this.  The first is contained in sections 5 and 8 which would give back to the consumer full rights and would remove the derogation these two companies have had from the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act.  This would mean that the consumer would at the very least have the right to go to court to seek redress in cases where there has been a failure to provide a service.  Obviously, it would be tricky for a consumer to take a court action against a company so large as the postal or telecommunications service.  It is only a small protection but it is very important that the consumer at the end of the day would have the right to go to court to assert his legitimate rights, in the same way as he could go to court to assert his rights in regard to any other service being provided to him or any goods being supplied to him.  It is not too much to ask that these two companies who enjoy a monopoly should recognise the consumer's rights in this area.</P>
    <P>In the consumer rights area it would also give the consumers a clear, written contract setting out their rights and this is something we have been striving to achieve in many other areas, such as the lending area.  It would be moving with the tide if we were to require that this should also be available to the consumers of the services provided by these two companies.</P>
    <P>The second major initiative to protect the consumer is to require the companies to draw up a code of practice for consumers. This proposal is outlined in sections 7 and 9 of the Bill as presented. There are many items which a code of practice could cover but obviously its main purpose would be to set out the standard of service which a consumer could expect to enjoy from these two <Col N="2374" /> companies.  It should also set out a procedure for handling complaints and arrangements for referral to the Ombudsman if a consumer cannot resolve his dispute with the company.</P>
    <P>It would also be important that a code of practice would look at areas where a consumer has automatic redress without having to go through any complaints procedure. There are areas where there should be automatic redress for consumers. For example, where faults persist on telephone lines for several working days, consumers should have the right of redress in respect of telephone bills.  This is now a requirement in other countries. Such a right to redress would recognise the consumer's entitlement and would act as a spur on the two companies to resolve these problems.</P>
    <P>Similarly, a consumer should have an automatic right of redress in cases where there is undue or excessive delay in delivering postal packages or letters or in cases where the telecommunications company have made a wrong entry in a directory.  I am not saying that there should be unlimited liability but the company should provide in a code of practice that they are willing to accede automatically to a certain level of compensation in these cases or in cases where a wrong entry has been made in a directory they could compensate in another form.</P>
    <P>Those are the elements which would make up a code of practice.  Perhaps the most important from the telecommunications consumers' point of view is that there should be some procedure for dealing with queries in regard to bills.  As the House is aware, it is a continual source of frustration for people to receive <i>pro forma</i> letters from Telecom Éireann saying their meter had been checked and that the charges are in order while, at the same time, not feeling there has been a real investigation of their case. By providing a code of practice Telecom Éireann would be able to clearly establish what procedure it carries out and consumers would be able to gain confidence in the system which exists for dealing with queries in regard to bills.  This is the <Col N="2375" /> greatest source of frustration for customers.</P>
    <P>I could not list in detail what a code of practice would contain but we have two agencies which are uniquely well placed to help the postal and telecommunications companies in drawing up such a code &mdash; they are the Director of Consumer Affairs and the Ombudsman's Office.  The Director of Consumer Affairs has helped to establish similar codes of practice in other bodies and we will see in the coming years a growing number of such codes to protect the consumer. He obviously has great experience in drawing up such codes and that is why this Bill suggests that he be involved. Similarly, the Ombudsman should also be involved because he has the experience of dealing daily with consumer complaints, particularly emanating from telecommunications consumers.  He knows the pitfalls, the frustrations which people feel, and the procedures which have fallen down in the past and he is uniquely well placed to help the company to establish a code of practice.  The bottom line is that it would help to remove the cause of complaints.  The best code of practice is one that never has to be used and that is what we must strive to achieve.</P>
    <P>I believe the telecommunications company suffer more public opprobrium than they deserve.  The bills which they send out are considerably more accurate than is suggested by the level of public feeling about them.  However, the fact that they do not have a clear code of practice, that the consumer feels unprotected, that the consumer has to go through very awkward procedures, receiving what he believes to be a cavalier response, means that this has built up to a major public issue.  This is a way of lancing that boil which, in time, will be proven to be to the good of these companies when the provisions of the Bill come into force.</P>
    <P>Of course the presence of this code is not sufficient in itself.  It is very important not only that there be a code of practice but that there be somebody independently evaluating and monitoring the use of that code.  Without such <Col N="2376" /> monitoring the code could become a dead letter, another volume of paper the company produce but meaning very little. That is why I have provided, in section 11, that the Ombudsman will take on the duty of monitoring and evaluating this code.  There may be a dispute as to who would be best suited for this responsibility, whether it is the Director of Consumer Affairs or the Ombudsman.  In practical terms, it points to the Ombudsman because he deals with the major area of billing complaints on a regular basis. At the end of the day, he constitutes the court of arbitration to which people can appeal in respect of the implementation of such a code of practice.  He is the ultimate arbiter.  It is logical that he should be the person to evaluate its progress. It would be my hope that he would be gradually working himself out of a job through the implementation of this code.</P>
    <P>It is only fair to the Ombudsman's office &mdash; recognising his existing heavy costs and also that the provisions of this Bill will involve him in extra duties &mdash; that the Minister should be given the power for which I have provided, by order, to require the levying of half of the audited costs of the Ombudsman in relation to these companies on the companies themselves.  This would provide the Ombudsman with a new source of revenue.  Also it would constitute an equitable way of sharing out the costs of investigation and would provide the telecommunications and postal companies with an added incentive to avoid having a high level of complaint if they knew this cost could be eliminated by reducing the level of recourse to the Ombudsman's office.  This would be a very good way of allocating the costs: half being paid by the company the subject of a complaint and half by the taxpayer generally.</P>
    <P>I know that the Ombudsman himself would have some misgivings about this. He would feel that his independence hinges on his sole and direct funding from the Dáil.  I would have to say that I cannot agree with that.  I cannot see how this would undermine his independence in <Col N="2377" /> any way because the two agencies concerned would not have discretion as to the amount they devoted to this activity. Rather it would be a question of the Ombudsman presenting his audited costs which would automatically become chargeable without the discretion of these companies.  Therefore, I would contend that the Ombudsman's concern about the sort of approach to funding is misplaced.  Obviously I will be interested to hear what other Members feel about it.</P>
    <P>The virtue of this code of practice is that eventually it will mean that both the Ombudsman and the companies will be able to deal much more successfully with complaints.  The introduction of Bord Telecom's new technology &mdash; that would provide the possibility of giving detailed billing, spelling out exactly what calls were made &mdash; provides another opportunity for Bord Telecom to have this issue resolved once and for all in a fair and equitable way.  I contend that the combination of these things will constitute a great improvement.</P>
    <P>Another area the provisions of this Bill tackle &mdash; in order to try to enhance consumer service and the consumer's belief that the company have his real interests at heart &mdash; is a requirement that the company should report quarterly on key elements of their service.  The sort of thing I have in mind, in particular, is the speed of postal deliveries.  That has become a major bone of contention, with people in the more remote, rural areas feeling they are not getting adequate service. I contend the company should be obliged to provide quarterly reports on the speed of delivery between different parts of the country.  Similarly, the condition of telephone boxes should be surveyed and results presented on a quarterly basis.  In that way we would know the percentage of telephone boxes in working order at a given time in different parts of the country.  Also the speed with which telephone repairs are effected should be reported, the extent to which there are problems encountered in post offices with queueing, and also the extent of complaints.  These are matters that any <Col N="2378" /> company that has an eye to its consumers at all would have at its fingertips.  It is important that the company should publish details of their performance in these areas and set themselves targets for improvement.  In that way the confidence of the consumer can be restored.</P>
    <P>There are people who say that the provision of this type of information is asking too much of companies.  I might add that this type of information is being demanded of monopoly companies in every country.  One only has to go to the United Kingdom where there is the office of telecommunications, OFTEL, and POUNC, the body dealing with the post office, bodies with very considerable teeth doing much more than just monitoring or reporting of the type I am seeking. They actually have teeth to change what happens within these bodies.  It will be seen that there is nothing onerous about asking companies to report on the quality of the service they provide.</P>
    <P>I might now look at the overall economic performance of these companies which control enormous economic resources.  They have a combined turnover of £700 million.  The fact that they are monopolies means that they are, to a great extent, free from the normal market pressures a normal company would face in the marketplace.  This means that the Dáil has no option but to put a different type of pressure on them to perform.  The approach I favour in that respect is well summed up in the report of the National Planning Board in 1984 when they examined the whole of the semi-State sector and what it was we needed to achieve a high level of economic performance from that sector.  They clearly indicated that there was a need for proxies for market forces in the key areas of borrowing, investment assessment, objectives on pricing and indices of performance, among others.</P>
    <P>What I have sought to do by way of the provisions of this Bill is to require these companies, very major ones with a great deal of potential, to improve Ireland's position as a place for conducting business.  I am requesting that they be subjected to the sorts of pressures <Col N="2379" /> the National Planning Board foresaw as the appropriate way for the Dáil to regulate such companies.  This means they should state clearly the annual borrowing limits to which they would be expected to adhere.  It means also that they should carry out clear investment assessments, providing a clear indication of what they expect to be achieved through their investment, following that up with a report on what that investment actually achieved or yielded.  It is only right that in the case of companies which, at the end of the day, command a guarantee on their loans from the taxpayer or, in some cases, State bodies enjoying support direct from the Exchequer, the taxpayer, through the Dáil, should have access to them to ensure that they are carrying out the types of investment appraisals necessary and not only doing that but are seen to be living up to the assumptions that underlay those appraisals.  There is no point in having an appraisal saying everything in the garden is rosy and then finding that a project runs way beyond budget and does not achieve the level of sales expected.  That is not investment appraisal; that is just cooking the books.  What we want to see is genuine appraisal.</P>
    <P>In the pricing area, it is very important that these companies be set a very clear objective, and that is set out in this Bill. We expect them to move to and exceed European levels on pricing.  This should be one of their major objectives.  They should report regularly on their progress and set targets for what they hope to achieve each year relative to the other countries.  This country has enough disadvantages and we should not have to face extra ones in relation to telecommunications and postal charges. These should be made the main activities of the board and I have set them out as new objectives for these two companies.</P>
    <P>The planning board had a very interesting discussion on the need for indicators of performance from companies and I think this is very apt for the telecommunications and postal companies. It is important that we see that their <Col N="2380" /> performance in relation to meaning, efficiency of utilisation and so on matches that of foreign equivalents providing similar services.  These are the ways in which we can get a handle on what the companies are doing.  It is very hard to get behind the financial figures of a monopoly body because at the end of the day the market does not operate in the same way, and profits are not a simple indicator of a successful performance by a monopoly body and certainly not by a State monopoly company and therefore, we need to supplement this with these indicators. It is important also that we see transparency between the different elements of their operations.  It does not do the taxpayer any good when there is cross-subsidisation and no reason being presented for it.  Where cross-subsidisation is occurring this Bill requires that it should be clearly flagged and if it continues there should be adequate justification for it.  Obviously in the case of the postal company there will be certain areas where there is adequate justification for it through their duty of universal service but we need to see the extent of cross-subsidisation and get a clear reason for it.</P>
    <P>I believe it is our duty to require this sort of information and to act on the recommendations of the National Planning Board because the Oireachtas Joint Committee on State-sponsored Bodies are the only body who oversee, on behalf of the taxpayer, the performance of these companies and if this information is not available to us as members of that committee it is impossible to assess their performance. Equally it is a farce that we come into this House year in, year out, and discuss the Public Capital Programme but we never see a single project appraised; we never see what is expected from a major investment initiative that has been proposed by some of these State bodies; we never see whether an initiative has lived within budget and we never see if the rosy picture that was painted of what could be achieved was delivered a year or two down the road. <Col N="2381" /> It is crucial that we focus on economic performance because I am convinced the solution to our employment problem is not to be found in some packaged answer that one can take down off the shelf and say: &ldquo;Here is the solution, it involves more spending&rdquo;, but in using the resources we have more effectively. All I am asking for in this Bill is that the monopolies who command huge resources should be required to show that they are meeting an adequate level of performance.  That is what this Bill focuses on.</P>
    <P>I know that the boards of the telecommunications and postal services have expressed a fear that this will stifle their freedom of commercial operation.  I believe very sincerely that this will not be the case.  There is a huge difference between the Dáil requiring them to account for their stewardship and to report on their performance and the Dáil seeking to impose new controls on them. There is no new control contained in this Bill.  No one is trying through this Bill to say &ldquo;We want to block the telecommunications or postal services, from doing this or that&rdquo; but, as taxpayers and as people who ultimately guarantee the operation of these companies, we want to see that they achieve the highest standards of quality at a price that the customers in Ireland have a right to demand. This Bill is not an attack on these companies; rather is it a recognition that we are living in a very difficult economic climate in the late eighties and that we have to exact the very maximum from the scarce resources available to us.</P>
    <P>We have an opportunity in this Bill to make a move in this small section of State enterprise so that we can enhance performance, create new opportunities and prove that we can do the very best with the most efficiency.  The telecommunications company are at the leading end of technology.  They command high resources and they must be seen to deliver on price and quality.  The frustration of consumers will be very quickly lanced and cured if the new duties of the board which are contained in this Bill are adopted by the Dáil.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Minister for Communications (Mr. R. Burke) Raphael P. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Communications (Mr. R. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened carefully to what Deputy Bruton has had to say.  We have a common interest in the continuing welfare and development of the companies, in ensuring that the charges are kept at minimum rates consistent with the requirements of the legislation and in seeing that the companies provide comprehensive and efficient service to their customers.  However, I am not satisfied that the Deputy's approach to the problems he has outlined is the appropriate one.</P>
      <P>The explanatory memorandum circulated with the Bill says that its principal purpose is to improve the responsiveness of Bord Telecom Éireann and An Post to their customers' needs and complaints and to extend the public accountability of both companies.  These are aims we can agree to, but I believe the methods proposed by Deputy Bruton for achieving them are not the best.</P>
      <P>As Minister for Communications I have to ensure that no action is taken that would weaken the commercial mandate of the two companies and that would require disclosure of information that would work to the economic disadvantage of the companies.  I will deal with these points in some detail in a few moments.  First of all, I think it appropriate to outline the performances of An Post and of Bord Telecom Éireann since they were set up on 1 January 1984 and the companies' plans for the future.  I will deal first with An Post.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since it commenced operations An Post has been achieving improving financial results each year.  Since its establishment the company has shown a continuous improvement.  In its first two years of operation the company suffered losses but happily that trend has been reversed and profits were recorded in 1986 and 1987.  Last year the company made a profit of £2.776 million, including the national lottery management fee, representing an increase of over £2 million on the 1986 profit figure.  The volume of mail handled by An Post has been growing at a steady rate and is now 16 per cent higher than when the company <Col N="2383" /> took over four years ago.  Particular growth is being achieved in key strategic mail areas such as express mail and business reply.  The number of countries to which the express mail service of An Post operates more than doubled last year, from 36 to 75, and that number is expected to reach 100 in 1988.</P>
    <P>For the second year running An Post has maintained its postal charges at 1986 levels and the charges will be maintained at least to the end of 1988.  The last increase took place in March 1986.  In real terms our postal charges have been reduced by 8 per cent over the past four years.  It is a source of concern that our postal charges are still so high relative to our European competitors.  This situation is a reflection of the operating costs which An Post has had to bear and which it inherited from the former Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  I can assure the House that the company is fully conscious of the need to reduce its costs.  Thanks to the efforts of An Post our postal charges now compare much more favourably with those of other EC states.  In fact Ireland's charges now come fourth in the EC league table, as compared with first and second highest some three years ago.  An Post is a labour-intensive company and staffing costs account for 76 per cent of the company's total costs.  The company, with a view to making a major reduction in staffing costs and staff numbers, has introduced a self-financing productivity agreement.  Last year there was a reduction of some 500 in the staffing of An Post.</P>
    <P>The general quality of the mail service has been highly satisfactory since the establishment of An Post.  The company in 1986 succeeded in reaching its target of delivery of 90 per cent of letters on the working day after posting.  Regrettably, there has been a down-turn lately in the standard of service because of industrial relations problems and this is a cause of serious concern both to the company and myself.  An Post is giving the highest priority to resolving the problem.  Needless to say, I attach a high priority to surveys of standards of mail deliveries <Col N="2384" /> and I will be monitoring the situation very carefully.  In fact, I have made arrangements to have the results of independent surveys carried out by An Post made available to my Department.</P>
    <P>The parcel service of An Post continues to cause serious problems.  Last year there was a loss of £5.6 million on the service.  Clearly there is a need for remedial action.  An Post has drawn up a plan to solve the problems of this particular service and hopefully the company will succeed in resolving the problems and in building a profitable service that meets the needs of customers.</P>
    <P>An Post is committed to the highest levels of customer service.  The company has established customer panels so that its customers will have the opportunity to inform the company of their views of the service and of making suggestions about how it might be improved.  An Post is totally committed to the concept of much closer relationships with its customers in every sector of its business.</P>
    <P>In the provision of agency services, whether for Government Departments or other bodies, An Post has been providing a most satisfactory standard of service. Deputies will be aware that a subsidiary of An Post, the National Lottery Company, operates the national lottery under licence from the Minister for Finance.  The fact that the national lottery has been operating with spectacular success is an example of the capacity and professionalism of the staff of the company in the matter of the provision of agency services.  In the collection of television licence fees An Post acts as agents for the Minister for Communications. For the last three years the company has achieved the collection targets agreed with RTE.  The number of licence holders is now 100,000 more than in 1984.</P>
    <P>The company's capital development programme covering accommodation projects, replacement of motor vehicles and provision of equipment is funded totally from its own resources and borrowings and there is no draw on the Exchequer.  Prior to the establishment of An Post investment in the postal service was minimal.  In summary, An Post has <Col N="2385" /> served the country very well and I am satisfied with the company's progress in the short period of its existence.  There are challenges to be faced and I am confident that the company will cope successfully with them.  An Post's overall objective is to achieve profitable growth through the development of existing and new services for its customers and continual striving for improved productivity to minimise costs.</P>
    <P>Turning to Bord Telecom Éireann I believe it is only fair to record that since its inception the company has brought about a veritable transformation in the national telecommunications system. The quality of the infrastructure has been consistently upgraded and the range and quality of services has been greatly improved.  Telecom Éireann has gone a long way towards eliminating the waiting list for telephones.  The waiting list today is 17,000 compared with 60,000 in January 1984.  This year alone over 75,500 connections were made and 58 per cent of these connections would have been completed within three months of application. The standard of service, which in the past had been a hindrance to bodies such as the IDA who were seeking to encourage foreign firms to locate in Ireland, has been improved to such a degree that it is now a major contributory factor to present day successes in wooing foreign firms to our shores.  The Custom House Docks Financial Services project is perhaps the most notable testimony to this fact.</P>
    <P>The quality of the service has improved to such an extent that the local call failure rate for the whole of 1987 was significantly better than the 2 per cent target rate set by the company.  The call failure rate in 1984 was almost 4 per cent.  The failure rate for STD calls is now down to 2 per cent compared to 24 per cent in 1984.  The Postal and Telecommunications Review Group in 1979 called for an average faults rate not exceeding one per telephone per annum. At present the average fault rate is one per telephone every two years.  This is twice as good as the review group's target.  Seventy-eight per cent of the <Col N="2386" /> faults which do occur are now cleared within two working days.  Improving the quality of the repair service is a long hard haul &mdash; it involves upgrading local plant, pressurising cables, computerising testing procedures and organising repair teams in an optimal manner.  Telecom Éireann has attacked these areas vigorously from the beginning.  Computerised central repair centres which were introduced in Cork in 1985-86 and extended later to Dublin are having a significant impact on the standard of the fault repair service.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be well aware that most of the complaints received by the Ombudsman relate to billing.  One can never expect a bill to be popular and the telephone bill has as bad a press as the next one.  Telecom Éireann gets, and expects to get, a lot of queries about bills.  Indeed, it has put much effort, for example by inaugurating a free-phone telephone inquiry service, into making it easier for people to query their bills.  They have also tried to facilitate people in paying their bills by introducing a range of new payment methods.  Needless to say, paying up will never be painless.  To put the problem into perspective over three million bills totalling £516 million approximately are issued annually.</P>
    <P>Telcome Éireann is very conscious of the need to improve public confidence in its billing system and to this end decided to invest some £20 million in equipment which will enable it to provide itemised billing for those of its customers who require it.  While it is my firm view that Telecom Éireann must constantly strive to eliminate customer complaints, it is worth while to reflect that the number of complaints received by the Ombudsman indicates that less than 0.3 per cent of Telecom Éireann's customers are dissatisfied with the service being provided by the company.</P>
    <P>It is also worth mentioning that an independent Swedish consultant firm, which was commissioned by the former Department of Posts and Telegraphs, reported that the billing system was fully satisfactory by European standards and commented that substantial expenditure <Col N="2387" /> on generating detailed call information was not objectively warranted by any shortcomings in the billing system. However, the fact that Telecom Éireann decided to undertake this expenditure is, I believe, an indication of the company's commitment to improving its relations with its customers.  The new itemised billing system will be available in Dublin this year and nationally at a later stage.  As the House is aware, this system is not yet available in Britain or, indeed, in very many European countries.</P>
    <P>The cost of the dramatic transformation of our national telecommunications services has been very significant by any standards.  Since 1979 when the Government of the day &mdash; and I am proud to say I was a member of that Government &mdash; decided to reorganise the telecommunications service into a semi-State organisation and to invest heavily in upgrading the infrastructure, almost £1.4 billion has been spent.</P>
    <P>In one sense we were fortunate that the rapid development in our network has only taken place in recent years.  We have been able to take advantage of the latest technology and now Ireland has one of the most technologically advanced networks in the world.  Telecom Éireann is already well advanced in the building of a countrywide Integrated Digital Network, IDN, of exchange and transmission systems.  As well as providing better conventional services, this places the company in a very strong position to provide advanced services immediately and to move to full ISDN, Integrated Services Digital Network, whenever the world standards and equipment are fully defined and available.  Already all of the main trunk centres as well as many local exchanges are digital and these are being linked by a backbone network of digital transmission systems on microwave radio systems, optical fibres and co-axial cables.</P>
    <P>A sum of IR£343 million has been invested in digital switching systems since 1979.  Some IR£226 million has been spent on transmission systems, including digital radio transmission and more <Col N="2388" /> recently optical fibre systems.  The greatest proportion of expenditure has been in the local network, providing circuits to the customer's premises or residence. Since 1979, IR£610 million has been invested in the local network.  A further IR£200 million has been spent on new buildings specially designed for computer technology and on various other improvements such as new fault handling systems and computerised operator services.</P>
    <P>Telecom Éireann invests in the region of £130 million per annum in the network to ensure that Ireland's technological edge is maintained.  A new Ireland-UK fibre optic cable will be brought into service this summer &mdash; it will connect Portmarnock in North County Dublin with Annesley &mdash; and IR£20 million is being invested in the trans-Atlantic fibre optic cable, PTAT &mdash; 1 which will have a spur to Cork.</P>
    <P>The entire investment programme has been financed by borrowing and by funds generated internally by the telecoms system.  No part of the cost of that borrowing will be borne by the taxpayer. Apart from about £335 million in equity, Telecom Éireann took over in 1984 all the liabilities of the telecoms service in the form of debt.  The debt is being fully remunerated without recourse to the taxpayer or to Exchequer funds in any form. It is intended that Telecom Éireann will remunerate its equity capital in due course by way of dividends.  Far from imposing on the taxpayer, the company is a major contributor to Exchequer funds.  Of a turnover of £516 million, about £150 million goes to the Exchequer in taxes of various kinds.</P>
    <P>From a situation where the service was losing money at a rate of £70 million a year in 1984, it is expected that Telecom Éireann will show a modest profit in 1987-88. This has been achieved while keeping real price increases below the rate of inflation.  This requires Telecom Éireann to keep a tight and continuing control on costs, a control which they are, in fact, in process of intensifying just now.  Prices <Col N="2389" /> are still high by international comparisons and the financial pressures constrain Telecom Éireann from doing all they would like to do on prices but some prices have been cut substantially and further reductions are in the pipeline.  For example, international call charges to the United States, Canada, the EC and some other countries were cut by 10 per cent on 1 April 1986 and from the 1 October 1988 the following reductions will be implemented: (i) 20 per cent reduction in EC countries and Switzerland; (ii) 25 per cent reduction in North America; (iii) 30 per cent reduction in Australia, Hong Kong, Japan, New Zealand, Saudi Arabia, Singapore and South Africa. There will be no change in Irish or cross-Channel charges this year, thus giving a reduction in charges in real terms as charges for these services were last increased in April 1986.</P>
    <P>It has been said that local call rates in Ireland exceed those of our European neighbours but if we are not the cheapest for local calls, we are not the dearest either.  On the question of international comparisons, it is not always possible to compare like with like.  Because of the variation and complexity of pricing structures, and leaving aside altogether currency exchange considerations and problems of purchasing power parities, a comparison of telephone charges between different countries is seldom straightforward.</P>
    <P>We must not overlook the new services introduced by Telecom Éireann since 1984.  These include Eirpac &mdash; a packet switched data network; Eirmail &mdash; an electronic mail service; and Eircell &mdash; a mobile cellular radio telephone system. A new nationwide paging system, Eirpage, is about to be launched.</P>
    <P>For subscribers connected to digital exchanges a new range of services, un-dreamt of here a few years ago, is available. Subscribers can activate their own alarm clock calls, direct calls within their own exchange area, learn by a special tone that there is another call waiting, participate in a three party conference call or have a &ldquo;hotline&rdquo; facility whereby a pre-programme number is automatically <Col N="2390" /> entered on lifting the handset.  This new service is especially useful to the elderly and people living alone.</P>
    <P>What of Telecon Eireann's future development plans?  As I mentioned earlier, the company invests about £130 million annually in the network in order to keep abreast of technological developments. Apart from the imminent launch of its new national paging system &mdash; Eirpage &mdash; the company from mid-1988 will provide an overlay Digital Network offering the latest in digital leased data circuit technology to Irish business.  The company is committed under our EC obligations to have an Integrated Services Digital Network in place by 1993 and is well ahead of its commitments in this regard.  An Integrated Services Digital Network, ISDN, will mean that fax, telephone, telex and data services will be carried on a single network and the user will probably have a single multi-purpose ISDN terminal.</P>
    <P>Work is progressing internationally on the development of the technical specifications, standards and equipment for ISDN and Telecom Éireann is taking part in the EC ISDN trials.  ISDN will be another step in information technology by making the access to and use of information even easier for the user.</P>
    <P>Broadband communications are another service of the future.  Broadband communications would involve very high capacity circuits carrying voice, text and video information over the same network. It is thought that the technology to provide these sophisticated services will be available by the middle of the next decade.  Telecom Éireann's associate company, Broadcom Éireann Research Limited, was established to carry out research into broadband communications and it recently secured contracts from the EC RACE Programme for research in this field.  In the light of all of these developments I am sure that it will be generally accepted that, on the whole, Telecom Éireann's performance since its inception has been a praiseworthy one.</P>
    <P>I now propose to outline my greatest concerns about the Bill.  First of all, nothing must be done by legislation which <Col N="2391" /> cuts across the commercial mandate of the companies.  They were set up by Act of the Oireachtas and given certain commercial objectives.  These objectives cannot be lightly set aside after only four years.</P>
    <P>An Post and Telecom Éireann are still at their development stage and in only their fifth year of operation.  Proposals to amend the legislative structure governing the two companies should be brought forward as soon as serious flaws in the performance of the two companies have been identified and all other possible corrective measures have been exhausted.  I do not accept that such a situation has been reached.  I am also concerned lest the companies should be required by law to publish commercial information which would place them at a commercial disadvantage <i>vis-á-vis</i> other participants in the market place.  As you will know, both companies have competitors in the marketplace and the publication of commercially sensitive information could not but place certain of their activities in jeopardy.</P>
    <P>The Bill would require the two companies to include in their annual reports a comparison with similar companies in the European Community in relation to certain management performance indicators. Compilation of the range of information required by this provision could well be a time-consuming and financially expensive exercise.  The basic comparative data may not always be readily available or forthcoming.  By their very nature, international comparisons of performance are not always meaningful because of variations in the underlying factors such as different distribution networks, different distributions of populations and traffic volumes.</P>
    <P>Publication of revenue and cost summaries for the different business components of operations of the two companies would have to be carefully considered to ensure that economic damage would not be done in the case of An Post.  For Telecom, for example, allocation of costs between residential <Col N="2392" /> and business users is not technically possible and to legislate for this would be meaningless.</P>
    <P>The size of the capital development programmes of An Post and Telecom Éireann is set out in the public capital programme which is published each year. I do not see the need, therefore, for advance publication of the borrowing requirements of the two companies.  As regards publication of appraisal of major investment proposals, I feel that the House will understand that the disclosure of such information would be commercially imprudent.  Such a requirement would also represent undue interference with the day-to-day activities of the companies. It would also be seen by them as heralding a return to the detailed ministerial control of the operational aspects of the postal and telecommunications services that existed prior to the establishment of An Post and Telecom Éireann.</P>
    <P>With regard to quarterly reports I should inform the House that I already get extensive quarterly reports from the two companies. These reports cover the principal operational areas of the companies.  However, these are reports prepared for management information purposes.  To have them prepared pursuant to a statutory provision would put them into quite a different category and would serve as another mechanism to pull the day-to-day operations of the companies into the political arena.</P>
    <P>The Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act, 1980, already applies to both companies, save for section 39.  That section could not be applied to the provision of international services by either company, for reasons I will come to in a moment.  There is also an exemption for internal services but there is an existing legislative mechanism for removing that exemption.  In fact, the question of making an order to remove the exemption for internal services is already being considered but I could not anticipate the outcome as so many very significant factors have to be taken into account.  For example, I am advised that application of <Col N="2393" /> that section to the postal service would require An Post to introduce detailed checking and tracing systems from acceptance point to delivery point in respect of each and every item passing through the post &mdash; over 450 million items a year.  Such systems would have to provide not only proof of posting, and detailed monitoring of the progress of each and every item through the post to point of delivery but also proof of delivery.</P>
    <P>The introduction of detailed tracing systems would add enormously to the cost of processing mails, reflecting itself in much higher prices to the consumer and the delays involved at acceptance point and each point of handling would be such as to make them unacceptable from the customer's point of view.</P>
    <P>The registered service for inland mail, generally speaking, provides the type of protection for the customer which the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act, 1980, seeks to impose on the service as a whole.  The pricing implications for the customer of imposing the same duty of care in relation to non-registered items would make the cost of posting a letter prohibitive in relation to other forms of communication which are available.</P>
    <P>In general section 39 of the Act would impose a very heavy unreasonable burden on the company, add substantially to the cost of the service ultimately to the detriment of customers and impose delays in delivery, which would be totally unacceptable to customers effecting the transaction of business and commerce.</P>
    <P>Both companies are exempted from section 39 of the 1980 Act in regard to international services because under conventions of the Universal Postal Union and the International Telecommunications Union, of which Ireland is a member, postal and telecommunications administrations do not accept liability towards users of international services except, in the case of postal services, for certain registered or insured services.  Application of section 39 of the 1980 Act to international services is therefore impossible.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2394" /> Application of section 39 to internal telecommunications services would pose serious difficulties for Telecom Éireann. By its very nature the service would be exposed to much contentious litigation.  I do not have to spell out how difficult it would be to determine the extent of damage which might be caused through failure on the company's part in the provision of service if the provisions in the Deputy's Bill were to be adopted.</P>
    <P>On the question of contracts, I note that the Bill would require An Post to enter into contracts for all charges to be made by it, the terms and conditions to be applicable to its services and the prohibition of transmission of objectionable matter.  Assuming that An Post serves every household and business enterprise in the State, whether for internal or international services, or both, I would have serious reservations about the practicability of this requirement.</P>
    <P>I have no difficulty about having regard to the performance of the company's services, before agreeing to an increase in charges.  As I have already indicated, I monitor the performance on a continual basis.</P>
    <P>So far as individual contracts for telephone subscribers are concerned all of Telecom Éireann's customers have agreements with the company.  To enter into 750,000 contracts, which require amendment as each service or service charge is revised, would stultify the commercial activities of the organisation.</P>
    <P>The charges for the services provided can be varied from time to time without the need to alter the agreements.  This arrangement is commercially workable. A requirement to replace the agreements by contracts would appear to be much more expensive and an inconvenient way for Telecom Éireann to go about its business.</P>
    <P>The Bill proposes an extension of the Ombudsman's powers by giving him a role in the drawing up of codes of practice and in the adjudication of disputes with customers.  This would represent a major change in the Ombudsman's powers, as the existing legislation merely empowers him to investigate complaints and his final <Col N="2395" /> sanction in law involves reporting the results thereof to the Oireachtas. Accordingly, any proposals for changes in the functions of the Ombudsman would be more appropriate for consideration in the context of amending the legislation dealing specifically with his Office.</P>
    <P>I have adverted only to my principal objections to the Bill.  These cover points of substance affecting the policy under which these two major State companies operate.  There are many technical points which I have not touched on but I think I have said enough to convince the House that this measure is not appropriate or opportune.  Neither is it likely to aid the companies or their customers in any significant measure.  I have given examples where the Bill could work to the disadvantage of the customers.</P>
    <P>I accept that the Deputy's legitimate intention was to improve the whole level of responsiveness of Bord Telecom and An Post to their customers' needs and the constraints and to extend the public accountability of both companies.  I think I have given enough examples where the Bill could work to the disadvantage of the customers rather than the intention of the Bill.  Accordingly, I ask the proposer to reconsider the motion for a Second Reading of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOMalley" hpid="Mr. P. O'Malley Mr. P. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill which seeks to give a better deal to the consumers of postal and telecommunications services as provided by An Post and Bord Telecom Éireann.  The objective of the Bill is to ensure that both these companies would improve their responsiveness to customer needs and complaints and their level of service and charges would be brought more into line with the best standards prevailing in the EC.  These are very desirable objectives and the Bill seems to be going the right way in trying to address these problems that undoubtedly exist in both companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, one of the complaints I have about the Bill is that it is too confining. It provides for consumer protection and <Col N="2396" /> reduction of charges in only two of our commercial State-sponsored bodies.  I would like to see the provisions of this Bill extended to other commercial State-sponsored bodies who have a monopoly also in terms of the services they provide, such as the ESB and the VHI board. Consumers of these services also need redress in relation to complaints and charges but they are not getting a fair deal because in a monopoly position which provides services that people need the consumer has no choice but to use those services even though he can be very dissatisfied with the level of service he is getting.  For example, the ESB are required to break even on an annual basis and, of course, that is an easy thing to do if you can pass on all your costs to the consumer.  They are not required to publish a report of performance on key indicators of quality of service to the consumer, including comparisons with charges for electricity in other countries, and there is no target for getting their charges down within a specified time frame.  That is why it is a pity the scope of this Bill does not extend to other commercial State-sponsored bodies like the ESB.</P>
    <P>An Post and Bord Telecom Éireann have achieved a great deal in the last few years and the structural change from the Civil Service to a commercial entity has undoubtedly led to a better standard of performance and an improvement in the level of service to the public.  Bord Telecom Éireann since 1984 have cut their losses from £100 million to a virtual break even in 1987.  The automation of the telephone network has been completed, the fault rate has been reduced and prices have not been increased over the last two years.  However, the main priorities of Bord Telecom Éireann must be to reduce their prices in line with those prevailing in other European countries and they must give urgent attention to the whole area of customer relations now that other aspects of their operations have been put on a better footing.</P>
    <P>The Bill proposes to establish a new code of practice for both BTE and An Phost for dealing with complaints.  This <Col N="2397" /> code of practice would be drawn up after consultation with each of the companies, the Director of Consumer Affairs and the Ombudsman.  I also note in the Bill it is proposed that the Ombudsman should be given responsibility for monitoring the operation of the consumer code of practice and that he should be paid a fee by both companies to cover his costs in relation to that function.  I have no doubt that the Ombudsman would not object to that proposal, particularly as far as Bord Telecom are concerned because, as he highlights in his 1987 report, the number of valid complaints against Bord Telecom exceeded the number of complaints he received against the whole Civil Service.</P>
    <P>The number of complaints about An Post also increased in the year ending 1987.  In the same report, the Ombudsman drew attention to the very serious handicap he has <i>vis-à-vis</i> the cutbacks which have affected staffing levels and, consequently, the processing of complaints which have had to be delayed. That is a very unsatisfactory development as far as the consumer is concerned.</P>
    <P>In the case of Bord Telecom, the Ombudsman reported a number of cases where the company failed to detect faults until extensive investigations had been conducted at his request.  In two of these cases rebates of £1,600 and £1,700 were allowed by Bord Telecom.  I accept that some complaints can be vexatious and that it is not possible to investigate every complaint, but the Ombudsman highlighted the need for a change in the company's procedures to enable them to be more effective in detecting faults and dealing with complaints in a reasonable time.  The measures in the Bill will assist greatly in that whole area.</P>
    <P>One of the main complaints regarding Bord Telecom service is the matter of telephone accounts and billing.  Detailed information is not available on these at the moment and it is extremely difficult to get information and to have your complaints redressed.  A high percentage of complaints about overcharging have been proved, on examination, to be correct after the Ombudsman had investigated <Col N="2398" /> them and it has been shown that the consumer has very great difficulty in trying to establish that he has a just complaint.</P>
    <P>The chairman of Bord Telecom confirmed in evidence to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Commercial State-Sponsored Bodies recently that the company are installing a call logging system which will alleviate the problems in this area and the Minister referred to this in his contribution.  The system costs approximately £20 million and it is expected to be fully operational later this year.  Any customer will be able to get a printout which will give details of a bill, including the duration, destination and time of call and a charge of £4 will be made for providing this service.  The chairman of the board confirms that this was an investment which he personally did not want to make but, eventually, the company had to yield to pressure which was building up in relation to dissatisfied customers who were querying their charges.  The chairman's view was that £20 million could have been better spent by Bord Telecom but, because of pressure from consumers in relation to bill queries, he felt the company had no option but to go ahead and install this system.</P>
    <P>The chairman is also of the opinion that you cannot win when dealing with the public on the provision of a telephone service because, originally, the complaint was that the service was wrong.  If you get that right, the complaint is that the billing system is wrong and, now that they intend to sort this out, he guaranteed that complaints will still come from people who will not believe the evidence detailed on the printout and who will deny that they ever made the calls.  I do not accept that.  He is being too cynical about the attitudes of people in relation to this matter.  Consumers have a right to determine whether they are being overcharged and I am certain that the vast majority of complaints, after this logging system is operational, will be justified.</P>
    <P>The other major area of complaint by telephone subscribers is the delay in having reported telephone faults repaired.  The faults report system does <Col N="2399" /> not give a person information as to the nature of the fault or when he or she can expect their telephone to be back in action.  You are left hoping that somebody will do something about getting your telephone repaired.  It is right, as proposed in the Bill, that people should have redress when their telephone is out of service for some time, particularly in view of the high rental charges.  Compensation should be paid if a telephone is out of service for more than a few days.</P>
    <P>An Post have performed well since they were put on a commercial footing in 1984.  They are moving from the legacy of inadequacy they inherited from the days when they were part of the Civil Service.  The company made a profit of almost £3 million in 1987 but, of course, the major part of this was attributable to the fees they earned under the national lottery.  It is important that there should be more transparency in the company's accounting system to highlight whether there is cross-subsidisation or loss making services.</P>
    <P>Irish postal charges remain high in European terms and they constitute a cost penalty to consumers, particularly companies who rely heavily on the postal service for transacting business.  There is, undoubtedly, dissatisfaction with many aspects of the postal service, especially in relation to delivery times.  For example, while the company believe they are meeting their targets of 90 per cent of internal letters delivered the following day &mdash; the Minister confirmed that that is the position &mdash; independent research by the consumers' association has put this at 81 per cent.  This unreliability of delivery has led to the growth of the private courier service in recent years.</P>
    <P>Even though An Post are supposed to have a monopoly on the carriage of postal packets in the State under the Postal and Telecommunications Services Act, 1983, whether these courier services operate legally is not the point at issue.  It is obvious that An Post must improve their service to the consumer by becoming more efficient in their delivery times and more cost effective in their overall operations. <Col N="2400" /> The annual targets set out in the Bill are very worthwhile in that regard.</P>
    <P>By European standards, Irish postal charges are still high.  At 28p &mdash; the price of a stamp for an inland letter &mdash; it is the fourth highest in 19 countries.  The Department of Industry and Commerce review of industrial performance in 1986 noted that postal charges facing Irish industry were 36 per cent higher than the European Community average.  This is a disincentive to new companies to locate in Ireland.  In particular, it could hinder the effort to attract new service companies in sectors such as finance and mail order.</P>
    <P>Apart from late delivery and high charges, another area of the services of An Post giving rise to concern is the withdrawal in many locations of counter services where sub-post offices have been closed.  I accept that we have a higher ratio of post offices per head of population than other European countries, including Britain, but Ireland's relatively low population density must be taken into account.</P>
    <P>Many of the users of counter services are elderly people or social welfare recipients who attend the local post office for payment of their social welfare benefits. It would be imposing hardship on many of these people if they had to travel a distance and, in many cases, the bus fare would be a major expenditure.  I am particularly concerned about the closure of some sub-post offices in suburban areas which has been brought about by persistent robberies.  An Post take the view that they can no longer afford to have a sub-post office in such areas but this is capitulating to the criminal.  If we are going to deprive people of a service in an area because the State is unable to tackle the level of crime, that is a very sad comment on the state of affairs here.</P>
    <P>There is another very important aspect of consumers' rights in relation to the services provided by Bord Telecom and An Post that I wish to raise and that relates to the interception of mail and telecommunications messages, which <Col N="2401" /> includes telephone tapping and the bugging of phone calls.  At present the practice is that a warrant to intercept mail or place a listening device on a subscriber's telephone line is issued by the Minister for Justice on the advice of the Garda Commissioner or the Chief of Staff.  The practice has been that such interceptions are not authorised by the Minister for Justice except in cases where it can be clearly established that it would be likely to provide information relevant to serious crime investigations or where the security of the State is being threatened.</P>
    <P>However, this practice has not always been followed by the Minister of the day and, in fact, arising out of a court action some years ago the State had to pay substantial compensation to two journalists whose telephones had been tapped on foot of a warrant issued by the then Minister for Justice.  The purpose of the telephone tapping on that occasion was apparently to listen in for information that might be coming from Government sources to journalists in the normal course of their work.  The telephone tapping on that occasion was found to be unlawful and an invasion of the citizen's right to privacy under the Constitution.</P>
    <P>I am surprised that Fine Gael have not brought forward proposals in the Bill to deal with the matter as they made great political capital out of the unlawful actions of the then Minister for Justice. The Coalition Government published a Bill to regulate this area of activity but it fell with the change of Government last year and the Government have not put the Bill, or a similar measure, back on the Order Paper.  In order to eliminate abuses of the established practice and in order to ensure that similar breaches of ministerial powers do not occur in the future, my party will be tabling an amendment to the Bill, if it reaches Committee Stage, to ensure that a proper statutory basis exists governing the conditions under which any Minister for Justice has the power to issue warrants for telephone tapping or mail interception.</P>
    <P>The Bill before us provided an opportunity for incorporation of up-to-date <Col N="2402" /> legislation on this matter and I regret it has not been included in it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickOMalley" hpid="Mr. P. O'Malley Mr. P. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>In my view the Bill before us is the appropriate piece of legislation to incorporate the measures I spoke about and I regret it does not do so.  The ordinary law-abiding citizen is entitled to have legislation in place which protects his right to privacy and, if he believes that his communications have been improperly intercepted, he should have a statutory procedure available to him to enable his complaint to be investigated speedily.  If his complaint is upheld, then the warrant should be quashed and he should be automatically entitled to a specified amount of compensation.</P>
      <P>The Bill is useful in that it critically looks at what is wrong with the services that An Post and Telecom Éireann are providing.  It requires them to make quarterly reports detailing the frequency of faults that arise in their services and also the level of charges which they are making.  Undoubtedly, it would give the consumer better protection.  We will be supporting it but we will be tabling amendments on Committee Stage to put its shortcomings right, if it reaches Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>The intention of the Bill is to improve the responsiveness of Telecom Éireann and An Post to their customers.  It deals with complaints and seeks to extend the public accountability of both companies.  The Minister told us tonight he does not hold any objection to that.  There is general agreement that the two companies have performed excellently since their formation but I wonder if the provisions of the Bill will improve the services they provide to their customers?</P>
      <P>One should look at the performance of the two companies since their formation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2403" /> An Post was formed against a background of what one might call a difficult economic environment but within a short period of three years the company turned a loss into a modest profit in 1986.  They improved their position in 1987.  There have been many notable achievements by the company since 1984.  The mail traffic volume is now 14 per cent higher than when the company was formed.  We all must agree that the quality of the service remains high, with about 90 per cent of letters being delivered on the working day after posting.  I am satisfied that An Post is doing a good job and providing a high quality and reliable service.  I should like to express my appreciation to everybody involved in the success of An Post since its formation.</P>
    <P>Since vesting day in 1984 An Post has displayed great energy, resourcefulness, and lots of imagination.  From the outset the company presented a vigorous and vibrant image and adopted a number of initiatives.  There are many examples such as the St. Patrick's Day cards, Valentine's Day stamps and the introduction of bureau de change facilities.  The development of express mail service is being given a high priority by An Post. In a world where speed and reliability is becoming the norm a first-class express mail delivery is of great importance.</P>
    <P>I am sure most Members were disappointed with the report for 1986-87 in that it stated there was an increase in the number of work days lost through various disruptions.  However, it is important to state that there has been co-operation between management, the recognised unions and staff associations in the company. They looked at the procedures with the objective of keeping losses and disruptions to the minimum.  Management changes in regard to decentralisation and the devolution of responsibility for day-to-day industrial relations matters have meant that problems when they arise are dealt with quickly.</P>
    <P>The staff of all companies are concerned about the standard of their accommodation at work.  In this regard An Post are doing remarkably well.  From their <Col N="2404" /> own resources they are providing good quality staff accommodation and are engaged in a major building programme, including the provision of new delivery and sorting offices and the extension and refurbishment of existing post office premises.  Between 1984 and 1986 An Post spent £7.67 million on building works and refurbishment schemes at 18 offices.  In its formative years An Post needed Exchequer assistance and in 1984-85 received £9 million.  This had to change because of the state of the public finances and the company had to be resourceful.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I am trying in my amendment No. 18 to differentiate between a person caught on premises and the fine levied on the publican for having that person on the premises after the permitted hours and a publican who actually sells alcohol or exposes alcohol for sale on his premises after hours.  It is a greater offence for a publican to sell drink after the permitted hours than to endeavour unsuccessfully to get people off his premises.  There are two separate offences and they should be distinguished.</P>
      <P>Section 25 (2) states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every person who shall sell or expose for sale any intoxicating liquor or open or keep open any premises for the sale of intoxicating liquor or permit any intoxicating liquor to be consumed on licensed premises in contravention of this section shall be guilty of an offence under this section and shall be liable on summary convication thereof, in the case of a first offence, to a fine <Col N="2406" /> not exceeding £400, or, in the case of a second or any subsequent offence, to a fine not exceeding £800.</P>
    <P>The Minister felt it would be difficult to provide an amendment to achieve what I have in mind, but I suggest that the amendment I have tabled meets the point.  It provides that the maximum fine for a first offence will be £300 for allowing or permitting persons to remain on the premises after closing hours and the maximum fine will be £400 for selling or exposing for sale intoxicating liquor after closing hours.  That distinguishes between the two offences.  The Minister's amendment relates to section 29 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1962 which deals with permitting persons to be on licensed premises during prohibited hours.  He is increasing the penalty to £400 for the first offence and £800 for any subsequent offence.  He is not distinguishing between the two offences as I am endeavouring to do.  That distinction is worthwhile.</P>
    <P>I am quite certain that a district justice would take the circumstances into account when dealing with individual cases.  A number of publicans have made the point that there is nothing to stop anybody from ordering three pints ten minutes before closing time and it can be a very difficult job to get those people off the premises.  There is an onus on the publican to do it and it is an offence if he does not succeed.  A publican who deliberately serves drink 15 minutes after closing time is surely committing a greater offence than the person who is endeavouring to get people off his premises. It is worth distinguishing between the two offences as I have done in my amendment.  I will be interested to hear what my colleagues have to say about it and whether they feel there is any merit in it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy Barrett's amendment.  I agree that there is a need to distinguish between the fine imposed on a licence for allowing people to remain on the premises and the fine imposed on the licensee who sells or exposes liquor for sale after the permitted time.  The <Col N="2407" /> Minister might very well accept this amendment.  It is an attempt to break down the traditional practice of daring the law when people purchase three pints ten minutes before closing time and then take on the publican and everyone else. In some pubs in Dublin there is an overbearing barman who rattles keys and thumps tubs and people who have paid substantial sums for the luxury of their pint are inclined to react to the attitude displayed by the barman and the owner of the hostelry.  The publican who is endeavouring to do his job according to the law should be recognised by the Minister. If he is unfortunate in that the Garda feel it necessary to summons him for a breach of the licensing law there should be a distinction between the publican who has made evry effort to clear his premises and the other fellow who has deliberately decided to flout the law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment for one main reason.  The offence related to prohibited hours is the traditional six-count offence.  Some of the counts are more serious than others.  Selling is more serious than keeping open for sale in the circumstances outlined by Deputy Barrett. They are all endorsable offences. Deputy Barrett's amendment highlights the distinction in gravity between the counts.  Once a summons is brought under the prohibited hours section, there is not much distinction made as between the counts on it.  Such a distinction should be made and this amendment directs the attention of the court towards making that distinction.  In that regard the amendment has merit although its drafting could be looked at to make the point more precisely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 64 is being discussed with this amendment.  This is the Minister's amendment designed to increase the penalties under the 1962 Act for prohibited hours offences.  Notwithstanding inflation, the increases the Minister is proposing are out of proportion.  To increase the maximum from £20 to £400 and for a second offence from £40 to £800 is ridiculous.  This is not a great area of <Col N="2408" /> social jeopardy and these offences are not gravely offensive to the body corporate or to the body politic.  To propose penalties of that magnitude, I respectfully suggest to the Minister, is disproportionate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I have to disagree with Deputy Cooney's views on this.  First, when one of these summons comes to court, he is correct in saying that it normally comes as the classical six part summons and the individual offences alleged in each of the six parts are at present all seen as part of effectively one offence, or different facets of one offence and are punishable in the same breath and by the same order of the district justice, one with the other.</P>
      <P>It seems to me if we are going to have penalties, we must have serious penalties. For the average publican a fine of £20, as is the case at present, is absurd, because to go to the District Court and bring a solicitor, and the other side bringing the garda sergeant and the other garda who is standing outside, costs the State a huge amount of money.  Fines in the District Court are small enough when compared with the costs involved in bringing these offences to court.</P>
      <P>I know it would be very stupid of me to criticise lawyers' fees but they are a very substantial imposition on the average publican even if he has been brought along to meet a £20 fine.  Let us be honest about it, the substantial penalty when one of these six part summonses comes to court is the endorsement on the licence. The publican could not give a damn about the £20 because it is less than the VAT on a quarter of the solicitor's fee or the barrister's fee that he is going to have to pay.</P>

      <P>To him the monetary penality is not the issue.  He is not concerned about these issues at all but he is concerned about the endorsement.  It is <Col N="2409" /> in that context that I would like the Minister to take on board my very strong view that endorsement in these circumstances, leading as it does to loss of licence in certain other circumstances, is the fundamental punishment now prescribed by law and the monetary penalties are not what is foremost in the publican's mind. If endorsement is the penalty which follows automatically from any conviction on a six part summons, be it for allowing somebody&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is for a second offence.  It is an automatic endorsement in that case.  It does not allow the district justice to distinguish between a grave offence and a not so grave offence.  If a district justice honestly comes to the conclusion that a person was being allowed to remain on the premises after hours, he is obliged in certain circumstances to endorse just as if the publican was found serving rounds of drink after time.  Deputy Barrett's attention should be attracted to that one issue, that is, that endorsement seems to follow on a number of different sets of facts which are of totally different gravity in terms of the moral guilt of the publican involved. That is why I believe that, in lieu of endorsement, we should in the context of this Bill &mdash; I know it will be dealt with on amendment No. 62, if that is ever reached &mdash; deal with a power other than the power of endorsement so that a district justice who says: &ldquo;You were slow about getting this customer out and you were culpably slow and you must be convicted,&rdquo; has a choice short of endorsement to order some other form of penalty which would be a real sanction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not believe that monetary sanctions are the real sanctions in the licensing code.  I believe that fines of £20 are derisory. A fine of £400 or £800 is proper as suggested by the Minister.  The cost to the State of getting the State solicitor, the three gardaí and all the rest to come along is very substantial.  Occupying a court's time for one or two hours while an argument occurs as to whether there <Col N="2410" /> was or was not a reasonable effort to enforce the law involves a very substantial cost which is put on society.  Since District Court costs can be awarded either way, when there is a conviction the penalties should at least reflect the cost to the State of the whole operation of securing a conviction.</P>
    <P>I believe in the penalties which are involved here but the point that Deputy Barrett is making on the distinction between the severity and the immorality of the offences would be far better reflected in allowing some form of suspension of a licence rather than trying to make a distinction between £300 and £400.  The average district justice does not impose the maximum fine.  He normally imposes a fairly nominal fine because in his view endorsement is the real penalty.  He will only fine £100 or £200, no matter what penalties we fix in this Chamber tonight on this issue.  If we are really talking about deterrents we should look to other things.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy Cooney's views on the level of fines being proposed for being found on a premises for a number of reasons.  The idea of increasing the fine to the level proposed is on the basis that in large establishments it is worth certain proprietor's while to keep people on the premises after time and, in the event of a small fine being imposed, they will have more than got it back with the number of drinks served after hours.  That is why we have the proposal to increase the fine substantially, up to £400 but now agreed at £300.  When one is deciding and making a general rule on the level of a fine one should apply an amount which is fair to all sectors of the trade, large and small. The fact of the matter is that, while in lucrative city pubs £300 is a very small amount, the vast majority of licences are held by family run rural businesses, with a turnover not exceeding £3,000 and more likely nowadays to be around £2,000&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;per week.  I am talking about rural family run pubs, which are the general businesses.  When we decide on fines we should average them out to be fair to everybody.  A fine of £300 would be a small amount to a minority in the trade but to the majority it would be a great deal of money.  People with no passing trade cannot fling their customers out of the road.  They can only ask them to leave and if there is no sign of them leaving, what do they do?  They are their regular customers and there is no intention to break the law.  We will find more and more with the increase in the drinking up time that people will go out to the pubs later because they have only a fixed amount of money to spend on a few pints.</P>
      <P>When you take a cross section of the trade £300 is too expensive.  I agree with Deputy Cooney's sentiment in that regard because it reflects a reality with which we deal in our respective constituencies. Indeed, the same applies in most people's constituencies throughout the country.  While, I take Deputy McDowell's point that it is unlikely that there will be a maximum fine of £300 in every case, in one District Court district there could be a district justice who is very anti-drink and who would charge £250 and in a different district down the road the district justice might charge only £20 or £30.</P>

      <P>That is where the Deputy comes in.  Not alone would one have to pay the State solicitor but he would also have to be paid.  We might as well raise the fine to £1,000.  The level of discrepancy that could arise could bring the matter into disrepute.  I accept that £20 is a ridiculously small fine.  The scope in fines from nil to £300 and the way they will be applied by various district justices in adjoining District Court districts will also bring it into disrepute.  I accept that the Minister has come a certain part of the way by reducing the fine from £400 to £300 but there is still leeway to bring <Col N="2412" /> about a more satisfactory situation in the implementation of these fines.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>Probably the best way to approach this is to accept the Minister's amendment, altered in some small way.  It will then be open to the District Court to differentiate in terms of the scale or level of fine on what is ultimately presented in facts.  The prosecution can allege that the person was simply on the premises or was being provided with alcohol on the premises after hours and this can be reflected in the level of the fine imposed.  I want to address in particular amendment No. 64 and the general question of monetary penalty.  I am a little concerned as to whether I will ever get an opportunity to speak on this matter at length on the amendments of The Workers' Party.</P>
      <P>The Minister on Committee Stage, agreed to consider the whole question of the level of fines and the product of those considerations leaves me somewhat confounded. In the area of penalties for being found on premises, he is proposing for a first time offence a fine of £400 maximum, not £300 as Deputy Cowen said, and for a second or subsequent offence £800.  The one problem we wanted to address is under-age drinking. We wanted to get at the people who were selling and making alcohol available to people under 18 years of age.  The Minister in that regard has introduced for a first offence a monetary penalty that is less than the offence for being found on premises and for a second or subsequent offence a maximum fine of £500, £300 less than the penalty for being found on premises.  I agree with Deputy McDowell that the fines should be a little higher than the existing ones of £20 and £40. The Minister has gone much too far in regard to the offence of being found on premises but I am not very worried about that.  I have to admit there is nothing I enjoy more when I can get down the country occasionally to a licensed premises than to sit there until all hours.  I like nothing more than&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>There is nothing more that I appreciate than the local garda or sergeant bidding me good night or good morning and going about his business. There is not a major problem in that area and the Minister has gone too far with the penalties.  We will support the amendment if the Minister reduces the penalties. I suggest that for a first offence for people found on a premises the maximum fine should be £200 and for a second or subsequent offence, a maximum of £300 or £400.</P>
      <P>The Workers' Party proposed on Committee Stage a five-fold increase on what was being suggested in regard to penalties for people peddling or selling alcohol to young people.  The Minister has conceded very little in this regard &mdash; £50 for a first offence and nothing for a second or subsequent offence.  He has not conceded on the imprisonment aspect the possibility of doing community services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government published the Child Care Bill today.  Under section 58 of that Bill the Minister is imposing penalties of 12 months imprisonment and a fine of £800 for the peddling of inhalants.  With regard to the proof of identity card that is being proposed here under amendment 57, on summary conviction a person can be fined a sum not exceeding £1,000 or 12 months imprisonment if he doctors or interferes with his older brother's identity card.  We have lost all sense of proportion in this regard.  If a publican knowingly and willingly makes alcohol available through an off-licence to persons under the age of 18 the threat of imprisonment does not exist, the penalty for a first offence is less than that proposed for being found on premises and for a second offence even less again.  Yet if a person who wants to get into a licensed premises doctors or uses in some way his older brother's card he can face 12 months imprisonment.  We have gone a little off the rails in terms of our sense of proportion in this regard.  I am borrowing from some of the other examples of what the Department are doing to illustrate this fact.  Perhaps the Minister might reduce the penalties imposed on people found on premises and meet us some way <Col N="2414" /> in regard to the other penalties when we discuss them later.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>We must ensure that we bring in legislation that is respected by everybody, the public and the licensees, and legislation that is capable of being administered.  As I said on Second Stage, it is impossible to implement the law as it stands at present.  If publicans and holders of licences deliberately flout the law they should be answerable in law.  It is unbelievable that we have gone through an era whereby publicans have been brought to court because people were found on the premises even though these people had refused to leave the premises. As I have said previously, if we sell intoxicating drink to somebody we have no right to take the glass out of their hands. We have no right to abuse people and to put them off the premises.  There should be shared responsibility by all.  There is far too much of a gap in regard to the fines and the penalties on the licensee and the people found on premises.  That gap should be bridged either by a reduction in fines on the licensee or an increase in the fines on the people found on premises.  I also mentioned on Second Stage that on-the-spot fines could be imposed in such cases.  Perhaps the Minister would indicate if that would be possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy gives me a chance perhaps we might be able to work out something.  Official amendment No. 64 increases the maximum fines on the licensee, and not on those found on a premises as Deputy McCartan seemed to think, for permitting persons to be on his premises during prohibited hours, to a maximum of £400 for a first offence and £800 for a second or subsequent offence. Extending the scope of the offence by altering the wording as Deputy Barrett has proposed and making it necessary to prove that persons are on the premises for the purposes of consuming intoxicating liquor would, I am advised, make it more difficult to prove and would certainly disimprove the existing provision.</P>
      <P>Section 25 proposes that the maximum fine imposed on a licensee for keeping open his premises would be £400 for the first offence and £800 for subsequent offences.  Deputy Barrett put down an amendment which would have created the new offence of permitting persons to remain on the premises for the purposes of consuming intoxicating liquor with a maximum fine of £300 for the first offence and £600 for the second and subsequent offences.  The existing equivalent provision in the law is at section 29 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1962.  That Act fixed a maximum penalty of £20 for the first offence and a maximum of £40 for a subsequent offence.  These are the maximum penalties at present applicable where the licence holder sells intoxicating liquor during prohibited hours in contravention of section 2 of the 1927 Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under section 25 of the Bill, the maximum penalty for selling drink during prohibited hours is increased to £400 for the first offence and £800 for any subsequent offence.  My proposal is that there would be corresponding increases in the maximum penalties for permitting a person to remain on a licensed premises <Col N="2416" /> during prohibited hours.  But I am worried that the new wording proposed by Deputy Barrett as to remaining on the premises for the purposes of consuming intoxicating liquor would make the offence more difficult to prove.  I consider it enough that persons are on the licensed premises during prohibited hours for the licence holder to have a case to answer. Under the Bill, customers found on the premises will be liable on conviction to a minimum fine of £25 and a maximum fine of £50.</P>
    <P>I think I know what Deputy Barrett is trying to do and I do not think there is any disagreement between us, but I am advised that he is providing a loophole, is creating a new offence and is making the offence more difficult to prove.  I see Deputy Barrett does not accept what I am saying, but I am advised very strongly that he is creating a new offence.</P>

They are two different paragraphs and in the first the Deputy is very definitely creating a new offence.  I am trying to move along the same road as the Deputy.  The penalties here are fairly heavy and I do not accept the description of them given by Deputy Cooney. It is because the endorsement is now discretionary in this area that the penalties are as heavy as they are.  The endorsement for these offences have been at the discretion of the District Justice since 1986.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy McCartan criticised the penalties laid down for people selling drink to persons who are under age, but the endorsement is mandatory there.  We should bear in mind that there is a distinction here.  I would not have any worry if the only difference between us were the penalties of £300 and £600 and £400 and £800.  I have no monopoly on common sense or wisdom in deciding the right figure.  As I said, the figure of £20 was laid down in the 1962 Act and we have adjusted those penalties to a maximum of £400 now.  This is very important.  If a good argument was put forward that the <Col N="2418" /> figure should be changed to £300 and £600 we might find some way of doing that, but I do not believe there is a good argument for doing this.  I believe I am being consistent in raising the two sets of penalties to the same figures.  As I said, I am worried that the creation of the new offence in Deputy Barrett's amendment would create a legal loophole and that it would make it more difficult to get convictions.  That is my dilemma.  That is my case.</P>

      <P>The Bill as it stands has in it the offences I am talking about.  All I have done is to revise it and say the offence of selling or exposing for sale should be distinguishable because in my opinion it is a more serious offence to sell or expose for sale alcohol after closing time than it is to have somebody on your premises.  I have merely taken section 25 (2) (ii) and divided it up.  I have said that for one offence there will be a fine of £300 and for the other of £400.  I am not creating a new offence.</P>

I accept the Deputy's point that it is a more serious matter to have a barman selling drink at 20 minutes after the stipulated time rather than being outside the counter trying to empty his premises. In an effort to show that one offence is greater than the other, if the House would agree I would accept the proposed figures.  I do not know if this is technically possible.

      <P>Amendment No. 24 in the name of the Minister is related to a large number of other amendments, as the House will observe.  I am suggesting in connection with amendment No. 24 that we take amendments Nos. 28, 29, 42, 45, 46, 47, 51, 55, 56 and 57.  All are related.  Shall we debate them together?  Agreed.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 24:</P>
      <P>In page 14, to delete line 26 and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;30.  In this Part&mdash;</P>
      <P>`age card' means a card issued under section 40 of this Act;</P>
      <P>`child' means a person under the age of 15 years;</P>
      <P>`private residence' includes any outhouse, yard, garden or other land appurtenant thereto or usually enjoyed therewith.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Committee Stage, Deputy Colley and Deputy Seán Barrett put down amendments proposing that provision should be made for a system of age or identity cards to help curb under-age drinking.  As I said at the time, I agree in general with the principle that a provision of this kind would be of advantage.  It would help people who are just over 18 years of age to obtain a drink; it would help the licence holder and also dissuade under-age persons who would realise that they would probably not be able to get drink in a licensed premises without having such a card.  Accordingly, amendment No. 56 now provides for the introduction of a new section at the end of Part VI of the Bill so that the Minister for Justice may make regulations providing for the establishment of a system of age cards to be <Col N="2422" /> issued to anyone aged over 18 years requesting such a card.  It will be a matter for the Minister to specify the authority or organisation through which the cards will be issued and to specify in the regulations such matters as that a charge should be made for the issue of the card, the format of the card and its period of validity.</P>
    <P>So far as the licence holder is concerned, the important thing is that, under amendment No. 28, section 31 of the Bill will be amended so that if a card is produced to him which genuinely appears to be an age card, he will be regarded as having had reasonable grounds for believing that the person concerned was over 18.  This will given him a defence to any charge under section 31 such as that of selling drink to an under-age person.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 57 introduces a new section providing a penalty for forging an age card or using a like document with intent to deceive.  The other amendments, which are amendments Nos. 24, 29, 42 and 45, are necessary amendments arising out of the basic provision as to age cards.  It will be noted that these provisions will not come into force until the necessary regulations have been made by the Minister.  I regard these provisions as an important contribution to the drive to curb under-age drinking and I commend them to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very pleased that the Minister has agreed to do something in this area.  It is wise that we should enable him to make regulations providing for the issue of age cards or identity cards on a voluntary basis.  Anybody who wishes to receive one for convenience sake should be able to get it.  It should be an official card, issued by the Minister's Department on request made by the individual. This scheme has operated quite successfully on a voluntary basis in County Mayo, where people chose to receive an identity card which they found to be extremely convenient.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I first mooted this issue of identity cards, there was much emotional talk about imposing restrictions on people. Many destructive comments were made <Col N="2423" /> in relation to the whole issue.  I was very pleased that as the debate continued, sanity crept in and people saw that we were not trying to impose anything on anybody, that this was a question of convenience for the individual and to help the implementation of this new Act.</P>
    <P>We all agree that under-age drinking is a serious problem.  I am very conscious that by removing the word &ldquo;knowingly&rdquo; we are imposing a heavy obligation on the publican to be satisfied that a person to whom he is selling alcohol is over 18. That is a very sudden change.  The community can reciprocate if they so wish by receiving an identity card, or an age card and by making it available if requested. Anybody who has spoken to young people lately will say that the majority do not find any difficulty in seeking an age card or an identity card.  What we are doing here is making it optional.  That is a sensible approach.  I have no difficulty in accepting the Minister's wording.  It goes further than what I had proposed and it is quite in order.  This will be of great benefit to everybody, in particular to young people who from time to time can be embarrassed by being refused a drink because they look younger than 18 even if they are over 18.  This makes it easier for the publican to administer the law.  It is a step in the right direction.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with what Deputy Barrett has said.  This is voluntary and it should not raise any ideological hackles no matter how sensitive they are. The reality is that this scheme is optional. Some other day this House will address itself to a proper identity card and it will be different from this document.  Some other day people in this House will give up the idea of having to queue in Molesworth Street to buy books when they want to travel to European countries and they will be happy to have an identity card in their pockets.  The Left can sit and wait until that comes.  I suggest that they should reserve their ammunition for that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is very sensible. When I was about 18 a few people who <Col N="2424" /> were frequently in my company looked younger than 18 years and they were often flung out of pubs because they could not convince anybody that they were aged 20 or thereabouts.  This was a huge embarrassment to them.  It is a major intrusion on the rights of adults to be refused legal entry into a pub because the publican cannot take the risk of serving them because they look so young and because he knows that a judge would not believe him if he was brought to court.  If an adult has the right to go to a Garda station to secure evidence of his age who, from whatever ideological view, can say that he should not have that right?</P>
    <P>On the last occasion people spoke about producing a birth certificate but, as Deputy McCartan said, there is nothing easier than to produce one's brother's birth certificate because there is nothing on it to identify it with the owner.  This is a reasonable, sensible amendment designed to give publicans some assistance in making hard decisions which can embarrass people who are only exercising their lawful right to have a drink in circumstances where a publican might reasonably have a doubt about their age. I ask those who opposed this when it was first mooted in this House not to oppose it now, to see the sense of it and to see that it is not the thin end of any wedge but merely an entitlement to save some people the embarrassment of being flung out of pubs at the age of 21 because a publican has the brass neck or the good judgement to say he does not believe them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Whips for ordering the debate so that we could reach this important issue tonight.  Earlier on, due to progress and the number of amendments to be tabled, there was a concern that we would not get this far. During the debate on the Private Members' Bill on under-age drinking the Minister inquired of Deputies as to their views on this issue.  This was something that was taxing the Minister's mind at the time and he did not come down strongly on one side or the other.  The indications <Col N="2425" /> were that the Government had an open mind on this issue.</P>
      <P>I was not present, and I did not hear, and I hope I am not considered to have contributed to whatever attacks Deputy Barrett was subjected to.  The Deputy has mentioned them three or four times. Perhaps the attacks did not come from within the House but from outside.</P>
      <P>This is an issue in which The Workers' Party gave consideration because the Minister inquired about it during the Private Members' debate.  On consideration we are opposed to the scheme that the Minister proposes on the basis that there are many people who rightly or wrongly would not be disposed to having an identity card.  They have not the cultural or educational means to go to a place of authority for the card.  They do not like the idea of going to the local Garda station for an identity card.  During the course of my work I have talked to many respectable people who would not be happy to frequent a Garda Síochána station. Two classes of people will develop &mdash; those with the card and those without it.  There will inevitably be a bias and it will militate against those who opt out of the system.</P>
      <P>I have often been told that I look young for my age.  I started taking drink a lot younger than the age this legislation is trying to get at.  Never in my life have I seen a person being ordered out of a licensed premises because he looked too young.  I do not believe that is a problem. However, in my locality recently I heard an off-licensee saying to a boy who was about 12 years old that he would not serve him.  I complimented that man because it was the first time I had ever come across a licence holder refusing to sell alcohol.</P>
      <P>The problem is one of dealing with publicans and off-licence holders who are not prepared to abide by the law.  They know the law and should enforce it where there is doubt.  The problem is not of people who are over the age being embarrassed. We have to bear that in mind when we try to address this problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take it that this identity card will have some distinction so that when it is produced it will be clearly identifiable <Col N="2426" /> and that it will not be easily interfered with.  Such a card will cost money.  What will be the charge, if any, to a young person who wants one of these documents? That is an aspect which has not been addressed.  The various identity cards that have been made available cost several pounds to produce.  Where will people find the money, particularly now when we have so many young people unemployed?  This is an aspect worth considering.</P>
    <P>One of my major concerns about this scheme is that it would present an out for publicans and off-licence holders in serving drink to those under age.  This is the single greatest problem we are seeking to address in this Bill.  As has been mentioned, we are taking new steps in this legislation and one of the major steps which we are taking and which is what every party has been screaming for for so long is we are getting rid of the defence of &ldquo;knowingly&rdquo; serving drink to under-age people.  Publicans have been able to walk out of court time and again by arguing that they could not have known that a person was under 18 years of age and that on looking at him or her they had the impression that they were on the borderline. There is all-party agreement that this has led to problems in policing the legislation.</P>
    <P>What is proposed offers a way of reintroducing the word &ldquo;knowingly&rdquo; into the legislation whether we like it or not and I will explain that in this way.  The publican in court would be able to say, and I quote amendment No. 28, that &ldquo;the person in respect of whom the charge is brought produced to him a document that appeared to be an age card relating to such a person or that he has other reasonable grounds for believing that such person was over the age of 18 years&rdquo;.  A similar defence is provided in respect of an off-licence holder.  It would be open to the publican to say in court, providing he can be convincing in his or her presentation to the justice, that they saw a document which appeared to them to be an age card.  Unless a garda has the power to put the young person in question against the wall, to frisk him or her, to <Col N="2427" /> take the card and retain it for production in court and to say it was a credit card or student card or that he or she had nothing on them to show that they were over 18 there would be no way to answer the publican's case and a district justice would have to concede on the word sworn to him by the publican.</P>
    <P>What I am worried about, with the greatest of respect to the Minister, is that we are going backwards.  The defence provided in this amendment is repeated in amendment No. 29, amendment No. 42 and amendment No. 45.  I wonder can the Minister see the difficulties which would arise in the prosecution of these offences?  I have to suggest that the defence of &ldquo;it appeared to him&rdquo; is the same as using the word &ldquo;knowingly&rdquo; because a garda would not have the power to produce the young person in question in court or to search the young person.  When a garda enters a public house there may be seven or eight people sitting around who appear to him to be under age but when he confronts the publican he could say that they produced cards to him and he could also say the same subsequently in court.  How can a garda contradict that evidence or present a contrary case beyond saying that they looked to him to be under age?  He cannot produce them in court and that is why we are probably going to make it easier for publicans in this legislation than in the existing legislation.</P>
    <P>The Minister wants to introduce the issuing of identify cards on a voluntary basis and he has received support for this from the Fine Gael Party through Deputy Barrett and the Progressive Democrats through Deputy McDowell.  Looking at the numbers I am on a lone pitch but I have made my point.  I am worried about certain elements of this scheme on principle &mdash; it may be called ideology but I am not too worried about that aspect of it.  I have to say to Deputy McDowell that the National Youth Council, of which Young Fine Gael and Young Fianna Fáil are constituent members, are opposed in principle to the issuing of identity cards <Col N="2428" /> and they have written to every Deputy in this House to say&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that they are opposed to the concept of identity cards as means of trying to enforce the legislation. They have made the exact point which I am trying to make here tonight, that the onus should always rest full square on the publican to police the legislation and that if he is in doubt he should refuse to serve.</P>
      <P>Let me say to all Deputies present here tonight, if we are going to allow a voluntary scheme to be introduced &mdash; looking at the numbers I am on a losing wicket &mdash; let me urge the Minister to reflect again on amendment No. 28.  The Minister can introduce a voluntary scheme as a means of helping the publican to police the legislation or as a means of helping those who, as Deputy McDowell said, might be embarrassed but we should not give them the means whereby they can walk out of a prosecution which if I am right in my interpretation, amendment No. 28 and the related amendments would give them.  Perhaps what could be done is that in evidence a publican could say to a district justice that he came to the reasonable conclusion that the person was of age but they should not have it as an absolute right of defence as is suggested here and it should not be left open on wider grounds.  That would be one way of addressing this problem but leaving aside the wider arguments I believe amendment No. 28 and the related amendments would make this legislation almost inoperable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I commend the Minister for the efforts he is making to introduce some form of identity card system.  As somebody who is involved in the trade, the Minister asked me if I would be in favour of some form of identity card system and my reply to him was that I would welcome such a system and that is why I am delighted to have an opportunity to debate this issue here tonight. I do not believe we are imposing any <Col N="2429" /> restrictions but rather we are introducing liberalisation in this area.  Many voluntary organisations and many concerned organisations have been crying out for the introduction of some form of identity card system and those involved in the trade have also asked that some form of identity card system be introduced under legislation &mdash; not as an &ldquo;out&rdquo; for a licensee but rather as a way of helping them to find out whether the person is over 18 years of age.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to remind the House that we are not going to discriminate against anybody under this Bill.  When I first entered the licensed trade one would not dare serve a lady in a public bar.  If she was lucky she might be brought into a public bar on a fair day and served with a small port.  That was a fact of life.  I am not a very old man but at that time a lady would not be allowed into a public bar to have a drink.  Therefore, there was discrimination at the other level.  Abuses now exist at the other end which nobody wants to tolerate any longer and I want to put the record straight in this House tonight and say that probably 98 per cent of publicans uphold their name and a degree of credibility.  Any publican worth his salt must uphold such a degree of credibility within his local community. As far as is possible he must comply with the provisions of the law.  However, having said that, I contend they should also receive a certain amount of help from the law in maintaining their businesses to the highest standard possible.  Nobody who has been involved in the trade over a long period of time, inside or outside this House, would convince me that people who serve intoxicating liquor after hours or before hours or to young people, will maintain any degree of credibility or their businesses because they will not. As I said on Second Stage, there are a number of such people, perhaps one in a certain town, none in a small town, but I guarantee that those who do not adhere to the provisions of the law will be those that will carrry a &ldquo;for sale&rdquo; sign every two or three years.  Perhaps they constitute a necessary evil for the type of people who <Col N="2430" /> do not want to frequent the more honourable type of premises.</P>
    <P>We must enact legislation worthy of this House and of the Minister who spent so much time and thought on all of its aspects.  With co-operation right across the board it is my contention that we can successfully introduce a form of identity card acceptable to everybody.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Labour Party do not support the notion of identity cards, voluntary or compulsory.  We believe it will not help the objective of this part of the Bill in trying to control under-age drinking. The experience of those countries that do operate identity card procedures, for example, such as the United States, shows that these procedures tend to be totally eaten away by forgeries of these documents.  This has become a simply, commonplace thing.  The extent of forgery of these cards taking place in the United States is quite remarkable.  We contend it would be an extremely difficult if not impossible thing to control.  Indeed the Minister realises that difficulty.  That is the reason that, in the section dealing with the offence of forging these cards, he has prescribed surprisingly heavy penalties for that offence, penalties which are considerably heavier than any of those prescribed for any of the other offences arising under the provisions of the Bill. The fact that such heavy penalties are prescribed is an indication of the weakness to be encountered trying to enforce these regulations.  I contend we should not go about giving rise to such circumstances, setting up the possibility of forgery and so on of these cards.</P>
      <P>Deputy McCartan is quite right, the provision of identity cards possibly will give publicans an out.  I am sure that is not the intention of the Minister or indeed that of any other Member or party who may be supporting it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This whole notion of having to carry an identity card &mdash; or, even if one does not have to carry one &mdash; I find somewhat repulsive and alien.  I know that in European countries such practice is the order of the day, that everybody must carry a <i>carte d'identité</i>, for example, in France, <Col N="2431" /> Germany and countries like that.  I do not like that practice.  It constitutes a kind of big brother position, with everybody being recorded numerically and all the rest of it.  It is all very well for Deputy McDowell to say that this does not constitute the thin end of the wedge.  I have heard that kind of talk before.  I am sure he is well intentioned in so saying. However, the Labour Party believe that this would be the thin end of the wedge, would lead to more comprehensive and compulsory schemes.  Perhaps the fact that some young people would have such a card would save them embarrassment. It might cause an equal amount of embarrassment to others who did not have a card.  Almost certainly it would cause difficulties in the prosecution of the offences that would arise under the provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I realise that there will be difficulties encountered and that great care will be needed on the part of publicans in dealing with people both under and over 18 years of age.  I am sorry about that but, for decades past the prosecution have also encountered difficulty in this regard and that difficulty is now being met.</P>
    <P>I contend that the provisions of the Bill adequately meet the circumstances.  The House decided to tackle this by deleting the word &ldquo;knowingly&rdquo;, which constituted a major step forward.  We would be better advised to allow the Bill go through on that basis and ascertain what would be the response.  The pendulum swung too far in favour of the publican before.  It is now time they lived up to their responsibilities, it being put up to them that some of them have been enabled to flout the law blatantly to date, and many establishments in this city are well known as havens to which people under age would go.  When we have advanced to the position that we are updating the law in a perfectly acceptable and reasonable manner I should not like us to provide a possible out here by having forged identity cards, pass cards around or whatever, that would throw us back to square one and reopen the whole question of under-age drinking.  We would feel very sorry <Col N="2432" /> for ourselves and it would be a bad day's work in this House if we did that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Like everyone else, I share the instinctive reaction Deputy Taylor against personal identity cards as being somehow an invasion of the privacy we feel we are all entitled to as independent citizens living in a free democracy. Instinctively that is the position which we would all take and would like to have the luxury of enjoying if we lived in a perfect world.  But we live in an imperfect world, in which there is trouble from drugs, drug smugglers, pushers, in which there are reports of highly organised crime and extortion and, above all in this and many European countries, where there are highly organised terrorist organisations, with all the criminal tentacles that that produces within our society.  If the holding of personal identity cards is going to enable democracy, as a whole, to protect itself against all those evil influences, then I would put my personal feelings of distaste for the invasion of my privacy which that card would represent to one side in the interests of the common good and co-operate with all my fellow citizens in having personal identity cards so as to enable democracy, through its agencies, to more effectively fight the troubles, gangsterism, and terrorism we all have to face.  That is the reality.  I do not think any of us is entitled to the luxury of indulging our personal, instinctive feelings having regard to the well nigh emergency circumstances in which we have to live in western democracies these days. In any event the reality, from the point of view of the innocent, law-abiding citizen, is that it will be no hardship on him to carry an identity card.  He should be pleased to produce it whenever he has to produce it to the proper authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having said that on the general issue of identity cards, I do have to confess that I feel the Minister's proposal here of voluntary identity cards is a half-baked one, a nod in the direction in which he and many people want to go, the only effective destination being represented by circumstances in which everyone held an identity card.  Then there could be no <Col N="2433" /> question of publicans being able to evade their duty.  A very strict obligation could be imposed by law, black and white circumstances, in which we would not encounter the dangers about which Deputy McCartan is rightly apprehensive in regard to trying to prove offences under the régime now proposed.</P>
    <P>The proposal which provides for voluntary identity cards for persons aged 18 and upwards does not make sense to me; it is somewhat unreal.  The objective of it is to try and redress the balance from the point of view of the publican who, up to now, escaped unless he could be proved to have knowingly sold liquor to a person under the age of 18.  We have removed that exemption from him.  We do not want to make it an absolute offence because all of us would jib at the injustice that that would present because it would impose an impossible burden on the publican and could not constitute a definite offence.  We are now reduced to looking for a compromise, some sort of a halfway house between the absolute exemption and the absolute offence.</P>
    <P>Originally the halfway house in the Bill was that, if a publican could convince the court he had reasonable grounds for believing that the person was over the age of 18, he was exempt.  Of course that opened a Pandora's box from the point of view of the defending lawyer and the offending publican as to what were &ldquo;reasonable grounds&rdquo;.  All sorts of ideas and hypotheses could be advanced to a court and, depending on the humour of the court and the skill and imagination of the defending lawyer, goodness knows what might turn out to be reasonable grounds.</P>
    <P>In a further effort to try to get a compromise between the two extremes, the Minister, with encouragement from this side of the House, has thought up this idea of a voluntary identity card.  If there is a very high rate of application for this card among all the 18 year olds in the country I suppose it will have some validity but, quite frankly, I cannot see <Col N="2434" /> that happening.  I cannot see people of 18 years and upwards heading <i>en masse</i> to their local Garda station with a photograph and the appropriate fee in their hand and asking for an identity card. The Minister has to prescribe regulations stating how long the card lasts for and he has to decide who can issue these cards, the form of the card and the particulars it has to contain.</P>
    <P>A whole new bureaucracy is being set up here to provide for something which might not be used.  Even if it is used I am afraid it will be open to abuses because it will not be uniform for everybody.  The abuse can be in the court, in the swopping of the cards and in the veracity of a publican who takes a casual look at something that is produced and says &ldquo;Yes, I saw it&rdquo; and who is prepared to go into court and say that he saw it.  Are those reasonable grounds for exempting him from conviction?  They probably are.</P>
    <P>We are putting in place here something which is well intentioned but which I am afraid is woolly in concept and which will be imperfect in its execution.  In order to make our last stage a little less ridiculous if we are going to go down the road of identity cards we should make a decision to go all the way and have identity cards for all citizens.  It would have advantages in the general area of public order and it would bring us into line with many of our European colleagues.  This will probably have to come in any event as cross-border documentation will be removed following increasing integration within Europe. There will have to be some sort of security identification and it will probably take the form of identity cards which will be issued nationally.  We may as well get into it at this stage because it is inevitable.  We should arrange for it now rather than embark on this rather woolly, halfhearted proposal which I do not think will be effective and which in its implementation will only put an impossible burden on the court, bring the law into disrepute and will not assist in what <Col N="2435" /> we all want to achieve, which is the elimination of under-age drinking.</P>

      <P>The current effort in this Bill has the support of the vast majority of those who have confidence in the young people of today.  I was a little disappointed to hear both Deputy McCartan and Deputy Taylor talking about the things young people might get up to, that they might forge identity cards and that there might be underground factories in every college in the State.  I am disappointed in so far as this is a proposal which has been sought for a long number of years by people outside of politics, especially by those on the western sea board.  I know that increased security arrangements are being operated at discos and the people who guard the doors will not allow young people in unless they have some kind of identification or they know them personally. In order to reduce this hassle, I believe young people will avail of the opportunity to get ID cards if the Minister, in setting up the regulations, makes it easy for them to apply and to get a quick response to their application for this documentation.</P>
      <P>Other Deputies have examined amendment No. 28.  I cannot see how it would improve what is already contained in the section.  Deputy Barrett who was the first to suggest this notion of identity cards in the House proposed that it should be on a voluntary basis.  Amendments Nos. 28 and 29 are at the nub of the objections of Deputy McCartan and others and I think they are unnecessary.</P>

      <P>It has been mentioned here that on the western sea board and in other areas it might be quite easy to control under-age drinking because in most small areas everybody is fully aware of the ages of people who are drinking. However, in city areas, whether it is in Cork or Dublin, a young person will travel from one end of the city to the other in order to get drink.  In my area they will even travel long distances to off-licences. This is an extremely difficult problem to get around.</P>
      <P>I am not madly keen on the idea of national identity passes.  I do not think it is in the interests of democracy that we should have to carry identity cards. However, there is the problem of how a publican can decide the age of a person on his or her premises.  I disagree slightly with Deputy McCartan on this point because in many cases public houses now have security staff on their doors to stop young people entering.  Most Members in this Chamber would find it very hard to identify a person between the ages of 16 years and 21 years.  It is almost impossible to tell the age of a young boy or girl.  However, I do not believe a publican should be relieved of his responsibilities in this regard.  They are selling a highly dangerous drug and must take a great deal of the responsibility when selling this dangerous substance to young people.  The Minister's amendment will help in that direction because the barman will have to be satisfied that a person is over 18 years of age.  I have here a small card &mdash; Deputy McCartan and I are the only ones who have one &mdash; produced by Dublin Corporation with my photograph and name but no address.  Something like that would be suitable.  The only problem would be proving a person's age.  I have no doubt that young people will go to any lengths to forge a card if that is what they want to do; it will become a cult to be able to forge such cards and this is a difficult thing to get around.</P>

      <P>This amendment relates to advertisements for sport and physical recreation which takes place outside the normal permitted hours during which liquor may be supplied in clubs.  I am assured that dancing is not a physical recreation under this amendment. Dances or discos in registered clubs may not be advertised anyway if they take place after the normal closing time of 11 p.m. or 11.30 p.m. as they almost always do.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that it would be in order for clubs to announce that they are holding a function and that the normal club exemptions would apply. The Minister would need to be careful that in placating the publican's lobby he does not come down too heavily on the activities of bona fide clubs.  I am well aware that there are some clubs which probably abuse the special position they have under our licensing laws but the vast majority are run for the purpose of the entertainment of their members and for the advancement of the sport they are set up to foster.  They cannot effectively carry on their functions of providing recreational facilities for their members to the degree that is expected in this modern age unless they can generate some income, and the common way in which they can generate income is by using their club facilities and their licence for reasonable recreational activities.  They have to be allowed to advertise and notify their members in the public press that such functions are going to take place.  It will not always happen that all of their members will be such assiduous attenders on the premises of the club that they will see notices at the club of what is going to take place.  The club could have a very widespread membership and it would be quite impossible and overexpensive for it to have to notify its membership through the post if it is going to have a function. Clubs may have different grades of members; some of them may be just social members who would not come normally to the premises.  This restriction on advertising is unduly harsh and I think the Minister should look at it again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The defences that are available to the club indicate that the Minister has some doubts about the justice of what is being proposed here.  I would ask the Minister to look at this section because social clubs and sporting clubs form a very important part of the life of many of our country towns and villages.  If they find themselves unduly restricted they may go to the wall simply because they will not be <Col N="2440" /> able to generate enough funds to continue in being.  I know there is a strong publican's lobby very hostile to clubs; in some cases they have managed to persuade the Garda that the clubs have to be monitored in an extremely strict way. I would not like to think that the Minister has become a victim to the lobbying by the vintners in this regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>On the last occasion the Minister produced an amendment and it had a general prohibition to advertising any function in a club.  Then it is provided in subsection (2) (b) that it would not apply to an advertisement in so far as it related to a function involving any sport, game or physical recreation. I pointed out then that dances would undoubtedly come under the category of physical recreation and that since most of the advertisements that I have ever seen relate to dances the effect of that exclusion was effectively negatived.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now it appears that the Minister has decided to bring in an amendment the gist of which is that one cannot advertise an extension in the context of a dance.  I presume that is what it is supposed to do, but if that is what it is supposed to do I wonder does it achieve that aim because the rules require a club to confine drinking to the hours allowed by statute. Would it be open to a club to set out in its rules that there could also be drinking where the District Court extended the time?  If there was such a rule in the club that it could cover extensions then the amendment the Minister is putting down would allow the club to advertise the extension as well.  Unless the registration of clubs procedure is that a club cannot provide in its rules for extensions, or even acknowledge the right of the District Court to provide for an extension, then it seems that the purpose of this Act will be self-defeating and we will not actually stop the advertising of extensions.  If a club's rules said that there could be drinking after the hours, where the District Court under statute so provided, then <Col N="2441" /> the club could advertise such an event.  I wonder if we have achieved anything by this amendment.  The more we wander into this thicket the more lost we become. I do not think we will be able to stop rugby clubs from advertising dances and if the rules provide that they can drink after hours and the District Court so permits, I think the Minister will allow them to advertise the extension as well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBarrett" hpid="Mr. M. Barrett Mr. M. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I am somewhat disappointed that we have extensions.  We have extended the hours of drinking and I am disappointed that we must have such extensions.  If people who are in premises can drink up to midnight, why is it necessary to have extensions?  We must all remember &mdash; and I referred to this on Second Stage &mdash; the number of people who have lost their lives on the road because of drunken drivers.  This will make the position even worse.  I do not see the need for further extensions.  It is an indictment of us all that we can run no functions now without drink.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>There was a fairly long debate on this matter on Committee Stage.  As a result of that debate I said I would try to tighten up the loophole in section 43 (2) (b).  I am now satisfied that this amendment is watertight and it is only applicable for what is provided for within ordinary club rules &mdash; that is, drinking up to 11 p.m. or 11.30 p.m.  It is not applicable for the occasions mentioned by Deputy McDowell where a special exemption is given and where there is also late night dancing.  It is applicable within the ordinary rules of the club.</P>

      <P>In page 22, line 18, to delete &ldquo;and&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;or&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>On Committee Stage Deputy McCartan expressed the view that the defence given in relation to the issue of advertisements in contravention of section 44 was too generous and I undertook to look again at the relevant provisions.  Having done so, I came to the conclusion that far from being too generous the defence was, perhaps, too restricted.</P>
      <P>Under the section as it stood the person concerned would have had to prove that the advertisement was published without his consent or connivance and also that he used all due diligence to prevent its publication.  If the advertisement was published without his consent or connivance, then in many cases the person concerned, for example, a committee member might not even be aware that the advertisement had been issued so that he could hardly have used all his due diligence to prevent its publication. Accordingly, under this amendment the person concerned will have to prove either that the advertisement was published without his consent or connivance or that he used all due diligence to prevent its publication.  In the first case he would probably not have known the advertisement was being published, for example, he might have been abroad at the time.  In the second case he would probably have known about the advertisement and in those circumstances would have to prove that he attempted to prevent its publication and that he used all due diligence to stop such an advertisement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I can see clubs devising all sorts of ways to get around this problem. There could even be the extreme case that clubs would publish a notice in the local newspaper to the effect that: &ldquo;This club will not be holding any particular function on the night of 24 January and <Col N="2443" /> there will be no exemption on that night&rdquo;. Would that be an offence?  Clearly, in attempting to restrict clubs from doing what they have been doing for generations &mdash; and which was perfectly valid &mdash; I think this is an outrageous restriction and the Minister will provoke a daft situation.

      <P>I move amendment No. 61:</P>
      <P>In page 23, line 12, after &ldquo;£500&rdquo; to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;and the offence shall be deemed for the purposes of Part III (which relates to the endorsement of licences) of the Act of 1927 to be an offence to which that Part of that Act applies.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>On Committee Stage Deputy McCartan raised the question as to whether an adequate penalty was provided in section 45 which relates to the sale of intoxicating liquor in supermarkets.  He also raised the question as to whether convictions of such offences should be endorsable on the licences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have considered this matter and in view of the importance which I attach to this provision I am disposed to agree that the offence should be endorsable and <Col N="2444" /> amendment No. 61 provides accordingly. This will mean that on conviction endorsement of the licence concerned will be mandatory and on the third such conviction the licence concerned will be forfeited.  As regards the monetary penalty provided this is the maximum fine of £500.  It will be noted that this is the largest maximum fine that may be imposed for any first offence under the Bill and, taken in conjunction with the fact that the offence will, as I proposed, be endorsable, I think the monetary penalty provided is adequate.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage it was suggested that some types of off-licence are a particular source of abuse.  I would point out that section 45 applies to all off-licences so far as they are used for liquor sales from mixed premises such as supermarkets. I think this is adequate control. The Intoxicating Liquor Acts provide for a variety of on-licences and off-licences. The question of rationalisation of this system involving perhaps the abolition of certain types of licence is a very large one.  It requires careful study and is not one which could be dealt with adequately in the context of this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very important section in the Bill and I understand it came on the suggestion of a number of Deputies in the House to the Minister.  I welcome the amendment.  The section provides for a penalty on summary conviction, not just for the first offence but for any offence.  There does not seem to be in the section a gradation upwards for a second or subsequent offence.  Can the Minister explain why that is so?  Has he a firm view now as to when this section will come into operation?  He reserves to himself the right to set the date when the section shall come into operation.  What considerations is he bearing in mind as to when the section should come into force? It is an important section and I hope it will not be too long before the Minister will bring it into operation.  I appreciate that time must be given to the owners of <Col N="2445" /> the premises to re-adapt to reflect what is required under the law.  I welcome the fact that people will not now be able to buy in a self-service that places alcoholic beverages on open display.  This is a good development and I thank the Minister for accepting the proposal put forward on Committee Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this amendment also because this is one of the areas where most of the abuse took place in relation to under-age drinking.  I mentioned on Committee Stage that this so-called sweets licence was causing some concern particularly in relation to some alcoholic drinks sold by some of the smaller shops.  I may be out of order but section 45 (2) does not impose restrictions on premises where the business carried on is the sale of intoxicating liquor for consumption off the premises and the sale of commodities ancillary to such business as cigarettes, tobacco, cigars, matches, confectionery and nonalcoholic beverages.  I am afraid these types of premises, small, so-called grocers' shops, are some of the worst offenders in relation to under-age drinking, and I am a little disappointed that we have nothing before us in relation to these sweets licences.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that many of these very small shops are operating on these licences they are getting for something like £70 a year.  It proves that it is unwise of this House in important legislation such as this not to have adequate time between Committee and Report Stages.  All of these amendments have had to be rushed.  It would have been wiser had we waited another week, and we should learn a lesson from this because we have had to skip over a few things here.  When we are dealing so well with this problem of under-age drinking, it is a shame that we let slip an opportunity to amend the law that we might <Col N="2446" /> not get for another five or ten years.  To be told that time restrictions do not allow for adequate research to cover these potential danger areas is a shame.  What has been done in relation to supermarkets and the larger shops selling drink is wise and welcome, but I am warning that many of the difficulties in the area of under-age drinking are coming from the very small shops where the owners are not displaying the sense of responsibility they should and are selling to very young children cider, beer, and other alcoholic drinks.  The real problem is in that area. In fairness, I have not seen supermarkets abusing the off-licence in relation to under-age drinking to any great extent. Generally the large supermarkets are conscious of their responsibility.  It is the smaller shops operating on these sweets licences, as they are known, that are causing a great number of the problems, and there is no amendment here to deal with that.</P>
      <P>However, I welcome what we have. When this Bill goes to the Seanad the Minister should ask his officials to look at this area and when there is a chance to amend it let him bring it back here and we will have it passed in half an hour for him if it means tightening further on this under-age drinking problem.  Let us not lose this opportunity here and now to deal with it.</P>
      <P>We did not get around to dealing with the problem of the employment of people under 18.  I suggest that perhaps it should be persons over 16.</P>

With reference to what Deputy McCartan says, the maximum fine here is £500 accompanied, of course, by a mandatory endorsement.  That is quite a severe penalty. With regard to a date for the reintroduction, I will have to consult with the supermarkets.  I cannot give a date as of now but we will bring it in as early as possible.</P>

      <P>In page 23, between lines 37 and 38, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;48.&mdash;(1)  Where a court has convicted a person of an offence under the Acts and such offence is deemed for the purposes of Part 3 of the Act of 1927 to be an offence to which that part of that Act applies, the court may in lieu of, or in addition to such endorsement, order that the licence relating to the premises shall stand suspended during such period as shall be specified in the order, being not less than one day and not more than thirty days.</P>
      <P>(2)  Where a licence is suspended under subsection (1) during a period, the premises to which it relates shall not be used for the purposes of sale or of consumption of intoxicating liquor, and in any proceedings arising out of the sale or consumption of intoxicating liquor on the premises during the period of such suspension, it shall not be a defence to show that there was a licence in being authorising such sale or consumption.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have said everything I have to say about ten times in this debate so I will not say it again.  I made the same point on Deputy Barrett's Bill.  Even though time is available, I will not make the same points but I would like to know the Minister's attitude.  He indicated that he would come back to us on the suspension of licences.  I still hold that monetary penalties are not adequate as a method of distinguishing between large and small pubs and the gravity of offences.  Many pubs in the city of Dublin if caught infringing the law in an endorsable situation would be much more scared of a closure order than of anything else and there are <Col N="2448" /> many places such as Leeson Street &mdash; I do not want to be too arch or puritanical about it &mdash; where the endorsement is of no interest to them.  They swap ownership and licences and everybody wonders who owns which club in which month and they add interim transfers to get around the law.  It would be far better if a district justice could order the place to be closed for a time rather than wipe out the licence and we would get far more compliance with the law.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy McDowell mentioned, I said on Committee Stage that I would look at this suggestion by Deputy Colley.  A provision for the suspension of licences such as exists in Nothern Ireland would mark a major change in the system of enforcing the liquor licensing laws.  An in-depth study would be required before such a change could be contemplated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The relationship between the existing penalties including the amount of fines and the provision for endorsement or forfeiture would have to be examined as well as whether suspension would be appropriate for a whole range of recordable offences as apparently is contemplated in Deputy Colley's amendment.  The present Bill, as I said early on Second Stage, is not intended to be a comprehensive Intoxicating Liquor Bill and many important aspects of the intoxicating liquor laws would need to be examined in the context of a subsequent Bill. The question of providing for suspension of licences in certain circumstances might be one of those aspects, but it raises too many difficult questions to be settled within the timescale of this Bill.  On Second Stage Deputy Colley and other Deputies suggested that, whereas we recognised that this legislation was not to be regarded as an in-depth study covering all the ins and outs of the liquor laws, we had a consensus that we did not have to wait five or ten years to come back into this House if we had matters examined. I am prepared to say to the House that <Col N="2449" /> we can have an ongoing examination of the liquor laws and come forward again in the autumn if necessary and ask the House to consider further proposals if I think them worth while.  We do not have to wait ten or 20 years.</P>
    <P>The liquor laws are an area where there have been very few differences between us in our approach to what we are trying to achieve.  There has been a worthwhile consensus from day one when Deputy Barrett introduced his Private Members' Bill.  We have made considerable progress. Perhaps we should have done better, but on the whole have made far more progress than many of us thought we would ever make from the very beginning. A number of areas require further attention and in-depth examination such as the one we missed out in Deputy Carey's amendment this evening.  I say to him that that area requires very careful consideration and we must give consideration to it together with others.  I am prepared to have that study which is required undertaken with a view to coming back into the House perhaps in the fall of the year to do some more worthwhile work in this area.</P>

      <P>I respect what the Minister says, but I think this is a good amendment. I ask the Minister to throw off the shackles around his shoulders because he has not had a chance to examine this. Nothing in this amendment can cause difficulty.  All it is doing is giving a judge extra powers or another option if he wishes to use it.  It is a very wise provision because, as I said on Second and Committee Stages, £300 or £400 to a pub in rural Ireland is a considerable amount of money, a heavy penalty to pay, but £300 to many pubs in large urban areas is a drop in the ocean.  The fact that the judge can use his discretion in relation to imposing a penalty for a serious offence, the fact that he can say to a publican &ldquo;Because you have been consistently breaking the law and abusing it, I am going to suspend your licence for two or <Col N="2450" /> three weeks&rdquo; will make people sit up and take notice.  In rural Ireland, the judge may say to the owners of a small pub run by a husband and wife, &ldquo;I am imposing the maximum penalty of £300&rdquo; which is a severe penalty, whereas the loss of a licence for three weeks would not be as heavy a penalty.  This is a good amendment and it is a pity it cannot be accepted bacause it advances the law in this regard. We have got into the habit of either sending people to prison or fining them for an offence.  We are afraid to take new ideas on board although that is why we were elected.  Grave doubts were expressed about the community service orders but now they are seen to work.  The Minister provided more money to implement them last year and I hope he will provide even more this year.</P>

      <P>Responsibility for the promotion and servicing of convention business in Ireland is not a matter for my Department but for the Convention Bureau of Ireland.  The bureau state that they currently list 78 premises of various types around the country as suitable for international meetings.  These premises range from purpose-designed conference centres through to multi-purpose venues, to academic institutions and hotels.</P>
      <P>The breakdown of the size of these conference centres is as follows: 800 seats and above, 12 premises; 250 to 800 seats, 47 premises; 80 to 250 seats, 19 premises. Most conference premises provide some basic audio and audio-visual equipment. More sophisticated conference technology equipment, such as simultaneous interpretation, is readily available from competent contractors in Ireland.  This equipment is easily transported and set up for temporary installations.</P>
      <P>While most international meetings do not require the use of computers by their delegates, computers are available for such purposes as interactive audience response systems.  Likewise services such as video conferencing can be provided at most conference facilities on request.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that Ireland as a conference destination is competitive in the international market and that with increasing awareness and investment in development of conference facilities this element of the tourism product will continue to maintain its position.</P>

      <P>The question of the abolition of duty free sales within the European Community arises in the context of EC harmonisation of indirect tax rates and the completion of the internal market and is therefore a matter primarily for the Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>Total revenue earned by Aer Rianta from the duty free shops at the State airports in 1987 amounted to nearly £30 million.  Of this up to £18 million was generated from sales to passengers travelling within the European Community. The loss of this revenue would be a serious matter for Aer Rianta.  The major Irish air and sea carriers are also involved in duty free sales and would be affected by the abolition of duty free sales.</P>
      <P>Aer Rianta, the Irish air and sea carriers and other Irish companies involved in duty free sales as suppliers have formed a Duty Free Federation of Ireland and have been lobbying strongly for the retention of duty free sales within the European Community.  I completely support their efforts in this regard.  I can assure the Deputy that I have made the Minister for Finance fully aware of the implications for the State companies under my aegis of the abolition of duty free sales within the Community.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the Government decision in 1952 to which the Deputy is referring.  I understand, however, that no servicing of US military aircraft has been carried out in Ireland for a considerable number of years. There are no proposals for similar servicing or maintenance of Soviet military <Col N="2216" /> aircraft in Ireland.  However, under an agreement between Aer Rianta and Aeroflot, refuelling and catering services are provided at Shannon for aircraft of the Aeroflot fleet operating services between the USSR and Ireland and onwards to other destinations.  Approximately 1,200 movements a year are involved.</P>
      <P>In addition agreement has recently been reached for the painting of Aeroflot aircraft at Shannon.  It is expected that from September 1988 up to 40 Aeroflot aircraft per year will be repainted and refurbished in a specialised hangar to be constructed for the purpose.</P>

      <P>The provision of £400,000 in the Estimate for the Department for 1988 for the promotion of cultural relations with other countries has been funded from the national lottery.  Grants are made under this heading by the Minister for Foreign Affairs on the advice of the Cultural Relations Committee and go towards the promotion of Irish cultural and artistic events, lecture tours etc. abroad.</P>
      <P>Applications for such grants may be received from groups and individuals anywhere in Ireland and in many cases are not readily identifiable with a particular geographic location.  Furthermore, most of the funds granted are of their nature expended either abroad or on travel abroad.  Identification of expenditure by county is not therefore feasible.</P>
      <P>A complete schedule detailing the individual grants paid to date and grants approved and not yet paid is set out as follows.  No additional commitments have been entered into in regard to future disbursement.</P>

      <P>I propose to reply to Questions Nos. 39 and 40 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The steering committee which has been established to oversee the preparation and implementation of the national programme of community interest for EC purposes for Dublin comprises representatives of the Departments of Finance, Agriculture and Food, Energy, Environment, Labour, Industry and Commerce, Tourism and Transport, the Dublin City and County Manager, Dublin Chamber of Commerce and the Commission of the European Communities. Representatives of relevant State-sponsored bodies may accompany Departmental representatives as the need arises.  The chairman and secretariat <Col N="2236" /> are provided by the Department of Finance. It is the convention to avoid naming officials in the House, so the names of the members of the committee are not being given in this reply.</P>
    <P>The steering committee drew up a brief for a study by consultants to help in preparing the programme.  This brief is a comprehensive statement of the objectives and requirements of the study.  I have arranged for a copy of the brief to be placed in the Dáil Library and a copy to be sent to the Deputy directly.  This brief was given to a range of consultants as a basis for them to tender for the work. The proposals received are now being examined.  I expect that a decision on which consultants to appoint will be taken in the near future.</P>
    <P>It was envisaged in the brief sent to consultants that work on the study would commence in June, with a final report being submitted at the end of the year. This timetable is dependent on the timing of a decision by the EC Commission, who have been asked to finance part of the cost of the study.</P>
    <P>It is not possible at this stage to indicate what financial benefit Dublin will gain from the programme.</P>

    <P>¹The number of charges raised is not necessarily the same as the number of individual farmers involved because, in some instances, individual farmers will have received additional assessments for a particular year.</P>
    <P>These numbers are subject to downward revision on closer examination of liabilities, on appeal and for various other reasons, such as, for example, where it is subsequently found that individuals hold medical cards.</P>
    <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that demands and reminders are issued regularly to those who are liable to health contributions.  It has not so far proved practicable to take enforcement proceedings in regard to the arrears.  The Commissioners say, however, that the level of inquiry about the incentive scheme to bring tax affairs up-to-date, which I announced in my budget speech, leads them to expect improvement in the collection position in the current year.</P>

      <P>Deputies and Senators not infrequently form part of delegations who are concerned about local policing matters and who are met by the local divisional or district Garda officers.  I consider that this is the appropriate and most effective level at which matters of this nature can be discussed.  I understand that it is only very rarely, if indeed ever, that the Commissioner himself would meet formally with public representatives to discuss matters related to Garda business.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 53 to 62, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The table below gives details of Garda strength at the ten stations referred to in the questions, on 31 December 1986, 31 December 1987 and 30 April 1988.  It should be borne in mind that the precise allocation of Garda manpower to individual stations varies from time to time in the light of changing needs and circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The strengths assigned to Union Quay, which is the Divisional Headquarters for the Cork East Division as well as being a District Headquarters, and to Gurranabraher and Mayfield stations, which are also District Headquarters stations, include specialist staff and units that operate on a Divisional/District basis.  I <Col N="2245" /> should also mention that the reduction in strength at the Bridewell station is due mainly to the decentralisation of the Warrant <Col N="2246" /> Office activities and consequent redeployment within the Cork East Division.</P>

      <P>In February 1988 the person referred to in the question applied for an entry visa to visit the State.  He had not resided in the State previously but had been a student in Northern Ireland for six years. However, he had been refused permission to remain in the United Kingdom.  His application was refused as my Department were not satisfied, on the basis of the information available, that he intended to genuinely visit the State. My Department are not seeking any undertaking from the person concerned in relation to an entry visa for the State.</P>

Patrol cars are assigned to Mountmellick and Portarlington stations and two patrol cars are assigned to Abbeyleix station, which is responsible for providing mobile patrols in the Rathdowney area also.  In addition, the areas served from all the stations referred to receive regular attention from patrols by the traffic corps and the Detective Unit based at the Divisional Headquarters at Portlaoise.</P>

      <P>The person named applied for grants under the special beef premium on 28 animals last July.  Payment was made on 22 of these and the remaining six were found to be ineligible because one animal had no ear tag and the other five had no identity cards.  On 9 December 1987 the person named lodged an application for the special beef premium scheme on 53 animals (including the 28 already mentioned) but this application was lodged too late for consideration of payment on the extra 25 animals listed on it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2259" /> Her husband has been in receipt of unemployment assistance during all of this time and had claimed an increase in respect of his wife as an adult dependant and also had been paid the full child dependant allowance for his two children.</P>
    <P>From 17 November 1986 when equal treatment provisions were introduced this couple were only each properly entitled to be paid at the personal rate plus an increase in each case of half the child dependant allowance.  In addition, her husband would have been entitled to the £20 per week special alleviation payment.</P>
    <P>As the full circumstances of the situation only came to light this year it is only possible to regularise the position from a current date.  Regulations, (S.I. No. 368 of 1986) specifically provide that in a case like this arrears otherwise due to one spouse shall be offset against an overpayment incurred by the other spouse.  This has been done in this particular case and the alleviation payment which was retrospectively awarded to the husband has been included in the adjustments made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn)</NameTxt>
      <P>The making of a special amenity area order is a reserved function of the planning authority in accordance with the provisions of section 42 of the Planning and Development Act 1963, as amended by the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act 1976.  Where such an order is made it requires confirmation by the Minister for the Environment in accordance with the provision of section 43 of the 1963 Act.  In 1977 the Dublin Bay Special Amenity Area Order was made by Dublin Corporation.  Because of objections made a public local inquiry was held.  The then Minister for the Environment, having considered the objections and the report on the inquiry, made an order on 6 November 1981 refusing to confirm this special amenity area order.  The main reasons for the Minister's decision were:</P>
      <P>1.  The order gave little protection to the areas covered in addition to that already provided for in the development plan.  No objectives were included for the preservation or enhancement of any special features in the area or for the prevention or limitation of development.</P>
      <P>2.  The order was ambiguous in a number of respects particularly in regard to the intentions of the planning authority relating to port development and exempted development.</P>
      <P>3.  The development plan on which the order was based had been superseded by the new plan.  The provisions of the order envisaged that it could be altered by provisions in the new plan which would be contrary to the provisions in the Planning Act for the review and amendment of SAAOs.</P>
      <P>4.  The order provided for the location of potentially incompatible uses in parts of the area without providing for their separation or management.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>5.  The inclusion of housing areas <Col N="2266" /> within areas designated as of &ldquo;outstanding natural beauty&rdquo;, was inconsistent with the provisions of the Act for the making of SAAOs.</P>
    <P>6.  The order was insufficiently detailed to provide the protection for amenity which would be expected from it.</P>
    <P>The making of a special amenity area order or orders, is still open to the Dublin authorities in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Planning Acts.</P>

      <P>The sum of £30,000, representing approximately £300 per dwelling house, which was provided by my Department towards the cost of landscaping at this estate, is a more than equitable contribution from housing construction capital towards the cost of these works.  In addition to that the Clareville Estate Residents Association has been allocated a grant of £5,000 under the amenities grant scheme for the five-a-side soccer all weather area in this location.</P>
      <P>Dublin Corporation wrote to my Department on 19 April 1988 seeking an amenity grant for this project.  It was not among the projects for which I announced grant allocations on 21 April 1988.  In the event of additional funds becoming available, I will consider the application in conjunction with all others received.</P>

      <Col N="2277" /> In 1986, Dublin County Council submitted a proposal to the Department to provide a footpath on the section of the N11 Cornelscourt-Cabinteely by-pass between Clonkeen Road and Johnstown Road.</P>
    <P>My Department considered that, in the interest of road safety, a footpath should not be provided at this location and that pedestrians should be encouraged to use the existing by-passed road where traffic volumes would be much lower.  A footbridge was provided at the Clonkeen Road junction and approval also issued for the acceptance of a tender for the construction of a pedestrian overbridge at Johnstown Road.  These overbridges will provide access across the by-pass to the old Bray road.</P>
    <P>In view of the provision of pedestrian overbridges, the general undesirability of having pedestrians use a heavily trafficked route, and the low pedestrian volumes involved, I do not propose to provide funds for a footpath at this location.  The local authority has been advised accordingly.</P>

      <P>Complaints about air pollution are the responsibility of the local authority concerned, in this case Dublin County Council.  However, I understand that in response to a notice of High Court proceedings under the Air Pollution Act, 1987, issued by the council on 27 April, the company involved informed the council that the manufacturing process which caused the air pollution problem was terminated on 13 May 1988.  The matter is being kept under review by the council.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if he intends to amend present legislation in order to empower local authorities to direct owners of land adjoining a public highway to make safe, by felling or otherwise, trees that may, in the opinion of that local authority, constitute a danger to road users.</P>

      <P>In cases where trees or hedges are growing on private property, it is a matter in the first instance for the landowner concerned to arrange for the trimming or cutting of such hedges or trees. However, where roadside trees growing on private property are considered to be a hazard to road users, local authorities have been instructed by my Department to notify the owners or occupiers of the lands where such trees are located and to invite their co-operation in dealing with the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Local authorities have specific powers under section 34 of the Local Government Act, 1925, to request the cutting or trimming by landowners or occupiers of trees or hedges on private property which cause obstruction to road users or danger by obstructing the view of road users. The section also includes a provision enabling a local authority to seek an order of the District Court empowering them to carry out such trimming or cutting of trees and to recover the cost where the landowner or occupier had refused to do such works despite a District Court order requiring him to do so.  The exercise of <Col N="2279" /> these powers is wholly within the competence of local authorities.</P>
    <P>While the existing arrangements appear to be adequate I will keep the matter under review.</P>

      <P>In accordance with the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> there is no compulsory redundancy affecting permanent health service staff at present.</P>
      <P>A total of 11 staff in clerical-administrative grades have expressed an interest in availing of the public service early retirement-voluntary redundancy scheme.</P>
      <P>On the matter of the overall level of clerical-administrative staffing the position is staffing was reduced from 284.38 w.t.e. (whole time equivalents) on 31 March 1987 to 268.59 w.t.e. on 31 December 1987, the percentage reduction being 5.5 per cent.</P>
      <P>This reduction was achieved through a range of measures including career breaks, job sharing, non-renewal of temporary contracts and natural wastage rather than compulsory redundancy.</P>

      <P>It is not possible to determine accurately the numbers of deaths either directly or indirectly attributable to the use or misuse of alcohol.  A number of causes of death are regarded as alcohol-related, principally chronic liver disease and cirrhosis of the liver.  The number of deaths due to these conditions were 132 in 1980 and 90 in 1985.  The most recent available figure is provisional and refers to 1986 in which 99 deaths were registered as due <Col N="2290" /> to these conditions.

      <P>The numbers of public patients on the waiting list for hip replacement operations for the past two years are as follows: 31/12/86, 202 patients including 8 from the Midland Health Board area; 31/12/87, 269 patients, including 20 from the Midland Health Board area; 29/2/88, 217 patients, including 17 from the Midland Health Board area.</P>
      <P>The number of private patients on the waiting list is not known since this is a matter for each individual consultant. The precise number of the patients on the waiting list who are medical card holders is not known but it is estimated to be between 50 per cent to 60 per cent of the total.  The Midland Health Board is now providing an orthopaedic service in its own area at Tullamore and this should result in a considerable reduction in the waiting list at Our Lady's Hospital, Navan.</P>

Comhairle na nOspidéal have recently submitted to me their report on the organisation of neo-natal services in Dublin.  The views of the faculty were taken into account in the preparation of the report.</P>
      <P>Comhairle are now proceeding to examine the organisation of neo-natal services in other parts of the country.  The recommendations made by Comhairle and the Faculty of Paediatrics will be taken into account in the formulation of future policy on neo-natal services.</P>

      <P>I had inquiries made of the Eastern Health Board in this case and have been informed that the person in question applied for and was granted a domiciliary care allowance with effect from the date of application, i.e., 16 July 1987.  I understand that the applicant is seeking payment of the allowance for some considerable period prior to that date and to offset any such payment against an overpayment to him of supplementary welfare allowance.  Unfortunately, it is not administratively feasible to make payments of domiciliary care allowance in respect of any period prior to the date of application.</P>
      <P>I also understand from the health board that agreement has now been reached with the applicant regarding the repayment of the overpayment of supplementary welfare allowance on the basis of a deduction of £5 per week from his unemployment assistance payments.</P>

      <P>The Eastern Health Board are making every effort to treat children with orthodontic conditions as soon as possible. However, at present there are 1,286 children awaiting complicated orthodontic treatments in the Dublin area.  The waiting list has grown due to difficulties in attracting suitably qualified persons to fill the vacant post of consultant orthodontist with the Eastern Health Board.  This post was created in 1983 and has been advertised on a number of occasions without success as indeed have a number of such posts in other health board areas in recent years.  An alternative arrangement has been made between the Eastern Health Board and the Dublin Dental Hospital to provide orthodontic treatment for eligible children and has now been in place for a number of months.  This should lead to an improvement in the delivery of services over time.  In addition, my Department have very recently received proposals from the Eastern Health Board for the future development of its orthodontic services, which my officials will consider in light of available resources.</P>

      <P>The administration of the higher education grants scheme is statutorily entrusted to local authorities. Section 2 (1) (a) of the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Act, 1968 provides for the making of grants to candidates who, <i>inter alia</i>, achieve prescribed successes at the leaving certificate examination of the Department of Education. Local authorities are, therefore, not empowered to admit successes in an examination other than the leaving certificate examination, for the purposes of determining a candidate's eligibility for a grant.</P>
      <P>A student who chooses not to sit the leaving certificate examination of the Department of Education and who does not obtain the prescribed examination successes is precluded from being considered for the award of a grant under the schemes of financial assistance operated under the aegis of my Department.</P>
      <P>I have no plans to alter the existing statutory position.</P>
