      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he has held consultations with any of the leaders of other EC countries regarding the composition of the new European Commission which takes up office on 1 January 1989; if a final decision has been reached regarding the Irish nominee to the next Commission; when he expects to announce the name of the Irish nominee; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Taoiseach, in view of the suggestion that Ireland could have a chance of the Presidency of the Commission, to make a decision immediately on this issue and to consider that decision in the light of the fact that previously he decided to support someone from this side of the House for that position?  I hope he will not do another U-turn on this issue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach not agree that it would be wise to make a decision and an announcement, with all the qualifications the Taoiseach has mentioned at a very early moment on the basis that a certain amount of position taking is already taking place among the other member Governments and would the Taoiseach not agree with me that it would be most unwise to follow the precedent that he set on the last occasion when he made an appointment very late in the day?</P>

I should like to assure Deputy Dukes that I am listening very carefully to what is said around Europe and what the prospects are in regard to the Presidency and other matters. All those issues will be taken fully into account by me and I think it would be as well now if there was not any more pressure put on me in this regard.</P>

It is appreciated in particular because with the ongoing almost daily series of events, these people still languishing there may well tend to be forgotten.  I understand that the committee appreciate and will make full use of the opportunity to meet with the Taoiseach and to discuss the issues outstanding with him.</P>

Creidim go mbeidh tábhacht ar leith ag baint leis an bhfeachtas sin ó thaobh cur chun cinn na Gaeilge de agus ní foláir mionscrúdú a dhéanamh ar na bealaí is fearr leis an mbuntáiste is mó a bhaint as an gcaiteachas a bheidh i gceist.

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach the annual average number of persons who emigrated from 1980 to 1985 inclusive; the numbers who emigrated in 1986 and 1987; and the estimated number of persons who will emigrate in 1988.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VincentBrady" hpid="Mr. V. Brady Mr. V. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>Comprehensive documentary or other administrative procedures relating to the movement of persons into and out of the State would be necessary in order to determine the actual numbers of inward and outward migrants in any period.</P>
      <P>As such procedures are not in force the only reliable estimates of migration flows are those for net migration, i.e., the difference between the inward and outward flows, between successive Censuses of Population.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1768" /> Population estimates are made in respect of mid-April of each year from which estimates of net migration can be derived for the 12 months to mid-April.</P>
    <P>In the five-year period from April 1980 to April 1985 net outward migration is estimated to have been 42,000 persons equivalent to an annual average of 8,400. In the years to mid-April 1986 and 1987 estimated net outward migration was 28,000 and 27,000 respectively.  The net migration estimates for the 12 months to mid-April 1988 will not be available for some months.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that the rise in emigration is dramatic? I might further ask when he will be in a position to indicate the age cohorts involved?  Would the Minister not agree that when one looks at the age cohorts of emigrants, the percentage rate is now approaching the same levels as in the fifties?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VincentBrady" hpid="Mr. V. Brady Mr. V. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>The information requested in the question deals mainly with statistical requirements.  However, I can tell the Deputy that the estimated net outward migration for 1987 showed a reduction of 1,000 over 1986.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the return of emigration in such proportions &mdash; this is acknowledged in the Minister's reply to the question &mdash; would the Minister and the Government consider the establishment of a commission on emigration, on the lines of the 1948 commission, to review all aspects of emigration, its causes and consequences?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Marine if his Department has been involved in discussions with regard to the development of a private marina at Dún Laoghaire harbour, County Dublin; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. P. Gallagher) Pat 'the Cope' Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. P. Gallagher)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6, 9 and 23 together.</P>
      <P>My Department are currently involved in discussions with regard to the development of a public marina at Dún Laoghaire harbour.  A proposal has recently been received from a private company to construct a 220 berth marina in the coal harbour.  Yacht berthing facilities would be made available to the general public. It is proposed that the project, including any necessary dredging and breakwater construction, would be funded entirely from private sources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposal is currently being examined by a working group, consisting of officials of the Department of the Marine and the Office of Public Works.  No decision on the proposal has yet been taken.  I am anxious that there should continue to be maximum public access to the facilities of the harbour.  I have had a number of meetings with local interest groups from Dún Laoghaire to hear their views on the question of a marina.  My Department are continuing to seek views <Col N="1770" /> on the matter to ensure that all opinions can be considered before a decision is taken.  I am aware of another proposal. However, no discussions have taken place as yet.  I expect the Minister will meet with representatives of the company shortly.</P>
    <P>On the general question of development, legal ownership of the harbour still rests with the Commissioners of Public Works.  When functions in relation to Dún Laoghaire harbour have been transferred to me I will consider the options for development of the harbour.  I am satisfied that the proposed marina would be in line with the balanced development of the harbour and would make better use of the amenity value to the public which the area presents.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister to state quite clearly if it is the policy of this Government to reverse the decision of the last Government to set up a harbour authority in Dún Laoghaire?  It would appear that this is the case.  Would the Minister confirm that the last Government had put in train the procedure for the preparation of legislation for the establishment of such an authority?  If a harbour authority were to be set up would he not agree that it would be a pointless exercise that his Department, or any other Department for that matter, should enter into negotiations with any group before such authority could be set up, as presumably that authority would represent various interest groups affected by the future use of the harbour?  Is it not a total slap in the face for local democracy that negotiations should take place between the Department and developers without any consultation whatsoever with the local authority in question, with interest groups and with Deputies for that constituency, who have consistently endeavoured to raise this matter?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I am asking a question, a Cheann Comhairle.  We have received <Col N="1771" /> replies in the past to the effect that no final plans are available for Dún Laoghaire harbour because of its being transferred to the Department of the Marine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be very happy to answer a question on the legislation relating to a harbour authority, if that question were before me.  The question refers largely to the development of a marina at Dún Laoghaire.  In view of negotiations and discussions that are taking place &mdash; discussions will take place with Dún Laoghaire Corporation &mdash; I assure the House no decisions will be taken unless they are in the best interests of Dún Laoghaire.  The Deputy referred at length to the harbour authority and if it were the subject of a parliamentary question, I would only be too happy to answer it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldineKennedy" hpid="Miss Kennedy Miss Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Miss Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, I would like to point out that my question is more general and asks whether any decisions regarding various proposals for Dún Laoghaire harbour are being considered. Is the setting up of a harbour authority to guarantee members of the public access to this public amenity being considered in line with the other developments the Minister has mentioned?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>All the points raised by Deputy Kennedy are under consideration. While the question may appear more general, it does not refer to the setting up of a harbour authority. However, all matters will be treated in tandem.  I assure the House, at the expense of repeating myself, that any decisions taken will be in the best public interests, and will be widely accepted and acclaimed by the Deputies representing Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister confirm that since July 1986 his Department have had comprehensive proposals from Dún Laoghaire Corporation with regard to the future development of the harbour?  Would the Minister indicate <Col N="1772" /> also when his Department might respond to that locally elected democratic organisation, that would appear to have the most immediate interest in and concern with the harbour?  Can he indicate when his Department might have the courtesy to respond to them indicating what is to become of their proposals?  In particular, would the Department be disposed to give a response at some stage to Dún Laoghaire Corporation's request for £250,000 to enable them&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that the previous Government made a decision in October 1986 to set up a harbour authority to ensure the integrated development of the harbour area, including traffic control &mdash; road and port &mdash; Sealink development, the local yachting recreational development and the local authority interests in the area?  Would he not share the view that as a prerequisite to any development of the harbour, a harbour authority should be established? Will he inform the House who he had discussions with concerning the proposal for a 220 berth marina to which he has referred in his reply?  What interests are involved in the discussions with the Department?</P>

I do not believe it is absolutely a prerequisite to set up a harbour authority there.  If Deputy Desmond says the previous Government took this decision in October 1986 I have no doubt that is correct, as he was a member of that <Col N="1774" /> Government, but I do not have that information in my brief.  I also accept what the Deputy says in regard to the objectives at that time but in the intervening period we had the election.  We will give consideration to this matter but I do not believe it is prerequisite.  I can assure the House that consideration will be given to the views of the corporation, the elected representatives and also any public representatives in the area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to ask the Minister if the Office of Public Works will be bypassed in the future for any or all decisions in relation to Dún Laoghaire harbour and if the fact that he and not his colleague, Deputy Treacy, the Minister with responsibility for the Office of Public Works, is answering this question today is a statement in itself?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>In my reply I said the matter is being examined by a working group consisting of officials of the Department of the Marine and the Office of Public Works.  There is no question of by-passing the Office of Public Works, particularly as they still have responsibility in this field.  The reason I am answering the question is that we will have responsibility for this area in the near future.  It had been expected that the powers could be transferred fairly readily but I do not believe it is that straight-forward now.  These powers cannot be transferred from the OPW to the Department of the Marine under existing legislation.  I am awaiting a view from the Attorney General in relation to this matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Marine the progress which has been made in re-establishing a profitable Irish ship building, ship repairing and marine servicing industry; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I assumed responsibility for the industries mentioned last October.  Progress in re-establishing the ship building industry is difficult for two basic reasons: (i) over-capacity in the shipping industry which has greatly reduced the level of demand for ships; (ii) the state of the public finances which severely limits the scope for assisting the industry at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The world ship building-ship repair scene is extremely competitive with too <Col N="1777" /> many shipyards chasing too few orders, and many yards are receiving generous State assistance to stay in business.  It is against this background that the options available for developing the ship building and ancillary service industries, including disposal of Verolme Cork Dockyard as a going concern, are being examined in my Department.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has indicated that the two factors concerned are over-capacity in the shipping industry and the state of public finances.  If they are the reasons for the lack of development in the job creation area and improvements in the ship building industry, why did his Government include in their manifesto of February last year a statement that they intended to embark on the re-establishment of a profitable Irish ship building, ship repairing and ship servicing industry?  Why did they set that out as a goal and as an objective when they are now telling us, less than a year later, that little or no progress is expected in this area?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Changes can come very quickly in the shipbuilding industry. It is 12 months since that statement was made.  However, I am still confident this country needs such a shipyard.  The Deputy referred to shipbuilding, ship repair and ship servicing.  Ship repair and ship servicing are essential and if we had the necessary facilities we would be in a position to build the ships if we got the orders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of the Cork dockyard is one we in the Department would like to see resolved.  We would also like to see the shipbuilding, ship repairing and ship servicing being reopened.  This is a matter for the liquidator who was called in by the courts.  We are keeping a keen eye on this but we have no discretion in this area.  However, we are asked for our observations and I can assure the Deputy that it is our firm intention to do our utmost, within the constraints placed upon us because of the appointment of <Col N="1778" /> the liquidator, to ensure that we can reopen this dockyard.</P>
    <P>I would draw the Deputy's attention to the guidelines for aiding shipbuilding within Community countries.  There is a world-wide crisis in the shipbuilding industry and this crisis continues to deepen together with the imbalance between shipbuilding capacity and demand, causing prices to fall to a level which is often below the fixed cost of European shipyards.  The price problem has been aggravated by the development of the cost competitive capacity of third countries, particularly in the production of standardised vessels.  We are anxious to have a shipbuilding industry in Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>Little has changed since February last.  May I bring the Minister's attention to two specifics in regard to ship repairing and shipbuilding?  Is he aware that previous Governments invested heavily in the development of Howth harbour and that there exists there a ship repair service whose charges are so high that most of the fishermen, if not all of them, travel to England where they can get a quicker, more efficient and cheaper service?  That is something he might look into so that some on-harbour jobs would develop at Howth.</P>

      <P>With regard to the Verolme shipyard, would the Minister not accept that the current approach of the liquidator, selling off piecemeal plant and equipment, is undesirable?  Surely the Government should, and can, influence matters by taking steps to invest in the purchase of the plant in its entirety to preserve it as a unit?</P>

      <P>There is the question of price competitiveness between Howth and the west coast of England.  I have had long discussions with the fishing industry from Howth and they have made abundantly clear the difficulties arising in that area.  We have taken into consideration the fact that the fishermen have to cross to England and spend a number of days there while waiting for the repairs to be carried out, and when we add those costs to the cost of repairs carried out in England and compare them to what it would cost to have these repairs carried out in Howth I do not believe the cost would be very much greater.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for the Marine the total number of persons employed in fish farming in the State; the plans, if any, the Government have for the expansion and development of this sector; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>There are at present 330 full-time and 1,040 part-time workers engaged in aquaculture.  In conjunction with my Department, BIM is working on plans for the development of the industry <Col N="1780" /> over the coming years and it is expected that by 1991 the numbers employed will be 1,100 full-time and 2,300 part-time.  A strategy to underpin this development of the aquaculture industry has recently been approved by the Government which covers the allocation of functions and responsibilities of the various agencies involved in aquaculture &mdash; my Department, Bord Iascaigh Mhara, Udarás na Gaeltachta, the reconstituted fisheries boards, and the proposed Marine Institute.</P>
      <P>The strategy provides that my Department will have responsibility for overall policy, planning licensing and the co-ordination of the activities of all the other agencies and a committee structure is being established to facilitate those tasks. A small management committee has already been established comprising representatives from my Department, BIM, Údarás and Roinn na Gaeltachta. Among its tasks will be the co-ordination of State funding for aquaculture projects so as to optimise the returns in terms of employment and output.  Another new feature is the establishment of an advisory committee which will represent all the major interests in the aquaculture industry and will improve communications and the flow of ideas on the best means for securing the development of the industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the scale of the investment necessary to maximise jobs in the aquaculture area, there is need for active State investment to give a lead in this industry.  Given the history of involvement of State and semi-State bodies in fish farming to date &mdash; for example, the ESB who were the single biggest fish farmer for a long time, the Central Fisheries Board and other agencies &mdash; have the Government any plans for borrowing abroad, if necessary, and the investment of State money in the development and leadership of this industry?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government are anxious that there be the maximum investment in this area.  In order to ensure <Col N="1781" /> that we can avail of FEOGA grants &mdash; a matter for another question &mdash; we are providing the minimum State assistance so that there will be an equitable distribution of this money across the board and to maximise the grants available from the Community.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that Údarás na Gaeltachta had a major impact in the pioneering development of much of the work in fish farming in recent years, and because Údarás na Gaeltachta have to develop natural resources if they are to create jobs, what is the Government's role for Údarás na Gaeltachta in terms of the strategy recently approved for fish farming development?  I am sure the Minister knows exactly what I am speaking about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Údarás na Gaeltachta will play a very active part.  We have ensured that they will be very much a part of the management team which will meet often, possibly on a monthly basis, to assess on an ongoing basis the development of aquaculture.  They will also give their assessment on applications for grant aid, whether inside or outside the Gaeltacht.  The Deputy will fully appreciate the work Údarás na Gaeltachta have done in the development of aquaculture in the Gaeltacht areas.  We want to capitalise on the data they have garnered over the years and which will be part and parcel of the scheme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I might put two brief questions to the Minister.  Do the plans the Government have for expansion and development of this sector include increasing the manpower resources of the fisheries research centre?  Would the Minister accept that, because of undermanning at the scientific research level, we are inhibiting the growth of this sector at present?  Can I take it from the Minister's initial response to this question that he is rationalising the whole procedure in relation to designation and distribution of agricultural licences?  Within that &mdash; if my assumption is correct &mdash; can he indicate how he will cope with the competing <Col N="1782" /> demands for water usage from the different sectoral interests &mdash; including local authorities &mdash; sewage disposal, yachting, aquaculture and the various other areas where there are difficulties in ascertaining who comes where and what is the order of priorities for competing demands on water usage?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I might answer the Deputy's question in reverse order.  I am very aware of the necessity to protect these waters for amentity purposes.  I have always said &mdash; and am on record both in Government and Opposition as saying &mdash; that the traditional right of sea harvesters must be protected together with the protection of amenity facilities and, of course, navigational and shipping lines.  There is an opportunity afforded, when any area is to be designated when there may be a public inquiry held, to have any objections lodged, when all of these factors are taken into consideration. To date there have been no difficulties encountered.  However, I can accept the point made by Deputy Doyle. I can foresee difficulties arising further down the road.  We will ensure that we take all of these factors into consideration before a definite decision is taken.  In relation to the fisheries research centre, I cannot go along with the Deputy's contention that it is under-staffed.  I believe that the staff at the centre are able to cope adequately.  However, I should say that the legislation in respect of the establishment of the marine institute is at an advanced stage.  All of the various strands will be weaved together into that institute and all of these matters will be carefully examined.  If the Deputy wants to bring any specific queries to my notice, I will be only too pleased to have them investigated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Begley</NameTxt>
      <P>I should remind the Minister that all that glistens is not gold. Would the Minister inform the House what steps his Department are taking about pollution at these mariculture cages around the country, particularly in view of the fact that Mulroy Bay &mdash; in his <Col N="1783" /> constituency &mdash; is completely contaminated?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>One hears something new every day.  I always thought I was <i>au fait</i> with happenings in my constituency and county but I am not aware of that contamination.  If Deputy Begley is that aware he should certainly bring the matter to my attention&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelBegley" hpid="Mr. Begley Mr. Begley">

    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;when I will have it investigated.  I will not pre-empt the outcome of my investigations but I will be very surprised if what Deputy Begley says in relation to Donegal is found to be the case.  Indeed I might thank him for having advised me of the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the comment of the Minister of State with regard to the strategy recently approved by the Government in relation to fish farming would he say if that means that approvals by Údarás na Gaeltachta in respect of fish farming development must be endorsed finally by the Department of the Marine before going ahead and if the Department of the Marine have overall responsibility for this development?  In other words have Údarás na Gaeltachta authority to take decisions to give the goahead in respect of approved developments?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer is &ldquo;yes&rdquo;. The recommendations of the committee, comprising representatives of the Department, An Bord Iascaigh Mhara, Údarás na Gaeltachta and the fisheries boards will come before the Minister.  But I doubt very much that there would be any intention of nodding through any recommendations emanating from Údarás na Gaeltachta just for the sake of nodding them through.  I fully appreciate the work done by Údarás na Gaeltachta over the years in the development of the aquaculture industry.  If the Deputy has any fears I think I can allay them.  Without <Col N="1784" /> prejudicing any discussions that might take place I should say I will be only too pleased to meet him to discuss these matters.</P>

      <P>I am aware of reports of illegal fishing for pike. Indeed very recently I had reports of widespread illegal fishing for pike and the Shannon Regional Fisheries Board investigated.  The investigation revealed, however, that the reports could not be substantiated.</P>
      <P>Measures to conserve pike stocks were introduced under the conservation of pike by-law No. 654 of 1986.  Primary enforcement of the by-law rests with the Central and Regional Fisheries Boards and I am currently reviewing these measures.</P>
      <P>The fisheries boards are responsible for combating illegal fishing in their own areas.  I support them in this work.  I will continue to afford them every assistance to combat all types of illegal fishing within the limited resources available.</P>

      <P>Arising out of the Minister's reply and, in particular, his reference to the 1986 order to conserve pike stocks, can he explain to the House why fisheries boards staff found it necessary to cull, in 1987, 4,800 pike in the Shannon fisheries board region, over 12,000 pike in the western region, 931 pike in the north western region and 30 pike in the northern region?  How does that fit with the conservation order the Minister has just mentioned in respect of pike stocks which he says was issued in 1986?</P>

      <P>The regional fisheries boards carry out pike eradication schemes to keep the levels of pike under control.  The Department do not allow <Col N="1785" /> blanket approval to fishing clubs to fish for pike at all times.  However, in the case of clubs wishing to hold fishing competitions or pike removal operations in certain western lakes, special arrangements can be made.</P>

      <P>If these clubs in certain regions get a special permission, as it were, to help the fisheries boards in their culling or eradication schemes, will the £10 coarse angling licence be necessary, or what sense does it make to charge on the one hand when we are paying our fisheries boards staff on the other?</P>

    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Marine his views on the Salmon Review Group report; if he accepts its recommendations; and when he intends to implement them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11, 18 and 29 together.  I have accepted the objectives as included in the report and am of the opinion that they will form a firm foundation on which the development of the salmon industry can be based.  Salmon is a national asset which must be developed in the national interest with a view to creating sustainable employment, better income distribution and improved recreational amenities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recently published the report of the Salmon Review Group, and in view of the many far-reaching recommendations made by the group, I invited interested parties to submit their observations on the report as soon as possible.  A number of interested parties indicated that the original timetable of end February was not sufficient.  I, therefore, extended the date for replies to 31 March 1988.  I will, on considering their views, arrange for <Col N="1787" /> implementation of those recommendations in the report which I consider will best achieve the objectives which I have adopted.</P>
    <P>The report covers a very wide range of issues.  This area is notorious for the conflicting interests between anglers and draft net fishermen on the one hand, and drift net fishermen on the other.  Any strategy which I adopt would endeavour to maintain that balance.  I do not, therefore, envisage the lifting of the monofilament ban in isolation from implementation of alternative conservation measures.</P>
    <P>I have also accepted in principle the introduction of a tagging and quotas system for dead salmon which is one of the alternative conservation measures recommended by the group.  In relation to the tagging and quota system, all the recommendations will be discussed together and a decision taken as soon as possible.  My Department are currently formulating detailed arrangements for its early introduction following consultation with fishing interests.  These details will include the fixing and distribution of quotas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister, in relation to the salmon review group, why it is now necessary to receive submissions in the wake of the report being published and why submissions from these various groups were not received by the body who were set up to publish the report we received recently?  For example, has the Minister received any submissions on behalf of the fishermen?  Why were they not included as part of the original terms of reference of the body who sat to formulate this report?  While I am on my feet, may I also ask the Minister to make it clear once and for all whether, as part of the recommendations of the salmon review group, he or the Government intend to set up a single fishery authority, and I use the words the report uses?  Can we please hear from the Minister what his intentions are in this area and what the future of the regional boards will be?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason for inviting submissions at this stage is that we are anxious to hear the views of the industry on the recommendations.  The initial submissions were in relation to the problems in the salmon fishing industry and, therefore, we felt it would be very wise and sensible to request the industry's views to give them an opportunity to give their views before any final decision is taken in relation to the recommendations of the salmon review report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>This is not a final report. There will be a further report subsequent to the submissions the Minister will receive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>When the submissions are received at the end of March we will study them and make a decision on the recommendations, which we will either accept or reject.  I think all of us, irrespective of our interests in whatever field, fully accept the objectives of the report which are to exploit the potential for substantial employment, maximise net income on a long term basis, optimise income distribution, which I feel is very important, optimise the amenity and recreational value and conserve and develop individual stock quotas.  We are reviewing at present the question of regional fisheries boards and at this point it would be wrong of me to give any views here while this is under active consideration within the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sceptical when the Minister talks about interested fishing bodies throughout the country.  Every Minister who comes in here says the same thing.  I wonder why people are protesting in the street every other day of the week. Do the Minister's discussions encompass all the different views around the country from the south-east to the north-east to the west to the south because the views are very different?  The problems pertaining to the west coast of Ireland are radically different from those on the east coast or the south-east coast.  There are no salmon left in the rivers and there are <Col N="1789" /> no spawning grounds left.  My question specifically asked the Minister what he intends to do about monofilament net fishing and I have not got an answer to that.  It has been couched in vague language that it is being looked at in relation to conservation measures and all sorts of other things.  This is March 1988 and the season is upon us.  Is the Minister telling me at this stage that he does not know what he is going to do about it?  May I have an answer to those two specific points?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I was told earlier in the day that we are not accepting the views of representatives in relation to, for example, Dún Laoghaire harbour and now I am being told that we should not be asking the industry for their views. The review report was made available to us early in the year and we felt there was not sufficient time between then and 29 February for the industry to make a submission to us in relation to the recommendations. I fully accept what Deputy Cullen said about there being great difficulties in respect of the final decision. We must reach a decision which ensures that there is equal distribution and which optimises the amenity and recreational value right throughout the country. There are difficulties but I think the Deputy must accept that we have been talking since I came into this House about problems in relation to the salmon industry and this is the first time we have had anything concrete.  As soon as is practicable and possible after 31 March both I and the Minister, together with officials of the Department, will give full consideration to the submissions made by the industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I ask the Minister, if it is intended to introduce a salmon quota system, if he will ensure that each drift net licence holder will have the same laws applying to him.  In other words, a quota should apply equally to each licence holder and there should not be any variation and also in relation to the length of drift nets, the same length of net should apply to each licence holder.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1790" /> There should not be the type of discrimination that is proposed in the report which, of course, takes into account the larger catches in certain areas where we know that the monofilament net has been largely in use and where there are much larger boats.  Is it the Minister's intention to have the conditions applying equally to all licence holders, including size of boat size of net and size of catch?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>The questions asked by Deputy Molloy are being fully considered, and will be fully considered before the final report is made available. The situation at present is that a currach can have a licence and a 46 ft. boat can have a licence and the same length of netting applies to both boats.  I do not envisage &mdash; and this is a personal opinion&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not so.  The same length does not apply to both boats.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Does it not?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  Different fishery districts have different lengths.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not envisage any change there but my personal view &mdash; and I should like to emphasise that it is a personal view &mdash; is that the length of net that is being proposed, whether it is accepted or not, should be the same for all licence holders.  On the point that the number of salmon for each boat will be the same, if the quotas are accepted, I certainly would not be as adamant on that question as I would be in relation to the other question.  I want to re-emphasise that I believe the most important of the basic objectives is to ensure that there is an equitable distribution of income right across the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that the report envisages a single fishery authority right through, until we know the Minister's mind or the mind of the Government in that regard the rest of the report falls.  Will we have the final report when <Col N="1791" /> the Minister has received the final submissions? I still do not accept the reason given by the Minister.  Perhaps he can explain why all submissions were not received before this report was published. He could continue receiving submissions and making additional reports forever if he wanted to postpone action. May we have an answer, please, to the question put, which is, whether the Minister intends to legalise monofilament nets?</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for the Marine the contact his Department had from the EC Commission in July 1987 concerning Irish aquaculture projects submitted under the fisheries structures policy/or the December tranche; if it was indicated to his Department that the cost structure of the Irish projects submitted was unsatisfactory; and the action which was taken by his Department to correct this situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>During discussions in July last year with officials of my Department on the multi-annual guidance programme for aquaculture, representatives of the European Commission raised the question of the cost structure of a number of the aquaculture projects submitted by Ireland.  I felt that the best way to proceed was to have the promoters concerned meet directly with Commission officials and on 22 July last year a group from the Irish Aquaculture Association accompanied by officials of Roinn na Mara went to Brussels for such a meeting.  Discussions focused primarily on the cost structure issue and the Irish side felt after the meeting that any doubts or reservations which had existed on the Commission side had been cleared up.</P>
      <P>Following disappointment at the level of grant aid approved for Irish aquaculture projects in the December tranche, I raised the matter specifically at the Council of Fisheries Ministers meeting in December last year.  The matter has been raised with the Commission at official level on a number of occasions since.  I have augmented the resources available to the aquaculture division of my Department and liaison with the EC Commission and the industry is being stepped up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irish Aquaculture Association <Col N="1794" /> have been invited to meet senior officials of my Department at their earliest convenience to discuss the most effective approach to promotion of aquaculture here with European support.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>As you know, a Cheann Comhairle, this is a follow-up to previous parliamentary questions and discussions that we have had in this House on this matter of the appallingly inadequate treatment of Ireland from the structures policy point of view, particularly the 1987 tranche.  Will the Minister accept the following statement as true?  It has been issued by the Commission to myself in response to a criticism I have made of the treatment of Ireland.  The statement is as follows:</P>
      <P>The Irish Authorities were fully informed in July 1987 of the new situation and at the time it was clearly indicated to the Authorities that the cost structure of the Irish projects submitted were unsatisfactory and did not compare favourably with similar projects in other Member States of the Community.  No action was taken to correct this situation by modifying the projects which had been submitted for grant aid.</P>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that contention because there hangs the future, as far as I am concerned, for adequate grant aiding of our fisheries section under the structures policy, particularly the aquaculture section which was so badly treated?</P>

      <P>If it is a statement from the Commission, one of which I am <Col N="1795" /> not aware, I accept that it is a statement from the Commission.  I would point out, however, that in July of last year we ensured that officials of the Department dealing with the aquaculture project met with the representatives of the Commission, particularly in relation to the cost structure.  The industry, those from the Irish Aquaculture Association, left the meeting quite happy and felt that all the doubts that had existed had been cleared up.  Unfortunately, in December, particularly in the middle of December, when the Minister and I were in Brussels at a Council meeting and decisions were taken, I could not hide my disappointment. I had been quite satisfied that up to £3.5 million would be available for aquacultural projects here.  I was extremely anxious that the eight or nine projects which were on their last leg would be grant-aided in that tranche.  I continue to pursue this matter and did so again last week at the Council meeting. I shall continue to do my utmost to ensure that we in this country obtain our fair share.  That is all that we are looking for and the Council are well aware of our attitude.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that difficulties arose with one Irish project which was selected at random as a test case, as it were, and that the comparisons subsequently made by the Commission were invalid?  I understand they took a bridgestone cage technology from the west of Ireland &mdash; we are talking now about salmon &mdash; and compared it with polar circular technology used at a certain site off the coast of the United Kingdom. The comparisons involved were not valid and, as a result, the difficulties which have subsequently arisen need to be resolved immediately, particularly if this line of argument is going to be used with regard to future applications.  To ensure our success in the future for FEOGA grant aiding &mdash; or grant aiding under the structures policy, as it is more properly called now &mdash; we will have to resolve the particular difficulty in relation to the latest tranche.  Otherwise we shall have <Col N="1796" /> major problems for the future of our aquaculture industry.</P>

      <P>There was never a problem with regard to the cost structure in the past.  It is important to point out, in relation to the meeting in July and, in addition to my statement to the Council of Ministers on 15 December, that officials in the Department have met with officials of the Commission.  Bilateral discussions have taken place.  The new structures regime to which the Deputy refers is a five year one.  I want to assure the House that for the next four years we shall work vigorously to ensure a levelling off and that there is a fair, balanced structure over that period.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will have to resolve the problems that occurred this year, and the basis of their difficulties is our lack of funding.  Does the Minister feel that that has been adequately explained by the Commission and resolved?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>In order to ensure that it will be adequately resolved we have augmented the resources available to the aquaculture division of the Department and liaison with the Community and the industry has been stepped up.  It is also proposed that an official from the aquaculture section of the Department will spend some time in Brussels with Commission officials involved in the processing of aquaculture projects.  That has been agreed by the Commission and arrangements for the visit will be finalised shortly.  That is absolutely essential and I am convinced that over the five year period of this structured regime the grants will be much higher than the £1.4 million which we received this year.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>At the Council of Fisheries Ministers on 29 February 1988, which I attended, agreement was reached on a fisheries agreement between the European Community and Morocco and on the opening of autonomous tariff quotas for certain species of fish, mainly whitefish species.  The latter measure was adopted on a qualified majority basis with Ireland being the only member state to oppose the proposal.</P>
      <P>The proposed revision of the Community's common market organisation was discussed and referred back to official level for further consideration.  The European Commission also reported on relations with certain Third Countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister if there was any discussion on the whole area of gross registered tonnage which is causing such problems here, if there was any discussion on the existing quotas, such as the mackerel quotas, on which we have demanded an increase and if there was any discussion, or is likely to be in the future, on the high percentage of temporary tax here?  I take if from what the Minister said in reply to my last question that the implications of the structures policy were discussed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>That matter was not specifically on the agenda but the Minister and I avail of every opportunity to raise the questions of structures and grant aid for aquaculture or any other aspect of the industry.  There was no discussion on gross registered tonnage.  However, bilateral discussions are taking place with the Commission.  Mistakes were made a few years ago and we have responsibility now to do our utmost to ensure that we get the maximum gross registered tonnage. I appreciate that any limitations <Col N="1798" /> could hinder the development of the fishing industry.  There was no specific item on the agenda in relation to mackerel. However, the scientific advice which we have provided is now available to ICES and I expect that by the end of May we will be in a position to discuss the proposed increase in mackerel quotas.  I should like to take the opportunity to advise the House that mackerel fishing is continuing.  We will be having a meeting with representatives of the industry today and we will be listening to the views of those involved.  I am proud to be able to say that mackerel fishing continues particularly in view of the fact that this time last year the fishing had closed three or four weeks previously.</P>

      <P>What are the implications for the white fish industry of the decision taken at the last meeting of the Council of Fisheries Ministers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>This is nothing new. It happened last year and as a result our proposals for imports of white fish species into the Community are being put into effect on a planned basis this year.  The decision can be made only when we are aware of the tax and quotas for the other countries.  It strikes a balance between the needs of the processing industry and the need to protect the livelihoods of Community fishermen.  I am always fearful of any imports of white fish because they may affect white fish prices here. We continue to oppose such imports and, in fact, we are the only member state to do so.  What is coming into the Community is sufficient to take up the slack between the capacity of the processing factories in the Community and the tax. However, I hope that our industry will avail of the opportunities that exist to import white fish and process it to a finished product.</P>

      <P>The House will be aware of the recent troubled history of the B &amp; I.  When I took office in March of last year, I found a company facing major difficulties.  A restructuring package involving substantial Exchequer funding which had been put in place in the course of 1986, aimed at turning the company round, had failed in that objective.  Substantial losses had been incurred in 1986 and were similarly forecast for 1987 and subsequent years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>In February 1986, in the context of proposals made by the board of the B &amp; I to the then Minister for Communications for a financial rescue package aimed at restoring the company to viability, the Government approved equity injections totalling £38 million, £20 million to be paid in 1986 and £6 million in each of the years 1987 to 1989, inclusive, the 1988 and 1989 injections to be subject to the achievement by the <Col N="1912" /> B &amp; I of profit targets determined by the Minister for Communications with the agreement of the Minister for Finance. The targets set were a profit of £500,000 in 1987; of £1 million in 1988; and of £2 million in 1989.  The company had forecast a trading loss of about £5 million in 1986.</P>
      <P>During the course of 1986, B &amp; I received £20 million from the Exchequer. By March 1987, however, the company were in serious financial difficulties.  The 1986 trading loss had been £6.8 million or £1.8 million more than forecast and far from expecting to meet their modest profit target in 1987, the company were, in fact, forecasting trading losses of nearly £15 million for 1987.</P>
      <P>In May 1987, I brought the B &amp; I situation to the notice of the Government and subsequently on 27 May I called in the board of the B &amp; I and directed them to submit to me as soon as possible an agreed plan of action, for implementation in the autumn, aimed at restoring the company to viability.  The company had already exhausted the £6 million Exchequer equity allocation for 1987 and, to provide time for preparation of the plan of action and to prevent disruption of B &amp; I services during the peak tourism season, the Government agreed to provide the company with additional Exchequer equity of up to £8 million, of which £6 million would represent an advance of the 1988 instalment due under the 1986 restructuring package.  In the event, the company drew down £5 million of this additional allocation in 1987.  It recorded a loss in that year, including financial charges, of £10.6 million.  In the two years, 1986 and 1987, the company received, therefore, £31 million in Exchequer equity.  An Exchequer guarantee was also issued during 1987 in respect of bank borrowings of £6 million which had been incurred by the B &amp; I with the Minister's consent in 1986.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some commentators blamed the company's continuing losses on the impact of the policy of air transport liberalisation and lower air fares initiated by my predecessor in 1986 and greatly intensified by me since then.  Indeed the B &amp; I <Col N="1913" /> themselves would argue that competition from air services was a major contributory factor to the deterioration in the company's performance.  I accept that the liberalisation of air transport did not make the company's job any easier.  At the same time, any commercial organisation has to react positively to adverse changes in its commercial environment by developing and aggressively marketing new business initiatives and by reducing costs.  This applies to the car ferry companies, including B &amp; I, no less than to other commercial enterprises faced with challenging circumstances. Lower air fares cannot, however, be blamed for all of the B &amp; I's problems. Major contributory factors in the deterioration in the B &amp; I's financial performance were the company's disastrous strikes in late 1986 and early 1987 and inherent cost weaknesses in B &amp; I's operations, particularly on the freight side.</P>
    <P>In any event, I would have to say that the benefits to the economy and the community as a whole of lower air fares, greater air access and a boosted tourism sector far outweighed any adverse impact on the revenues of the B &amp; I.  The results of the crash tourism programme I initiated in 1987 bear this out.  For the first time in the industry's history total tourism revenue is estimated to have topped the £1 billion mark.  Over 2.1 million visitors came to Ireland in 1987 and total out of State revenue amounted to over £720 million.  This represented an increase of 12 per cent and 11 per cent respectively on the previous year.  Arising from this improved performance, Bord Fáilte estimate that 4,000 new jobs were created in the tourism sector in 1987. There is a question there of job equivalents.</P>
    <P>It was against the background of substantial B &amp; I losses that I directed the board of the B &amp; I last May to produce a plan of action aimed at restoring the company to viability.  The House will be aware of the long and very difficult negotiations between B &amp; I management and unions which culminated in the submission to me by the board of the B &amp; I in December 1987 of a plan of action <Col N="1914" /> which had the across-the-board support of the B &amp; I workforce.  I had indicated to them in May last year that there was not any point in coming with such a plan if there was not across-the-board support for it.  It is only fair that I should acknowledge the very responsible and constructive approach adopted by the B &amp; I unions, under the auspices of the ICTU, during several months of very difficult negotiations.  I should also acknowledge the significant concessions made by the company's workforce in agreeing a plan to secure the B &amp; I's survival.  I also acknowledge the sustained contributions made by the Chairman and Managing Director of the B &amp; I, Mr. Alex Spain, by the members of the board, and by the management of the B &amp; I, towards achieving a viable plan of action.</P>
    <P>The broad strategy of the B &amp; I plan is to create a new low cost company able to compete in the increasingly competitive passenger and freight markets, through a reorganisation of services, the shedding of more jobs, a reduction in pay and changes in conditions of the remaining employees.  The main features of the plan are as follows: a reduction of 585 in staff numbers from 1,464 to 879; a guarantee of industrial peace from the B &amp; I unions until the end of 1990; an across-the-board pay cut of 5 per cent from 1 January 1988, a pay freeze until June 1989 and extensive changes in working conditions; and a reorganisation of car ferry services.</P>
    <P>The B &amp; I-Sealink agreement, which expired on 31 December 1987 was not renewed.  The Liverpool service was terminated on 1 January while an independent B &amp; I Rosslare-Pembroke service was resumed at the same time.  The Dublin-Holyhead service has been intensified and now operates on a two round trips per day basis all year round instead of just during the peak season.  The car ferry, the <i>Connacht,</i> will no longer be required and will be sold.</P>
    <P>On the freight side, the B &amp; I-Pandoro UK Trailer Service agreement has been replaced by a new agreement with Pandoro under which B &amp; I will no longer be involved in door-to-door services but <Col N="1915" /> will concentrate on the port-to-port business only.  The B &amp; I's European container service will be made more cost efficient through the reduction of staff and other costs.</P>
    <P>The implementation costs of the plan, which mainly comprise redundancy compensation payments, are being largely financed by the sale of assets, principally the <i>Connacht.</i>  The bulk of the £11 million financing requirement for 1988 relates to payments of capital and interest on B &amp; I's existing bank loans and bank overdraft facilities.</P>
    <P>Having noted the company's plan of action and its across-the-board support by the workforce, the Government on 11 December 1987 agreed, on the basis of the plan, to provide the company with up to £11 million in Exchequer equity in 1988.  The Government also decided to review the position not later than the autumn of 1988 on the basis of detailed comparisons of the company's performance against forecasts.</P>
    <P>In view of the manner in which the 1986 restructuring package, which included Exchequer funding over a four year period, went so badly off line, I am sure that Deputies will agree that this time we must proceed more cautiously as far as the demands on the Exchequer are concerned.  It is a very reasonable response on the part of the Government to the B &amp; I's latest plan to allocate further funds up to £11 million for 1988 for the company and to review the position later this year on the basis of performance against forecast.  The plan forecasts a small operating loss, that is before financial charges, for 1988.  My Department will be receiving regular and frequent interim reports from B &amp; I during the year and I myself will be closely monitoring the situation.</P>
    <P>Before I conclude, I wish to emphasis one point.  The future of the B &amp; I cannot be assured by Government support alone.  It is equally dependent on full co-operation by all concerned in the provision of continuous, reliable and efficient services.  I have acknowledged the significant concessions made by the <Col N="1916" /> company's workforce in agreeing the plan of action with B &amp; I management and I trust that the combined efforts of the board, management and staff will ensure that the new strategy of a slimmed down B &amp; I will help the company to achieve a cost-efficient operation, to exploit new business opportunities and provide the type of low cost shipping services required for the development of our trade, tourism and general economic growth.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be irresponsible of this House to let this Bill through without a critical analysis of the history of B &amp; I, and of its present state. It is fortuitous that, as former Minister for Tourism and Transport and for Communications, I have been asked to shadow this Bill through the House today.  I suppose no one other than the Minister is in a better position to comment on the history of B &amp; I than I.  The Minister in his speech referred to the present problem of B &amp; I and the latest explanation or rationale that exists within B &amp; I for that state.</P>
      <P>However, there are three main reasons for supporting the Bill.  The first is that to close the company would cost the Exchequer a great deal more in the short term than to keep them going.  Secondly, there is, in my opinion, a strategic national need for an Irish presence on the cross-Channel ferries.  Thirdly, the B &amp; I group of unions have contributed very positively to the salvage package recently negotiated for the company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Notwithstanding these factors, the B &amp; I Bill represents a mysterious black hole into which tens of millions of taxpayers' pounds have sunk without trace. For over 20 years now with an uncanny consistency B &amp; I have never reached either the annual targets set for them or the projection for end of year outturns which the company make at the beginning of each year and, of course, each year a new explanation is given for the missed targets which in turn decorates the annual accounts as &ldquo;exceptional expenditure'.  The latest rationale for <Col N="1917" /> missed targets, as the Minister said, is the air fares competition.  Management and unions alike are seeking refuge under the wings of lower air fares as an explanation for the fact that B &amp; I's returns for 1987 are almost £20 million worse, in my calculations, than targeted, although this is obscured in the Minister's presentation. My calculations are that the targets which were for £500,000 profit in 1987 are now, when you add up all the different aspects of what the Minister said, something like a £19 million loss.  They are trying to rationalise and blame air fares competition and <i>ipso facto</i> account for a £20 million deviation in their outturn for 1987 from that targeted.</P>
    <P>I am culpable for the latest plight of B &amp; I in the minds of both management and unions in B &amp; I, but seeking outside scapegoats to blame has always been a hallmark of B &amp; I, whereas in almost all cases the problems have been internal. In relation to the effects of lower air and sea fares on B &amp; I's revenues, the Department's Estimate while I was Minister was effectively less than £6 million per annum.  I made it clear at the time that the Government were prepared to adjust their annual targets accordingly on the basis that the overall economic benefits of lower access fares clearly outweighed their drawbacks for B &amp; I.  I am glad that that point has already been made by the Minister.</P>
    <P>B &amp; I cannot credibly ascribe a £20 million deviation from the 1987 target to air fare reductions.  This is heavily emphasised by the fact that the other ferry companies serving Irish ports are all private and profit-making even after the air and sea fares revolution.  Would Sealink still be on the Irish Sea route if it were not profitable to do so?  They have nobody to blame or give them free equity.  Would Belfast Ferries still serve the long Belfast-Liverpool route if it were not profitable to do so?  They have nobody to give them free equity.  Would Irish Ferries or Brittany Ferries still be serving the Ireland-France routes if it were not profitable to do so?  Of course they would not.  They are still making profits even after the air fare revolution and they have no scapegoat <Col N="1918" /> like me to blame.  They have had to react competitively, to perform, to make profits, not just since air fares were reduced but for all those years when B &amp; I were consistently losing money.  I have described it already as a mysterious black hole.</P>
    <P>Why then do B &amp; I not make profits on their routes when all other ferry companies serving Irish ports make profits? With the exception of the Cork-Swansea company just set up, no other company get any subsidy or free equity.  B &amp; I are the last subsidised shipping company in these islands and they still manage to make enormous losses.  Why do they not make profits?  How then can they seek refuge in the air fares revolution when all other companies have managed to survive, make profits and continue in being even though they have no uncle in the Department of Finance to come out with another chit for £4 million?</P>
    <P>To put it in a more comparative context, B &amp; I were one of eight State companies for whom I was responsible when I became Minister for Communications in December 1982.  At that time only one of those companies, Aer Rianta, were in profit and a tiny one at that.  Major structural and accountancy improvements, major new approaches in the State sector turned the State sector round.  That was one of the great achievements of the previous Government. Every one of those companies today are in profit, some of them substantially so. Aer Lingus, Aer Rianta, CIE, BTE, Great Southern Hotels, An Post and RTE have all been turned round and are doing well.  Only one, B &amp; I, have not reacted to the same restructuring and, even more, the same efforts of the Minister and the Department.  Indeed, we went further with B &amp; I than with any of the other companies.  We want to exceptional lengths to bring in a top rate manager from outside at above Devlin rates. As the Minister has said, £38 million was committed to investment.  The ships were overhauled, restructured and made completely <Col N="1919" /> modern and attractive.  New companies were brought in to run the dutyfree shops but despite all these exceptional movements, this exceptional investment, restructuring of the board of management and new controls, B &amp; I's performance was never worse.</P>
    <P>The three year agreement with the unions is a ray of hope but poor industrial relations, at least in the sense of strikes, have never been a contributing factor to the company's perpetual problems.  I know what the Minister has said about the ridiculous strikes that have taken place in the past year or so, particularly by the officers.  The history of the B &amp; I has been one of continuous losses way above targets set by the company itself, but bad industrial relations resulting in strikes was never a problem.</P>
    <P>I have studied the question long and hard and I still do not understand where or what is the black hole of the B &amp; I.  It is a mystery to me that this company can suck in so many millions of pounds when all the other companies in the State sector and all the other ferry companies are making profits.</P>
    <P>I believe the passage of this Bill today is advisable and necessary but for the reasons I have stated, I think it only right that Dáil Éireann should seek a final, independent and professional analysis of every nook and cranny of this tormented company.  If we do not, the chances are that we will have yet another B &amp; I equity Bill before this year is out, and certainly as an annual feature of the legislative programme.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister takes on board my proposal.  I know the Oireachtas Committee on Semi-State Bodies have been examining the B &amp; I in the way that they examine other companies, but I have some prescience as to the sort of information that is being fed to the committee by management and unions blaming all the latest failures on air fares which is totally absurd, especially in the light of the reaction and performance of the private companies who have to deal with the competition just as they have and have remained profitable.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1920" /> I do not know if we should express the desire that this will be the last B &amp; I Bill of this kind before the House, because there is some major problem in the B &amp; I that we have not identified yet.  We have to seek some way of limiting the exposure to risk of the Exchequer in the future, laying more emphasis than the Minister did on the fact that the future of the B &amp; I will be dictated not from Dáil Éireann or the Department of Tourism and Transport but from within the B &amp; I itself.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that the Government alone cannot guarantee the future of the B &amp; I.  I would go much further and say that the Government cannot guarantee the future of the B &amp; I.  The only people who can guarantee its future are the B &amp; I people themselves.  In order to restrict the exposure to risk of the Exchequer I proposed &mdash; unfortunately it was not accepted by the Department of Finance at the time &mdash; that we would create an operating subsidiary to the B &amp; I which would own the assets and be responsible for that part of the debts which equalled the assets, so at last they would have a one to one geared balance sheet, and if they wanted more investment they would have to justify it in the gilt markets or in the equity markets just as Sealink, Irish Ferries and Belfast Ferries have to do; the Exchequer would then take on responsibility for the holding company's debts.  The exposure of the Exchequer would be limited and it would be absolutley clear and enshrined in legislation that if further funds were needed by the B &amp; I they would have to be found in the equity markets.  Unfortunately, that was not accepted.  To my astonishment £20 million was agreed as an initial investment in the B &amp; I, and tranches in subsequent years of £6 million each, giving a total of £38 million.  Even after that massive investment we have losses beyond the bounds of reasonable explanation.  Here again we have the Minister proposing yet another tranche of Exchequer subsidy, because that is what it is.  We call it equity but in fact it is subsidy, and we will continue to have B &amp; I Bills of this nature.  I predict that we will have another before the year is out <Col N="1921" /> because the B &amp; I will have run out of money.  We will have one every year unless we take some more decisive steps.</P>
    <P>It has become the custom in the western world in recent years for people to support the concept of privatisation as an ideology.  Likewise there is a group very strongly of the view that all privatisation is wrong and that State enterprise is right no matter what.  I do not belong to either of those camps.  I do believe there is a major continuing role for State enterprise. As I said many times when I was Minister, the biggest enemies of State enterprise are often those who are its strongest adherents, refusing to co-operate with obviously needed restructuring and new practices.  In 1982 there was a major crisis throughout the State sector. It has been said that there have been very significant changes in trade union attitudes and none better illustrated than in the case of the B &amp; I.  But there is still an ideological belief that certain things just have to be owned by the State and that to do anything else is somehow wrong or regressive or somehow antisocial. It is that sort of thinking that has consigned many of the our State enterprises to sure failure.  Any enterprise, private or public, needs to be able to acquire and dispose of assets depending on developments.  It often makes sense to realise gains from previous decisions, to dispose of assets that have gained in value and to provide much needed money for the company.  Much of this is still resisted by some on the ideological left but these are matched in every way by those on the ideological right who want to privatise no matter what.</P>
    <P>In the case of the B &amp; I there is a very strong case for saying that this should be the last tranche of free capital that this House is prepared to approve for this company.  There has to be a decisive new beginning.  I suggest that this be done by setting up an operating subsidiary that owns the assets and has the responsibility for a like amount of the debts, the Exchequer to take on responsibility for the rest of the debts to be remitted over a period of years.  That is the only way we have any hope of bringing certain <Col N="1922" /> realities home to the B &amp; I or of ensuring that they act competitively with the other companies on the Irish scene, namely, Sealink and Belfast Car Ferries, Brittany Ferries and Irish Ferries, all of whom are operating profitably notwithstanding the air fares and the sea fares revolution of which I am happy to have been the author.  I believe that the overall economic benefits of cheap access routes far outweigh any small drawbacks in the B &amp; I.  Even if we do not look at it from the broad economic point of view but from the State sector point of view, Aer Rianta are a booming company whose profits have been greatly enhanced by the increase in air travel.  Aer Lingus, in the transport sector, are a booming company even though they thought the liberalisation of air fares would be the end of the world.  Even in the limited State sector, the overall policy is correct and beneficial but in the wider economic area it is even more beneficial.</P>
    <P>When the Minister comes to reply I would like him to outline some of the things he did not outline in his opening speech.  What are the present projections for B &amp; I's performance this year?  What profit or loss does he expect them to make after this tranche investment?  What is the outlook for B &amp; I in terms of car and passenger numbers for this year?  What is the present position in relation to their freight performance for this year?  Perhaps the Minister could give us some sketch of how he sees the company developing in 1989 and 1990 not only in relation to the profit and loss account of B &amp; I but also their balance sheet.  What are his future plans for the company? Does he rule out another B &amp; I equity Bill this year?  Will he come to the Dáil with a B &amp; I restructuring Bill along the lines I have suggested?  The House deserves to know what the medium term outlook is for this company.  I hope the Minister will give us clear replies to the questions I have raised and the underlying assumptions which give rise to those projections.</P>
    <P>One of the consistent facts about the B &amp; I is that their projections are never realised.  That has been the case since <Col N="1923" /> 1965 when they were acquired by the State.  I think the officials in the Department of Communications, as a rule of thumbs multiply by two, add ten, and take their first thoughts away.  That is the way it is with B &amp; I.  I remember when we announced the four year investment package of £38 million and the bringing in of Mr. Alex Spain as Chairman and Chief Executive, B &amp; I sources leaked to the media how unfortunate this was as we were heading for a greatly improved loss of £3.9 million compared with £7.1 million last year.  They were buying this until I pointed to the history of the preceding five years of B &amp; I's projections and the actual outturn, and that year turned out no different.  The losses were not £3.9 million; they were several times that figure.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I would like to say that this Bill is a holding operation.  Clearly it is not the last we will hear of the B &amp; I this year and we may hear more about them in the next session.  Obviously, the Minister will not disclose his plans prematurely but he has a responsibility, in asking for these funds, to let us have some outline of the direction of his thoughts on how he will tackle and attempt to stop the haemorrhage of funds to plug the black hole which the B &amp; I represent and which I tried valiantly to plug but did not succeed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>In addressing in this Bill may I say I have an enormous feeling of <i>déjà vu.</i>  I have been in this House for 12 months.  The Minister and Deputy Mitchell have great knowledge about this matter.  Either as Ministers or in Opposition, the same things have been said by both of them for the past five, six or seven years.  The same problem is continually being identified by them.  The answer is still the same, that is, simply to put more money into B &amp; I.  This is showing up the losses and that is how it has been since this company were purchased.  Well in excess of £100 million has gone into this company.  In a country of this size with the limited resources we have, how can that be justified?  There are options. <Col N="1924" /> While Deputy Mitchell has alluded to them, he did not say exactly what he means.  It seems to be something to do with ideological views of privatisation on the one hand, which are incorrect, and ideological views of public holding companies on the other hand, which seem to be correct.</P>
      <P>I do not have any ideological hangups about B &amp; I.  There are tremendous opportunities out in the market for B &amp; I. There is no doubt that other companies &mdash; as a matter of fact all the other companies &mdash; operating on the Irish Sea both to the UK and to the Continent are making substantial profits&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Nonsense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and here we are with the B &amp; I who have failed on incredible levels over the years.  Not only are they making losses but they cannot hit their targeted losses.  Their projections are being doubled on a consistent basis.  If Deputy Mitchell is unable to find out where the black hole is I can tell him I am at a loss to see it but I will not stop at that and look to the past.  I want to look to the future.</P>
      <P>In looking over the debate on the British &amp; Irish Steam Packet Company Limited Bill, 1986, in 1986 I find it extraordinary that the Minister, Deputy Wilson, who was then in Opposition referring to ICL said and I quote from the Official Report, 11 June, 1986, Volume 367, columns 1763 and 1764:</P>
      <P>I know there are difficulties in regard to the sale of ICL and I outlined our party's policy in that regard.  We want ICL maintained in Irish hands, public, private or public cum private.  We are not particularly worried about the combination but this profit making company should be retained in Irish hands.</P>
      <P>All I can say is thank God that B &amp; I did not purchase and that this Government did not purchase that company at that point in time.  Had it been purchased we would be in a worse situation than we are now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1925" /> Irish Ferries, as they are known today, are making a profit in the market place. I suggest to the Minister that they could be a potential purchaser of the assets of B &amp; I.  It is obvious that the company laden with debts would not be attractive to anybody or even be feasible for consideration. I am not suggesting it.  One of the inherent problems we now have with B &amp; I is that, because of the huge financial constraints on the company, they are being forced to cut back in certain areas which I do not think are the correct decisions to make in marketing terms. They may be the only decisions that company can make because of the constraints of the financial situation, but that is not a healthy situation for the potential development of the Irish sea routes.</P>
    <P>Having regard to all the debates we have had on the potential for tourism it is wrong that we should be losing potential tourists from various areas within the UK because of cutbacks in the B &amp; I.  This cannot be sustained.  A sum of £11 million and upwards is going into that company purely to show up what has happened last year.  The Minister said:</P>
    <P>The bulk of the £11 million financing requirement for 1988 relates to payments of capital and interest on B &amp; I's existing bank loans and bank overdraft facilities.</P>
    <P>Basically we are showing up the situation. It is inevitable unfortunately &mdash; the PDs and I would like to see a completely different picture &mdash; that the Minister will be back in the House within the next 12 months with proposals for some other way of funding B &amp; I, more or less through the Exchequer.  I understand we cannot pull the plug tomorrow because of the forthcoming tourist season and all of the huge problems that would create but I had hoped the Minister would refer to some definitive course of action he could take over the next few months.  I have been present on both occasions when debates took place on B &amp; I in this House.  I will quote from the Official Report, Volume 373, column 3216, of June 1987.  The Minister said:</P>
    <P>I have told both the board and representatives <Col N="1926" /> of the B &amp; I unions, whom I also met recently, and I got a very good response from them, that if the company are to survive it will be necessary for the board, management and staff to face up to the need for drastic and radical change which will eliminate the company's losses.  I have directed the B &amp; I board to submit to me as soon as possible a plan of action for implementation in the autumn. Between now and then, the Government will be considering the position with a view to a long term policy decision.</P>
    <P>The Minister repeated all that in October when he was speaking on the Estimates with regard to B &amp; I and I will not bore the House by repeating it.</P>
    <P>Where is the plan?  Is the plan the Bill? Is this what we have been waiting for?  Is the simple answer that once again we stick another £10 million or £11 million into B &amp; I and let them carry on regardless. I was very conciliatory towards the Minister in those speeches of last year.  I encouraged him to do something to finish the matter but I cannot stand here today in all honesty and hold my hand over my heart and say I am satisfied with what has happened.  I do not think the Minister can be satisfied with what has occurred. It is obvious from his contribution that there is a huge level of frustration with B &amp; I.  It is obvious to me that he has tried to do something but it appears that it has all come to naught, for whatever reasons I do not know.  The frustration is obvious in that he has very little to say about the future of the company.  I find that a strange position.</P>
    <P>We, in this House, are capable of making a definitive decision with regard to the future of B &amp; I.  We can do that here today, if we so wish.  The Minister can bring plans forward today, if he so wishes.  It is obvious that B &amp; I are incapable, and they have gone out of their way to prove they are incapable, of making decisions.  I respect what the chairman of B &amp; I achieved over the past few months in times of crisis.  I respect what the workforce and unions did when <Col N="1927" /> they realised finally all the mistakes they had made and their outrageous carryon in years past.  Unfortunately, is it too little, too late?  If that agreement had really borne fruit I would have expected the Minister to come in to announce the next stage beyond the agreement and to tell us in the House today what exactly the company will face and where the Government stand in regard to the company.  I think that is a reasonable request.  I think it is something the Minister should want to do.  It is something we in Opposition expect from him.</P>
    <P>Cartel arrangements existed on the Irish Sea routes over a long period.  This again was referred to at length in 1986 by all Deputies, including Deputy O'Malley. B &amp; I suffered greatly under these arrangements.  I want to raise some points on this matter as it affects the future, and I do not wish to dwell on the past.  Sealink have a massive operating advantage on the Irish Sea because they have control of the ports in the UK.  I believe the Minister acknowledges this fact and would agree with me.  Until such time as we get our act together in the harbours in this country, we will never be in a position to compete fairly with Sealink on the Irish Sea.  Control of the harbours is one of the master strokes of Sealink operations.  Because they can dictate the times in the first instance that are suitable for them to use their own ports in the UK they get the prime sailing times from every single port.  B &amp; I have then to agree to the times that are left which are obviously outside the peak convenient times from a business, tourist or freight viewpoint.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and trains.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>The same thing applies to trains.  How are we proposing to compete with that?  This question must be taken in conjunction with the future we are to have in the operation of a profitable seagoing ferry company out of this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has already been identified that B &amp; I have the potential to be profitable. However, there are other things that the Government can do to ensure that companies <Col N="1928" /> such as Irish Ferries and a revamped B &amp; I have a real chance to compete on an equal footing.  It is ludicrous to say that we simply take one course of action and the rest follows.  That is not necessarily true.  It is interesting to note that when the 1986 Bill was before the House, Deputy Nealon &mdash; who was obviously standing in for Deputy J. Mitchell &mdash; said this was the last straw, this was the end of the road, that this could not happen again.  He said we have reached the end, we have got to shore everything up, we have to stop here.  It was made clear to B &amp; I that no more funding was going to be made available and that they would have to stand on their own two feet.  Yet, here we are two years later in the same situation, and the same happened in 1985, 1984, 1983 and 1982.  This obviously cannot simply go on.  We are losing out in the development of our tourism and in freight transport costs.</P>
    <P>I want to turn to the problem of freight transport costs out of this country.  It has been identified by Irish business that the huge cost of transport out of this country is a major problem and we at this stage are doing nothing about it.  I ask the Minister whether it would not be more imaginative for him to come into the House and at least say, for instance, that we are going to create a free port area in Rosslare, that we are going to give our transport operators on a commercial basis a cheaper rate of diesel so that we can start business up and running in a far more definitive and positive way.  Would money spent in that way not be of far more benefit in terms of job creation and in the creation of connections throughout Europe with the oncoming Single European Act and all that that whole area entails?</P>
    <P>Imagination is necessary in this whole regard.  There are options for the Minister. Deputy J. Mitchell has alluded in some way to these type of things without actually naming them.  However, I am saying what they are.  It is not an ideological thing but simply a matter of commonsense. Students at school are taught the importance of getting a balance sheet <Col N="1929" /> right but we behave in this House as though we cannot find an answer to the problem.  In the business world you would not get away with that, and quite rightly so.  Politicians should not be allowed to get away with it either.  We are failing in our responsibility if our response to the people is that we do not know the answers, or that we are in some way unable to find them.  If that is what the Government and certain people in Opposition come up with they should not be here because that is not the answer.  The answer is in the whole spectrum of what we can do in regard to B &amp; I.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a very profound answer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to know from the Minister if there has been any contact with private interests.  I agree with Deputy Mitchell in this regard.  It is vitally important &mdash; I have stated this before &mdash; that we have an Irish-owned ferry company operating out of this country.  I would not like to see a company from abroad being responsible for the operation of ferries in this country because strikes could totally strangle our whole access to markets, as happened some time ago with the agricultural industry when goods which we had to send to the Continent urgently were destroyed.  Has the Minister or his Department been approached by any private interest or have the Department gone into the marketplace and put out feelers for bodies with an interest in the assets of B &amp; I?  Has the Minister requested that any private interest might take over B &amp; I?  These things should be considered, rather than somebody shouting ideological viewpoints at the Minister.  They do not worry me and I am sure they have never worried the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been mentioned earlier that the competition in air fares and the steep reduction in the cost of air transport in this country is somehow responsible for all the ills of B &amp; I.  I do not accept that, I am sure the Minister does not accept it and anybody in this House would be very foolish to accept it.  There are certain <Col N="1930" /> factors with regard to low air fares that should be considered.  It is right to say that because of the advent of lower air fares the trade and marketing perspective of B &amp; I would naturally have to change but that has not happened.  B &amp; I did not react in time to what was happening on the air routes.  Because of their failure to react, they are now saying in a very simplistic way that air fares came down and we lost our passengers.  If every business in the country was run on that basis they would all be out of business.</P>
    <P>There are many factors involved in the whole B &amp; I spectrum.  Has the Minister received any definitive plans from B &amp; I as to how they can get into the added value tourist market?  There is a much bigger spin-off from the type of tourist who comes here with his car and his family than there is from the person who comes in on a plane, stays in one place and goes away again.  The market in the UK is huge.  The potential for us on the sea routes has not been tapped.  We need to garner the potential in that area.  B &amp; I should address themselves to a marketing concept.  They should not just take a ship from point A in the UK to point B in Ireland and think that is the end of their role.  That is only the instrument whereby they bring about the final end of their business.  They are involved with people, as is anybody involved in transport or tourism, and at the end of the day it is they who pay the piper.</P>
    <P>The options available to B &amp; I are vast.  I am disappointed that there has not been some formalisation from B &amp; I in this regard &mdash; otherwise, I am sure, the Minister would have adverted to it &mdash; as to how for the coming season they will tackle this situation.  I suspect that the Minister's reply may be that the task force which he has set up will take care of this whole area.  That, on its own, is not the answer.  This is part of an overall strategy that must be co-ordinated between the ferry company on the one hand and how the tourism aspects are promoted on the other hand.  I would like the Minister to say if any discussion has taken place on this whole area which is of great importance to us in the summer <Col N="1931" /> months.  We are now well into March and bookings are taking place at an enormous rate.  I suspect that we have lost out on many bookings to the Continent and it is very sad if that proves to be the case.</P>
    <P>I have referred to the tourists coming here in cars, to the added value that we offer and the opportunities open to B &amp; I in that regard.  We have many amenities here.  We do not have to spend vast sums of money, as other countries do, to create false amenities, as it were, or man-made facilities.  We have all the facilities that many people on the Continent and in the UK are only too willing to come to this country for, but that is not happening because for a number of reasons these things are totally unco-ordinated.</P>
    <P>There is potential for development of continental routes out of this country.  If B &amp; I were in a marketing position they could open up routes in that direction. The vast bulk of people taking holidays on the Continent do not stay in three star, four star or five star hotels; they use the camping facilities throughout the Continent and they travel by car.  There is a fly-drive element but many people drive their cars great distances.  I know, from going to Denmark regularly where my wife comes from, that a great number of tourists drive to that part of the Continent. There is not an exceptionally hot climate there but people drive long distances on holidays and the added value that brings into the country is tremendous.</P>
    <P>Recently the Minister stated that Germany is the largest single tourism market in the world but we have only 1 per cent of that market.  There is no reason why we should not be planning down the road. One matter that will affect us in the future is the channel tunnel and the potential it will hold for us on the Irish Sea.  We will not be in a position to build a chunnel for the foreseeable future but there will be a huge increase in volume of potential tourists from the Continent through the UK.  It is not unreasonable to ask what plans B &amp; I have in that regard.  The potential is there for that company and I see no reason they cannot make a <Col N="1932" /> profit.  They have been utterly spoiled over the years and lethargy has destroyed the whole ethos.  As I have said earlier, efforts have been made to counteract that and I respect those efforts but I want to see what the follow-on will be.</P>
    <P>The other factor that will affect us in the next few years is the change in the market in 1992.  Ninety per cent of goods transported out of this country go by sea and in this regard there will be a great need for an efficient, well operated company. B &amp; I do not have to concentrate solely on the tourist market.  That is a very important area with great potential, but how we ship freight in and out of this country is an extremely pressing question which I believe comes within the realm of what the B &amp; I will do in the future.</P>
    <P>If this Government at interdepartmental level are discussing areas I believe they should be discussing, this should be done in conjunction with other issues and not in isolation.  My great fear about this Bill is that, unfortunately, it will go through on the nod at 7 o'clock and will then fade away, and the B &amp; I problems will also fade away until once again we are faced with another crisis.  It is fundamentally wrong to think we can deal with the problems of this company in isolation.  The Minister is to be commended for the way he has tackled air transport, but can we not apply the same dynamic approach to the operation of our ferries which have great potential?</P>
    <P>By getting this Bill through the House this evening we will be once again putting money into the coffers of the B &amp; I.  I hope the Minister will answer the points I raised as well as those raised by Deputy Mitchell.  We in the Progressive Democrats cannot support this Bill.  We do not want a repeat of what has happened time and again.  If something definitive was being done and if we could see this as the final measure, things might be different. I can see the frustration this is causing the Minister and Deputy Mitchell because they are repeating what has been said many times.  They are very disappointed having to do this, and I do not blame them.  As I said, their frustration is obvious.  Obviously Deputy Deasy did <Col N="1933" /> not want to contribute to this debate and go through the same old rigmarole.  As a colleague from Waterford, for whom I have a lot of regard, I do not blame him. It is only right that one party in this House will say enough is enough, not just for ideological reasons but for reasons which are important to the future development of this country.  We must call a stop because there are other options which must be taken.</P>
    <P>In his speech today the Minister said, &ldquo;The future of B &amp; I cannot be assured by Government support alone.&rdquo;  This was said also in 1986 and 1987.  I will await with interest to hear what the Minister says when concluding this debate.  Maybe he has come here simply to whet our appetites and has something of great interest to reveal later this evening.  I sincerely hope so and I will welcome it. If he makes a concrete suggestion I will review my position but what I have heard here today is not satisfactory.  Things have gone too far and we are prepared to call a halt.  Nobody has had the courage to do that up to now but I am not prepared to come back into this House and repeat on another occasion what I have said today.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>The Labour Party will support this Bill but we want to comment on the problems of this company.  We have seen the traumas experienced by the B &amp; I for many years and the comparisons made between this company and others operating in the same area.  We know of the efforts which have been made by the Government and management and staff in recent times to get this company on a firm footing.  Everybody in the country wants to see that happen.  Everybody wants to see the B &amp; I operate profitably and successfully.  We would all like to see the final trading figures in the black.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should look at the history of this company and query the black hole which has already been mentioned.  The previous Minister with responsibility for this company inquired where all those tens of millions of pounds went.  The Joint Committee on Commercial State-Sponsored Bodies are looking very closely at <Col N="1934" /> the history and problems of this company and are producing a report.  As a matter of fact there are two of us in this House who should be in Setanta House where this company are being discussed and a report being prepared for discussion in the Dáil at a later date.  It is important that this Bill was introduced today because I believe the decisions that have been taken, and that will be taken later tonight, will give the B &amp; I a breathing space to get their act together and to meet some of their problems and, hopefully, overcome them.</P>
    <P>It is important to put in context why this company seem to have had problems over the years.  When the board of the company set out the corporate objectives in 1965, I am sure they met with the general approval of the House.  The objectives were to provide and develop a modern, efficient, profitable, national and comprehensive surface transport system to and from Ireland.  When the Joint Committee on Commercial State-Sponsored Bodies looked at that company in 1978 &mdash; and various committees have looked at that company over the years &mdash; they felt the B &amp; I included broader obligations in their corporate aims.  On page 17 of the report produced in 1979 they said:</P>
    <P>The B &amp; I sees itself performing a primarily commercial role; to that extent it retains a strong market orientation and a desire for financial targets. However, it would appear to the Joint Committee that it includes in its corporate aims obligations of a broader nature.  This view was confirmed during the taking of evidence, when a B &amp; I representative stated that the Company had an overriding social obligation to the community and that concrete evidence of that is the money expended in the building of new ships at Verolme, so as to keep the business at home in Ireland.  To the extent that the Company has to incur significant expenditures in meeting social and national obligations, because the Government requires it to do so.  The Joint Committee recommends that <Col N="1935" /> such costs should be clearly identified and an indication given of the extent to which they affect the commercial success of the Company.</P>
    <P>The latter part of that recommendation was never carried out in the production of accounts and the showing of the cost to this company down the years of carrying out social and community obligations on behalf of this country at the direction of Government.  This was a commercial company whose original aim was to be efficient and profitable and to operate a national, comprehensive transport system.  However, that is probably where its problems began.  The <i>Connacht</i> was built in Verolme Dockyard in 1978 at a cost of £16 million and was designed for the Cork-Swansea route in addition to a summer service to the Continent. Because it would be necessary to compete with other companies permission was refused at that time for that summer service.  I mention that by way of an example of how losses occurred at that time.  The <i>Leinster</i> was built in Verolme Dockyard in 1980 at a cost of £24 million. It was exactly the same type of vessel as the <i>Connacht</i> but, built two years later, the cost had risen by £8 million.  I might add that, on that occasion, the B &amp; I did not require that vessel at all but &mdash; for what would appear to have been electoral reasons &mdash; were told it was being built anyway.  It will be seen, therefore, that losses were incurred on account of interference by Members of this House, in particular members of the Government at that time, leading to some of the problems encountered by the company in those early days.  There was also an instruction issued to the company for the retention of the Cork-Pembroke service, again for political reasons, its cost having to be borne by the company.</P>
    <P>There were various other decisions taken over the years, one when I was a Member of the previous Government, in relation to the imposition of a travel tax to be imposed on everybody travelling out of the country whether by sea or air.  Certainly that has had a detrimental <Col N="1936" /> effect on sea travel.  Take the case of a child travelling to London with the B &amp; I line on a fare costing £6, the imposition of that travel tax of £5 almost doubled that fare.  An adult travelling on a fare costing £11 had the same £5 imposed whereas the budget air fare to London would be approximately £91 and would attract the same £5 travel tax.  Let us suppose that one decided to travel to New York on a first class air fare, which would cost in the region of £1,200, that fare would still attract only the £5 travel tax. It will be seen that the imposition of that travel tax acted as a disincentive to the fare structures within the B &amp; I.  Perhaps the Minister would reconsider the effectiveness of that travel tax which would appear to have been imposed in a budgetary fashion rather than by way of ensuring equity in travel fares as between air and sea.</P>
    <P>The company had to accept decisions taken and encounter problems not of their making, which cost them dearly over the years and placed them in a very difficult position.  It is my belief that certain management decisions added to the problems of the company.  For example a Jetfoil was bought some years ago which was found to be totally unsuitable for the open sea.  It was the type of vessel more suited to service in the Mediterranean where they do not encounter the same storms and difficult waters between here and, say, Liverpool and other English ports.  That Jetfoil remained in Arklow for several years before being sold at a loss of almost £3 million.  Surely somebody with naval knowledge or experience within the company would have known it to have been a vessel totally unsuitable for use between, say, Holyhead and Dún Laoghaire or Liverpool and Dublin.</P>
    <P>The types of decisions taken over the years have had repercussions more on the workforce of the company than on management and the workforce have had to take the brunt of decisions to restructure the company.  If one looks at the employment position within the company one finds that the workforce has been reduced from almost 1,900 in 1985 to approximately 700 or 800 as a result of <Col N="1937" /> the latest agreement reached between the Government, the company and the workforce. In fact in 1985 there were 1,829 people working in the company.  In 1986, under a deal done by the previous Minister, that workforce was reduced to 1,464.  The latest agreement will see a further loss in the workforce of 585, so it will be clearly seen that the greatest losers in all of this have been the workforce at all levels.</P>
    <P>If, as has been suggested, some other independent, commercial company were to take over from the B &amp; I Line and all of their operations were to close that would not mean the end of Government commitments to the company over the years.  There have been debts accumulated over the years which will continue to have to be repaid and which will amount to quite a large sum this year. When the current year's accounts are prepared, taking into account the latest agreement reached, undoubtedly they will show a loss on account of heavy interest charges accruing on outstanding liabilities.</P>
    <P>The Minister, unions and management have come to an arrangement in an endeavour to render the company a slimmer, more active, acceptable one to the general public, one that will be able to fulfil its original mandate.  We do not foresee the company becoming profitable because of the heavy interest charges outstanding and which the Minister admitted himself.  However, he did not say how long these commitments will continue or what will be the likely outcome on the profit and loss account in future years. One can only hope that their future activities will result in their making a profit, when it will be possible to ascertain how the company are performing under the new arrangement.</P>
    <P>The last accounts we have are in respect of the year 1985.  In the course of his remarks the Minister indicated that the accounts for 1986 are available to him but not to the general public.  The 1985 accounts include extraordinary items to the extent of about £51 million.  These extraordinary items deal with the writeoff <Col N="1938" /> of various ships, previous arrangements for redundancy packages, for reductions in staff and the general way depreciation is handled in the accounts. These have absolutely nothing to do with how the company were run by their staff and the people involved in the day to day running of the operations out of Dublin and Dún Laoghaire.  These arrangements were made because of decisions made, not with the staff and the ordinary management, but between Governments and the board of directors.  Because of that, I suggest to the Minister, this company have received a great deal of criticism which perhaps they do not deserve.  The criticism should be laid at the door of anybody who was in Government when the various decisions were made, and I think that refers to many Governments since 1965.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister made an attempt to avert the very serious situation which occurred last year.  The rescue package which has been agreed between the unions, management and Government will give a breathing space to the company. It is only a breathing space because, unless proper decisions are made in the future, unless we can ensure that the company are given reasonable treatment on the other side of the Irish sea, say in Holyhead, and unless the conditions for the company are improved over what they are at present as against those arrangements which the Sealink company now have, the company will operate at a disadvantage.</P>
    <P>I looked at the jetty arrangements in Holyhead in late 1986, and I can only say to the Minister that the ramps provided there for the B &amp; I boats were something similar to cattle ramps.  I hope things have improved in the meantime because fair treatment was not being meted out to the B &amp; I by the organisation in Holyhead. Promises were made to me on that occasion that improvements would be made.  I hope they have been carried out and that pressure is being brought to bear on the people running the port in Holyhead, which I believe is owned by the Sealink company.  I hope the arrangements <Col N="1939" /> will give an even break to the B &amp; I in operating out of that port which I believe will be the most important one for them during the coming years.</P>
    <P>This company can be profitable and do business.  Efficiency can be brought back into the company which will put them on a sound footing for the future.  As a result of what has been achieved by the workforce and what has been agreed to both now and in the past, profit can be made but it will be eaten into by the very heavy responsibilities which were entered into prior to 1986-87.  More business can be brought to the company through the arrangements that have been suggested. There is a great need for the continuance of this company in public ownership. They have to carry out a responsibility on behalf of this country.  They cannot be just closed down and handed over to the vagaries of some other operation, or let go to somebody else.  They came very close to that last October or December but I am glad it did not happen.</P>
    <P>Because of the complexity of the problems of this shipping line, there is obviously no simple solution to these problems.  Job cutting and cost cutting are not simply the solution.  The company require a far deeper and more intensive re-organisation than simply coming to an agreement with the unions and organising a reduction in the numbers operating the company.  Their marketing must be improved and there must be increased efficiency, flexibility and innovation in the company.  This must be brought about by a more enlightened management.  I believe the B &amp; I staff can be relied on to contribute to all these essential areas in the future.</P>
    <P>The Minister has given a breathing space to the company and he and the Government are to be thanked for that. He will have our support for this Bill. Whether in a joint committee or in this House, this party will continue to keep a close watch on the progress of this company in the years ahead.  We believe they are an essential part of surface transport <Col N="1940" /> for this country and we know the arrangements that have been made and the contributions of all concerned will lead to the essential changes which are necessary for the existence and improvement of the company in the years ahead.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I intend to be very brief in response to the Minister's Second Stage speech on this Bill.  When one looks at the Bill, its purpose and intent, one wonders at the earlier furore in the House with regard to the period of time being made available for a discussion on the Bill.  It is very simple and straightforward in its intent.  Its purpose was mapped out for us, not just on the publication of the Bill, but by previous Governments and by the past history of this company which we seem anxious to avoid in considering the status of the B &amp; I shipping line.  We are simply agreeing to a necessary and inevitable contribution to the continued future of the B &amp; I line.</P>
      <P>It is also significant that there is not one amendment coming from any of the benches which were so vocal in signalling the shortage of time available.  Having listened to the contribution from the Progressive Democrats speaker, Deputy Cullen, and to the succinct single point he made, I wonder how much more time that party would have put to good use in any debate on the Bill and its intent.  As I said it is succinct and to the point, has a single purpose and for that reason The Workers' Party indicate their support for the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The history of the B &amp; I has been referred to in passing.  I believe that one of the significant facts of its history has not yet been mentioned, that is, that it grew out of the failure of the private sector in the area of shipping.  The B &amp; I came into being in 1965 because the company who previously owned the shipping line were in a disastrous financial situation. The Government of the day took a decision based on reasons of economy, strategy and prudence, which apply equally today with regard to the existence and continuation of the company.  The company, once established, had major disadvantages attaching to them from <Col N="1941" /> their previous pre-State ownership, from which, in effect, they have never significantly been allowed to recover.  They had problems of interest payments on huge borrowings to capitalise their development.</P>
    <P>In the earlier years their was no other way in which they could have obtained their revenue, irrespective of profitability or otherwise.  They could never have matched the necessity for capital investment needed to build their fleet and develop their services.  How, may I ask the great advisers on better business management who have contributed to this debate so far, could the money have been raised and the company developed other than through borrowings which have involved the company since then &mdash; as is the unfortunate legacy of almost all State and semi-State companies &mdash; in massive interest payments on their capital borrowings?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>These are facts in the history of the company that contributors to this debate simply want to set aside. They want to lecture the company and the Minister on how better to run their jobs, ignoring very fundamental economic facts.  The depreciation of the fleet over the years, coupled with the instances indicated by Deputy Kavanagh, constitute a very major problem with regard to the control and development of the B &amp; I.  It is much more interesting to ask how decisions were taken, if we are to take Deputy Kavanagh's word for it, and I have no reason to doubt that, on the imposition on the company of stock that was not particularly suitable or with regard to services that the company should supply which were particularly desirable, economically or otherwise. How were those decisions arrived at? What great brain either within the Government at political level, or within management level in the company, agreed to the type of arrangement indicated with regard to the MVs <i>Connacht</i> and <i>Leinster</i> and the Jetfoil?  How was the decision taken with regard to the <Col N="1942" /> maintenance of the Cork-Swansea route? These are matters that we could spend a little more time analysing and understanding, so that that type of decision will not be taken in the future.  It is all very well in a debate like this to say let us forget the past, as Deputy Cullen has said.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is not saying that and I shall explain why I do not believe that the PDs or Fine Gael are saying that.  They talk about the need for a more streamlined, more efficient arrangement.  Deputy Cullen suggested that Irish Ferries could do it for us.  That is not what I am talking about here.  I am talking about an unambiguous commitment <Col N="1943" /> to the B &amp; I shipping company from all parties in this House.  It is incredible to hear people in here saying that the B &amp; I should be getting on with the job out there, forward looking, competing against the odds, out on the open seas, developing and doing all the things that we want them to do but we in here spend our time tearing lumps out of the company, deriding them from top to bottom&mdash;&mdash;</P>

All talks of aspirations, in my respectful submission, will not put the B &amp; I right until we understand the existing structures between Government and the company and within the management of that company which led to series of disasters that was outlined and itemised for us here by Deputy Kavanagh.  Unless we tackle that political perspective, all the other rhetoric we have heard will not achieve one iota of improvement.</P>
      <P>The question of ideology has been mentioned again by the Fine Gael and PD contributors.  There is a suggestion here that the spectre, or shadow, of ideology is raised only when it has to do with protection of the B &amp; I company or of the State sector, that that ideology is the sole preserve and concern of the left.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>The history of this country has shown that private interests in shipping have been unable to sustain a viable shipping line necessary to service <Col N="1945" /> our needs.  It is our belief that they would not have the necessary commitment to sustain a viable service.  It must be said that they would be motivated by maximisation of profits and not concerned with national interests.  We cannot get away from that and those who argue in favour of a private exclusive company supplanting the B &amp; I are not arguing in the better interests of our economy or of our shipping interests.</P>
      <P>The B &amp; I, with all their problems, have taken their future seriously.  In the face of an eleventh hour ultimatum from the Government they have, thankfully, made decisions, with the full co-operation of the workforce, that will ensure that they can continue to operate.  The scale of the concessions made by the workforce must be acknowledged by the House as a major contribution to the viability of the company.  The Minister gave us details of the reduction in staff numbers, almost 600, and that was an unprecedented concession.  The fact that the workforce have guaranteed industrial peace in the company to the end of 1990 will enable both management and workers to work towards the viability of the company.  The workers made an unprecedented concession on pay, not just allowing for a pay freeze but agreeing to a reduction in wages.  That is an indication of the goodwill of the workers and it must be matched by a commitment from all sides of the House to the future of the company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is incredible to hear talk of pulling the rug from under the B &amp; I after the workforce have made such heroic sacrifices. I regret that Deputy Deasy is not present to repeat the inevitable message of privatisation from the ranks of Fine Gael.  I waited for the inevitable demand from Deputy Cullen of the Progressive Democrats to close down the B &amp; I, in line with his demands that we should close down our State transport company, CIE.  I was surprised he did not demand that we should hand over the B &amp; I to the private sector.  However, it is my belief that the sacrifice of the workforce has made it impossible for the Progressive <Col N="1946" /> Democrats to argue for the privatisation of the company.  We must respond to that sacrifice.  We must tell the workers that we are prepared to give something in return for their efforts to preserve the company and make it viable.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cullen in referring to Irish Ferries did not put up a strong argument for the privatisation of the B &amp; I.  That company has been trading for less than a year and it was ridiculous to use them as an argument for the privatisation of the B &amp; I.  Such a suggestion is a non-runner and I was pleased to hear the Minister reject it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">

The privatisation of the B &amp; I would not succeed and I do not believe such a move would be supported by a majority of Members.

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>Most Members recognise that the B &amp; I have little room to manoeuvre as a shipping line between this country and our nearest neighbour. We have given a very limited brief to them.  There are a limited number of ports available for the line and only a specific number of crossings can be made on the Irish Sea.  We must bear those points in mind when considering the company <Col N="1947" /> and their future development.  We must ask ourselves if the company have the scope to diversify, like other State companies have done to their profit.</P>
      <P>Bearing in mind that the company bring a big number of tourists to Ireland we should ask ourselves if the company are entitled to a subsidy from our tourist industry.  There is no doubt that the line carries a big number of tourists annually. The trip from Holyhead to Dublin is a small vital part of the holiday of British visitors.  In my view the B &amp; I have been left in too small a corner of this market. It is important that we consider whether we should pay a subsidy to the company in recognition of the outstanding contribution of passengers using that line to our tourist industry.</P>
      <P>Another point of significance is that the B &amp; I must compete with a company who maintain absolute control over the ports they utilise.  I am referring to Sealink and that company's involvement in the ports on the other side of the Irish Sea, in particular Holyhead.  The British Government set their company up very well to compete on the Irish Sea and I wonder if the Minister would consider doing something on this side of the water to help the B &amp; I achieve equal or comparable status in the ports they use in this country.  The B &amp; I do not have any substantial control over the port or port facilities in Dublin, Dún Laoghaire, Rosslare or Cork.  It does not have available the same facilities as Sealink.  This position can be looked at in an attempt to help the company in the very competitive war between the shipping lines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the issue of deregulation.  While none of us complains about the advent of deregulation in relation to airline pricing, we must recognise that it has had and will continue to have a fairly significant impact on the numbers travelling by ferry.  I estimate a drop of approximately 20 per cent in the numbers availing of ferry services by reason alone of the fairly substantial reduction in prices offered by the airlines <Col N="1948" /> and the increase in their services.  This matter must be considered.</P>
    <P>B &amp; I provide a crucial service to the economy.  We must maintain control over shipping available to this economy as a matter of strategy should emergencies occur.  During the Falklands crisis the British Government pressed into service huge elements of their merchant shipping fleet, as well as passenger liners.  We must realise how vulnerable we could be if we did not have a residual fleet to rely upon.</P>
    <P>In a reply to me today by the Minister for the Marine the very small nature of our cargo fleet was highlighted.  The Minister indicated that serious efforts are being undertaken by the Government to increase our minuscule merchant fleet. He said it is possible that in the event of an emergency Irish tonnage would fall short of minimum requirements.  We do not have the capacity within our own fleet to meet everyday requirements should an emergency draw away other facilities. This highlights the importance of a fishing shipping fleet.  We live on an island and we are very isolated from the Continent if we do not have control of ships.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that the interests of Irish shipping were well served by the appointment of Mr. Spain to the management of B &amp; I.  While we expected a streamlining we could never have anticipated the emasculation of the company by Mr. Spain and his management team.</P>

      <P>Dare we mention his name?  The ground work that was being held was, until the intervention of this Government, leading very quickly to the ultimate demise of B &amp; I.  Interests were waiting in the wings, very close to the private interests brought in to manage B &amp; I, to take up the pieces that would be left.  Very important lessons must be learned from this experience.  I hope the Government in indicating a commitment to the continuation of B &amp; I will not repeat that mistake and will leave B &amp; I unfettered by the narrow political decisions which have proved disastrous in the past.  The company must be allowed to develop with the goodwill of the workforce. They must be allowed to maintain their important strategic contribution to our economy.</P>

      <P>Deputy McCartan began by saying he would be brief but went on to give a lengthy submission.  I intend to be reasonably brief.  Like Deputy Kavanagh, I have been a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies and, part of our brief, we examined the B &amp; I line.  It would have been of benefit to those who contributed to this debate to have been <Col N="1950" /> party to those meetings and to have heard the submissions from the management and unions.  We were given a broad perspective on the past and the future of B &amp; I.</P>
      <P>I find myself in the middle, between the extreme Left and their idea of the extreme Right.  In relation to Irish Life I came out quite strongly in favour of privatisation but I am not sure it is feasible in relation to B &amp; I.  Given its past history and present problems, I am not sure many entrepreneurs would want to become involved.  The auditors report in the 1985 annual report and accounts for the B &amp; I states:</P>
      <P>The Balance Sheet on page 13 shows an excess of liabilities over assets and, in our opinion, on that basis there did exist at 31st December, 1985, within the meaning of the Companies (Amendment) Act, 1983, a financial situation which under Section 40 (1) of that Act may require the convening of an Extraordinary General Meeting of the Company.</P>
      <P>The opinion of the auditors was that the company were insolvent.  The reason reports have not been made available during recent years is that the company are insolvent.  The State has continually invested in the company and there have been continual losses.  At one of the meetings of the joint committee in 1986 someone said that if this was a private company it would have gone out of business long ago but the fact of the matter is that this is a State company and, as Deputy Kavanagh has said, there is a social element involved.</P>

      <P>Having said that I think that all of our State bodies should be run on an economic basis.  One of the things which came across very clearly to the joint committee was that a proper monitoring procedure was not adopted in relation to this.  Perhaps various Departments did monitor it but the fact is that reports were not made available to both <Col N="1951" /> Houses of the Oireachtas or to the general public.  One of the recommendations and aspirations of the joint committee was that reports of State bodies should be made available more frequently in the future so that the general public will have an idea how a particular company is getting on at a particular time.</P>
      <P>We could blame the management for what would appear on the face of it to be disastrous decisions.  For example, a jetfoil was purchased which obviously was unsuitable for the Irish Sea.  Someone must accept responsibility for that.  We could also blame the Government for various decisions which they made.  Some Deputies referred to the fact that boats were built at Verolme where the State had an involvement.  In my view it was of much greater benefit to the State to have them built at Verolme than elsewhere even though it may not have had a great effect on the accounts of the B &amp; I. There was also a strike in late 1986 and early 1987 and, as a result, the company lost £5 million net.  These are all things which have helped to leave B &amp; I in this situation and there are storm clouds ahead despite the fact the Government are bringing forward this Bill.</P>
      <P>There are a number of points which I made at the meetings of the joint committee which I would also like to make here.  One of these was that lower fares have been introduced.  We are all in favour of these but we have to proceed with caution in the future as we are now getting to the stage where it will be a free for all and enterprises such as the B &amp; I will only suffer as a result.  The committee also questioned how the Department&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is not.  I congratulate the Minister on adopting the attitude which he has adopted since taking office. He laid it on the line to the company that they would have to get their act together and come forward with a plan.  At a stage when it was generally accepted that the company were going to the wall, the Minister had the courage to stand up and say that if they did not bring forward a plan on an agreed basis on a particular day, he would not provide further finance for the company and the company came forward with an agreed five year plan which I think can lead the way to a better B &amp; I service in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Kavanagh referred to travel tax.  Obviously, that is a matter which the Minister should look at to see if he has any leeway to ameliorate the plight of B &amp; I <i>vis-à-vis</i> the airlines.  Is it fair that someone going on these routes should pay £5 while those going on transatlantic routes should also pay £5?  UK berthing facilities are such that they place the B &amp; I at a disadvantage and the Government will have to do something about this matter.  We provide a better service on this side of the Irish Sea and we should receive a similar service on the far side because obviously we are losing business <Col N="1953" /> as a result of the poor facilities provided in the UK.</P>
    <P>Anyone who attended the meetings of the joint committee would have recognised the bona fides of both the management and the union and I must say I was very impressed by the representatives of the union who, as Deputy McCartan said, have taken a pay cut of 5 per cent and have accepted a reduction in the workforce of nearly 600.  This is unprecedented.  They want to help in making the company viable and are willing to do so in conjunction with the management. I agreed with what is being done here today and I congratulate the Minister on bringing this Bill forward. I agree with what a number of other speakers said: other areas should be pinpointed where B &amp; I could get into rather than just the passenger area which obviously is a dying trade.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to speak in support of the points made by Deputy Cullen earlier this afternoon on this matter.  It is time that as legislators in this House, particularly at a time when we are trying to get the public finances in order, we questioned the moneys which are voted by this House to various State projects and in particular to State companies. I do not think it is good enough that we should continue to put good money after bad into companies such as B &amp; I.  Today, once again, we are apparently going to vote another £11 million to this company.  I do not see any sense in this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the years 1965 to 1985 at present money values the B &amp; I received £190 million in subsidies from the State. Apparently we could have bought Sealink for one-third of the cost of the subsidies we have ploughed into the B &amp; I. Does it make any sense that we should continue to do this and nod it through this House almost without question?  Deputy Cullen was right to ask for a debate on this matter and not simply to let all Stages of this Bill go through in a matter of three hours.  Eleven million pounds may not seem an awful lot of money in the context <Col N="1954" /> of what this company have already received but, until we turn our affairs around in this country and until we begin to dispose of certain State assets and liabilities such as this one, we will not be able to keep pace with the rest of the world which is daily passing us out.  The Progressive Democrats make no secret of the fact that we fully support the idea of this country engaging in a programme of privatisation which includes not just the selling off of State assets but the selling off of various State services which could be much better run by private individuals coming together.</P>
    <P>There is a paranoia in this country about the State getting involved in all kinds of activities.  When Deputy Mitchell was in power there was an effort to take over Bewleys.  I do not know why we were getting involved in restaurants. As an economist friend of mine said, we would probably have An Bord Bun to run that same institution.  We must realise that it does not make sense for this small country to get involved continually in State activities which could be better run, from the taxpayers point of view, by other groups.  I have no doubt that some private individuals would be more than capable of providing this service if allowed to do so.</P>
    <P>Obviously, nobody would be prepared to take over this company in their present form.  We have to take off our ideological blinkers and realise that every time a matter comes before this House about allocating public moneys, sometimes under the pretext, as this is, of additional share capital, writing off massive debts, we will have to question it and to say &ldquo;no.&rdquo;  The Progressive Democrats are putting this Government on notice that we will not allow matters of this kind to go through the House unnoticed as they have gone through the House for so long. As a party we are fully committed to examining each aspect of State activity, including the area of transport, to see whether or not the job could be done better by allowing private individuals into the market-place.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>We must adopt the same principles in relation to sea transport.  It does not make <Col N="1956" /> sense for this country to exist in a protectionist atmosphere, as if the rest of the world will fall in with our plans.  Even in the USSR the state is beginning to roll back its influence, because people realise that modern market forces cannot be allowed to pass them by.</P>
    <P>I listened on my monitor to what Deputy McCartan said about these matters. If we were to follow the advice given by people like Deputy McCartan, we are supposed to make decisions about B &amp; I and every other State company not on the basis of commercial sense but on the basis of political sense.  That is what has been so wrong with decisions in relation to major State bodies or semi-State bodies.  The decisions have been made not on the basis of commercial sense but on the basis of what the political forces of the day dictate.  Those are the forces which lead this country and this House to vote millions of pounds to CIE, to B &amp; I, or whatever.</P>
    <P>We must realise that the taxpayer will not be able to continue to take on board the kind of losses and economic disaster which have been so much part and parcel of the way these companies have been run.  We have to make decisions on the basis of the commercial criteria that would apply if those companies were operating in the private sector.  We cannot allow anything else to dictate decisions.</P>
    <P>For every £1 billion reduction we can make in the national debt, we will save about £100 million per year on the basis of the present interest rates of about 10 per cent.  Given that 90 per cent of income tax alone goes to service the national debt, would it not make far more sense if we were to dispose of major State companies and reduce the debt and, in return, reduce the amount of money taken in income tax from the hard pressed workers?  The point made by Deputy Cullen this evening and by Deputy McDowell last week calling for a White Paper to be produced by the Government was valid.  A group other than public servants should compile this White Paper as it must be objective.</P>
    <P>We brought in economists from outside <Col N="1957" /> the State when we were looking for advice about cuts.  These same people should be asked to examine every area of State activity and to question whether or not it is still necessary for the State to involve itself in so many activities, or whether it would be better to dispose of some assets and some of the current services provided by the State and allow them to be run by private individuals.  We must do that if this country is to prosper and to be able to compete, and in order to reduce the high levels of unemployment.</P>
    <P>A recent study carried out here indicated that in relation to telecommunications, for example, we were 60 per cent dearer than the average price in other European countries.  We were 23 per cent dearer in relation to electricity and something like 50 per cent dearer in relation to postal services.  Irish companies cannot be expected to compete with EC countries if they have to face such enormous costs because of the high price of many of the services currently being provided by the State.  It is well known that many of the prices are so high because there is an over-abundance of manpower in these firms which would not be tolerated if they had to operate in a competitive world.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that there are 1,200 more people than necessary working in the ESB.  Who is paying the price of that?  Those 1,200 jobs night be protected in the ESB because this House has never really questioned the way we apply ourselves to doing our job in relation to State bodies.  We should think of the thousands of other jobs which are lost because industries cannot compete or expand, or cannot start and develop.  We have to realise that jobs protected at those high prices in the public service cost far more in terms of other jobs down the line in many other sectors of the community.</P>
    <P>It is not good enough to say, as Deputy McCartan said earlier, and as other Deputies have often said in this House, that the reason we must never look at privatisation or competition is that there would be job losses in State bodies.  We <Col N="1958" /> must face the fact that there will be job losses, but they will only occur because there is overmanning in those bodies and because those bodies do not need the huge amount of manpower they often have to provide a service.  The jobs lost there will be more than made up in the other jobs created right down the line. Those who are at work will reap the rewards of reduced levels of taxation if we have a much slimmer and more efficient public sector and semi-State sector.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Cullen said in relation to B &amp; I and as we have done in relation to CIE and other State companies, the PDs will look at each of these issues as they come before the House.  If we believe it is not appropriate that more and more good money should be thrown after bad we will not be afraid to oppose these measures.  We will spell out our reasons and take on board the political hassle that no doubt comes with that.  It is too easy for purely political reasons to bury one's head in the sand and ignore the economic forces that should be the criteria governing any decision in relation to these matters.</P>

      <P>I understand the Minister is to reply to the debate at 6.45 p.m. Before he replies, let me say that I do not wish to prolong the proceedings, but this Bill is one on which it is very wrong for this House to take a quick decision without a long and adequate explanation on a cost-benefit analysis basis of what is at stake.  It seems wrong that this House should commit another £11 million of taxpayers' money to capitalisation of an already loss-making concern without persuading the ultimate shareholders, the Irish people, that there is a greater interest to be served and a reason to inject further capital in this company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are no different in some respects from any other group of people who are being asked to invest moneys in a company and we should apply the same criteria as any other would-be investors. Indeed, we have a higher duty in this House to examine this proposal from the <Col N="1959" /> Minister.  It is not our money we are spending individually or collectively in this House.  It is taxpayers' money, and it is not simply taxpayers' money, it is moneys which are being borrowed abroad on which an interest price tag has to be paid.  This £11 million which the Minister proposes to advance to B &amp; I in the course of restructuring them and just staving off the inevitable for yet another season will cost about £1 million per annum in interest charges which have to be paid by the taxpayer each year in order to fund it.  That calls into question a number of issues.</P>
    <P>First, why do we want to remain owners of a shipping line on the Irish Sea? Does a strategic or national interest dictate that we should persist in funding a shipping line in this day and age in the circumstances?  Quite regardless of the circumstances which brought us into ownership of the B &amp; I Steam Packet Company a couple of decades ago, we must now ask ourselves whether it is legitimate for us to maintain that ownership. That question must be asked not simply on the basis that we have assets we might divest ourselves of but that we are embarking on a course which has in all probability further cost to the taxpayer down the line.</P>
    <P>It is suggested that the shipping business between Ireland and England is a strategic business and that for various national purposes it is important that there be an adequate supply of ships on that line.  If that is the case, this House is entitled to be informed as to whether there are others willing to purchase the ships, some or all of the ships that are not surplus to requirements.  From the Minister's speech it seems that at least one is now surplus to requirements.  Are there other people willing to purchase them and put them into the same service or a different service or more lucrative services plying between the same ports?</P>
    <P>If this House is not satisfied that nobody else will buy these ships or run similar services using other ships, then it is folly for us to go further into the mire and spend more money staying in this <Col N="1960" /> business ourselves.  We should be told clearly and unequivocally whether others are willing to supply the service using their own capital, rather than going to the taxpayers to provide more capital for what is in effect a hopeless case, the B &amp; I Steam Packet Company.  We should be told whether there are others willing to provide these services so that we can withdraw from this arena in which we have distinguished ourselves so badly.</P>
    <P>There is more than ample evidence that plenty of people are willing to run ferries and passenger and freight services where profit is to be made.  It is not as if there is a shortage of ships or a worldwide reluctance to invest in what should be safe and predictable routes.  It is not as if this country has problems of seasonality or geographical location or some other set of problems which would prevent private capital from investing in this route.  All the other ferry and freight companies plying between Ireland and England are, first, profitable and, secondly, privately owned.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Why should this country and this State decide to enter into a highly competitive situation with funds that not merely we cannot afford to spend but which we do not have in the first place and must borrow on the international money markets?  That is a crucial question which the Government, with respect to them, have never answered.  I do not believe that strategic interest argument has been adequately made out or that it can be shown that there would be a vacuum if the B &amp; I Steam Packet Company were no longer to function on these routes.  Even if there were a vacuum, I do not believe any lessening of the services would have a dramatic or serious strategic effect on our economy.  I suggest that the Government at the very least failed to make out a case in any shape or form to the effect that Ireland needs to plough more money into the B &amp; I Steam Packet Company or the services and ships employed on this line.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1961" /> We cannot simply regard resources which are to be spent on this decision by the Minister as free goods.  As I have said, they have to be borrowed elsewhere and could be expended or invested elsewhere. In that context our decision here tonight must be very clear, rational and cold.  The Minister made a case in his speech that there has been a considerable degree of evidence to suggest a willingness on the part of the workers in the B &amp; I Line to change their work practices, moderate their wage demands, guarantee industrial peace and the like. That is, belatedly, a credit to those workers and I do not want to denigrate it or take away from it.  That sacrifice should be saluted but, unfortunately, it is not enough.  It does not justify wasting money, and the strategic interest this country has is not in providing or maintaining those jobs, even a reduced number of jobs, to which the Minister refers.</P>
    <P>We have no strategic interest in retaining 1,200 jobs in any industry where the cost to the taxpayer cannot be justified. The ESB, to which Deputy Harney referred, is also an example of a company who are overmanned.  Here is an example of detrimental overmanning which is costing other jobs in other areas.  There is also the matter of interest costs and the time of Government which will be absorbed in the B &amp; I as a result of their continued existence in a vain effort to make them commercial.  This country cannot bear these costs any longer.  We must at some stage cry &ldquo;stop&rdquo; and apply reasonable, sensible commercial criteria. Nobody in the marketplace in his right mind would invest this extra £11 million in this company now.  It has negligible value.  It has negligible value in a market sense, and I do not believe that there is any strong case for deciding that it has anything but negligible value in a social sense.  We have no social interest above the economic interest, and I am not so ideologically made up that I refuse to blend social and economic interests.  But we do not have an economic or a higher social interest which requires maintenance <Col N="1962" /> of this service.</P>
    <P>As has been pointed out, the Sealink company is just as effective a means of transport in many respects as the B &amp; I Line.  It is now in private ownership.  I am sure its owners probably have complaints about the profits they make, but they are still providing the services and I have no doubt that the very competitive situation that has arisen out of the airlines fare structure reduction in recent times will have an adverse effect on the shipping services in relation to foot passengers at any rate between Ireland and Britain.</P>
    <P>But all these criteria do not justify making out a hard case based on sympathy or based on admiration for the management of B &amp; I who have been trying to turn the company around, or admiration for the workforce of B &amp; I, who, belatedly, have undertaken sacrifices to keep the company in existence. We cannot afford, as a society, to carry on commercial businesses to the point where they are manifestly no longer viable and then, effectively, find ourselves being presented with a case based on sympathy rather than cold commercial criteria.  We cannot go too far down that line.</P>
    <P>I believe that if the B &amp; I Line were to be allowed to be liquidated there would be a demand for the services of the people who are willing to work in shipping between Ireland and England. There is a market for their services.  It might be that for a short period there would be fewer people employed.  It might be that their trade union practices might be less restrictive.  It might be that their jobs would be, on occasions, more seasonal.  It might be that their remuneration would not be as high as it is now. But I have no doubt that there are some people &mdash; and there is clear evidence that there are people &mdash; who are willing to invest capital and who offer to carry on services between the ports now served by the B &amp; I.</P>
    <P>The Government have a very high onus of proof on them to establish that it is right that this House should put more money into the B &amp; I Line.  All of the activities in relation to that line over the <Col N="1963" /> last year have shown that they have, reluctantly on occasions, and under duress on other occasions, been brought to reality, but far too late.  The time for harsh measures, the time for deadlines, the time for unilateral warnings and threats is long since gone.  Now we are in the position that it is all too late.  This shipping line is not going to return to profitability.  It is not going to give a return on this capital that we are being asked to invest nor to any of the other capital that we have been asked to invest in it, and there are others who are in a far better position to run this service.</P>
    <P>I want to make one last point.  This House, and the Government which this House nominates after any General Election is not well qualified to run a shipping service.  We have no particular function in the matter and no qualifications.  We are not good readers of the market and our record in making commercial decisions, as Deputies Harney and Cullen pointed out earlier, is not one of which we can be proud.  Therefore, on any occasion when there is a proposal to invest the people's money as capital in any commercial or quasi-commercial operation, we should be very slow to do so and we should not do so unless the case is made out beyond doubt that this is a good investment.  I am afraid that on this occasion not only is that case not made out but it is staring us in the face, if we have the political honesty and maturity to face facts, that this is throwing good money after bad, that this is a deferment of a political decision which may be embarrassing to make but which must be addressed by this House, that is, to get out of capitalising and operating shipping services on the Irish Sea.  That is something we must face up to.  It is wrong that the price of lack of political courage on the part of politicians and the political establishment is an extra £11 million cost to the taxpayer.  Therefore, our party is absolutely opposed to extra capitalisation for B &amp; I because the Government have failed to make out the case.</P>

      <P>The B &amp; I moved 1.44 million tonnes of freight in 1987 from this country and brought into the country 126,000 cars, some business but mainly tourists.  It also dealt with 816,000 passengers.  I merely give those few statistics to indicate the important role the B &amp; I are playing in the commercial life of the country.  It was against that background that when I had a look at the state of the company's finances and referred the matter to Government that we decided, having considered it at more than one meeting, that we would have to call in both management and unions and indicate to them that they would have to come up with a blueprint for a commercially viable shipping company.</P>
      <P>I make that general statement because a good deal of the waffle I have listened to was an indication that people did not understand that that was the objective the Government set for themselves in their dealings with B &amp; I.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal with the various points made by Deputies in this House. Unfortunately, my time is very short.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Mitchell rightly pointed out that it would have cost more to close the company down than it would to keep it going.  That is not a good motive for keeping it going, but I am afraid it was a brutal fact.  I agree with Deputy Mitchell and disagree with the people who said <Col N="1965" /> that it is not necessary to have this company in present circumstances to deal with freight and passengers between this country and the United Kingdom.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mitchell and others paid tribute to the unions' contribution when this package was being put together.  I do not accept that argument about air fares.  It had an impact but, as I see it, the foot passengers will not, in the future, constitute any great percentage of the profits and moneys that are to be made by the B &amp; I.  It is not true to say, as Deputy Mitchell said, that all the semi-State bodies except B &amp; I were making a profit.  There is a substantial subsidy to be made to the transport company as well, as the Deputy knows.  A sum of £113 million is a substantial amount of money.  It has to be put above the line and it is money.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mitchell said he put a suggestion to the Department of Finance that they should take care of the debts accrued by the company and that the company should be allowed a plain sea to operate on and prove that they could make a profit.  One of the difficulties about that is that the moneys are not available as of now.  It is not the responsibility of the State to look after the debts incurred by the B &amp; I except in so far as the State guaranteed those debts.  I do not intend to depart from that position.</P>
    <P>The B &amp; I, as I said in my opening remarks, were under no illusion from the start about what my objective was.  That objective was that they develop a commercially viable shipping industry here operating from Dublin to the United Kingdom.  I know that the profit and the benefit in tourism will be in cars for the future and the slimmed down freight operation which was put in the package by the management and the unions.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that many of the contributors to the debate did not examine the package put together by the chairman and chief executive and the unions. There was no analysis of the redundancies, no analysis of the shedding of services, no analysis of the responsible attitude of the unions in putting that <Col N="1966" /> package together.  A number of Deputies referred to profits that are being made &mdash; I will not be specific about companies &mdash; by shipping companies at present.  I do not know where they are getting their statistics.  My information is that all the shipping companies, both on the short routes and on deep sea routes, are in serious trouble and are finding it very difficult to make the kind of profits they could make by buying saving certificates. That is, in fact, my information in my Department and I want to put it on the record of the House.  There is an idea that we should start a private company, start shipping, start a commercial deal, and, hey presto, the money will come in immediately.  That is not a fact as of now.</P>

      <P>I would not be so bullish about the profit situation as referred to by several Deputies &mdash; Deputy Cullen, Deputy Harney and Deputy McDowell &mdash; who mentioned it in their contributions. I pointed out at the time I announced the new arrangements that I would be reviewing the situation in the autumn.  That will give time for the new shake out to get settled down and to face up to the facts of life on this particular operation.  Do not forget that there are hardly very many people in our society at present who would take a cut in what they are being paid to save the company for which they are working.  That position deserved commendation from this House and I am very disappointed&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Deputy's colleagues did not.  In fact, they said they did not count at all when they were deciding on policy for this company, get rid of them, sack them, wives and children did not <Col N="1967" /> count at all, crass commercialism and make the bottom line your ideal.  That was the theme of the contribution by at least two of the Deputies here tonight. Where is the plan?  I do not think Deputy Cullen listened to what I had to say.  He came in with a prepared speech.  He did not listen to what I outlined.</P>

      <P>I am not saying the Deputy had a script in his hand; I am saying he came in with a prepared speech. He did not deal with rationalisation of the company and he did not listen to what I had to say.  If somebody says it is not necessary to have this company on the Irish Sea, I wish that person had been in my office when the Sealink went on strike.  I had mushroom growers, meat exporters, perishable good exporters haunting me and hammering me on the telephone to try to get space on the B &amp; I ships so that they would not lose their goods and that they would not go to loss. I wish people would be a little more realistic and stop talking in terms of high finance, of profits and so on and think of the realities of the situation, the people who are exporting goods out of this country and the people who are working at that business of exporting.</P>

Private people would have one look at the debts which the B &amp; I have and they would run like the hammers of hell away from that situation.  There is no way in which they would walk into it.  Some people suggested that the banks might take it over but we, the Government, were to pay the bank debts, bank debts which we had not guaranteed.

      <P>I agree that it is in heavy freight and in the businessman with the car, and the tourists with cars that the B &amp; I must seek their market and must seek to develop their muscle.  There seems to be &mdash; probably from lack of knowledge &mdash; the idea abroad that the B &amp; I are not trying to sell.  The B &amp; I are trying to sell, are publishing brochures, are holding conferences with tourist operators and travel agents in order to get people to use their services into this country and I gave the statistics of how many did come.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take the point that Deputy Cullen made about the Channel tunnel.  It will have an important impact on transport in this country. It will have an important impact on the areas which will be used from this country &mdash; Rosslare and that particular part of the country will become more important.  I want to say that the finished Channel tunnel is far down the road.  It will be very expensive and it will be expensive to use it.  We should keep that in mind also when we are thinking of planning ahead.  It is important to have a commercially viable company.  It is <Col N="1969" /> important also that 879 people should be working in this country where work is getting scarcer and scarcer and where our numbers of unemployed are becoming greater.  We have got a guarantee of industrial peace.  We have workers who took a 5 per cent cut and who have taken a freeze in their wages.</P>

      <P>That Dáil Éireann, conscious of the particular attack on the vocational sector represented by the cuts inflicted on the sector at second and third level by the Minister for Education and the Government; noting in particular the increase in the pupil-teacher ratio, from a band of 17 &mdash; 19-1 to 20-1 in the vocational sector, and an increase from 19-1 to 20-1 in the community and comprehensive sector, with a reduction of 10 per cent in the number of teachers; nothing the threat to temporary teachers at second and third level; noting the suspension of the building programme, and the deferral of urgent extensions and refurbishment; noting further the proposals of the Minister and the Government to abolish or amalgamate some vocational education committees, calls for democratic and prior consultation before this specific proposal is published; conscious that the vocational sector is responsible for a disproportionate share of remedial teaching, special provision for the disadvantaged, and community related and second chance education; calls on the Minister and the Government to withdraw their proposals for cuts in the vocational sector so as to enable this sector of State education to survive and expand.</P>
      <P>In moving this motion in the name of the Labour Party Deputies I would like, with your agreement and with the agreement of the House, to share some of my time, 12 to 15 minutes, if necessary, with the Leader of The Workers' Party, Deputy Tomás Mac Giolla, the representative of the Democratic Socialist Party, Deputy Jim Kemmy and the Independents, should they need such time as might be left over.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this motion is to defend what semblance of equality remains in second level education. In moving the motion on behalf of the Labour Party I am very conscious that many may ask, is one concentrating on one specific threat?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me begin immediately by saying that the Labour Party's position in <Col N="1973" /> relation to the cuts in education was indicated very clearly when we gave our opinion on the motion noting the Estimates last June.  We stated on that occasion that we thought the cuts in education were the ones which, together with the cuts in health, would impact most particularly on the disadvantaged sections of the community.  Therefore we opposed all cuts in education.  It was in this sense that we put down motions dealing with the cuts in every sector of education and took the position we did particularly in terms of the impact on primary education of Circular 20/87.</P>
    <P>I am aware that at secondary level a new booklet has been prepared by the ASTI, &ldquo;Post-Primary Education Cutbacks&rdquo;, which lists serious consequences for the cuts in education over a number of years, some continued and some now being more accentuated by the failure to make provisions.  They point, for example, to cuts that will come about in terms of the shortening of the school cycle, larger classes, fewer subject options, cuts in the provision for minority subjects, remedial education, cutbacks in career guidance and counselling, in technical and scientific subjects, in science and equipment grants, in in-service training, the impact of fees and charges of an additional kind, particularly in relation to the repeat of the leaving certificate and so forth.  I am very conscious of these matters and I will return to them in more detail perhaps on another occasion soon.</P>
    <P>This motion on the Order Paper and expanded by events is one that has been placed in an atmosphere of some secrecy. I made a number of attempts to draw from the Minister for Education what precisely were her intentions in relation to vocational education as far back as last May.  You, Sir, wrote to me on 5 May 1987 and I accepted your ruling.  When I asked whether I could place a question asking the Minister to withdraw the directive relating to guidance teachers, remedial teachers and vice-principalships in both the secondary and vocational levels, you said it anticipated a debate on the budget.  Again and again I asked the <Col N="1974" /> Minister, specifically in Question No. 82 of 11 June, what her proposals were in relation to the funds she might make available towards vocational education.  I also asked about vocational preparation and training programmes and how they could survive in an atmosphere of cuts. In Question No. 177 of 23 June I asked the Minister the number of whole-time teaching equivalents allocated to each vocational education committee in the years 1986 and 1987.  The Minister replied:</P>
    <P>It would not be in accordance with normal practice to supply the information sought in respect of each vocational education committee.</P>
    <P>I derived some cynical amusement from that because I remembered the Minister sitting on this side of the House and when the Minister of the day was asked a question by the then Deputy O'Rourke, she was quickly on her feet and said: &ldquo;I want that information.  It is outrageous that I cannot get it.&rdquo;  The conversion of the seating arrangement has more than gone to the Minister's head.</P>
    <P>In Question No. 178 of 23 June 1987 I asked the amount allocated to each vocational education committee in respect of (a) discretionary non-pay and (b) committed non-pay for the academic year 1987-88.  She said:</P>
    <P>Resources are allocated to vocational education committees on a calendar year basis, not on the basis of the academic year.</P>
    <P>She went on to say the information was not available.  Question No. 179 asked for further information.  I have already referred to Questions Nos. 180 and 181. In reply to Question No. 182 she said it would not be normal practice to furnish the information requested in relation to individual schools.  What was happening?</P>
    <P>I used the word &ldquo;secrecy&rdquo; because the Minister was preparing to attack vocational education through stealth.  She was setting up a situation where she would be able to shelter behind the vocational education committees, the chief executive officers and the heads of <Col N="1975" /> schools to whom she could direct the parents, teachers and pupils and say: &ldquo;I do not make the decisions.  I simply allocate the money.&rdquo;  Let us call it what it is. It is an exercise in simple, unadulterated cowardice.</P>
    <P>The main purpose of our motion seeks to defend vocational education.  Let me make this point very clear.  I could have added to this motion suggestions about where the money might be found from all kinds of taxation the majority of people in this House seem to want to oppose.  There is a consensus in this House, I understand, that the wealthy should not pay taxes, that people who operate stud farms should not pay tax, that stallions fees should not be liable to tax, and so forth. It is a strong ideological position.  I left all that out so that we could make a simple decision: are we in favour of defending the <i>status quo</i> in relation to a sector which is carrying more than its share of servicing the deprived, or are we not?  There is no need to fudge the issue.</P>
    <P>I want to indicate my attitude to the Fine Gael amendment to my motion.  If they had said they were in favour of retaining the <i>status quo</i> in vocational education and that the central review committee, which can work under the <i>Programme for National Recovery,</i> would look at the issue of inequality, I would have accepted the amendment. Instead I am being asked to delete all the words in my motion that defend vocational education, that oppose the cuts, and to take refuge in the committee's work.  I have described this publicly, and I put it now on the record, as asking me to accept a committee on capital punishment while executions on Death Row continue every minute.  It is, in effect, a mask, a smokescreen for allowing the cuts to continue.  I am not surprised, nor am I shocked, about this. I see it as part of the collusion between the two larger parties to defend their consensus on the economic issues at the cost of vocational education, those who benefit from it, those who work in it and those who support it.</P>
    <P>Our motion is intended to prevent <Col N="1976" /> deepening inequalities in Irish society. Cuts have been proposed in the vocational sector and this is agreed by anybody who has ever served on a vocational committee.  Vocational Education Committees are filled 80 per cent to 90 per cent by Progressive Democrats, Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael members throughout the country.  They have said to their committees, to parents and to children that they will defend vocational education.  The time has come for them to choose between that commitment and a parliamentary subterfuge which would allow the cuts to continue.</P>
    <P>As I said, the motion was worded initially to secure the widest possible consensus among Opposition parties and I welcome the support being given by the Deputies of the Left.  It afforded an opportunity to all political parties concerned about the attack on the vocational sector, to stop these attacks in a united and positive manner.</P>
    <P>The cuts in vocational education have been well documented for any Deputy who wants to read the facts, who wants to ascertain how they will impact.  There is a figure from a Teachers' Union of Ireland survey that shows just under 700 posts being lost in the vocational sector and 200 in the community and comprehensive sectors.  There will be losses in the regional colleges of both permanent and part-time posts and there will be losses of part-time posts at second level.  Can the House imagine circumstances in which 10 per cent of the teaching staff in a sector of education is taken away with all the consequent losses in terms of jobs, of subject provision, in terms of the different links which had been built in second chance and community and special provision education? The cuts are being effected through an increase in the pupil teacher ratio from a band of 17 to 19: 1 to 20: 1 in the vocational sector and an increase from 19 : 1 to 20: 1 in the community and comprehensive sectors.</P>
    <P>The Minister has also issued Circular 45 of 1987 which gives details of the cost savings in gross pay she expects to effect in the vocational sector &mdash; 1 per cent in <Col N="1977" /> 1987, 3 per cent in 1988.  She has, of course, hastily thrown together a voluntary redundancy scheme which she &mdash; and I am afraid now, Fine Gael &mdash; will allow to continue while the position is reviewed.  The effect of that will be to devastate vocational education.</P>
    <P>I do not want to hear from the Minister any little pieces of, if you like, clever sophistry for which her Department is a good and reputable source, that we are really talking about levelling things up at this level of education.  If she feels inclined to that poisoned well of logic, I would invite her to read the reports of the Economic and Social Research Institute, to look at those who have carried out research in the area, who have looked at which sector is in fact dealing with deprivation, who is carrying what proportion of the burden and so on.</P>
    <P>I have been inundated with letters from people who work in the sector all over the country.  Today a teacher rang up from a rural area in County Galway.  He said to me: &ldquo;The Minister has told me&rdquo;&mdash; at least her departmental official said, let me correct myself immediately &mdash;&ldquo;that I will be all right for equipment, that the £30 cannot be paid to pupils, or £300 a year per pupil.&rdquo;  He said, &ldquo;I can have equipment but there will be nobody in the classes.&rdquo;  That is the kind of unthought-out consequence behind the proposals.</P>
    <P>In addition, we must bear in mind that there is another dimension to all of this. In the vocational sector there has been a long history since John Marcus O'Sullivan introduced the Vocational Education Act, 1930, despite some prejudice and opposition.  Poor Professor O'Sullivan, a former Minister for Education, had to give guarantees that boys and girls would be kept separate in the day and that there would not be night classes at all lest they meet after dark &mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Minister for Education (Mrs. O'Rourke) Minister for Education (Mrs. O'Rourke)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>They still meet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash; and on it went. He gave other guarantees in relation to religious education.  We have come a long <Col N="1978" /> way since that time.  Those who worked in the vocational education sector transcended prejudices and obstacles of one kind or another to make a unique contribution to equality of access to education. I challenge anybody to tell me where in the motion they find a fact they can dispute in relation to that.  That is not to say there are not secondary schools carrying the burden of deprivation to some degree or another.  I am simply saying that the greater part of the burden is being carried by the vocational schools.</P>
      <P>There was another element that was very important which was in relation to control.  The vocational education sector represents, above all else, State education with a certain kind of democratic control represented through vocational education committees.  It sits side-by-side with denominational education just beyond the practically heavily-dominated denominational private primary schools sector.  That point has not gone unnoticed.  It is interesting that it is at State education the heaviest burden of the cuts have been directed.  I am not attributing any malign conspiracy theory to the Minister.  I am simply saying she is continuing a trend but she is not absolved by pointing to cuts that took place between the years 1983 and 1987.  As a teacher I hope she will get beyond such partisan points and will come to address the issue as to whether or not she agrees that this sector should have been left alone, should have been saved from the cuts she has suggested, as to whether she will withdraw her proposals for effecting cuts in this sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to staff and courses, even in relation to making provision for the subjects being taught, did it not occur to the Minister, when she spoke of higher classes &mdash; and her Minister of State now beside her is responsible for buildings &mdash; that even in the most modern buildings provided, the physical space does not exist in some classrooms for the increased numbers about which she and he speak? Are those children to be out in the corridor while they are doing practical subjects? Where in Europe has this been tried out?  Moving on from the buildings <Col N="1979" /> that are there to the buildings that will not be there, the fact is not only do the cuts mean larger classes, fewer teachers, subject choices for students being curtailed, length of weekly time of students' attendance being shortened, time devoted to individual subjects being curtailed and remedial education being affected: it will mean also that the building programme &mdash; except through the odd act of patronage &mdash; will not continue. Effectively the building programme will not proceed at all.  Not only has the building programme been halted but projects which were at different stages have been frozen at the stage they had reached despite the continual assertion from within the Department of Education itself that such a planning exercise was independent of the provision of funding at final stage as to whether a project could go to contract.</P>
    <P>The fact of the matter is the existence of prefab buildings will continue for students and their teachers.  In addition, in relation to the cuts, the whole notion of any project going ahead is questionable. Let us take the Minister of State and I who share the same constituency; we are told that perhaps one project could proceed this year and that we will be lucky if a second goes forward in two years. But all of the rest can be told &mdash; the people in Properous in Kildare, those all around the country &mdash; to continue their existence in a physical setting which is intolerable by any European standard.</P>
    <P>The vocational sector has been one that offered a comprehensive range of courses that bridged the gap between subjects of hand and brain.  In the community and comprehensive sector many changes in curriculum were pioneered that led to the combination of scientific, technical, academic and practical subjects.  These innovations are not only in danger, they simply cannot continue under the new arrangements suggested.</P>
    <P>How can Members of this House, who are in any sense interested in equality, justify anything less than the withdrawal of the Minister's proposals?  There is simply no justification on any moral <Col N="1980" /> grounds for other than support of this motion.  Again I repeat: anything less than a withdrawal of the proposals will allow the cuts to continue with the kinds of consequences of which I have spoken. It is very clear that vocational education carries more than its burden of addressing the needs of the lower socio-economic groups, that bottom fifth of the population who consume on average half the amount of resources consumed by the top fifth of the population in total educational resources.  They carry the burden of addressing the problem of deprivation in our society.</P>
    <P>I want this evening to address a particular appeal to all those from the other parties who are members of vocational education committees around the country. I appeal to them to be honourable and stand by the commitment they have made locally and not to take refuge in the degradation of Parliament that is involved in voting for a smoke-screen that allows to continue the very thing they gave commitments to stop.  What little equality there is, as I said, is at stake.</P>
    <P>There will be cuts in every area.  There will be cuts in Galway city where I live of between ten and 12 posts.  The vote tomorrow evening at 8.30 p.m. will be about that.  There will be 30 or more posts lost in Galway county.  People will vote for or against that.  If one takes refuge in the first amendment which is, to put it in vulgar language, a readyup between the Government and the so-called main Opposition party, one is simply taking refuge in a committee that allow everything to roll on.  The second amendment, to which I will give a more detailed response when I reply to the debate, is clever.  It realises what I have said about the risks of a committee while the cuts roll on but it is not clear what is meant by the word &ldquo;rationalise&rdquo; in its first line. It refers to a reduction in the number of committees and a rigid imposition of the ratio, language which is ambiguous and with which I will deal later.</P>
    <P>In relation to the proposal to abolish vocational education committees, I stated in the motion that what is at stake <Col N="1981" /> here is very simply a principle of democratic and prior consultation.  In other words, one should not simply make proposals by way of edict, ministerial edict or departmental edict, but there should be consultation in advance and the motion calls for open and democratic consultation.  We all have views on how representation at local level might be improved.  Let us have an opportunity to make that contribution.</P>
    <P>As I have said, the implications of the cuts will certainly take place in relation to the number of people who will be lost as teachers.  They will be represented through the loss of courses and through the loss of materials also.  I had a letter from a woodwork teacher who explained to me the difficulties of teaching woodwork classes using cardboard instead of wood.  There are schools around the country who have difficulty maintaining adequate heat, any kind of maintenance and so forth.  Maybe the intention in this atmosphere of rapid individualism and private provision is that the Minister and her Department are thinking of learning towards the vocational sector and saying to the parents involved, coming as many of them do from the socio-economic categories I have identified, that they could make a contribution to bail things out. No doubt the Minister of State who has responsibility for the national lottery might like to come around afterwards and tell them he is going to give some of it for wood for woodwork classes.  We are at that level of Santa Claus nonsense in this country at present, at that departure from democratic accountability.</P>
    <P>There are many other aspects to the cuts.  I am particularly interested in hearing how the main Opposition party square their response that their amendment is structured within the spirit of the Tallaght speech so-called, with the statement by Deputy Dukes in that speech when he stated that equality was a major principle with him.  I quote from his speech of 2 September 1987 when he said:</P>
    <P>Where expenditure has a social objective, the accent must be put on <Col N="1982" /> achieving social justice and ensuring that expenditure is clearly and effectively channelled towards those most in need, even at the expense of those in lesser need and those who can provide for themselves.</P>
    <P>The way to achieve that is to support the motion, not to amend it.</P>
    <P>The fact is that the future threatens us in an atmosphere of individualism where we have witnessed changes in health provisions that have now established a diminished public health care and a faster private health care.  We have taken overwhelmingly from working people in taxes and said to them there is something correct about a country in which 90 per cent of the people in Dáil Éireann support a situation where a person can have his hip replaced in four and a half weeks but another person must wait for four and a half years even though the person on the four and a half year waiting list is overwhelmingly the contributor to public taxation.  We are now witnessing the same thing in education.  In the end the destruction of inequality in education is about that kind of uncritical individualism and private provision.</P>
    <P>We have come a long way since the thirties.  During the past 58 years the vocational sector have built up a reputation for themselves and an impressive achievement in building egalitarianism against the tide of individualism.  It is that which is now at stake.  This motion is about equality; above all else, it is about that very principle.  It simply states that what little equality we have and what gains have been painfully made are under attack.  It calls on all the Members of Dáil Éireann not to allow it to happen.  I ask them to support the motion as I move it on behalf of the Labour Party.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to thank Deputy Michael Higgins for allowing me some of his precious time to speak on this motion because I know how strongly he feels on the issue and how much more he has to say.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Workers' Party totally support the motion put down by the Labour Party <Col N="1983" /> Deputies.  As a member of the City of Dublin VEC for the past nine years I have had fair experience of the workings of the VEC system in the Dublin city area.  I know the importance of it and the effect these cuts will have on it.</P>
    <P>The first point I should like to make is that the cutbacks now being imposed by the Government on the vocational education system seem to be a clear breach of the spirit and letter of the <i>Programme for National Recovery,</i> a programme which was signed by the Government, trade unions and employers.  That programme specifically said that the Government recognised the importance of the education system in the promotion of equity in society.  No society needs equity more than this society.  The programme said they recognised the importance of the education system and would ensure that in implementing whatever adjustments were necessary in that sector because of financial considerations the burden of adjustment would not fall on the disadvantaged.  Of course, the sector of education which deals with the most disadvantaged children, the VEC system, has been singled out for particular attention by the Minister.</P>
    <P>The cuts imposed on the VEC system will from next September result in a reduction of between 500 and 700 jobs in VEC schools in 1988.  According to a survey done by the TUI, the cuts have already meant that 19 per cent of VEC schools have lost a subject at junior cycle and 43 per cent have lost one at senior cycle.  Many VEC schools are now in the position where not alone can they not afford materials, as Deputy Higgins pointed out, but many are not even in the position to provide the minimum levels of heating required for workplaces under the Factories Acts.</P>
    <P>The VEC system already has a far higher proportion of weak and remedial students and students from socially disadvantaged backgrounds.  The unprecedented cutbacks now being imposed on the system can only increase the level of disadvantage.  In addition, the increase in <Col N="1984" /> school transport charges and the improsition of fees for students repeating the leaving certificate examination will place many lower income families whose children are attending vocational schools at an even greater disadvantage.  It will lead to more working-class children dropping out of the schools system earlier.</P>
    <P>The reneging by Fianna Fáil on their commitment to build regional technical colleges in Blanchardstown, Tallaght and other areas will make third level education an ever more remote prospect for working-class children.  Again, the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> said that the Government would continue to foster and encourage the participation of the disadvantaged at all levels of education. The cutbacks have also meant that the inner city college here in Dublin is deferred again this year, 1988.  Since 1982, the Government have cut the pupil-teacher ratio at second level several times and have indicated their intention to do so again now.  The effect of these cuts is that this year there are of the order of 2,000 fewer teachers in the public sector of education than there would have been if teachers were still appointed on the basis used in 1982.  The cuts proposed in 1988 will add a further 500 to 700 teachers to this number.</P>
    <P>The reason that you cannot have the same pupil/teacher ratio in the VEC system as in the secondary school system is fairly simple, but does not seem to be understood by the Department of Education or the Minister.  There is something more than just cutbacks on education generally involved in this attack on the VEC system.  The Minister is being very badly advised on this within the Department of Education, and she should look seriously at the type of advice she is getting.  You cannot have the same pupil/teacher ratio in the VEC system as in other secondary schools: ninety per cent of all the VEC school classes are practical classes &mdash; woodwork, metalwork and so forth where you must have a smaller pupil/teacher ratio for safety and instruction purposes, whereas less than 25 per cent of the secondary schools have practical classes.  Secondly, the <Col N="1985" /> VEC system is non-selective in its pupils. That means that all are welcome, no matter how difficult they are, how disadvantaged, how remedial.  Whether they are mildly mentally handicapped, or are disruptive due to problems in the home, or slow learners simply because of nutritional deficiency from the grinding poverty under which many of them are now living, no pupil is refused.  All are accepted, whereas other secondary schools select their pupils and decide whom they will have.  The vocational education system caters for a very wide range of pupils from the slowest to the brightest, right through the whole system of education.  You cannot lay down a rule that that system of education will have the same pupil/teacher ratio as second level schools.  Also, they are involved in many other areas of education such as in the prison service where you certainly are not going to have a 20:1 pupil/teacher ratio&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Department of Education over the years provided remedial teachers on an ex-quota basis.  According to the College of Education rules, these teachers should be given time to take small classes of very weak students and advance them in the basics of reading and mathematics.

      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall take another minute.  These teachers should be given time for meetings with parents, for diagnostic testing of the children, for liaising with other teachers and so forth.  This is not happening for the majority of such teachers.  In fact, remedial teachers are being put teaching general classes and the remedial problem is being overlooked due to lack of teachers.</P>
      <P>In the secondary school area there is a surplus of some hundreds of teachers and certainly these teachers should be redeployed rather than have cutbacks in the vocational system.  Why this problem should be made worse at the same time as taxpayers' money is being used to support education for the privileged in selective fee-paying schools is hard to understand. The number of teachers in these schools roughly accords with the numbers to be cut from second level schools.  If there must be cuts, let them be made on those who can afford them.  Let those salaries be met by fee increases and not by a reduction in the remedial service to the disadvantaged.</P>

      <P>Unfortunately, when I get up to speak in this House time is always a very precious and rare commodity. I have had to learn to practice some economy, to use a bad pun in this context, so I shall adhere to my normal procedure in that respect.  Like Deputy Mac Giolla, I am very grateful to Deputy Michael Higgins for his generous gesture in affording me time to speak here tonight.  It is not the first time that he has given me some of his precious time. There are not many Deputies who would do so and I have listened to the most dreadful ráméis.  Speakers have been rambling on for hours and saying nothing. When it comes to popular issues such as this, time is very precious.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is an obligation on the State &mdash; I suppose the cliché is, devolved on the <Col N="1987" /> Government of the day &mdash; to provide the means of giving all our children the best possible education.  This is the ideal but the reality in practice is often very different. Those of us who move around the country can see how the children are suffering.  The same case has been put forward here tonight as was put forward late last year regarding the proposed cuts in primary education.  The same arguments are being trotted out tonight against the proposed cuts in vocational education but these will do far more damage in that sector than in any other sector, as was said by Deputies Higgins and Mac Giolla.  It is the children from deprived, disadvantaged and poorer homes and backgrounds who suffer.  They are vulnerable, not being in a position to overcome these cutbacks.</P>
    <P>I have heard a lot said in this House in recent years about the need for educational reform.  Every Minister coming to the office speaks about that need. However, I see very little evidence of it.  You could not call cutbacks and the proposed changes educational reform.  I am not against the concept of educational reform.  It is a good concept if it is a thorough exercise, instead of a cosmetic one.  If we are going to have educational reform, let us go about it in an efficient, professional and scientific way.  Let us take all branches, levels and types of education into account.  We are not getting this type of approach.  Instead, we are getting a very crude, clumsy, insensitive and unscientific exercise of chopping and lopping at the most vulnerable and weak sections of our community.  I see very little evidence of any kind of equality of treatment or social justice in the Government's attitude.  The Government abolished, or substantially reduced the numbers of, career guidance teachers and remedial teachers and it is the children who pay the price for these cuts, through the quality of their education being diminished.</P>
    <P>Let us not be dishonest and call what is happening here educational reform; it is the opposite.  Unfortunately, Government propaganda has been effective in <Col N="1988" /> many areas.  I see principals of schools and colleges throughout the country, and teachers as well, being conditioned to accept these cutbacks.  Many have already made arrangements to deal with the effects of these cutbacks.  Many have already set plans in motion to cope with reduced numbers of teachers and classes in schools and colleges.  Two weeks ago, I went to the Moylish regional technical college, Limerick, after a memo had been sent out by the principal spelling out the future of brick laying, plastering and stone cutting courses.  Limerick has been the home of training this century in all those areas but those courses are now in jeopardy.  Even though the building industry is in the doldrums, it is wrong to turn our backs on our heritage in this respect.  In more recent times, we have shown a very flexible approach by going into the wider areas of Tipperary, Clare and even the Midlands, to bring students in to keep those courses going.</P>
    <P>It behoves the Minister to pay attention to what has been said in this debate. It is very easy to look on this exercise as a means to saving money but we are talking about young people who are trying to claw their way into the world of training and employment.  This is not a time for cutbacks, it is a time for maintaining and improving existing courses. The quality of education at that level is vitally important not just for the building and engineering industries but for the country as a whole, because we are depending on our children to build up this country, to provide full employment and to make it a better place in which to live.  By cutting remedial and career guidance teachers, we are doing the very opposite.</P>

      <P>I should like to thank the three speakers for the very constructive contributions they made, although I disagree with some of their remarks.  Any politician, irrespective of what party he comes from, has to complain about cuts in essential services such as education.  Probably two of the most <Col N="1989" /> telling statements that Deputy Higgins made were that we should leave this sector alone and that this motion is about equality.  I should like to deal with those two issues in the context of what all three speakers said.</P>
      <P>One must take the Government's Policy in regard to education in the context of their overall policy in running the country.  Deputy Higgins knows well that this sector cannot be left alone.  This is about the tenth time that Deputy Higgins has called on us in the House to leave this sector alone although, on each occasion, he was talking about a different sector.  There will not be much equality if we continue to leave every sector alone, as Deputy Higgins would like us to do.</P>

There will not be equality if three, four or five years down the road we will not be able to pay the salaries of the vocational education teachers or indeed the salaries of secondary teachers. The Minister and I, as teachers, are the first to acknowledge that any cut in education is not good but we are forced into a situation in which there is no choice. We must make the necessary cuts if we are to get the country out of the problems it faces and to keep it from falling into much more serious trouble, which would lead to less equality in the years ahead.</P>

      <P>It is relevant, in the context of the motions before the House this evening, to trace in outline the development of the vocational education system.  Following the report of the Commission on Technical Education which was established in 1926 &ldquo;to inquire into and advise upon the system of Technical Education in Saorstát Éireann in relation to the requirements of Trade and Industry&rdquo; the Vocational Education Act was passed in July 1930.  The main purpose of the VECs was to provide a system of continuation and technical education in their administrative areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In all, 38 VECs were established and the Act placed the administration of the vocational system of education in the <Col N="1991" /> hands of locally elected committees which would be subject to the overall control of the Minister for Education. The flexibility and adaptability inherent in the 1930 Act has enabled the VECs to be in a position to meet every challenge put to them in the intervening half century by a country which in that time has evolved into a modern industrial and increasingly urbanised nation.  The VECs have been in a position to decide what courses and facilities were required at local level and to provide a wide variety of courses to meet changing needs. Because of the close links between the schools and local communities and the knowledge and concern of VEC members, special needs were readily identified and met with a speedy and efficient response.  The VECs have also made a lasting contribution to the development of apprentice education and the provision of adult education courses. They are, of course, the main providers of adult education programmes.  A Fianna Fáil Government in 1980 had the foresight to sanction 50 adult education officers for the VECs to enable them to further expand the wide variety of adult education courses and to meet new perceived needs in that area.</P>
    <P>In the sixties, following the OECD report on &ldquo;Investment in Education&rdquo;, VEC schools were enabled to provide the full senior cycle programme in their schools, again by a Fianna Fáil Minister, the late George Colley.  This led to a fairly radical change in the curriculum in vocational schools and to a reduction in the differences between vocational schools and other second-level schools.</P>
    <P>I reject the view expressed by Deputy Mac Giolla about the alleged selectivity in regard to secondary schools.  That may be so in some secondary schools but, by and large, no selectivity exists and pupils now have an opportunity to choose between a vocational or secondary education system.  Indeed, I would quote the following extract from the previous Government's Green Paper, &ldquo;Partners in Education&rdquo;:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1992" /> The development of the Irish post-primary system over the last twenty years has led to the creation of a number of different types of schools all of which are seeking to provide essentially the same education service to the same public.  Up to the mid-nineteen-sixties the voluntary secondary schools provided services at post-primary level which were different in character and emphasis from each other.  Since then this distinction has largely disappeared ...</P>
    <P>It appears that some members are not familiar with that.</P>
    <P>This, therefore, represented acceptance of the point I have just made, that the curriculum followed by the various post-primary schools is very much the same.  It follows logically, therefore, that we should be looking towards a harmonisation of the pupil-teacher ratios obtaining in second-level schools.</P>
    <P>It was also a Fianna Fáil Government &mdash; I do not need to remind the house of the late Donagh O'Malley &mdash; who introduced free post-primary education, the free school transport system, the building of regional technical colleges and the provision of a VEC scholarship scheme to enable students to proceed to third-level education in the regional technical colleges and colleges of technology.  Successive Fianna Fáil administrations have, therefore, been conscious of the changing needs in education and have, by their actions, responded positively by ensuring that resources required to meet these needs were forthcoming.</P>
    <P>For its part, the vocational education sector has not been found wanting in its response.  It has responded admirably to the challenge of change, realising that the future welfare of our society is linked intrinsically with the products of our schools.  It has given a lead in the reorganisation of educational provision, placing new technical and technological modules before our pupils, stimulating work-experience in our schools and thereby bringing employers and teachers into a new partnership in education.  The Minister and I, as former members of <Col N="1993" /> vocational education committees, are clear that not alone should vocational education continue but that it should grow because of the important contribution it has to make to the education of our children.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Why change the ratio?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. F. Fahey Mr. F. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>Fianna Fáil administrations have always been to the forefront in the evolution of the education system and have acknowledged the key role performed by the VECs in that process. Notwithstanding the financial difficulties facing the country, the present Government have been at pains to ensure that sufficent funds are provided to enable the VECs to maintain a satisfactory level of second-level school facilities, including provision for the disadvantaged.</P>
      <P>In more recent times the face of change and the variety and complexity of the demands have grown far beyond anything that could have been dreamed of in 1930. Many educational changes and advances have been undertaken within the parameters of the 1930 Act in that period. The local VEC in addition to managing its own schools and classes is now the centre for many other activities.  Through its CEO, it assists in administering school transport for post-primary pupils. It runs adult education and adult literacy schemes and training workshops for travelling people.  It provides scholarships for third level courses and grants for ESF courses.  It promotes and co-ordinates sport activities in its area.  It maintains close co-operation with AnCO and national manpower, now FÁS, regional and county development and other national and local organisations.</P>
      <P>In the midst of change the vocational system has not lost sight of the need for all-round development of human potential. Care for the education of all individuals is the philosophical foundation of the 1930 Act.  That continuing care is manifested in the many varied projects currently being developed in VEC schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1994" /> The 1930 vocational Act has served this country well throughout the years.  It has provided a flexible and imaginative basis by which local, educational, industrial and social requirements have been met, and this has remained true to the present day.</P>
    <P>No one can be in any doubt about Fianna Fáil's regard for the vocational education system and their appreciation of the inestimable debt we all owe to those dedicated people involved in its day to day running.  It is because of this regard for the vocational education system that the Government are anxious to ensure that the structures presently in place are delivering the services for which they are responsible in the most efficient and cost-effective manner.  In this regard it is worth noting that in the 1985-86 school year VECs were responsible for 247 second level schools with nearly 5,000 whole-time teacher equivalents and some 82,000 pupils.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. F. Fahey Mr. F. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>In fact, during that period there were two reductions in the pupil-teacher ratio.  The education system, because of the need to change and rationalise, cannot be immune at any time from the type of changes that are now taking place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the amalgamation of VECs, the position is that the Government have decided, with a view to achieving a more efficient and cost-effective administration, that the vocational education sector should be rationalised.  The Minister for Education has been reviewing the scope for rationalisation having regard to a wide range of factors and in the light of representations which have been made to her and consultations which she has had with various interest groups. <Col N="1995" /> While final decisions have not yet been taken it is envisaged that the revised structures will involve approximately 20 VECs, rather than 38 as at present.</P>
    <P>In the present economic and financial climate it is generally acknowledged that economies must be secured in all areas of Government activity.  In effecting these economies the Government have had due regard to their effects on the various public services involved.  Given the resources devoted annually to the education services, it is apparent that a contribution must be forthcoming from this area to the resolution of our national difficulties.  I am convinced, however, that the resources available in 1988 to the education sector and to the vocational education sector in particular will be adequate to sustain the basic educational framework and to allow satisfactory educational services to continue to be delivered. I reject the accusations made by Deputy Higgins in regard to the effects of the cuts.  He said that ten posts would be removed in Galway city but I would like to assure him that that statement is not correct.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not ask the Deputy any questions.  I told the Deputy that it was not correct to say that ten posts would be lost in Galway city and that he should ensure that his facts are correct before he makes such statements.</P>
      <P>In line with the approach adopted in 1987 the Minister for Education is again emphasising to vocational education committees the need to accord priority to particular services.  In particular, services designated for priority are: (a) the maintenance of essential second level school services including the administration of the school transport scheme; (b) junior and senior traveller centres; and (c) vocational preparation and training and middle level technician programmes.</P>
      <P>These priorities are indicative of our concern to ensure that, despite the need to effect economies, this Government are committed to ensuring that the burden of adjustment does not fall on the disadvantaged, that there is adequate school provision for our young people and that training opportunities are available for those who wish to avail of them.</P>
      <P>The policy of the Government in regard to the educational needs of disadvantaged groups is described in the <i>Programme for National Recovery,</i> section IV, paragraphs 15 to 19.  As stated in that programme, there is a range of measures in place to assist disadvantaged groups.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should mention that even though it has been necessary to limit expenditure, we have not curtailed provision which has been made for disadvantaged groups. Indeed, our purpose is to develop the provision made and to ensure that it is co-ordinated and made more effective. Out of the 200 or so posts for remedial education in the post-primary sector, about 100 have been allocated to the <Col N="1997" /> vocational education sector and this provision has been preserved.  In addition to that provision, another 41 ex-quota posts have been allocated to the vocational education sector, taking special account of the needs of disadvantaged pupils and this provision has been preserved as well. We have also provided 26 special resource teacher posts to VECs in order to assist them to make special provision for mildly mentally handicapped pupils and it is intended to extend this scheme as required so that there is full continuity of provision between primary and post-primary levels for such pupils.</P>
    <P>Our three pilot curriculum projects dealing with the transition from school to work life, based on the curriculum centres in Dublin, Shannon and Galway, have just completed their pilot phase and the results are being disseminated at present.  Each of these projects has contained important elements which focused on the needs of the disadvantaged.  Of these I might mention the Dublin Inner City junior cycle school certificate course which was concerned with developing basic competencies in communication, personal and social development and in applied subject areas such as metalwork, crafts, woodwork, etc.  Similarly the Shannon Centre developed an alternative programme at senior cycle with a view to encouraging pupils to remain at school and much of the work of the Galway project was concerned with developing alternative curricula in areas such as technology, working world, community action etc.  I would say to Deputy Higgins that we would certainly like to have the name of the teacher who does not have wood for his workworking requirements.  We will ensure that this is not the position.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. F. Fahey Mr. F. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>I simply mention briefly some aspects of the overall scheme of projects and draw attention to the fact that full information on all of these projects is being disseminated through seminars and booklets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1998" /> It is not proposed to leave matters at that, various vocational education committee schemes have begun already to make proposals to adopt aspects of the pilot work and we look forward to supporting further development work which should commence in the near future.  I would emphasise that vocational education committees were asked in 1987 to identify priority areas to be financed by VECs, and they are being requested to do so again in relation to their 1988 allocations.</P>
    <P>However, I believe that what we must do in tackling the complex problem of disadvantage is to develop a co-operative approach by all the agencies involved at local and national level.  The implemention of the social guarantee in which education and the various manpower and training services of FÁS play their part is having a direct impact on the least qualified young people and is improving their abilities to compete for existing jobs.  My Department are working with the Department of Labour directly in order to develop a fully co-ordinated approach at both national and local levels so that the resources we have available to us will be deployed effectively for the most deprived young people, who are referred to as Priority Group 1 young people.  In addition, the allocation of resources from the lottery funds to our youth services, some of which will be channelled through VECs, will assist in the development of out-of-school provision.</P>
    <P>The Minister is committed to the future of vocational education and is keen to ensure that any cuts will be made in consultation with the people involved.  This has been and will continue to be the case. Every possible opportunity is being taken to ensure that the difficulties caused by the inevitable cuts will be kept to a minimum. It is particularly significant that the vocational teachers have had an opportunity to meet the Taoiseach so that their views can be brought to the highest level. I am quite confident that those views are being taken on board very carefully by both the Minister and the Taoiseach.  I would be very concerned at any serious <Col N="1999" /> restriction in vocational education, despite the inevitability of cuts.</P>
    <P>Deputy Higgins made some serious exaggerations in relation to the school building programme and I must take issue with some of his statements.  It is not correct to say that the school building programme has been halted and that there is an embargo on all new building, extensions and repairs, other that emergency repairs.  The Government, in pursuance of their policy to limit Government expenditure as part of their economic programme for national recovery, decided to curtail their capital provision for second level schools.  They did not, however, terminate the programme for those schools.  They merely deferred those elements of it which could prudently be postponed without doing damage to the overall programme.</P>
    <P>I readily agree with Deputy Higgins when he talks about the prefab accommodation to be found in vocational schools throughout the country.  I have felt very strongly about this matter in recent years.  I do not wish to be political about this problem but in County Galway we have had no new school building since 1981, with the exception of two small extensions to vocational schools.  There are seven vocational schools with diabolical prefab accommodation.  It is not quite fair of Deputy Higgins to point the finger in this direction as if he were immune from responsibility.  Government Deputies and Senators who supported the previous administration were completely and utterly neglectful of the vocational education sector in County Galway, particularly in regard to the school building programme.  I am, therefore, left with a huge problem on my hands at a time&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Deputy Higgins was chairman of a party who participated in a Government which spent a significant amount of money, mostly in the secondary sector.  I could reel off a list of secondary colleges in County Galway which would include St. Jarlath's, Garbally College, the college in Portumna and the college in Woodford.  Yet this Deputy can talk about the state of the vocational sector while the Government which he supported built two miserable extensions to vocational schools in County Galway. Let us not have this hogwash from Deputy Higgins night after night as if he himself had no responsibility whatever in politics in the past few years.</P>
      <P>The sum of £21 million was initially provided in the estimates to ensure the continuance of the capital programme at the reduced level.  This was increased in the budget to £23 million.  In making available the additional allocation, the Minister for Finance specified that it would be devoted mainly to school buildings in rural areas.  I am glad to say that the vast bulk of that money will be made available to the vocational and community sectors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope what I have said indicates that this Minister and this Government are committed to the future of vocational education.  My personal view is that the most important sector of education at present is the vocational sector.  I have no doubt about it, although I have been a secondary school teacher myself.  The future of education is dependent on the vocational sector.  My personal view is that we must have rationalisation, taking into account changing circumstances.  We now have a situation where the same set of conditions apply to secondary and vocational education.  We must get away from some of the ridiculous situations which exist in small towns where we have a vocational school, a convent school and a secondary school all competing with great gusto for the dwindling number of students in their catchment areas and with one school looking for an extension <Col N="2001" /> while rooms are lying idle in another.  A vocational teacher told me this week that one school is offering free trips to young people in order to get them into the school as first years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;conscious of the special role played by vocational, community and comprehensive schools in the education system particularly as it affects the disadvantaged young person, calls on the Government to convene a meeting of the Central Review Committee under the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> in order to examine the implications of the decision to increase the pupil teacher ratio in that sector in the context of the statement in the Programme at section IV, paragraph 15 `that the burden of adjustment does not fall on the disadvantaged' and that such examination should take place within the existing overall public expenditure provision for 1988.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome this opportunity to debate the difficulties which face the vocational, community and comprehensive schools as a result of the Government's proposal to disimprove the pupil-teacher ratio to 20:1 from September 1988.  It has been the publicly stated position of Fine Gael since the 1988 Estimates were announced last October, a few days after the publication of the <i>Programme for National Recovery,</i> that the proposed worsening of pupil-teacher ratios in both the primary <Col N="2002" /> and vocational sectors was unjustifiable and should be reviewed within the Government's overall spending Estimates. Indeed, while Fine Gael have welcomed the long overdue conversion of Fianna Fáil to financial responsibility, we have reserved the right to object to certain proposals which we believe are wrong.  Therefore, our amendment gives the Government and the Minister for Education an opportunity to reopen the question of the cuts in the staffing of vocational schools within the monitoring system which they established in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> because in our view it conflicts with the clearly stated aim of that programme.  We hope the initiative we have taken in this respect will lead to a change of heart and a reversal of this very damaging proposal.</P>
    <P>In talking about convening a meeting of the central review committee I want to emphasise that we believe that meeting should be called with great speed, if possible within the next week or so, because at present a great threat hangs over the vocational, community and comprehensive schools.  There is a great deal of fear and confusion.  The mechanism is already established and therefore there is no need for new structures.  What we need is for that review committee to be convened to discuss this issue.</P>
    <P>The week before last when the Taoiseach was answering questions from the leader of The Workers' Party on the workings of the central review committee I asked him if that review committee had ever been asked to address or had addressed the subject of the vocational school pupil-teacher ratio.  To my surprise he was able to tell me the subject had never been brought up or discussed by the review committee.  I found this surprising in view of the fact that the social partners are all parties to that programme and in particular I was very surprised that the trade union movement had not sought to bring this matter up at that committee.  I will speak a little bit more about this later on.</P>
    <P>Let me put our position in context.  I was very glad to hear Deputy Higgins's speech this evening, which I would not <Col N="2003" /> describe, as the Minister of State unfortunately described it, as being hogwash but rather as a most thoughtful input to this debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. F. Fahey Mr. F. Fahey">

    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>We will not argue about that.  I am glad the Minister is withdrawing that word.  The speeches of Deputy Mac Giolla and Deputy Kemmy were made with the utmost concern and sincerity for this sector.  They feel and I feel that at a time of recession and a time of very high unemployment and great economic difficulties for so many people, education should be used as an instrument of social change.  That is how we should regard education at a time like this.  It has a most important role to play in giving a better chance to young people who start out life with a great range of handicaps &mdash; socially, sometimes intellectually and economically.  We can give young people a better chance through the education system providing they have the schools to go to, that they have the teachers to teach them, that they have the means of arriving at those schools through the transport system and that they have a curriculum which is in keeping with the kind of potential they can develop themselves.</P>
      <P>We have to look &mdash; unfortunately, we need to look all of the time &mdash; at our unemployment statistics.  We find stated in them again and again that the biggest single group among the unemployed, in particular the long term unemployed, are the least educated people in our society, the people who have spent the least amount of time in the education system, the people who leave the system at the first possible opportunity.  The vocational sector is doing enormous work in combating that handicap.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There have been responses to new demands and new perceived needs in recent years and I was very glad that the vocational preparation and training courses were brought in during my time <Col N="2004" /> as Minister.  I am also glad that the practical element of the vocational sector has gone from strength to strength and in a few moments I will take up the Minister of State on the selective quotation he used from the Green Paper.  The provision of schools in the vocational sector was going ahead and I was not aware that County Galway was experiencing such a problem.  I must say I was sorry to hear that.  Perhaps it is not quite as badly off as some of the other counties.</P>
    <P>The school transport system for needy families is in place.  There were and I hope still are many moves to reform the curriculum in order to make it more relevant to the wide range of the needs of these young people.  As the Minister of State and Deputy Higgins mentioned their own local areas, allow me to mention my home county of Wicklow where, interestingly enough, 50 per cent of the young people in our schools are being educated through the vocational system which is astonishingly higher than the national average of 25 per cent.  The vocational education system had some extraordinary achievements in that county and, as the Minister is well aware, there was an enormous march in Athlone on 31 January in which an enormous number of County Wicklow parents featured because of that county's very large interest in vocational education.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>There was, indeed, but we will not go into that.  The Minister of State went into the history of vocational education in some detail and Deputy Higgins also referred to it.  Those vocational schools and much later the community and comprehensive schools were set up to meet a very definitely perceived need among young people for particular kinds of help to get through the system.  We have to look back to the thirties as being among the darker days of education, before we began to make strides in the provision of education for a wider section of the population.  Education, at a later level was reserved mostly for the solid <Col N="2005" /> middle and upper middle classes of the population.  That was very welcome and was brought about by the arrival and the development of the vocational sector.</P>
      <P>Nowadays our understanding of different kinds of aptitudes is better and there is a rejection of the concept of failure. This attitude permeates or should permeate the education system.  We recognise the mastery of technical subjects, the connection between hand and brain, as being extremely valid and important. Unfortunately, we have not advanced as far as the Minister of State implied when he gave a rather selective quotation from the Green Paper.  The Minister of State said that according to the Green Paper different types of schools are seeking to provide essentially the same education service and then said that according to the Green Paper up to the mid-sixties the voluntary secondary schools provided services at post primary level different in character and emphasis from each other. That was a selective reference.  I remind the Minister of State that the Government who brought out that Green Paper were as concerned as he is about the competition, difficulties and conflicts of interest between different kinds of second level schools.  I gather that the Minister of State in his concern spoke from the heart.  I felt I was in some sort of time warp, having so often stood on that side of the House and said the same thing.  The Minister of State must have come up against some of the great community problems I dealt with then.</P>
      <P>The Government who brought out that Green Paper, because they were well aware that the vocational and voluntary secondary system had not arrived at the point they were seeking, did not make the PTR the same in the vocational sector as in the voluntary secondary sector.  That was a very definite decision at that time. The Green Paper was an attempt to make sense of a second level system which has strengths and variations and schools competing in the same areas for different kinds of pupils and sometimes using questionable methods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not good to start rationalisation by disimproving all schools to a lower level. <Col N="2006" /> I point to some of the figures which I got in reply to a parliamentary question to the Minister for Education on the practical subjects take-up in vocational and secondary schools.  The number of schools providing woodwork at junior cycle is 35 per cent of secondary schools and 97 per cent of vocational schools. Metalwork is provided in 6.4 per cent of secondary schools and in 88.1 per cent of vocational schools.  Mechanical drawing which does not require the equipment of the other subjects, is provided in 45 per cent of secondary schools and in 96 per cent of vocational schools.  In each of those three categories the community comprehensive provision for those three facilities is way up, nearly at 100 per cent.</P>
    <P>When we proceed later to leaving certificate we have three subjects, engineering, technical drawing and building construction.  Engineering is provided in 4.6 per cent of secondary schools and in 78.4 per cent of vocational schools. Technical drawing, which does not require the equipment the other two subjects require, is provided in 33.7 per cent of secondary schools, in 95.9 per cent of vocational schools and in 98.3 per cent of community and comprehensive schools. Building construction is provided in 12.9 per cent of secondary schools, in 75.2 per cent of vocational schools and in 88.3 per cent of community and comprehensive schools.</P>
    <P>These figures speak for themselves in terms of how far we have come towards a general overall level of schools which provide a broad curriculum.  That is one of the main bases for our concern about this sudden decision in the 1988 Estimates to proceed along the lines proposed.  I have to reject the assertion from the Government side of the House that we are equalising a system.  We cannot equalise these two things.  If a room is full of heavy equipment and tools for building construction, for woodwork, for metalwork and for engineering, one cannot actually accommodate in that room the same number of pupils.</P>
    <P>A second feature touched on by various Deputies is the question of the selectivity or otherwise of vocational <Col N="2007" /> schools.  I do not want to attack the voluntary secondary sector because they are selective.  I know a huge number of voluntary secondary schools are not selective. However, the vocational schools do not select at all.  All of us in our clinics have had parents coming to us in despair. Their children have been running into educational problems because they are disruptive, because they are slow learners or because they have difficulties with teachers.  Time and again we have found that the principals and staff of the vocational schools make the maximum effort to readmit these young people and help them to get back into the system. This is not a bad time or place to pay a compliment to those people in the system who generously make such an effort and who open so many educational doors to young people who would not have had that opportunity anywhere else.  In former days those young people would never have entered the education system at second level at all.  They would simply have dropped out.</P>
    <P>The vocational schools have made great efforts to broaden the curriculum in their schools while keeping up the practical side, so that every young person whether his ambitions are academic or technical can be accommodated together comfortably in the one school.  I am sure the Minister would agree that we should proceed towards having that kind of school everywhere.  That is the ideal to be aimed for.  The way to progress down that road is not to make that combination so difficult as to discourage it and to cause schools to diversify away from that so that some schools will have to concentrate on the practical subjects only to the detriment of the other subjects and other schools will only have academic subjects. That is a most regrettable step, guaranteed to militate against the disadvantaged.</P>
    <P>I see that I have a time problem but I will have ten minutes tomorrow evening. As regards the Fine Gael amendment, we want to see a rapid and effective meeting of the central review committee.  It has been specified as a procedure in the <Col N="2008" /><i>Programme for National Recovery.</i>  This meeting should have this item on the agenda.  The proposal to disimprove the PTR at vocational, community and comprehensive schools should have been discussed before now.  I am astonished to hear that it was not.  It is in conflict with the statement in the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i>  Tomorrow evening in the few minutes I have left I will be able to read out to the House a document which I believe is a report on the progress of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> which, to my amazement again, does not mention this area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. MacSharry) Ray MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. MacSharry)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to make a number of amendments to the Agricultural Credit Act, 1978.  That Act is the principal legislation governing the operations of the Agricultural Credit Corporation. It deals with the objects, constitution, functions and financing of the ACC and with the various charges which may be taken, not just by the ACC but by other banks, on land and other property as security for loans.  Under the 1978 Act the ACC are limited to lending for the benefit of agriculture, horticulture or fisheries.  Before discussing the Bill I would like to review in general terms the development of the ACC.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The corporation, one of Ireland's earliest State-sponsored bodies, were established in 1927 to provide a specialised credit service to agriculture.  In particular it was intended that they should provide long-term credit to farmers and farm cooperatives, as this form of credit was not readily available from the commercial banks.  For many years the volume of business transacted by the ACC remained small mainly because of the traditional reluctance of farmers to <Col N="2009" /> borrow, a reluctance which was partly due to the poor profits in agriculture.</P>
    <P>By 1961, ACC's total assets were only £3.7 million while annual lendings were at the modest level of £0.8 million. However, there was a big change in agricultural investment in the mid-sixties, reflecting the improvement in the agricultural economy and the expectations generated by the prospect of entry into the European Economic Community.  At this time, the ACC started to promote themselves as a lending agency and, as business increased, a network of district offices was established.</P>
    <P>The growth in agricultural lending was given impetus by two pieces of legislation. The Agricultural Credit Act, 1961 increased the authorised share capital of the ACC, raised their borrowing limit, allowed them to engage in hire purchase lending and simplified the procedures for taking land as security for loans.  The Agricultural Credit Act, 1965 enabled the ACC to take deposits from the public. ACC had up to then been funded by advances and equity from the Exchequer. This new source of funding enabled ACC to expand their lending without drawing on the Exchequer.  As a result, annual lending grew to £4.9 million in 1965 and £17.5 million in 1972.  Thereafter, with the impetus given to farming by EC membership, lending increased rapidly.  New lending in the seventies peaked in 1978 at £132 million while by the end of the decade the ACC's total assets stood at £394 million.</P>
    <P>The general economic problems of the eighties, high interest rates and an increasingly restrictive Common Agricultural Policy brought about a decline of both income and confidence within the agricultural sector.  This decline has had its effect on the ACC.  New lending business fell to a low of £85 million in 1983, although it has picked up since then, reaching £162 million in 1986.  However, the increase in loan business in recent years has been accounted for by a substantial increase in business with the corporate food processing sector and is not due to any resurgence in loan demand by farmers.  This increase in corporate <Col N="2010" /> lending business was one of the noteworthy responses of the corporation to diminishing profitability in their traditional area.</P>
    <P>The factors which led to a decline in demand for credit by farmers also gave rise to difficulties with loan repayments and the consequent need for increased provisions against bad debts which, in turn, also adversely affected the corporation's profitability.  The bad weather of 1985 and 1986 further exacerbated these difficulties.  The need for increased profitability is the principal reason behind the Bill at present before the House.</P>
    <P>There are three main provisions in the Bill.  First, it is proposed that ACC should be empowered to lend to the non-agricultural area.  Secondly, it is proposed to increase from £20 million to £35 million the statutory limit on ACC's share capital. Finally, it is proposed to increase from £10 million to £25 million the limit on the amount of loans in respect of which the Minister for Finance may guarantee the corporation against losses.  I will deal with each of these provisions in turn.</P>
    <P>Section 2 of the Bill is divided into two parts, the first of which sets out the banking activities in which the ACC may engage on a universal basis subject to such conditions as shall be determined by the Minister for Finance, after consultation with the Central Bank.  This, therefore, is the provision which removes the restriction, contained in section 8 (1) (a) of the 1978 Act, of ACC's lending activities to the agricultural sector.  The second part of section 2 limits the amount of non-agricultural lending which the ACC may do to 20 per cent of their business with the agricultural sector, or to such lesser amount as may be determined by the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>There are a number of reasons for the proposal to permit ACC to engage in non-agricultural lending.  New loan business will reduce the corporation's dependence on one particular sector &mdash; in this case a sector which is prone to cyclical peaks and troughs &mdash; and will improve profitability.  The expansion of ACC's lending powers should also result in the corporation's becoming more attractive <Col N="2011" /> to the general public as a deposit-taking institution since, other things being equal, people tend to deposit money with institutions who can lend to them should the need arise.  An increase in small deposits from the general public should both increase profitability and, in the long term, permit a reduction in lending rates.</P>
    <P>ACC's move into non-agricultural lending would be in line with the general trend in other European countries.  The French bank, Credit Agricole and the Dutch Rabobank provide two outstanding examples of agricultural banks which have diversified without any diminution of their service to agriculture.</P>
    <P>I should say at this point that I am under no illusions about the immediate effect of this proposed new activity by the ACC, nor indeed are the ACC themselves. It will not transform the ACC's profitability overnight.  I will be concerned to ensure that ACC should move cautiously until adequate experience has been gained in this new area and my Department will be monitoring the situation closely.  I have already outlined the provisions in the Bill designed to ensure that non-agricultural lending by the corporation is strictly controlled.  The fact that the Minister for Finance will have the power not only to control the amount of non-agricultural lending within the 20 per cent limit specified in this Bill but also to lay down such conditions as he considers appropriate will provide an adequate safeguard to ensure that ACC will always be in a position to meet the demand for agricultural credit.</P>
    <P>I know that the concerns which I have expressed are shared by the ACC board and management and I, therefore, am confident that this venture will be successful. With the safeguards provided and with the long term potential for lower lending rates to farmers, I am also confident that the provisions of this Bill will be of benefit to ACC's core customers &mdash; the farmers of Ireland.</P>
    <P>There is also another important dimension to this aspect of the legislation.  The opportunity to develop a completely new business area will provide a significant <Col N="2012" /> morale boost for the management and staff of ACC who have in recent years been experiencing a decline in their core agricultural business which, in turn, has resulted in a large reduction in staff numbers. I have no doubt that the management and staff will welcome and rise to the challenge of developing profitable new business which this Bill provides.</P>
    <P>I will now refer to the second amendment which is contained in section 4 of the Bill.  The extension of ACC's lending powers was the original purpose behind this Bill but, because the limit on the corporation's share capital has been reached, I am taking the opportunity to ask the House to increase the limit from £20 million to £35 million.</P>
    <P>Section 5 of the Bill provides for an increase from £10 million to £25 million in the amount of loans in respect of which the Minister for Finance may guarantee the corporation against losses; the existing limit has been reached in this case also as a result of guarantees of £4 million and £6 million given in respect of the 1984 and 1986 accounts respectively to supplement the corporation's bad debt provisions.  To date no Exchequer money has had to be paid on foot of these guarantees given to the ACC.</P>
    <P>I hope I have adequately explained the purposes of this Bill.  If Deputies have any problems with the Bill I shall endeavour to deal with these in my reply to the debate.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill for the approval of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I welcome the Bill in so far as it goes, but it does not go far enough.  I see no difficulty in Fine Gael supporting the provisions of the Bill.  The Minister has outlined the background to the ACC and I will take a moment to pay tribute to the work the ACC have done over the years.  When it was impossible for farmers to get credit from the main lending agencies, the ACC filled a gap in the financial markets and provided the credit that allowed farming to expand.  It was necessary at the time <Col N="2013" /> and it benefited not only individual farmers but agriculture in general and, consequently, the country.</P>
      <P>I appreciate the recent difficulties that have occurred.  Farming is no longer the profitable activity it was in the late seventies and early eighties.  There has been a downturn in profitability and a bad run of weather in the past few years and there is a difficulty of declining land values. This combination, and lack of confidence in the industry, has given rise to arrears and bad debts.  I do not want to recite the problems of the ACC in the late seventies when land prices rocketed sometimes to an excessive £3,000 an acre and subsequently declined.  I do not want to recite the problems of the ACC in regard to bad debts and arrears.  I do not want to apportion blame for decisions that were taken.  The ACC were no worse and no better than any of the banking institutions in so far as they provided money for land prices which in retrospect were seen to be exorbitant and now there are bad debts.  I do not want to dwell further on that but it seems that the usual Bill that comes into the House to increase the share capital of semi-State companies normally increased them along the lines of these limits.  I have no problem with the increases announced here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, the extra provision which the Minister is seeking to guarantee the corporation against losses seems to be quite high.  They go from £10 million to £25 million in this area and this indicates how serious are the bad debts.  The most recent report I had an opportunity to look at &mdash; I am sure the Minister has more recent information &mdash; is the 1985 report in which the provision for bad debts was £6.3 million.  I would like the Minister to bring us up to date with the provision for bad debts in the year ending 1987.  It seems the Minister is being prudent in seeking to raise the ceiling on the guarantee from £10 million to £25 million but it pinpoints the difficult situation which the ACC have been facing, are still facing as a result of bad debts and a difficulty in getting in payments due which have <Col N="2014" /> not yet been assigned to the bad debt category.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to give us more information about the up-to-date situation in the ACC, first on the bad debts side and then on the difficulties of collecting repayments due at ACC offices all around the country.  I am sure this figure is very significant although it would not yet be in the bad debt category.</P>
    <P>The new proposals to enable the ACC to develop into the non-farming area are welcome.  Obviously one response for any financial institution operating in an nonprofitable area is to expand into profitable areas.  The provisions in section 2 will enable the ACC to operate, with the permission of the Minister in the normal areas in which banks operate.  I have a doubt about whether they should be operating in the home mortgage area but, as I understand it, the section will be subject to consultations between the Minister and the Central Bank and it will be up to the Minister to determine, from time to time, which of the portfolios on this section will be made available to the ACC.  It does not necessarily mean that as soon as this Bill becomes law all the facilities will be available immediately to the ACC but I would like the Minister to clarify that.</P>
    <P>There is one omission from this portfolio of projected new business available to the ACC which the Minister should consider.  The Minister is probably aware of the Killanin report, the report of the commission of inquiry into the thoroughbred horsebreeding industry.  One of the recommendations of that was that the 1978 ACC Act would be amended to facilitate the bloodstock industry by bringing about a situation whereby the asset value of bloodstock could be used as collateral against borrowing.  To do this the primary Act would have to be amended.  It is a pity the Minister has not used this occasion to take on board one of the main recommendations of the Killanin report.  I would ask the Minister to consider it between now and Report Stage.</P>
    <P>For the sake of Deputies who are not <Col N="2015" /> here but who will read the record subsequently it would be worth while reading into it the recommendation of the Killanin committee.  By way of background, there is a private company called Weatherby's with headquarters in England which keeps a general studbook and registers thoroughbreds at the moment.  I now quote from pages 42-44, paragraphs 3.3.1 to 3.3.7:</P>
    <P>3.3.1 Weatherbys' system is not designed to create a central register of ownership, which could provide title acceptable to banks in financing the breeding industry.  In practice, animals are often owned by syndicates of several individuals.  Weatherbys' do not document ownership details.  Without an ownership register, banks are reluctant to accept the horse as collateral for loans.</P>
    <P>3.3.2 The situation in the United States with regard to finance is more advanced.  The New York Jockey Club keeps a central register of ownership of all thoroughbreds, both in training and breeding.  Under the laws of individual States, financial institutions can register debts against a particular animal.  Banks thus have greater security for extending finance.</P>
    <P>3.3.3 The registration of ownership details, in an international industry where changes in ownership can be frequent, presents understandable practical difficulties for Weatherbys.</P>
    <P>3.3.4 The development of the commercial breeding sector is however dependent on access to finance.  In a situation where top-class stallions can cost many millions of pounds, sole reliance on the funds of breeders or money borrowed against their personal assets can be a major restriction.  Every effort should therefore be made to move to a situation where the bloodstock itself could be pledged as security for bank finance.  The Commission believes that the Irish banks would be willing to increase their involvement in the Irish breeding industry if progress <Col N="2016" /> could be made in the matter of title and the registration of charges.</P>
    <P>3.3.5 Finance for bloodstock is currently governed by the Agricultural Credit Act, 1978.  This Act contains certain provisions (see Appendix 13) which restrict normal supply of finance by financial institutions to the bloodstock industry.  The main relevant sections are summarised as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash;In order for the lender to give an effective loan under the Act, the borrower must own or have the use of land.</P>
    <P>&mdash;The charge must be registered in the Circuit Court in each area in which the borrower owns land &mdash; rather than centrally.</P>
    <P>&mdash;Access to the Circuit Court registers is limited to certain persons.</P>
    <P>&mdash;The borrower can transfer ownership of the charged stock after giving seven days notice to the lender.</P>
    <P>&mdash;Enforcement rights under the Act are unclear.  It is not certain whether a lender can appoint a receiver, act himself and, or serve on the sheriff an order in the prescribed form.</P>
    <P>Hence, there are restrictions on the type of borrower who can qualify under the Act, the registration system is prohibitively cumbersone and cannot create a presumption of &ldquo;constructive notice&rdquo; of the existence of a charge and thus third parties can obtain good title to the assets being offered as security before the lender is aware of the transaction....</P>
    <P>3.3.6 To remedy the situation, it will be necessary to amend the 1978 Act to facilitate owners of bloodstock to grant specific charges over thoroughbred assets to any lender.  Individuals and companies, whether landowners or not, should be treated equally as regards ability to give effective security. The distinction between &ldquo;recognised&rdquo; (the Agricultural Credit Corporation and most banks) and <Col N="2017" />&ldquo;non-recognised&rdquo; lenders at present incorporated in the 1978 Act should be revised at least for bloodstock lending, where it prevents full development of the market for the provision of finance. The definition of thoroughbred bloodstock for loan purposes will need to include not only specific horses, but shares in such horses and rights to nominations.</P>
    <P>3.3.7 An essential feature of any legislative amendment will be the provision of a central register of bloodstock mortgages of which everyone would be deemed to have notice.  In the absence of such a register, it will always be possible for a third party to obtain good title to mortgaged assets which constitute the lenders security. Without good security, loans would be prohibitively expensive or unavailable.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that with that recommendation on the table and with the traditional areas in which the Agricultural Credit Corporation are becoming increasingly more unprofitable, this would be an area where the ACC could develop quite logically to the great benefit of the country.  I ask the Minister to have a look at this to see if it would be taken on board on Committee Stage.  The nature of the amendments would be reasonably significant but, as he is allowing the ACC to develop in areas outside of agriculture, horticulture and fisheries, this proposition is worth exploring.  I do not think the Minister's colleagues in Government will introduce a second Bill to enable this recommendation of the Killanin report to be implemented.  It would be proper that it would occur now. That is an aside from the main business of the Bill but it is worth saying and the idea is worth looking at.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer now to an area which I think is of more importance in the overall context of the ACC.  There are a number of State banks, for want of a better phrase, in the country now.  We have the ACC, the ICC and the Trustee Savings Banks &mdash; Cork and Limerick are amalgamated and Dublin and Waterford <Col N="2018" /> are amalgamated.  The Trustee Savings Banks, in the final analysis, are underpinned by the Minister for Finance directly.  We also have Fóir Teoranta. Fóir Teoranta is the State rescue bank and I would like to leave that out of the discussion at this stage.</P>
    <P>There are four banking institutions which are either directly in the hands of the State as incorporated semi-State organisations or, alternatively, where the losses are underpinned and guarantees of 100 per cent are available and provided by the Minister for Finance in the case of debts as in the case of the Trustee Savings Banks.</P>
    <P>I know the Government policy in relation to State agencies.  The Government have brought forward policies to amalgamate quite a number of State agencies.  This area should be seriously looked at.  One of the difficulties facing the ACC now as it expands into new areas is that it will lack the expertise in the house market to get involved in the new activities.  People who, at a glance over a fence, could assess the value of an acre of land or the value of 15 bullocks will not be that good in the house market because they have not got the expertise. They will not be that good either at assessing commercial propositions or industrial propositions in the non-food area.  I am not taking from the expertise which is available in the ACC but it has been running on certain tracks for a long, long time.  I do not think we should legislate for the ACC if we are sure that a consequence of it will be that we will have to bring more staff in to work the areas of profitability while people who are in the traditional areas of expertise would be under used.</P>
    <P>There is a very strong case to be made for amalgamating the ICC, the Trustee Savings Banks and the ACC.  As I said, Fóir Teoranta is a horse of a different colour and I do not think the State rescue bank should be involved in the same corporate unit as commercial lending agencies. I do not think there is any logical reason now that the State should operate or underpin a multiplicity of lending agencies who, in their scope and <Col N="2019" /> expertise, are restricted.  If they were brought together there are people in the ACC who would be competent in agriculture and in food processing, in land and in livestock and there are people in the ICC who are highly experienced in commercial lending.  From my experience as Minister for Industry and Commerce I know that in the ICC there are people who could assess to the highest international standard a commercial project or a proposal where venture capital would be required.</P>
    <P>The Trustee Savings Banks are involved in the high street end of the market.  They are involved in house loans, car loans, overdrafts, ATM machines and the normal provision of credit like any of the other commercial banks.  They all have their own niche in the market and if we were to expand their activities there is a very strong case for bringing them all together.  While each one was confined to a particular niche in the market we needed three or four.  If they are all to be expanded and if they are all to be allowed to provide a range of financial activities, the first option that should be looked at is that of bringing them all together.</P>
    <P>I do not think the present position is in line with the Minister's attitude to other semi-State organisations or that it is cost effective.  It is not for the benefit of the institutions or the public that they should all retain their separate identities.  I ask the Minister to look at that and to give a commitment that he will have the situation examined with a view to bringing together the financial institutions I have named, to rationalise them and then let them provide a portfolio of services right across the spectrum and compete with the AIBs and the Bank of Ireland of this world.</P>
    <P>I never have ideological hangups about these matters.  I cannot see why one large State bank, bringing together these institutions, could not compete on commercial terms under the control of the Central Bank on an absolutely level playing pitch with the Bank of Ireland, Allied Irish Banks and with any of the other big <Col N="2020" /> players in the market.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would like to thank the Minister for his very full explanation here tonight.  I will enumerate briefly my concerns again.  First, why is the ceiling on the guarantee gone up by £15 million and, secondly, can the Minister give an indication of the present bad debts situation and the present difficulties in collecting payments due to the ACC?  I would like if he would respond either now, or later, to my proposal that the financial institutions, which the State controls or underpins, should be brought together to provide the extension of services which is being proposed for the ACC in section 2 of the Bill.  Finally, what is in terms of the Bill a single issue, would the Minister respond to my suggestion that the proposal of the Killanin report regarding the bloodstock industry be incorporated in the Bill on Committee Stage or would he at least have it examined and get reaction to it?</P>

      <P>Unlike the last speaker, I must say I am most unhappy with this Bill and it is my party's intention to vote against it.  We are not, I should tell you, calling a division tonight because we think Members of the House should have a more civilised occasion on which to divide on the issue.  It is my view that this Bill should not be voted through and certainly it should not be voted through in the context of the speech the Minister has made in support of its being read a second time.</P>
      <P>I am not happy at all that the full circumstances behind the promotion of this Bill in this House have been explained to us.  We are in early 1988 a quarter way through the year and the report of the Agricultural Credit Corporation in respect of 1987 has not yet been made available to this House.  Earlier today I may have unfairly given Deputy Noonan the wrong report in the Library&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but I found the <Col N="2021" /> 1986 report subsequently.  It shows a provision for bad debts in the region of £10.6 million.  I want to be assured by the Minister that the situation now is not significantly worse.  It is my belief that the situation deteriorated badly in 1987 and it is also my belief that the timing of the Bill, coming in before the accounts have been made known to this House, is not entirely accidental.  I believe it is a mistake for us to embark on the process of capitalising further or making further provision for the capitalisation of a semi-State body at a time when we are not aware of the up-to-date financial position.</P>
      <P>It seems to me that to come before the Parliament of a sovereign country with a proposal to spend more money or to make it possible to invest more money in any business, be it a lending institution or a commercial institution, without an up-to-date prospectus on the company's situation, without a certificate of fitness in corporate terms as to the company's affairs and without clear indications from chartered accountants or auditors of the company or others to the effect that the company is in a viable state and is worthy of support is wrong.  To come before this House looking for a licence to invest more money in it in those circumstances is wrong.  I believe it is not correct for this House to embark on a Bill of this kind on the blind when we do not know the outturn for 1987 in relation to that particular company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe their situation has worsened. The trend is very much against them. Their bad debt provision went up from £6.3 million in 1985 to £10.6 million in 1986 and I believe it has deteriorated further in 1987.  I believe we are entitled to be told if that is the case.  I find it impossible to believe &mdash; and this is what worries me about the Minister's speech &mdash; that he is not aware of the total situation in relation to the 1987 accounts.  I find it difficult to believe that the accounts of this semi-State body could not be put together in a reasonable shape or form for the consideration of this House on this measure tonight and that we should not know up until last December the state <Col N="2022" /> of this company's affairs.  In that context I believe they will show a further deterioration in the balance sheet.</P>
    <P>I believe it is simply not right to say that the powers of the Minister to increase the State's right to guarantee the debts or loans of the company or the power of the Minister to make further investments are just incidental powers which are being sought at this stage.  Even if they were incidential powers, I would want to know the financial state of the company before agreeing to these powers being given.  I do not believe they are incidental powers. I believe it is a very significant thing to say of a company that you propose to increase their authorised share capital by £15 million, from £20 million to £35 million. That would almost double their share capital.  I want to know in that context what case the company have to make for an increase in their capitalisation.  What right have that company to seek from this House permission to increase their capitalisation by another £15 million? Why does the company need those moneys?  Why should we give the Minister, as a matter of discretion, the right to subscribe those moneys as capital to that company at present?</P>
    <P>No argument has been made for any of those propositions.  In fact, two or three cursory lines have been thrown to us at the tail end of the Minister's speech on this issue.  If there was absolute certainty that the company are profitable, are not going to bring in a loss for 1987 and are absolutely fine and in sound condition that would be one thing.  I would resent it but I could not complain too much about it.  But if it is the case that the company's profitability has been declining and that their provision for bad debts have been increasing and the earnings per share have been going down noticeably over the past three years, then, in those circumstances I believe it is only correct to say &ldquo;no&rdquo; to a proposition to increase their capitalisation, until such time as we have the evidence laid before us in this House that such funds not only are justifiable but are necessary.  There are plenty of other things to which sums <Col N="2023" /> of this kind could be applied.</P>
    <P>It is noteworthy that earnings per share in 1984 were 9.8p per share.  They went down to 6.5p per share in 1985 and 1.1p per share in 1986.  I do not know if there will be any earnings on the State's capital this year.  Perhaps there will be, but perhaps not.  Certainly I think anybody who is being asked to invest his or her savings in a particular share should know the up-to-date position.  You could not float shares on any Stock Exchange without informing the potential purchasers as to what the situation was at the last year's end.  No company operating in the private sector could possibly seek to raise capital in those circumstances.</P>
    <P>I believe it is time in this House we began looking for the directors of this company to be presented before this House, at a Committee of this House if necessary &mdash; perhaps at the Joint Committee on Commercial State-Sponsored Bodies &mdash; before we go on to consider any further Stages of this Bill to find out the state of their affairs.  I do not see why any of us should feel competent or justified to make a decision as to further capitalisation of this firm on the blind, on the hazard, without any knowledge as to whether the company's affairs have significantly deteriorated further, when the trend was very much downwards on the last occasion we received a report on their affairs, the 1986 accounts.  I believe we are making a mistake if we think we should in these circumstances give this company increased capital.</P>
    <P>The other main purpose of the Bill is to extend the area of operations of the Agricultural Credit Corporation.  The Minister gave a potted history of the Agricultural Credit Corporation in his speech.  However, one thing that strikes me on reviewing the history of the corporation is that, when they were established in 1927, it was proposed that they should be a body in which the commercial banking sector of the Irish Free State, as it then was, would play a very significant role.  The State's role in the Agricultural Credit Corporation <Col N="2024" /> was always envisaged as merely a co-ordinating and minority role when the legislation was presented to the Dáil originally. In that sense it is similar to the Industrial Credit Corporation, where again the State only come into the matter because it was the underwriter of public share issues where the public would not take up any of the shares.  In a sense the original concept of the Agricultural Credit Corporation, which was one where private capital and commercial interests would predominate, was by accident rather than by design set aside and it was not until 1942 that it was finally admitted this was to be a State body, totally funded and operated by the State and was not to be a joint effort with the private sector.</P>
    <P>The reason I mention all that is that in 1980 the Joint Committee on Commercial State-Sponsored Bodies produced their tenth report.  They did so in 1980 which, as Deputy Noonan has pointed out, was the end of a decade of considerable turmoil in Irish agriculture. The report of that committee makes instructive reading in a number of respects.  The one message which came across to me from reading it was that the Agricultural Credit Corporation was at that time considered to be at a crossroads. The then Oireachtas Joint Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies believed strongly that the corporation should be put through the hoops financially and forced to get their balance sheet into better nick &mdash; to use a colloquialism &mdash; by 1985.  When that programme of restructuring of their finances and getting their house in order was complete their future should be reviewed with possibly a radical change in their status in mind.</P>
    <P>The Irish Co-operative Organisation Society made submissions to that committee. They suggested that the ACC should, in some sense, be made part of a commercial merchant bank with emphasis on agriculture, in conjunction with other agricultural and foreign banking interests.  At that time the Joint Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies <Col N="2025" /> thought that, due to the state of the balance sheet of the Agricultural Credit Corporation, they were certainly in no position to be so transformed.  The directors of the company who testified before that committee gave their view that the ACC had a very different role and had to be transformed into the dominant force &mdash; to use their phrase &mdash; in agricultural lending in this State.  They also specified a programme of reform of the balance sheet of the ACC so that they would retain their profits, become more liquid and become, in general terms, more analogous to a bank in terms of their liquidity ratios, lending and so on. The question was then to be examined in 1985 as to whether or not they should be made subject to the control of the Central Bank and brought, so to speak, into the main stream of banking in this country.</P>
    <P>During the years 1980 to 1985 it seems to me, on examination of the reports of the Agricultural Credit Corporation, that the precise opposite took place.  They did not get their house in order.  They embarked on a strategy to become a deposit-taking institution, to become a dominant force in agricultural lending, to change the character of the corporation quite dramatically, which was the subject matter of a U-turn in 1985-86.  Very significant expenditures were made in expanding the number and location of offices and branches with particular reference to the Dublin area.  I know of one place in Merrion Row which I used to haunt before it was taken over by the ACC.  The best part of £1 million was spent on purchasing that premises and within four years it was closed and is now a burger joint again.  That is indicative of an expansion programme which went hopelessly wrong.  At the same time in 1986 there were very substantial cutbacks in staff.  The strategy of the ACC seems to have changed dramatically.</P>
    <P>We have not had in this House an up-to-date examination of the function of the Agricultural Credit Corporation.  I agree with Deputy Noonan that there is scope for a much more radical rethink of what this corporation is all about.  I do not believe they should be a narrow lending <Col N="2026" /> institution based on agriculture.  It does not follow that the answer is to broaden their lending base, as Deputy Noonan rightly pointed out.  It is very different to start lending money in competition with other institutions in different fields of credit from merely depending on a staff skilled in the field of agri-business lending.  It seems there is a mistaken notion that the solution to ACC's problem is to widen their field of activities. They have shed a very significant number of staff.  The chairman, as can be seen from his most recent reports, was looking for this kind of widening of their base but he was not asked to come before this House and justify the strategy which he set out.  I am against the strategy in question. It is not right that the ACC should go into competition with other lending institutions.  That is especially the case in view of the institution's record of lack of success in their own specialised area.  I do not believe that because you fail in a specialised area it follows that the answer is to dilute your specialty and broaden your field of activities.  That does not logically follow and neither does it make commercial sense.</P>
    <P>The Agricultural Credit Corporation have faced very difficult circumstances, many of which have not been of their own making.  It does not follow that they should be retained in their present state or that we should seek to alter them by widening their range of activities.  It seems it would be much more sensible to investigate Deputy Noonan's suggestion now rather than waste taxpayers' money. Now is the time to say, do we need an ACC, do we need a super-structure on a specialised activity which give credit for agriculture and agri-business or should we transfer those functions or amalgamate them with another body which is capable of sustaining them and at the same time has the expertise to carry on other functions?  I do not see why ACC should think that they have any expertise in the wider credit area.  It is naïve of us as a House, without any guarantee from the Minister, to think that they have this capacity and to say that we will allow them to expand into some other field, to <Col N="2027" /> go from credit dairying into credit tillage, without even for one minute querying whether they have the equipment, the expertise or the know how to do these things.  That kind of decision should not be put before this House without thought.  This House should not take that kind of decision in the context of a Bill. What was needed before now was a White Paper explaining why it was necessary for the ACC to change direction. What we needed above all, as custodians of the people's money or the lack of it, was an up-to-date report on this corporation and their prospects.</P>
    <P>I cannot see why we are being asked to increase the capital of a company and to expand their areas of operation when we are not told &mdash; it must be within the Minister's power to deliver this information, even on a provisional basis to this House &mdash; what the financial state of that corporation is now.  The figures must be there.  I do not see why a Minister moving a Bill to give rights to invest extra capital should not be in a position to tell us that in 1987 that institution made a loss, as I believe they did, but I may be wrong.  The trend certainly is towards their making a loss and I would like to know how big the loss was, where it was sustained, and to what extent, even now, their provision for bad debts is adequately reflected in their accounts.  I would like to know the accounting principles that underlie the provision for bad debts in their accounts and whether or not they are adequate.  It is all right to say that these things are done by auditors but they are done in accordance with certain auditing policies.</P>
    <P>I wonder if the Central Bank had free range to inspect the activities of the ACC would they be in a position to report on their profits and losses and to deal with their bad debts and doubtful debts in the way in which they have done in their accounts in recent years.  I am not sure of it.  I have a hunch they have not followed the practice the Central Bank would require of any bank under their aegis.  In those circumstances I think it is wrong to tell this House we should give them the <Col N="2028" /> authority to increase capitalisation.  If there were significant losses in 1987, is the House not entitled to know before we decide whether to capitalise this company further?  Are we not entitled to know what the ACC's state of health was in 1987, is the House not entitled to know before we decide whether to capitalise this company further?  Are we not entitled to know what the ACC's state of health was in 1987 before we tell the Minister he can give them an extra £15 million by way of capital investment? Any prudent responsible Deputy and Minister would have to satisfy himself or herself on these issues before they could make a decision on whether to support this Bill and the onus is on the Government to bring forward the evidence on which we are to be satisfied.</P>
    <P>Looking at the Minister's speech, which is remarkable for what it does not contain, there is not a single word about the performance of ACC in 1987.  The Minister has nominees on the board of that body and he must know what the state of the company's profitability was in December 1987.  The Minister should be able to assure the House the order, if not the exact pound and penny, of the general state of health of this company. I believe it will transpire that the company is not as healthy as it was in previous years and that the extra capitalisation and guarantee facilities now being sought are in anticipation of a worsening of this company's affairs.</P>
    <P>This Bill is a matter of some importance. I appreciate that by passing this Bill we do not actually give £15 million <i>ipso facto</i> to the ACC nor do we, by authorising the increase in the guarantee of that company's liabilities, actually worsen the taxpayers' position by the amount authorised by this Bill, but undoubtedly we do make it a matter of executive action and loosen the purse strings to allow another hand to go into it.  We should be as careful about loosening the purse strings as we would be if we were actually dispensing the money and applying it irrevocably because we will not be in a position to undo an executive decision of the Department of Finance to <Col N="2029" /> capitalise this company at a later date. If it becomes a matter of commercial necessity, of a matter of strong political importance to strengthen the creditwordiness of this company in view of a poor set of accounts for any particular year, I have no doubt that the extra powers we are conferring will be used very smartly to prop up the balance sheet of this company.  Therefore I am not satisfied the case has been made why that should be done.</P>
    <P>I re-echo Deputy Noonan's suggestion. The ICC &mdash; I am not sure if the Trustee Savings Bank should be brought into this operation &mdash; and the ACC were similar in concept originally and both were a disappointment to the Irish Free State Government when they were established. For some reason the private sector would not capitalise them and both companies specialised in certain areas. Anyone looking at the reports would accept that the ICC have been more successful than the ACC, but that is probably due to the more varied business they were authorised to carry out.  I believe those two bodies must be reviewed together to see if the State should be in the business of banking and whether the State should specialise in agricultural lending at a time when, looking at the prospects for agriculture in the European context, it is not an area into which capital should be committed.</P>
    <P>I am not satisfied with the idea of widening ACC.  An argument has not been made for that.  The argument is just as strong, and I think it should be given much more weight, for restructuring ACC and for examining fundamentally where they are going.  If that argument is just as strong, and if the evidence for carrying on as we are is as weak as the Minister's speech makes out, now is not the time to increase our liability in respect of this company or to send it on yet another strategy &mdash; not the 1980 strategy to which this House gave its assent &mdash; which could have disastrous results if it over extends this company's capacity, if it involves this company in business at which it is not adept, and if it is not <Col N="2030" /> successful in those areas.</P>
    <P>For all those reasons we are against this Bill and think it should not be given a Second Reading.  The evidence has not been brought before the House.  It is premature.  The Minister should have brought before the House a set of accounts for that company, a set of reasons setting out why this is the better option maybe referring to the option Deputy Noonan canvassed.  For all those reasons this Bill should be rejected at this stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this opprotunity to speak on this Bill which is to allow the Agricultural Credit Corporation to engage in lending outside the agricultural sector, to increase the share capital of the ACC and to increase the amount of the corporation's lending business which may be guaranteed by the Minister for Finance.  Generally we support the Bill and have few comments to make.</P>
      <P>Semi-State bodies come in for a predictable amount of criticism from those parties of the right who are politically opposed to the concept of State companies. They are frequently criticised for not being able to compete with private enterprise.  However, many members of the public are not aware of the restrictions placed on a number of the companies by successive Governments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Public enterprise has made a major contribution to the economic and social development of this country, but the attitude of successive Governments has often been a begrudging one.  In most cases public enterprises were established only when private enterprise had tried and failed, such as CIE and Irish Steel, or where private enterprise was unable or unwilling to invest the large amounts of money required for particular projects, such as the ESB.  Much attention has been focused on the taxpayers' money which it has been necessary to put into public companies, but little or no attention has been given to the huge amounts of taxpayers' money which have been <Col N="2031" /> thrown at private enterprise with little or no results.</P>
    <P>In the latest years for which figures are available, the total losses for 21 public enterprises after providing more than £400 million for financing charges were around £20 million.  This compares very favourably with the £213 million spent by the IDA on helping private enterprises, not to mention the £688 million spent by State bodies and agencies during 1986 on providing a variety of aids and subsidies mainly for private business.  The ACC have played a major role providing a comprehensive range of long, medium and short term credit facilities for farmers and the agri-business sector.  They have played a significant role in providing goahead farmers with capital to expand and develop and have been able to offer assistance to farmers when in difficulties. However, they have suffered from having had all of their eggs in the one basket and from having been totally dependent on the agricultural sector, rendering them vulnerable to fluctuations in farming. This was seen at its most dramatic in 1985 when many farmers were unable to meet repayments resulting from a succession of bad summers, when the ACC faced a major financial crisis.</P>
    <P>We welcome the fact that the provisions of this Bill will enable the ACC to expand and develop outside the agricultural sector which will allow them, by continuing to deal in a major way with agriculture, to diversify and have some protection against fluctuations in the agricultural sector.</P>
    <P>There is another State company, the Industrial Credit Corporation, whose objective is to promote economic growth through the provisions of a capital and financial service to the manufacturing and service sectors of our economy.  The question must be posed: will there be now a degree of overlapping between the ACC and ICC?  Is there not an argument to be advanced for merging the two corporations? Such a merger would result in a corporation of a significant size with a combined capital of more than £1,100 million and a combined annual turnover of approximately £140 million.  Such a <Col N="2032" /> corporation might form the basis on which a State bank could be developed, something to which we should be aspiring.</P>
    <P>The two main banks between them made huge profits of more than £100 million before tax last year.  Why should this profitable area be left to private enterprise?  Equally, why should the ACC and ICC be restricted to the less lucrative areas of lending money simply for agriculture and industrial development? Already the ACC have some 45 branches throughout the country which could form the basis of a network of branches for a State bank.  Clearly the Post Office Savings Bank would have a role to play in such a State bank, already having a huge network of branches countrywide.  There is an unprecedented level of dissatisfaction with the charges and level of services provided by the commercial banks.  I am sure there would be wide welcome for a move towards the development of a full State bank.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>In general terms I welcome the provisions of the Bill outlined by the Minister.  I particularly welcome the provision which will allow the ACC to lend in areas outside agriculture.  The expansion of the range and size of lending activities and clientele must be welcomed, with the proviso that the ACC can clearly demonstrate not only their commitment to the agricultural sector but also their ability to service efficiently their developmental needs, providing the best possible package of services to farmers to enable them to adapt and adjust to rapidly changing circumstances likely to continue in future years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the past the ACC have experienced difficulties.  As a corporation they found it difficult to adapt to the changing conditions of the last decade or so.  It is my belief that the next decade, indeed the next few years, will bring further rapid changes.  Those changes have been heralded already in the building societies sector and in other financial sectors.  The ACC must be in a position to change and adapt to the changing circumstances <Col N="2033" /> prevailing.  They must also be in a position to adapt to the possible consequences of the inception of the European open market by 1992.</P>
    <P>In common with other lending institutions they loaned large amounts of money in the seventies.  Then, when farmers hit a series of bad years and were unable to repay their loans, the ACC put many into receivership, taking out judgments against many others.  That was not the purpose for which the corporation was established.  It is my contention that they reacted too quickly, withdrawing their support, particularly to the family farmer at a time when they should have stuck with those family farms they had been supporting.  There were many instances of family farms being put into receivership, placing many in dire straits. In the past they adopted a very inflexible approach.  A better solution would have been to propose packages of low interest, long term loans to farmers in difficulty, especially family farms, using foreign currency available, where necessary, to restore the viability of such farms.</P>
    <P>The ACC tended to go for quick profits, which was not the ideology behind their formation.  The reason they did not make such profits was the inflexibility within the corporation itself coupled with a certain degree of financial inflexibility. If the ACC are to expand into other sectors, if the provisions of this Bill enable them to raise more funds through deposits and interest on loans, rendering them more efficient and flexible, then they are to be welcomed.  However, their primary function in funding maximum development in the agricultural sector should be a clear priority.  If they fail to meet their obligations the provisions of the Bill should be reviewed.  There is the danger that if agriculture forms part only of the ACC business they will pump in cash in the good years, withdrawing from that sector when the going gets rough, just as the other banks and institutions do at present.  I am glad to note the Minister has retained control and can review the provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The board must be comprised of <Col N="2034" /> people with financial and banking knowledge and experience, of people with a vested interest in the success of not just farming but the agricultural sector generally.  We want people on the board with their feet firmly on the ground with the commitment and patience to achieve long term results.  There was a certain degree of inflexibility on the part of the staff of ACC in the past.  ACC staff at local level must be able to understand and respond to the problems and needs of farmers.  There have been instances where either inflexibility or bureaucracy has caused concern for farmers.  The position of farmers who have difficulties in meeting repayments and who fall into arrears should be fully and carefully assessed in consultation with the farmers and a restructured arrangement should be achieved by agreement if at all possible. It is stupid and insensitive for the ACC to demand payment of all arrears before they will consider any restructuring. Any child with a basic mathematical knowledge knows that if a farmer had the cash to pay up all the arrears he would have no problems and no need for a restructuring of loans.</P>
    <P>One area I find difficult to come to terms with in relation to the ACC is the forward planning they indulged in, if they indulged in any, in the past.  An example of this is the office in Trim, County Meath, which was opened with a great flourish in the early eighties.  There was plenty of pomp and ceremony at that time but the office was closed down very quietly three to four years later, all in the name of rationalisation.  If planning was being done in a proper manner I cannot understood how this office could have been opened and closed in such a short space of time.  The office could have been of immense benefit to the south Meath, west Meath and north Kildare farmers as well as to depositors.  The ironic part of all of this is that, since the office was closed, a branch of the Allied Irish Banks has been opened and they are currently trading successfully.  The point I am making is that if the ACC cannot compete, their problems should be examined <Col N="2035" /> thoroughly and there should be a little more forward planning.</P>
    <P>There is another area I should like to touch on.  I understand that the percentage of money lent to the agri-business <i>vis-à-vis</i> the farming sector is very high.  While I am not against investment in the agri-business I would not like to see the ACC withdrawing from farming and going purely into the business sector because it is a farmers' bank first and foremost.  In relation to credit and loans, I suggest to the Minister that he might possibly set up regional credit committees where local people and local board members could get together so as to make the loan-making decision less centralised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. MacSharry) Ray MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. MacSharry)</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all I want to make a few general comments, to thank Deputies for their contributions and to deal with some of the points raised.  The major thrust of Deputy McDowell's contribution was the necessity for this legislation and that Deputies did not have information on it. This legislation was first published last November.  It is not something which just happened out of the blue, yesterday or the day before.</P>
      <P>A general point which was raised by a number of speakers was the question of ACC's performance in 1987.  The calendar year is the ACC's financial year also and it is normal for their accounts to be published in April or May.  That will happen again this year.  The main thrust of this Bill has been to allow the ACC to lend in other non-agricultural areas.  As was rightly said by Deputies, that has been asked for for a number of years.  It has been normal practice, during my 20 years on the scene, and I am sure long before that, when financial limits are being reached to seek the permission of the House to increase them.  No more and no less than that is being done in these two other provisions, along with the extension of the lending powers of the ACC to non-agricultural areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am grateful to Deputy Noonan for his welcome for the Bill.  I thank him for the kind words he said about the <Col N="2036" /> contribution made by the ACC and their staff generally throughout the country and the assistance they have given to the farming community.  Deputy Sherlock and others Deputies also said the same thing and I concur with them.  A question was raised by Deputy Noonan and Deputy McDowell about the bad debts provision for 1987.  This is not finalised as yet.  The AGM will be held in April or early May and then all of the details in relation to 1987 will be announced.  The bad debts provision for 1986 was £10.6 million.  That is the latest figure I have.</P>
    <P>A question was raised about the possibility of the collection of arrears.  It is not advisable or appropriate to give details in relation to that but every effort is made, has been made and will continue to be made to bring the arrears situation up to date.  Obviously, as has been the case &mdash; and I think people have complimented the ACC on this &mdash; when borrowers found themselves in difficulties, special arrangements were made and will continue to be made.  Nevertheless, there will have to be a tightening up generally of the payment of arrears, whether arrears to the ACC, taxation or whatever. When people talk about bad debt provisions, the necessity for the various increases in the financial limits and why this is necessary in the ACC, I think all Deputies will know that the major banks and financial institutions generally have been increasing enormously the amount of provisions for bad debts over the past number of years because of the difficulties they have experienced generally and the recession which existed and which we have all come through.</P>
    <P>A lot of the discussion by the three main speakers from the other side dealt with a merger between ACC, ICC and, as somebody said, the TSB &mdash; and somebody else said not the TSB.  There are advantages and disadvantages associated with a merger of organisations.  The final decision in each case has to be taken by balancing these, and there are quite a number of them.  This question has been thoroughly examined in the Department of Finance and I agree with the conclusion that has been reached there &mdash; a <Col N="2037" /> merger would not be appropriate in the short to medium term.  However, I have asked &mdash; and this question has been raised by a number of speakers &mdash; the chairman of both the ACC and the ICC to examine the scope for co-operation between them and to ensure that there will not be the overlapping to which I think Deputy Sherlock referred.</P>
    <P>Questions were raised by Deputy Noonan about the provisions in section 2 if this Bill was passed and came in willynilly overnight.  That is not going to happen.  As I said in my Second Stage speech these will come in in a phased way, as required, with the approval of the Minister for Finance and the Central Bank.  It is not a question of somebody deciding that these things will happen because section 2 of the Bill states &ldquo;... for such purposes as the Minister, after consultation with the Central Bank of Ireland, may from time to time determine and subject to such conditions as the Minister considers appropriate&rdquo;.  That is fairly well covered in that section.</P>
    <P>Deputy Noonan also raised the question of the Killanin report on lending for the bloodstock industry and asked why we did not take the opportunity to deal with it in this legislation.  As far as I can ascertain at the moment from advice, there is no law at present preventing the ACC or anybody else from lending to the bloodstock industry.  Deputy Noonan's contribution made it quite clear that there was complexity involved in lending in this area and he spoke about the guarantee that would be required.  There is nothing to prevent this from happening, nor do I see any necessity for new legislation to allow it to happen.  It is a question of whether those who are lending will take a particular animal as collateral and too many of them will not.</P>

      <P>It is a question that is being examined by the Department of Agriculture and Food at present, but it does not arise under this legislation.  Concerning the specialty that would be required of the staff concerned with the ACC in the new areas of lending, I do not think there is any difficulty.  As Deputy Noonan rightly said, while he raised the point here he was quite satisfied that the staff involved were expert staff doing a good job.  I have no doubt that in a new area they will continue to do so.</P>
      <P>I am not going to deal with the general objections raised by Deputy McDowell when he said that he would be voting against the legislation.  I honestly believe the Deputy does not fully understand the case when he talks about extending the limit of the corporation's share capital. The reason we are doing that is that the limit has been reached.  It is normal. Section 5 of the Bill provides for an increase from £10 million to £25 million of the amount of loans in respect of which the Minister for Finance may guarantee the corporation against losses.  Existing limits have been reached.</P>

The facts are that we have reached the limits and it is normal when legislation of this kind is going through to take the opportunity to <Col N="2039" /> ask the House for permission to increase those limits rather than, if the occasion did arise in any circumstance, not just connected with the ACC, having to rush in overnight, creating panic in pursuit of legislation.  I cannot see that arising. Deputy McDowell was talking as if this was rushed out of the blue.  This Bill was published last November and we are just getting to it now.  Most Deputies who contributed have welcomed this Bill which is doing something the ACC have been seeking for some time.</P>

      <P>In reply to the Deputy's question on 2 February, I stated that a surveyor from the Marine Survey Office of my Department boarded the vessel following the grounding and instructed the owners to remove all polluted substances.  This instruction was complied with immediately and the <i>Samson</i> does not pose a threat to marine life.</P>
      <P>My Department have asked the owners of the <i>Samson</i> to remove the vessel.  Its removal is a matter, in the first instance, for the owners.  A harbour or conservancy authority, or the Commissioners of Irish Lights can also remove a wreck if they consider it an obstruction or danger to navigation.  I have no statutory powers to remove such wrecked vessels or to direct that they be removed.  I should point out that the costs involved in wreck removal can be very great.</P>

      <P>I would first like to explain that the Passport Office in issuing passport <Col N="1811" /> facilities to minor children must conform with the provisions of the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964.  Section 6 of the Act states that &ldquo;the father and mother of an infant shall be guardians of the infant jointly&rdquo;.  Even if one parent has deserted the family and has not been in contact for many years he or she is not deprived of the rights of guardianship.  The Passport Office, therefore, in issuing passports to minors, must take care that they do not infringe the legal rights of either the mother or the father otherwise the office could be sued by the injured parent.</P>
      <P>However, where a parent is not available to give consent the other parent has the option of applying to the courts under section 11 of the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964, for an order directing the Passport Office to issue passport facilities to the child or children of the marriage without the consent of the missing parent. Since the Court (Amendment) Act 1981 such an application can be made to the District Court under section 15 of the Courts Act, 1981.  The process is, I understand, relatively inexpensive and straightforward.  If the party in question, therefore, gets the appropriate court order the Passport Office will be in a position to issue passport facilities to her two children.</P>

      <P>I have been advised by the Revenue <Col N="1812" /> Commissioners that an incorrect certificate of tax-free allowances for 1987-88 was issued to the taxpayer on 5 February, 1988.  An amended certificate according the taxpayer the full allowances to which she, as an individual resident in the State, is entitled for 1987-88 has now been issued to her and any tax over-deducted from her earnings on the basis of the incorrect certificate will be refunded to her by her employer when the amended certificate is put into operation.</P>

      <P>The estimated costs in 1989 are as follows: (a) Public Service Pay Agreement (second general increase) £70 million; (b) increments £28 million; (c) special pay awards in the Public Service £15 million. The figures shown reflect the estimated likely impact of the Government's policy on reducing the numbers employed in the public service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The figure of £15 million at (c) represents, in the main, the carryover cost <Col N="1829" /> of special pay awards being implemented under Clause 3.2 of the 1986 Public Service Pay Agreement, the final phase of which is due to be paid on 1 July 1988.</P>
    <P>The current Public Service Pay Agreement provides for the payment, from 1 July 1989, of 40 per cent of special pay increases currently being processed.  It also provides that if the Government consider that these payments would put at risk the central objectives underlying the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>, they shall consult with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions on the matter with the view to arriving at a mutually acceptable solution.</P>
    <P>It would be inappropriate at this stage to speculate as to the likely cost of the Exchequer of these claims, which are at various stages of processing.  For this reason the potential cost of these increases in 1989 has not been included in the reply to (c) of the Deputy's question.</P>

It is a condition of repayment of excise duty under that scheme that the Revenue Commissioners must be satisfied that applicants are wholly or almost wholly without the use of each of their legs. The medical evidence furnished to the Commissioners in this case indicated that the applicant's disability was not such as would meet the criteria for allowing repayment and accordingly they refused the application.</P>

      <P>The Garda Station at Dublin Airport is being established to provide a service to the public who use the airport and to cater for the members of the Garda Síochána who provide policing and security services there.  These services, which have been provided for many years, are now being expanded to provide a uniformed Garda presence at the airport at all times.</P>
      <P>As I indicated in reply to Questions Nos. 49 to 52 on 23 February 1988, the opening of a Garda station at Dublin Airport does not involve any change in the roles of either the Garda Síochána or the airport security force.  There is no intention that the establishment of the new station should hinder in any way the development of the existing airport security force, nor is there any proposal that the cost of providing this force should be taken over from Aer Rianta by my Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare whether his attention has been drawn to major dissatisfaction with many of the decisions of medical referees; and whether he has any plans to review and reform the system.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>No major dissatisfaction has been expressed in regard to the medical referee system.  In fact it is generally perceived to be an effective and efficient system, being as it is, one of the key elements of control in the administration of the disability and injury benefit schemes.</P>
      <P>Every effort is made to ensure that the interests of persons referred for medical referee examination are fully safeguarded. Their own certifiers are advised of the forthcoming examinations and invited to submit an appropriate medical report.  In addition it is open to a certifier to attend a medical referee examination if he or she so wishes.</P>
      <P>In any case where, following a medical referee examination, it is decided that a claimant is no longer entitled to benefit, the person concerned is advised of the right of appeal.  Should the claimant wish to exercise that right then a further examination by a different medical referee is arranged.  If, following this examination, the claimant is deemed to be unfit for work, then benefit is fully restored back to the date of the original disallowance. On the other hand, if the opinion of the second medical referee agrees with the first one then the claimant is invited to complete a statement of appeal and the appeal is then submitted for consideration by an appeals officer who may decide if he considers it necessary to hold an oral hearing of the appeal.  Appeals officers are statutorily appointed and are independent in the exercise of their statutory functions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is worth noting that in 1987 while in excess of 95,000 persons were summoned to attend medical referees examinations some 2,000 cases only had ultimately to be referred to an appeals officer for <Col N="1847" /> decision.  Approximately a third of these appeals were allowed.</P>
    <P>The foregoing illustrates the various steps taken to ensure that claimants are fully safeguarded in relation to the medical referee system.  There are no proposals for reform under consideration at this time although the system is kept under continuous review.</P>
    <P>If the Deputy is concerned about any specific case I will be happy to examine it if he forwards the particulars.</P>

      <P>It is a basic condition for the receipt of unemployment benefit that the claimant must be unemployed.  In general, a person is not regarded as unemployed on any day on which he is employed.</P>
      <P>Regulations made under social welfare legislation allow a claimant, who is engaged in subsidiary employment, to be treated as unemployed where the income from such employment does not exceed £4 a day.  If the income from such employment does exceed £4 a day then the claimant is required to have 78 paid and reckonable contributions in the three years preceding the claim for unemployment benefit in order to be treated as unemployed.</P>
      <P>The person concerned is a selfemployed fishermen with income exceeding £4 a day.  He does not have the necessary 78 contributions in the three years preceding his claim for unemployment benefit and so his claim was disallowed with effect from 29 October 1987.</P>
      <P>It is open to him to appeal against this decision, and a form for this purpose may be obtained from his local employment office.  He was advised to apply for unemployment assistance but declined to do so.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Following re-investigation, a deciding <Col N="1849" /> officer determined that his means, arising from self employment as a taxi driver, exceeded the statutory limits and he was not, accordingly, entitled to unemployment assistance for the period concerned.</P>
    <P>The revised decision resulted in an overpayment of £836.92 being assessed against the person concerned.  He was informed of the decision and details of the overpayment on 22 October 1976 and of his right to appeal but failed to do so.</P>
    <P>He again claimed unemployment assistance on 5 March 1986 and following investigation was awarded a qualification certificate with nil means, from that date.

      <P>All Ro-Ro passenger vessels registered in the State and foreign registered ships when in an Irish port or territorial waters must comply with the provisions of the International Maritime Organisation's Safety of Life at Sea Convention, 1974 (SOLAS).  A set of 21 statutory instruments was executed in 1983 in order to give legal effect to the Convention while a further set of 12 instruments giving effect to the First Amendments to the Convention was executed in 1985.  The rules concern such matters as life-saving appliances, navigational facilities, fire protection, construction, surveys, radio installations etc.</P>
      <P>Ro-Ro passenger vessels registered in the State are subjected to an annual survey by marine surveyors of my Department for the renewal of the Passenger and Safety Certificate.  The object of the survey is to ensure that the vessel is maintained in a seaworthy condition. Such a vessel is issued with the above certificate which is renewable annually and which also details crew complement and the number of passengers permitted to be carried.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In so far as foreign registered vessels are concerned my marine surveyors carry out inspections in accordance with the Memorandum of Understanding on Port State Control.  The latter is an agreement between the maritime authorities of 14 European countries aimed at ensuring that ships comply with international <Col N="1854" /> safety, pollution prevention and other standards.  All deficiencies found during inspection are reported to the Port State Control Computer Centre at Saint-Malo, France.  In addition, the vessel may be detained to rectify deficiencies, allowed to proceed to the next port where the deficiencies must be rectified or given 14 days to rectify the deficiencies, depending on their gravity.  Under the Port State Control Memorandum, each member state undertakes to achieve an annual total of inspections corresponding to 25 per cent of the estimated number of individual foreign merchant ships (as distinct from ship's movements) which entered its ports during a 12 month period.  In practice this results in an inspection rate of around 85 per cent of all individual ships using ports in the State.</P>
    <P>The position under international law in relation to foreign flag vessels plying to and from Irish ports is that, unless on boarding the vessel there is a clear indication that the vessel is in breach of the relevant requirements, my Department's surveyors must accept the evidence of the certificates of compliance with the various international Conventions issued by the country of registry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am taking Questions Nos. 113 and 117 together.</P>
      <P>On 2 March 1988 I made regulations enabling bollards and ramps to be provided on public roads.  The regulations were made under the Dublin Transport Authority (Dissolution) Act, 1987, which came into force on 1 January 1988.  A corresponding power contained in the Dublin Transport Authority Act, 1986, involved cumbersome procedures and was limited to Dublin.  There has been no undue delay in making the regulations.</P>
      <P>Under the new procedures, a road authority must give public notice in a prescribed manner of proposals to provide or remove bollards and ramps in its functional area.  An opportunity is afforded to any objectors of having their objections considered by the authority. The authority must also consult with the Garda.  The final decision to provide or remove bollards or ramps is a function reserved to the local elected representatives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The regulations specify the procedures to be followed by road authorities in publishing both their proposals and decisions.  The schedules to the regulations also lay down requirements which authorities must comply with in relation to the construction, design and positioning of bollards and ramps.  In addition, classes of roads where bollards <Col N="1861" /> and ramps cannot be provided are specified.</P>
    <P>I have also sanctioned the use of new traffic signs to be provided by road authorities to advise road users generally where bollards or ramps have been provided.</P>
    <P>Local authorities may, at their discretion, finance the provision of bollards and ramps by way of the block grant for roads which is paid annually by my Department to supplement expenditure from their own resources.  In the case of Dublin Corporation, the block grant for roads allocated for 1988 is £2.654 million.</P>

I do not accept that the complexities or inadequacies of the compulsory purchase system are at the root of much of this dereliction.  I believe that a stronger derelict sites code, which would place a new and express obligation on all owners of land including public bodies to prevent it from becoming or continuing to be derelict and give local authorities the duty and the power to ensure compliance with this obligation is necessary.  I propose to bring forward legislative proposals in this regard as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>The control of disposal of waste polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) is regulated by the European Communications (Waste) Regulations, 1984.  I am aware of the incident in question which was notified at the time and duly investigated by an officer of my Department.  I am satisfied from this investigation that the <Col N="1865" /> interests concerned acted in a responsible manner in dealing with what was a relatively minor spillage.  I understand that the quantity of PCB involved was less than one litre.</P>
      <P>I am informed that the leakage occurred during the transportation of sealed capacitors from County Clare to County Offaly on 18 January, and that the leakage from one of the capacitors was noticed on the following day.  In the meantime the lorry had moved from Tullamore to Tallaght.  Immediately it was established that the leaked substance was PCB, the haulier was contacted, the vehicle was examined and, when found to have been very slightly contaminated, it was isolated and subsequently cleared by a specialist agency.</P>

    <P>The current approved payments for student nurses who were recruited in 1987 at £54 per week and also for future intakes are: 1st year, £58 per week plus free accommodation; 2nd year, £100 per week plus premium payments for weekend, public holiday and night duty; 3rd year, students who commenced training in 1987 at £54 per week (now £58 since 1-1-88) will not enter their 3rd year of training until 1989.  The level of pay to apply to these students in 1989 is under consideration at present.</P>
    <P>Within the limited resources available to me for training purposes I have endeavoured to make training available, within reason, to as many young people as possible.  On the basis of the revised rates for student nurses it is possible to increase the intake in 1988 by 400 students over the level of the 1987 intake.  I am satisfied therefore that this measure is not in conflict with the objectives of the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i></P>

      <P>The provision of paediatric services at Castlebar General Hospital is a matter for the Western Health Board in the first instance.  The paediatric unit at Castlebar was closed on various occasions since April of last year due to the serious illness of the consultant paediatrician there and the non-availability of a suitable locum consultant paediatrician to provide the necessary cover despite the best efforts of the health board by public advertisement to secure an appropriate locum. During these closures all paediatric cases from County Mayo were referred to the Regional Hospital, Galway.  The most recent period of closure was from 31 January to 12 February 1988.  The consultant paediatrician resumed duty on 22 February last.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to say that I recently issued clearance to the board, on financial grounds, to proceed with an application to Comhairle na nOspidéal for the appointment of a second whole time consultant paediatrician at Castlebar which should ensure that the necessity to close this unit will not arise in future.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1888" /> (a)  Introduction of £1 general medical service prescription charge</P>
    <P>It is broadly estimated that the introduction of a £1 charge on GMS prescriptions would generate between £15-£20 million in savings to the Exchequer in a full year.</P>
    <P>(b)  Abolition of drugs refund scheme</P>
    <P>The full year cost of the operation of the drugs refund scheme in 1988 is £10.5 million.  This sum includes provision of £1.5 million in respect of hardship cases.</P>

      <P>Children admitted to care under existing legislation without the consent of their parents are generally taken into care under fit person orders obtained by health boards under the 1908 Children Act.  Parents are entitled to be notified when application is being made for a fit person order in respect of their child. Parents may apply for a revocation of a fit person order any time after the making of such an order.  Guardianship rights for the duration of a fit person order, continue to be vested in the child's married parents, or in his mother where his mother and father are not married to one another.</P>

    <P>Where there is a difference of opinion <Col N="1893" /> between parents and a social worker the parents may also make an informal appeal through the health board structures or directly to my Department.</P>
    <P>A handbook entitled &ldquo;Your Child in Care?&rdquo;  was published last year by a voluntary organisation called Family Link, following consultation with my Department and with financial assistance from public funds.  It is a very useful source of information for families, covering issues such as guardianship and visiting rights and is available free of charge to parents.</P>
