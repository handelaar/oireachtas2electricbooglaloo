      <P>It is proposed that the Dáil shall sit later than 9 p.m. today and business shall be interrupted at 12 midnight.  It is also proposed that statements shall be made today on the review of the Anglo-Irish Agreement and the following arrangements shall apply: (1) the statement of the main spokesperson nominated by each of the groups as defined in Standing Order 89 (1) shall not exceed 30 minutes, (2) the statement of each other Member called on shall not exceed 15 minutes, and (3) the final statement shall conclude not later than 12 midnight.  Private Members' Business shall be No. 16, with Question Time as usual at 2.30 p.m.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I regret that I have to rise here once again to object to a proposal for dealing with business. Under this arrangement it is proposed that only the main spokespersons of the <Col N="558" /> groups as defined in Standing Order 89 (1) shall have 30 minutes in which to make their statements.  Again, I would argue that this is a deliberate attempt to downgrade the role of The Workers Party in this House, and on that basis I am objecting to the proposal and am going to call a vote on it.  I have pointed out on previous occasions that if this practice were to be continued I would challenge it on every occasion in the Dáil.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Order of Business, I understand that the Taoiseach will make a statement in the House this afternoon about the appointment of a Commissioner. I raised this matter yesterday and I asked that it be clarified that there would be an opportunity for the Leaders of the other parties in the House to comment on that appointment.  The Tánaiste yesterday suggested that the matter should be discussed between the Whips.  It has been discussed between the Government Whip and my Whip &mdash; I do not know about the other parties &mdash; and <Col N="559" /> the Government Whip has proved to be recalcitrant.  I should like it confirmed in the House now that there will be an opportunity for other Members of the House to reply to the Taoiseach's statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="The Tánaiste Brian (Snr.) Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>In accordance with numerous precedents in the past, what is involved here is that the Taoiseach will come into the House as a matter of courtesy to convey the Government's decision in a short announcement.  There is a short announcement procedure by which the Taoiseach of the day makes an announcement without debate.  That procedure is well established.  It is nothing new nor is it being introduced now for the first time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Tánaiste is not correct on that.  If he looks at the Official Report for 10 October 1984 &mdash; an occasion when on the resumption of the Dáil after the summer recess the Commissioner at that stage due to take office in 1985 was notified at the beginning of the session &mdash; he will find that a reply was made by the then Leader of the Opposition, Deputy Haughey, and I intend to invoke that precedent today.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="The Tánaiste Brian (Snr.) Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to clarify the matter.  That was a three page statement to which Deputy Dukes referred and there is specific procedure governing a statement with further statements from other Leaders.  This is not a statement; this is a three sentence announcement.  It is a different matter altogether.</P>

      <P>I know that it is extremely difficult for the Tánaiste to resist the temptation to be utterly disingenuous but if he looks at the Official Report he will see that there was at least a column of comment by the then Taoiseach, Deputy <Col N="560" /> Garret FitzGerald, and at least a column by Deputy Haughey.  I can tell the Tánaiste and you Sir, but in particular the Tánaiste, that I will not be making a three sentence comment.  I will comment at considerably greater length than that.</P>

      <P>The Tánaiste is now saying that in the Order of Business there will be an announcement by the Taoiseach.

    <Title>Review of Anglo-Irish Agreement: Statements.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="The Tánaiste Brian (Snr.) Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday was the third anniversary of the signature of the Anglo-Irish Agreement.  At the outset of this discussion it is useful for a moment to remind ourselves of another anniversary that occurred a short time ago, 5 October was the 20th anniversary of the first civil rights march in Derry.  The images of that scene on 5 October 1968 remain vivid in all our minds: people in Ireland and abroad were deeply shocked by the gravity of the wrongs to which the marchers drew attention, and struck by the reasonableness of their demands for the exercise of basic democratic rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is salutary to recall the 20-year span of the &ldquo;troubles&rdquo;.  A great deal has changed over those years but a resolution of many of the fundamental problems has so far eluded us.  The recollection of those years, far from inducing any sense of resignation, can only imbue us with a renewed sense of urgency.  Today's 30-year olds in Northern Ireland have lived their adolescence and young adulthood in the shadows of the &ldquo;troubles&rdquo;; it would be intolerable if their entire adult lives were similarly blighted.  One can only <Col N="564" /> imagine the depression with which people in such circumstances greet theories of &ldquo;containment&rdquo; or suggestions of an &ldquo;acceptable level of violence&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Anglo-Irish Agreement was part of a process, initiated in 1980, designed to counter any such theory of containment. The Forum report of May 1984 was absolutely right in stating that &ldquo;in political, moral and human terms, there is no acceptable level of violence&rdquo;.  The report stressed the overriding urgency of action and underlined the need &ldquo;not merely to arrest the cancer but to create the conditions for a new Ireland and a new society acceptable to all its people&rdquo;. Developments in the intervening years have confirmed the accuracy of the analysis contained in the Forum report.</P>
    <P>In approaching the review, it is important to be clear about what the exercise involves and what it does not.  It is worth restating Article 11 of the Anglo-Irish Agreement.  That Article provides that &ldquo;at the end of three years from signature of this Agreement, or earlier if requested by either Government, the working of the Conference shall be reviewed by the two Governments to see whether any changes in the scope and nature of its activities are desirable&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This is quite precise language; the review clearly is not intended in any way to call into question the existence of the Agreement.  The scope of the exercise is nevertheless quite extensive.  Articles 2 to 10 of the Agreement all make reference to the Conference and its work and thus come within the scope of the review.  Since the Conference is the operating mechanism &mdash; the engine so to speak &mdash; of the entire Agreement, we have a responsibility to assess the overall working of the Agreement, as well as of the individual articles I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>As is clear from the joint statements of the last three meetings of the inter-governmental Conference, the two Governments have been considering their approach to the review for some time.  The joint statement of 2 November sets out the approach agreed upon.  In summary, the joint statement commits both Governments to a thorough and <Col N="565" /> serious review, with the main emphasis on a positive programme of work for the future; each Government states their willingness to take careful account of views expressed to them; working parties of senior officials will be established; and both sides envisage that the review will be completed in early 1989.</P>
    <P>Essentially, we see the review period as involving two separate but interwoven exercises.  The first of these is the detailed assessment by the two Governments of developments to date and the mapping out of an agenda for future action.  The second &mdash; which will take place in parallel with the first &mdash; is the hearing of views from interested parties as to their assessment of the past operation of the Agreement and their suggestions for the future. The precise interaction between these two exercises will obviously be a matter kept under review by both Governments. I might add that we look forward in due course to hearing the views of political parties here and, in this regard, we will be making contact with political party leaders in the near future, indeed, this debate can act as a launching pad for this process.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to predict whether all interested parties in the North will in fact convey their views.  It is our hope that procedural issues will not stand in the way of the widest possible dialogue.  At this time of serious reflection on important issues, both communities in Northern Ireland will surely want their leadership to ensure that their viewpoints are represented and their voices heard.</P>
    <P>However, realistically, one has to acknowledge the publicly stated position of the Unionist leadership that they will not contribute to the review process as such.  We have noted their comments to the effect that they will not help to redesign a vehicle intended for their destruction, as they see it.  Let me say as clearly as I can: this is not a vehicle designed to destroy anyone.  For anyone critical of a lack of consultation three years ago, an invitation &mdash; a genuine and most sincere invitation &mdash; to have an input at this stage is surely not to be lightly cast aside.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="566" /> I want to emphasise again our understanding of the situation in which Unionists find themselves.  I made reference earlier to the Forum report.  This was no one-sided treatment of the situation in Northern Ireland.  We addressed ourselves also to the fears and insecurities of the Unionist community, and made clear our commitment to respecting and upholding their identity and ethos.  More recently, the Taoiseach has repeatedly stressed that his door is open to the Unionist community.  In order to facilitate any wish on the part of Unionists to make a contribution, our flexibility as to how views are conveyed, or to be conveyed, during the review period has been clearly signalled.</P>
    <P>Having said this, however, there is an important balancing point to be made. With the present rightful emphasis on reassurance to Unionists, it is imperative that the importance of reassurance to Nationalists should in no way be diluted or down-played.  It is the role and responsibility of any Irish Government to present the Nationalist viewpoint in a coherent and forceful way.  The Agreement should and must enhance our effectiveness in fulfilling that role.</P>
    <P>We have in particular to take account of the reality that, to some extent at least, the achievements of the Agreement have so far failed to fulfil the hopes and expectations of many members of the Nationalist community.  Important as it is that a friendly and neighbourly relationship between Dublin and London be developed and sustained, the real test of the Agreement is the difference it makes on the ground in Northern Ireland.  That is why all supporters of the Agreement must be sobered by findings which show that only a minority of Nationalists in Northern Ireland feel that the Agreement has made a difference to their daily lives.</P>
    <P>It would, of course, be quite wrong to suggest that there have been no worth-while developments from the Nationalist viewpoint in the past three years.  On the contrary, it is important that we give full weight to the positive developments that have taken place &mdash; improved policing of <Col N="567" /> the marching season, an end to supergrass trials, a new code of conduct for the RUC, the beginnings of an economic programme for West Belfast, the preparation of new and, we hope, effective fair employment legislation &mdash; all these deserve recognition as developments that are beneficial, or potentially beneficial, to the Nationalist community.</P>
    <P>Why then, despite the undoubted achievements of the past three years, is there such a degree of disappointment among Nationalists in Northern Ireland? This is a question which I believe deserves the most serious consideration during the review period.  The argument is sometimes made that the Agreement has fallen victim to unrealistic expectations generated at the time of its signature, that any society adapts slowly to psychological and structural change and that a great deal should not be expected in a three year time span.  According to this argument, supporters of the Agreement are simply showing an undue impatience for change.</P>
    <P>In my view, that argument misses the point.  The whole thrust of the Forum report was, as I have said, to stress the urgency of action.  Stormont may have lasted for over 50 years, but we do not have the luxury of another 50 years to redress the damage.  As realistic politicians, we know that society is not transformed overnight; at the same time, we cannot accept that change should come piecemeal, at its own pace, as might be acceptable in a more normal society. The Agreement envisaged an energetic and sustained programme of action, spanning all the crucial problem areas within Northern Ireland and it is both legitimate and necessary for us to measure the achievements of the Agreement against that standard.</P>
    <P>If many members of the Nationalist community are disappointed, it is not because they seek too much but because they have seen too little by way of change.  Constitutional Nationalists have a particular stake in the success of the Agreement because for them, involved as they are in the daily battle for hearts <Col N="568" /> and minds in their communities, the Agreement represents &mdash; or should represent &mdash; a bulwark against the forces of extremism and violence.  But for constitutional Nationalists, too, the Agreement has continually to earn its success; it must add substantive achievement to symbolic significance.</P>
    <P>To develop a more detailed sense of the subject matter of the review, and to amplify some of the points I have made, I propose to comment briefly on the individual Articles of the Agreement which fall within the scope of the review.  These brief comments on individual Articles will be supplemented in the course of today's discussion by other Government speakers.</P>
    <P>Article 2 of the Agreement sets out the right of the Irish Government to &ldquo;put forward views and proposals on matters relating to Northern Ireland within the fields of activity of the Conference&rdquo; and states that &ldquo;determined efforts shall be made through the Conference to resolve any differences&rdquo;.  These are absolutely key commitments of the Agreement and it will be crucial for the review process to examine how they have operated in practice and how they might better operate in the future.</P>
    <P>One of the strengths of the Agreement is that it provides a framework within which difficult issues can be discussed; it acts, if you like, as a kind of shock absorber at times of crisis in Anglo-Irish relations.  I am very much in favour of the substitution of conference table discussions for megaphone diplomacy; in a friendly relationship between neighbours, one should obviously not need a megaphone to be heard.  But that is the crucial point: that one's voice should be heard.</P>
    <P>There have undoubtedly been times over the lifetime of the Agreement when the consultation process envisaged in Article 2 failed to operate at all &mdash; as was the case with the announcement in Westminster last January of the decision not to prosecute in the Stalker-Sampson affair &mdash; or failed to operate within the spirit of the Article.  A strengthened commitment to the consultation procedures <Col N="569" /> envisaged in Article 2 would be, in my view, one of the most important and helpful outcomes of the review exercise.</P>
    <P>Article 3 of the Agreement relates to meetings of the Conference and the functioning of the secretariat.  I might emphasise here that the Government are fully persuaded of the importance of regular, well prepared meetings of the Conference. I would point out that the Conference has met more frequently in 1988 than in any previous year: there have been nine meetings to date and a further meeting has been scheduled for early December.  As is clear from the joint statements issued following each meeting of the Conference, discussions have been wide ranging, substantive and forward looking.  Indeed, on taking office, the Government consciously sought to broaden the Conference agenda and to place a particular emphasis on economic and social issues which we felt had previously received inadequate attention.  It is false and misleading to say that the Conference has been largely taken up this year with crisis management though, on occasion, responding to problems in this category can be an important part of our work.</P>
    <P>The Secretariat performs a key role in servicing the Conference; the presence of Irish civil servants in Belfast 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year, is an important reassurance to the Nationalist community.  The work of the Secretariat will be examined in the course of the review, to see if there are ways in which it might be adapted and strengthened.</P>
    <P>Article 4 of the Agreement refers, <i>inter alia,</i> to devolution.  The appropriate role for the Irish Government in relation to devolution is a matter which frequently arises in discussions.  The Taoiseach set out the Government's position on devolution clearly, and at considerable length, in reply to a parliamentary question on 9 March 1988.  I would like to take this opportunity briefly to reiterate our position. Article 4 of the Agreement speaks of devolution &ldquo;on a basis which would secure widespread acceptance throughout the community&rdquo;.  Sub-paragraph (c) <Col N="570" /> of that same article goes on to say that &ldquo;both Governments recognise that devolution can be achieved only with the co-operation of constitutional representatives within Northern Ireland of both traditions there&rdquo;.  On the basis of the stated positions of the parties in Northern Ireland, I simply do not see that the prospects for this are very high at present.</P>
    <P>Articles 5 and 6 of the Agreement are grouped under the heading &ldquo;Political Matters&rdquo;.  A cluster of extremely important issues is treated under this heading; issues of identity, protection of human rights and prevention of discrimination. Article 6 refers to the input of the Irish Government in relation to the role and composition of public bodies.  During the review, we will be taking a searching look at the balance sheet of achievements under these articles and the scope for future action.</P>
    <P>Fair employment deserves specific mention as an area where there is potential for very significant progress.  I am heartened by the close consultations which have taken place within the Conference on this issue.  I look forward to the tabling very shortly at Westminster of new legislation which, we hope, will bring to an end practices of employment discrimination which can have no place in any decent society.</P>
    <P>Articles 7 and 9 of the Agreement deal with security and related matters in their Northern Ireland and cross-Border contexts respectively, as well as with the crucial and central issues of prison policy and confidence in the security forces in Northern Ireland.  My colleague, the Minister for Justice, will comment in more detail on some of these issues when he speaks later in the discussion.</P>
    <P>However, there is one fundamental point which cannot too often be emphasised. The commitment of the Irish Government and the Irish people to combating terrorism is consistent, comprehensive and effective.  Our high expenditure on Border security is maintained at a time of financial stringency, when we have had to implement unparalleled cutbacks in a number of areas of the economy.  As the Taoiseach said in <Col N="571" /> this House last January, &ldquo;our commitment in this area is freely given, in the common interest of society, North and South, to ensure that the forces of terrorism &mdash; whether of domestic or international origin &mdash; do not prevail&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>One might sometimes infer from remarks by commentators that security issues are exclusively on the British agenda for the Conference and equality issues are exclusively on our agenda.  This represents a fundamental misunderstanding. The fight against terrorism is on our common agenda, just as equality of treatment for the minority community also forms part of the common agenda.  There is a moral and political imperative which compels both Governments to address both sets of issues.  Indeed, as has been demonstrated in similar situations around the world, issues of peace and justice are inextricably intertwined.  Strenuous efforts must, of course, be made to counter terrorism. But, as I said yesterday, in an interview in the <i>Irish News,</i> we must not fall into the error of believing that a security programme aimed at the suppression of terrorism can be a substitute for a policy which addresses the root causes of the problems of Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>The most important element in the whole area of confidence is the daily experience of ordinary people of the security forces.  Three years after the Agreement complaints of harassment continue.  It is clear that this must be a priority area for the Conference.  Our challenge is to put measures in place which, without prejudice to the right of people to bring their complaints to the courts or to the formal machinery established in law, will closely monitor the problems of people with the security forces with a view to taking immediate action to deal with them.</P>
    <P>Article 8 deals with legal matters, including confidence in the administration of justice.  From the outset, this has been an area to which we attach particular importance.  Confidence in the administration of justice is one of the touchstones of a decent society; an <Col N="572" /> absence of confidence provides the space in which subversion thrives.</P>
    <P>Doubts are sometimes expressed as to whether any substantial section of the National community genuinely lacks confidence in the administration of justice. In the face of the data, one may even wonder why this question is still being asked.  For example, a survey published last year by the prestigious London-based Policy Studies Institute found that 38 per cent of Catholics lack confidence in the fairness of Northern Ireland courts in dealing with Catholics.  Surely such a finding makes a compelling case for acceleration of work under Article 8 of the Agreement?</P>
    <P>Change in the method of trial or other aspects of the political system is considered by all forward thinking societies from time to time; and it is no reflection on judges or those who have charge of the system to propose change.  There is now, objectively, a more compelling case than ever for the introduction of three judge courts in the North.  We have found from experience that our own three judge Special Criminal Court has not alone worked very effectively but has, if anything, served to strengthen and sustain confidence in the administration of justice under a common law system.</P>
    <P>Article 8 also refers to extradition, a subject which, as we are all aware, has aroused considerable controversy.  The present position is quite clear.  Extradition, with safeguards, is in place.  In addition, we are also considering with the British Government the use of the Criminal Law Jurisdiction Act in appropriate cases.</P>
    <P>Article 10 deals with cross-Border co-operation on economic, social and cultural issues.  It is under this Article that the international fund was established. Article 10 makes clear that the focus of the fund's work is to be on &ldquo;those areas of both parts of Ireland which have suffered most severely from the consequences of the instability of recent years&rdquo;.  I am pleased to note that in recent months the fund, acting on advice of both Governments, has given increased emphasis to its work in disadvantaged areas, and <Col N="573" /> indeed that a specific disadvantaged areas initiative has been adopted.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that the full potential of Article 10 has still to be realised.  The approach of 1992 presents us with an unprecedented challenge to re-examine existing attitudes.  As national borders within Europe are effectively eroded by the process of European cohesion, there is surely an unarguable case for increased harmonisation between the economies of the two parts of this island.  We would hope to emerge from the review process with a detailed programme of action which will prepare us for the opportunities and challenges of 1992.</P>
    <P>This brief survey of the individual articles of the Agreement will have indicated our general approach to the review exercise. Our specific proposals will be made within the structures established by the Agreement.  I would again stress that both sides are approaching this review in a positive manner, in a spirit of joint endeavour.  The Agreement entitles &mdash; indeed almost obliges &mdash; us to be frank with one another but there will be no criticism for the sake of criticism.  Our purpose is to revitalise the implementation of the Agreement; above all to rekindle that sense of urgency which informed the discussions between the two Governments in 1980-81 and, subsequently, the Forum discussions and the negotiations which led to signature of the Agreement.</P>
    <P>It is my hope that the review exercise will engage the energies and creativity not alone of the two Governments, but of all who care about the fundamental issues affecting Northern Ireland, future relationships on this island and Anglo-Irish relations.  It is particularly appropriate that this extensive discussion should take place in the Dáil at this early stage in the review period.  I look forward to an open and constructive exchange of views.</P>
    <P>Before concluding I would like to note and to read into the Dáil record a message which has been received by the Taoiseach from President Reagan to mark the third anniversary of the Agreement.  I am sure I speak for all of us when I express deep <Col N="574" /> appreciation of the interest and concern so consistently shown by the American Government and people in relation to Northern Ireland and the generosity demonstrated by their very substantial contribution to the International Fund. The letter states:</P>
    <P>Dear Mr. Prime Minister,</P>
    <P>On November 15, the UK and Ireland will observe the third anniversary of the Anglo-Irish Agreement and begin a mandated review of the working of the intergovernmental conference. I should like to take this occasion to salute the courageous efforts which both governments and people of goodwill on both sides are making to deal constructively and realistically with very difficult problems and offer you our encouragement and support for the future.  The United States remains a firm supporter of the Agreement and the International Fund for Ireland and their objectives of promoting economic and social advance and encouraging reconciliation.</P>
    <P>From the beginning, the United States has supported the Agreement and the Fund which we believed would enhance co-operation between British and Irish officials who were working for the benefit of the people of Ireland and Northern Ireland.  The United States contributed $120 million to the Fund during its first three years and will make an additional contribution in 1989.</P>
    <P>The Agreement has been especially effective in promoting co-operation between the British and Irish Governments in their efforts to eliminate discrimination and to combat terrorism. The International Fund is working effectively to create jobs and promote reconciliation projects.</P>
    <P>As you begin the review, you will have a special opportunity to reflect on the solid accomplishments of the Agreement to date which have been made against difficult odds and strong opposition.  You will also be able to consider how it can be used to further improve the quality of life for the <Col N="575" /> people of Ireland and Northern Ireland.  Progress in dealing with this issue has often been slow, but the seriousness of the problems compels all of us, particularly those in the United States with strong friendships and ties to both Ireland and the United Kingdom, to help and support your efforts.</P>
    <P>Sincerely yours,</P>
    <P>Ronald Reagan.</P>
    <P>That is a very important and comprehensive message with a guarantee of continued help and backing for the Agreement from the United States Government and it is to be welcomed by the Government and the Dáil generally.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I look forward to a constructive debate.  It is very appropriate that it is taking place today at the start of the period of examination.  I am certain that the contributions made in the House will form the basis for solid contributions that can be made in greater detail possibly by political parties here in the House and by interested groups throughout the community, North and South, and in Britain, the United States and other countries where very great interest is focused on the constructive effort which is being made in Ireland between the two sovereign Governments concerned to deal with what has been a very intractable problem, not just over the years to which I have referred earlier, the past 20 years, but indeed for centuries.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like at the outset to say that, like the Tánaiste, I regard President Reagan's message which the Tánaiste has just read out to us, as being a very important statement of support and encouragement for the process that we undertook with the signing of the Anglo-Irish Agreement three years ago. It is a matter of some considerable satisfaction to this House to have a restatement of support in the terms that President Reagan has used.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Tánaiste's approach to this debate and to the review has a great deal in common with the Government's <Col N="576" /> approach to the Agreement.  I find it &mdash; I have no intention of making a personal point here &mdash; very low key and very lack-lustre. I would like to look back at some of the events that led to the signing of the Agreement three years ago.  That Agreement was the culmination of years of patient, careful and imaginative work by quite a number of people.  Nobody in this House would under-estimate or deny Deputy Garret FitzGerald's role in that, nor could people under-estimate his passionate commitment to peace, justice and reconciliation that was evident to everybody involved in the discussions and the negotiations that led up to the signing of the Agreement.</P>
    <P>As Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Peter Barry was intimately involved in every stage of the negotiations, in assessing each proposal and each development.  As Tánaiste and leader of one of the partners in Government, Deputy Dick Spring was very closely involved in the process also.  A great share of the credit is due to a number of other people.  The role played by our own public service and in particular by the Taoiseach's office and the Department of Foreign Affairs was vital at all stages of the negotiations.  I think it right to point out that the present Taoiseach played a role, in the talks which he had with the UK Prime Minister in 1980. He has seemed to prefer, up to today, to disavow that role but the fact remains that those talks were part of the background against which negotiations were initiated with the UK Government after the publication of the New Ireland Forum report.  I note that the Tánaiste has mentioned this in the speech he has just delivered. As far as I can remember, and I stand open to correction, this is the first time that statement &mdash; it is a true statement &mdash; has been made by any member of the Fianna Fáil Party in this House in a debate on Anglo-Irish affairs and I am glad to hear it.</P>
    <P>The New Ireland Forum contributed in a very significant way to the inspiration of the negotiations.  For the first time, constitutional Nationalist parties had joined together with a common accord <Col N="577" /> to examine all of the issues arising in examining &ldquo;the manner in which lasting peace and stability could be achieved in a new Ireland through the democratic process&rdquo; and in reporting &ldquo;...on possible new structures and processes through which this objective might be achieved&rdquo;. That is all part of the background.</P>
    <P>In the three years of its existence so far, the Agreement has proved its worth. It has clearly made the point that the Unionist parties can no longer say &ldquo;No&rdquo; to political developments which do not suit only them.  The Nationalist community now have a mechanism through which they can be sure that their views, their needs and their identity can be expressed.</P>
    <P>I was disappointed to find in the Tánaiste's speech a reference to findings which purport to show that only a minority of Nationalists in Northern Ireland feel that the Agreement has made a difference to their daily lives.  I am surprised, disappointed and even astonished that the Tánaiste should fall into the trap of using that illustration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>There is absolutely no doubt that if we were to ask a similar question to the one that was asked in those surveys of the man-in-the-street about the usefulness to him of this present Government we would find that 80 per cent of them would say that it did not seem to have any beneficial effect on their daily lives.  I find that kind of reference in this context to be utterly out of place and ill-judged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There have been a number of other achievements of the agreement which I do not intend to dwell on at the moment. My colleagues will deal with them in more detail.  Since March of last year there has been a marked slowing down in the pace of work under the Agreement.  It is quite clear that during these last 18 months nothing like the same effort or dedication have been put into working the Agreement as were applied during its first 18 months.  Indeed, the Tánaiste seems to accept that this is the case, <Col N="578" /> otherwise why would he mention at the end of his spech a purpose to revitalise the implementation of the Agreement and above all to rekindle that sense of urgency?  You do not revitalise something that is already vibrant; you do not rekindle a fire that is blazing.  It may be that we should welcome the Tánaiste's statement that he is going to revitalise and rekindle.  I am glad to hear it, but we should not have had 18 months of deceleration.</P>
    <P>That deceleration has not been due to either Government alone.  Each of the two Governments concerned must, in their own way, take responsibility for the failure to capitalise fully on the Agreement itself and on the work that was done during the first 18 months.  Over the last 18 months the agreement could have been more fruitful.  It could have produced greater progress in relation to the administration of justice in Northern Ireland.  It could have produced greater strides in relation to the level of confidence that exists between the security forces and the Nationalist community. It could have played a greater role in promoting economic co-operation between North and South.  Above all, it could have been used in a much more constructive way than it has been to develop political structures in Northern Ireland that would help the two communities there to live, to work and to develop together in harmony.</P>
    <P>Responsibility for those missed opportunities is shared by the two Governments. The UK Government have concentrated, sometimes to the apparent exclusion of all else, on their concerns with security co-operation, and in doing so, they have succumbed to the very obvious temptation to confuse security with politics.  I have no doubt whatever about the need for close cross-Border security co-operation, and I have made that clear in this House and elsewhere, time after time, but security co-operation alone will not solve even the security problem.  It will not solve the problem that arises from lack of confidence in the administration of justice.  It cannot solve the problem of relations between the <Col N="579" /> Nationalist community and the security forces.  It cannot solve the problem of unfair employment practices.  It cannot reduce the alienation of the Nationalist community in Northern Ireland from the Government system in which they live. Security co-operation alone cannot strike at the reasons bombers, gunmen and terrorists of all descriptions still find support in what is undoubtedly a small minority of the communities in Northern Ireland, nevertheless a minority significant enough to provide shelter.  Security co-operation can only be a complement to effective political and social action.  The UK Government must realise this, and must broaden the scope of their action accordingly.  They must take seriously and put into operation their obligations on consultation, because without that the Agreement cannot be fully effective.</P>
    <P>In the last 18 months the Irish Government here, for reasons I intend to go into in a moment, have taken the focus of their attention away from the areas of action where most imagination, most skill and most courage are needed &mdash; the political areas.  They have allowed themselves to become mesmerised by the UK Government's preoccupation with security co-operation.  In the last 18 months, the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste, who wrongly accused the last Government of paying too much attention to security, have said little of substance about anything else.</P>
    <P>This Government's approach to their obligations under the Agreement has been seriously deficient.  The action they should have taken has been grossly hampered as a result.  On this, the occasion of the review of the workings of the Inter-Governmental Conference, we must analyse what has happened so that we can see what is needed to rectify the situation and to make the Agreement the vehicle which it is designed to be &mdash; a vehicle for advancing the true human interests of all the people of Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>I have already referred to the present Taoiseach's talks with the UK Prime Minister in 1980.  They were carried a certain distance and were productive, but <Col N="580" /> the Taoiseach's involvement in those talks was interrupted in 1981 for very good and valid reasons which had nothing to do with those talks.</P>
    <P>As I have already said, the work of the New Ireland Forum was crucial, but it was here that we saw, for the first time, the unwillingness or the inability of the present Taoiseach to commit himself fully to the real politics of making progress in Northern Ireland.  No sooner was the ink dry on the Forum report than Deputy Haughey immediately put himself outside the circle of constitutional Nationalist parties who had worked so constructively together to lay the basis for real political action in relation to the future of Northern Ireland.  Who can forget the shock and the very sharp sense of disappointment that we all felt when, on the day after the signing of that Forum report, Deputy Haughey said, in effect, that, whatever the other parties in the Forum said, he was going to plough his own furrow as if nothing had happened?</P>
    <P>There followed the lengthy, often difficult but always dedicated negotiations between Deputy Garret FitzGerald's Government and the British Government. These led to the signing of the Anglo-Irish Agreement.  When that Agreement was signed, the present Taoiseach could not even bring himself to claim, as he had a perfect right to do, that his work in 1980 had been a definite and positive factor in bringing about the Agreement.  Instead of that, he took the safe, cute, unimaginative, unadventurous, utterly uncreative and fundamentally divisive route of voicing spurious constitutional doubts.  He has never, to my knowledge, even attempted to test the validity of these doubts.  Could it be that he knows in his heart of hearts that they are groundless?</P>
    <P>On coming into Government, with these spurious doubts still apparently unresolved in his mind, he found himself faced with the responsibility of working the Agreement.  Whether because of these alleged constitutional doubts or for other reasons, he failed to pay the proper attention to the working of the Agreement. The result was a lack of attention to <Col N="581" /> the close and continuing contact between the two Governments through the mechanism of the secretariat and the Conference that is part of the very fabric of the Agreement.  That inattention contributed largely to the heightening of tension between the two Governments as a result of the Stalker-Sampson affair, and the further deterioration in relations that came about at the beginning of this year as a result of the action of the British Government in relation to the Prevention of Terrorism Act.  Those events, in turn, led to a series of extraordinary zigzags on this Government's part in relation to cross-Border security co-operations and extradition.</P>
    <P>I must say regarding the passage of the Tánaiste's speech claiming that the commitment of the Irish Government and the Irish people to combating terrorism is consistent, comprehensive, effective and so on, that we all remember in this House and outside it suggestions that this Government would regard cross-Border security co-operation and, indeed, even extradition as being in some ways bargaining counters.  All of that arose from a lack of attention by the two Governments to the proper contact that, as I have said, is part of the fabric of the Agreement itself.</P>
    <P>Added to all that, we have the Government's persistent refusal to make any statement of any substance about their view on devolution.  The only view the Government have expressed was enunciated again by the Tánaiste today.  He referred to replies to questions in this House on 9 November and I quote what was said on the issue of devolution: &ldquo;On the basis of the stated positions of the parties in Northern Ireland I do not see that the prospects for this are very high at present.&rdquo;  That may very well be the case, but that is not the point.  Article 4 of the Agreement states that devolution on the basis which would secure widespread acceptance throughout the community is the policy of the UK Government, supported by the Irish Government.  Each Government is, therefore, under an obligation to play its part in making devolution, on the basis <Col N="582" /> set out, a reality.  It is the job of this Government, together with the UK Government, to improve the prospects for devolution and not simply to stand idly by.  This Government appear to have no policy on the issue, no ideas on how to bring it about and no understanding of its importance.</P>
    <P>We must ask ourselves what the reasons are for this present unsatisfactory state of affairs in relation to the working of the Agreement.  I believe that a pattern is discernible in all of this and that there is an explanation.  Quite simply, it is that the present Taoiseach and Government have, like most other people, come to the conclusion that their preferred solution and the solution the New Ireland Forum would wish to see &mdash; the unitary state &mdash; is not achievable in the foreseeable future, but are afraid to say so or are prevented by their history from saying so.  Further than that, and in spite of having come to that conclusion, they are either afraid or unwilling to contemplate any other arrangement no matter how permanent or how temporary, no matter how good for the people of Northern Ireland, no matter how conducive to bringing about peace, stability and political harmony, because they are still in the grip of their old household gods.  They are the prisoners of 66 years of empty rhetoric.  They are the hostages of the &ldquo;sneaking regarders&rdquo;.  They have neither the imagination nor the courage to rejoin the rest of us in the real world, which is the business of practical politics.</P>
    <P>That is where our real problem lies. That is why this Government have gone no further in terms of creating real political debate than to issue vague and impersonal invitations to the leaders of the Unionist parties to come to talks at an unspecified date at an unnamed venue to discuss a non-existent agenda.  As I have said before, such vague invitations are no substitute for clear thinking, realistic discussion and resolute political action.</P>
    <P>It is time that this Government woke up to the realities of political life in Ireland in 1988.  It is time for them to <Col N="583" /> realise that, sooner or later, real aspirations have to give rise to political action. It is time for them to accept that the best cannot be the enemy of the good, especially when our brothers and sisters, Catholic, Protestant and dissenter are suffering because Fianna Fáil do not want to take a single step forward unless that step leads immediately to a goal which we all realise is beyond our present horizon.</P>
    <P>We in Fine Gael, by contrast, have adopted a much more realistic and a much more compassionate view of how we should approach this problem.  At the end of September I put forward four proposals which address the issues before us. The Tánaiste said today that he looks forward in due course to hearing the views of the political parties here and that he will be making contact with party leaders in the near future.  I am glad to hear that because early in October I wrote to the leaders of all the other political parties and so far the only reaction I have had from the Government has been a gentle and a kind word from the Tánaiste in a corridor to say that they had received the letter and perhaps we could think about it.  I am glad to see an advance on that and that something active may be done either as a result of today's debate or as a result of a more studied approach to the views expressed in this House during the course of today.</P>
    <P>The first is that the two Governments must now state explicitly, in accordance with Article 4 of the Agreement, that they are determined to make devolution a reality.  It is abundantly clear to me and to many others that whatever ultimate objective any one of us in this House may have, and whatever ultimate objective any other party elsewhere may have, there must necessarily be a phase, however short or long it may be, during which the two communities in Northern Ireland confront their political differences in a political structure, and work together on an agreed basis for the welare of their people.  That is devolution.</P>
    <P>That is why it is essential that the two Governments now state a firm commitment to making it a reality.  Unless <Col N="584" /> and until the two Governments do that, we will continue to have the situation, as the Tánaiste himself mentioned, where he will say time after time that the prospects for achieving it do not seem to be great.  They will never be great if the two Governments do not make an effort.</P>
    <P>My second proposal is that each of the two Governments involved in the Agreement should institute consultations with the constitutional political parties in their respective jurisdictions before each meeting of the Conference.  These consultations should cover all the issues falling within the Conference's terms of reference, with the exception of operational matters arising in the context of cross-Border security co-operation.  Let not the Tánaiste or any other member of the Government say to me today that the prospects for bringing that about do not seem to be too great.  We know the difficulties, although I see reports today &mdash; I hope there is truth in them &mdash; that there appears to be a greater disposition among the Unionist parties in Northern Ireland now to discuss these issues with the Northern Ireland Secretary of State.  Let us encourage that and let us not say that prospects do not seem great because that is an utterly unconstructive and useless way of approaching the problem.</P>
    <P>The third change concerns a particular aspect of the promotion of cross-Border co-operation in relation to economic and social development.  The achievement of the single market in the European Community by 1992 will have immediate and fundamental implications for economic relations between the two parts of this island and will, as a result, have significant social implications.  The Agreement and the Conference provide an appropriate framework within which the two Governments can examine these issues, with particular reference to the effects on Northern Ireland and on our Border areas.  I am very glad to see from the Tánaiste's speech today that he appears to have taken that proposal on board.</P>
    <P>My fourth proposal is a simple and straightforward proposal that there be a regular schedule of Conference meetings <Col N="585" />&mdash; for example, ten per year.  Over the last 18 months, too many of the meetings have been called as a response to increased tensions in Anglo-Irish relations, rather than as a deliberate step to bring constructive work forward.  This is a totally unsatisfactory way of conducting the Conference business.  Indeed, if there had been more regular meetings of the Conference, some of the occasions for urgently calling special meetings might well not have arisen.  Because of the nature of its work, the Conference must become a normal and regular part of each Government's activity.  Each Government must develop a sensitivity to and an awareness of the other's attitudes, requirements and difficulties.  Regular meetings of the Conference are needed to ensure this.</P>
    <P>Much of what the Tánaiste has presented as the review of the workings of the Agreement strikes me as being the proper work of the Conference itself under the terms of the Agreement and it is a misjudgment to present what should be the ordinary work of the Conference as being in any sense a review.  It downgrades the ordinary work of the Conference to use it as part of a hype in a review process that we are now told is going to last for several months.  That is not an appropriate way to go about this business.</P>
    <P>Quite apart from the business of reviewing the operations of the Conference, there is another change in attitude which I believe we must all adopt if we really wish to see progress.  While there is no doubt in the minds of the vast majority of the Nationalist population of Northern Ireland as to our bona fides and our constructive intent, it is clear that there is an important section of Unionist opinion which takes a different view.</P>
    <P>We must make it clear, in all our words and actions, that we have the same concerns for the economic, social and political well-being of the Unionist community in Northern Ireland as we have for our Nationalist brothers.  In many respects, we believe the Nationalist community is in greater need of support but our ultimate objectives are the same <Col N="586" /> for all.  Our Constitution requires us to cherish all the children of the Nation equally. Our convictions demand of us that we respect each and every one of our brothers and sisters in Northern Ireland equally, whatever their constitution and whatever their status in relation to our State.  It is in that spirit, and with that respect for the rights and identities, the lives and liberties of everybody on this island, that we must approach this review of the workings of the Anglo-Irish Conference.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this day-long debate on the review of the Anglo-Irish Agreement which I, as Whip of the Progressive Democrats, had sought at Whips' meetings in the last couple of weeks, supported, I must say, by the other parties.  I want to put on record, at the start, what a great pity it is that the Taoiseach, Deputy Haughey, in whose hands the stewardship and development of the Agreement now lie, is not able to be present to contribute or listen to this debate in the Dáil today.  I hope that the House can benefit from a contribution from the Irish signatory to the Agreement, Deputy Garret FitzGerald, later in the day.</P>
      <P>The Progressive Democrats, first of all, believe that the Anglo-Irish Agreement holds the same potential for peaceful coexistence in Northern Ireland today as it did on the day it was signed.  To those critics who undoubtedly will say that it has not accomplished its stated aim of achieving &ldquo;lasting peace and stability&rdquo;, we would respond that three years is a short time in the long and bloody history of the divided communities in Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>The biggest achievement of the Agreement at this review period remains the fact that the Irish Government have been granted the right, for the first time in Irish history, to have a say in the affairs of the North.  The biggest shortcoming of the Agreement, on the other hand, remains the failure of that Anglo-Irish framework to get the majority Unionist community in the North involved in the process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="587" /> It would be fair to say, from the perspective of any party in the Republic, that the Agreement has fallen far short of Nationalist expectations that it would deliver major changes in the administration of justice in Northern Ireland. This, if anything, was the initial aim of the Agreement in the eyes of the Irish Government when it was signed three years ago.</P>
    <P>The Agreement reached its lowest ebb in Nationalist terms &mdash; North and South of the Border &mdash; with the handling of the Stalker-Sampson affair earlier this year. The failure to follow up the Stalker-Sampson report with prosecutions, the failure to have the same rule of law seen to be applied to the security forces as to civilians in the North, has had implications on the public perception of the Anglo-Irish Agreement in the Republic for most of this year.  The Stalker-Sampson affair was followed by a number of associated but dissimilar events all questioning the impartiality of the application of the rule of law: Private Thain's release, the Birmingham Six case, the Gibraltar shootings, the withdrawal of the prosecution against a British soldier in the McAnespie case and, this week, the turmoil at the inquest into the deaths of Toman, Burns and McKerr.</P>
    <P>The British assertion of the &ldquo;public interest&rdquo; in any of these singular cases militates against the long term interest of making the security forces more acceptable to Nationalists in Northern Ireland. In Ireland, where perceptions are often more important than the reality, it appears from this series of coincidental events that (i) there exists a high-level sanction or carelessness about a shoot-to-kill strategy regardless of its political consequences and (ii) there is a two-tier administration of justice.</P>
    <P>In summary, the British handling of the succession of events during the year have conspired to create the public perception that those who are charged with enforcing the law in Northern Ireland are somehow insulated against the full rigour of that law.  Apart altogether from the failure to secure the expected changes <Col N="588" /> in the Diplock courts, this perception is damaging public confidence in the administration of justice on an ongoing basis.</P>
    <P>What, then, is the main change brought about by the Anglo-Irish Agreement over the last three years?  I believe that the Agreement, and the all-party forum for a new Ireland which preceded it, have brought about a fundamental change in attitudes towards Northern Ireland in the Republic.  There is a solid consensus across all political parties that a united Ireland cannot, and will not, be achieved automatically as of right.  Even Fianna Fáil, the party most reluctant historically to accept that Unionists cannot be forced into a united Ireland in their preferred form of a unitary state, have had to accept the status of Northern Ireland in Article 1 of the Anglo-Irish Agreement in the wake of the McGimpsey case testing Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution this year.</P>
    <P>I will give the House a concrete example of the new political climate created by the Anglo-Irish Agreement in Ireland.  The Progressive Democrats published a new draft Constitution in January of this year in which they proposed a change in Articles 2 and 3, to remove the Republic's territorial claim to the North. Contrary to expectations in many quarters, that proposal did not produce a political fall-out of any great importance, as it would have done a few years ago, in my view.</P>
    <P>There is, since the Anglo-Irish Agreement, a growing realisation in the South of the realities of Northern Ireland: that a united Ireland, the aspiration of the majority of Nationalists on this island &mdash; which I share &mdash; is not achievable within most of our lifetimes and that a step by step approach to bring about a tolerant, democratic and plural society has to be the immediate Northern policy of any Government.</P>
    <P>Side by side with the change in attitudes in the South, the whole Anglo-Irish Agreement process has brought fluidity into Northern political opinion for the first time in many years.  Whatever the retrospective merits or demerits of the <Col N="589" /> exercise, a long series of talks have concluded between the SDLP and Sinn Féin. A fundamental reappraisal has evidently been taking place within Unionism in the North for most of the year.  Both of these moves would not have happened but for the fact that the Anglo-Irish Agreement has broken the political log-jam in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Because of the fluid political situation, North and South, I believe that a unique opportunity for movement presents itself with the review of the Anglo-Irish Agreement now.  I am encouraged by the signs that Unionists, for the very first time in their history, are beginning to look to themselves as the ultimate guarantors of their position.</P>
    <P>Before looking to the future, which should be our focus point in this debate, and on which the opening speech of the Tánaiste was most disappointing, I would like to say a few words about the working of the Anglo-Irish Conference set up under the Anglo-Irish Agreement.  The Progressive Democrats have taken the view that the Anglo-Irish Conference has not been worked to its full potential for most of the last 20 months.  Deputy Dukes seems to share that view.  The down-playing of the role of the Conference has coincided with the change of Government here.  The Conference itself met less frequently for the first nine months of this Government's term of office.  For most of the last year its work has been re-active and confined to the &ldquo;politics of the last atrocity&rdquo;.  No long term political work of an exploratory nature is being done.  I recognise that crises in Northern Ireland have to be managed but policies that consist only of crisis management on the security front are not the answer.  This strategy has hamstrung the development of the Anglo-Irish Agreement during the last 20 months.</P>
    <P>There are a few cogent examples of where the spirit, if not the letter, of the Anglo-Irish Agreement has not been adhered to by the two Governments in this period.  These are: (i) the stop-start attitude to extradition by the Fianna Fáil <Col N="590" /> Government and the ambivalence within the Fianna Fáil Party in relation to Ireland's pre-existing commitment, given in the joint communique to the Agreement, to ratify the European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism.  There was also the thinly veiled threat last September to equivocate on the matter of extradition when it comes up for review in the Dáil this December; (ii) the reluctance of the British Government to live up to its implied commitment in Article 8 of the Agreement to consider changes in the Diplock courts by seeking measures which would give substantial expression to the aim of securing public confidence in the administration of justice, &ldquo;considering <i>inter alia</i> the possibility of mixed courts in both jurisdictions for the trial of certain offences&rdquo;; (iii) the failure of the British Government to consult and inform the Irish Government about the Stalker-Sampson report before reaching the political decision not to proceed with prosecutions in their &ldquo;public interest&rdquo;; (iv) the failure of the Taoiseach, Deputy Haughey's Government to accept that it can play an initiating role in the working out of proposals for devolution, as provided in Article 4 of the Anglo-Irish Agreement.</P>
    <P>The reason that the Anglo-Irish Conference has not realised its full potential is quite obvious.  Mrs. Thatcher and Mr. Haughey have adopted an attitude of detached indifference to the Agreement over the past 20 months.  They have allowed the Conference to develop into a crisis centre dealing with day-to-day issues in Northern Ireland.  The longer-term political perspective has not been addressed.  Going by the Tánaiste's contribution to this debate this morning, there is no evidence that it will be addressed in a co-ordinated manner in the next couple of months during the review. There has been no Anglo-Irish summit meeting between the heads of Government since the Anglo-Irish Agreement was signed at Hillsborough three years ago.  I would argue that hurried, cosmetic, fringe meetings &mdash; there have been three or four &mdash; at European Council level are no substitute for structural and <Col N="591" /> detailed diplomacy on the issue of Northern Ireland and Anglo-Irish relations.  It is difficult to see how the Anglo-Irish Agreement &mdash; described by both sides as a &ldquo;process&rdquo;, not an end in itself &mdash; could develop without the benefit of a creative and constant political input to sustain it.</P>
    <P>The effect of these developments overall is to allow the IRA to set the pace of politics in Northern Ireland.  There is an urgent necessity now for the leaders of the two Governments to hold a full Anglo-Irish summit meeting to give developments in the North &mdash; particularly the reappraisal within Unionism &mdash; the benefit of political direction.</P>
    <P>It is also regrettable that no work was carried out within the confines of the Anglo-Irish Conference until the meeting in mid-September of this year to address the opportunity presented with the scheduled review of the Agreement now.  This has meant that no serious attempt has been made by either Government since Hillsborough three years ago to put forward proposals for political structures that might reconcile the two traditions in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>I would go further and state that both Governments have been wilfully negligent in their primary responsibility of shifting the emphasis of the work of the Anglo-Irish Conference from crisis management to political change in the last number of months.</P>
    <P>The thrust of the Northern policy being pursued by the Progressive Democrats has been careful and quiet over the last six to seven months in an effort to explore various avenues of accommodation in the general context of the review of the Anglo-Irish Agreement this month.</P>
    <P>This private process was based on a recognition that the review provided the opportunity to take advantage of the greater fluidity in influential political opinion on both sides of the Border in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Based on this work, the leader of the Progressive Democrats, Deputy Desmond O'Malley, put forward a carefully prepared formula first at our annual conference in Cork last May and again at our <Col N="592" /> constitutional conference in Dublin in September that could be a small step on the way to ending the current political logjam in Northern Ireland.  He suggested that the review of the operation of the Anglo-Irish Agreement, now being undertaken, offered a glorious opportunity for dialogue between the British and Irish Governments which would involve the constitutional representatives of both communities in the North.</P>
    <P>He proposed, that the British and Irish Governments should jointly invite the constitutional Unionists leaders to participate in a new round of talks under the auspices of the Anglo-Irish Inter-governmental Council, which for Nationalists remains within the ambit of the historic process devised in the early eighties, but which for Unionists lies outside the immediate structure of the Hillsborough Accord.  We are repeating this proposal today since this formulae was the culmination of a process of quite exploration and consultation with many shades of political opinion by this party.</P>
    <P>I will remind the House that the Anglo-Irish conference was established under Article 2 of the Anglo-Irish Agreement. Article 2 states that the Conference itself was set up &ldquo;within the framework of the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Council of 1981&rdquo;.  In our view that Inter-governmental Council now represents the key to progress.</P>
    <P>It is a mechanism which provides both Nationalists and Unionists with a context which does no fundamental injustice to either side, but recognises the current political difficulties, especially of the Unionist leadership.</P>
    <P>The key question that Nationalists politicians on this island must now ask themselves is whether we can find a way forward within the Dublin-London axis, leaving in place all those institutions which have been established after long and detailed consideration in the Hillsborough Agreement while, at the same time, facilitating Unionists who currently feel &mdash; incorrectly in my view &mdash; that they are excluded from the process. Politically it is not realistic for Unionists politicians to call on the Dublin and <Col N="593" /> London Governments to set aside a solemn and binding international agreement as a pre-condition for talks.</P>
    <P>That is why we are proposing, within the context of the Dublin-London axis, a parellel process to facilitate Unionist inclusion.  The Anglo-Irish Inter-governmental Council is the parent body of the Anglo-Irish Agreement and conference. It is the first product of that historic attempt in the early eighties to elevate Anglo-Irish relations onto a new plane which was started by the present Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>Our fundamental message to both Governments in this debate is: give the most earnest consideration to this proposal. The time for talking about talking is long overdue.  All democrats on both islands, whatever their view, are obliged to seize back the initiative from the men of violence.</P>
    <P>I would draw the attention of the House to the fact that statements issued at leadership level by Northern Unionists no longer merely contain the usual ritual denunciation of the Anglo-Irish Agreement and all its works and pomps.  What is now apparent is that these statements are increasingly accompanied by references to the &ldquo;totality of relationships&rdquo; that were originally recognised at a summit meeting held in Dublin between Mrs. Thatcher and Deputy Haughey. More importantly, what is also acknowledged and accepted is the formalised structure which emerged from that meeting, namely the Anglo-Irish Inter-governmental Council.  As examples of the new thinking within Unionism I would refer the House to the speech made by the leader of the Official Unionists, James Molyneaux, M.P., in his address to the Friends of the Union recently and also to a live radio interview on RTE's &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; in which the Rev. Martin Smyth, M.P. acknowledged the positive aspects of the Progressive Democrats's proposal.</P>
    <P>In view of Ulster's compulsion to continue saying no, in public at least, the importance of these acknowledgements and others has sometimes been lost on a public which understandably has become <Col N="594" /> accustomed to a regular diet of denunciations.</P>
    <P>Turning to future prospects for the development of the Anglo-Irish Agreement, it is worth stating that the review can be as great or as minimal as the two Governments decide.  I was sorry to note that the Tánaiste did not make this point in his speech.  Article 11 setting out the arrangements for the review, states: &ldquo;At the end of three years from the signature of this Agreement, or earlier if requested by either Government, the working of the Conference shall be reviewed by the two Governments to see whether any change in the scope and nature of its activities are desirable.&rdquo;  In this respect it is worth noting that &ldquo;the working of the Conference&rdquo; is covered in every single article of the Agreement with the exception of Article 1 covering &ldquo;the status of Northern Ireland&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In this context, the Progressive Democrats believe that the two heads of Government are failing in their solemn duty to be the initiators of political change in the North, neglecting to give political direction at the start of the review process.  There are still no plans, to my knowledge, for a full Anglo-Irish summit meeting between Mrs. Thatcher and Deputy Haughey to apply themselves to the review.</P>
    <P>The Northern Secretary, Mr. Tom King, MP, appears, over the last few months, to be pursuing a unilateral initiative aimed at trying to get the constitutional parties within the North involved in talks on devolution.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach, at the same time, appears to be interested in a different form of political dialogue which he has left undefined.  When Unionist leaders are focusing towards Dublin as much, if not more, than London, it behoves the Taoiseach, in particular, to set out his offer of talks to the Unionists in a position paper.  There is a total contradiction in offering &ldquo;talks without pre-conditions&rdquo; to the Unionists, on the one hand, and setting out your desired goal of a unitary State, on the other hand &mdash; simultaneously in the same speech, as happened in New York some months ago.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="595" /> We are confident from our regular contacts that an initiative along the lines we have suggested is the one most likely now to evoke a positive response.  The review of the Anglo-Irish Agreement is the catalyst for a parallel but separate process under the aegis of the Anglo-Irish Inter-governmental Council.  The most disturbing aspect of the review, in my view, borne out by the speech made by the Tánaiste, this morning is that the British and Irish Governments do not appear to have any policy, separately or together, to build on the political dimension of the Agreement over the next three years.</P>
    <P>In proposing a joint British-Irish initiative now under the aegis of the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Council we have had to make a few fundamental judgments as a party.</P>
    <P>Unlike the Northern Secretary, Mr. King, we believe that proposals for devolution will not work in the North at the present time until Unionists accommodate themselves first in a parallel framework to the Anglo-Irish Agreement. If the Unionists were to get involved in the Anglo-Irish Inter-governmental Council, then one of the first issues on the agenda should be devolution.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, in the wake of the Agreement, it would appear that the only form of devolution which has a chance of succeeding among Nationalists in the short term would be a system with an Irish dimension to it.  This will not succeed, in the short-term, until such devolution proposals are divested from any association with those referred to in Article 4 of the Agreement.</P>
    <P>We are making three points at this time about the review of the Anglo-Irish Agreement: this is now the time to respond to a Unionist leadership that needs a way out of the <i>cul-de-sac</i> down which it finds itself; this is now the time also to respond to an alienated Nationalist community which still has little reason for confidence in the administration of justice in the North; this is now the time to respond to a greater threat posed by a heavily-armed Provisional IRA.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="596" /> I was a political journalist at Hillsborough three years ago when the Anglo-Irish Agreement was signed.  I still hold the view, which I wrote about at that time, that Deputy Garret FitzGerald will go down in Irish history as the man who secured Mrs. Thatcher's interest and agreement to the most important political accommodation reached between these islands since independence.  The significant feature of his role &mdash; and that of Deputy Peter Barry &mdash; was the perseverance and personal commitment which they applied to the negotiation of the Agreement.  They knew that considerable political risks were involved.</P>
    <P>This is the lesson that the Taoiseach has not learned.  Deputy Haughey, as Taoiseach, has had an unrivalled opportunity to shape the Agreement into an image of his own making over the last 20 months in Government.</P>
    <P>What we are saying to the Taoiseach today is that he is better-placed than any other political leader to foster a real initiative on Northern Ireland now.  He is at the cross-roads of opportunity that may not come up again for some time. Has he the ingenuity to make the Anglo-Irish Agreement into something even greater?  Has he the courage to acknowledge that he cannot achieve a unitary State during the life of this Dáil or, indeed, in his own lifetime?  Has he the vision to realise that he can secure for himself the same place in history as Deputy FitzGerald by taking the personal initiative to abandon his party's sterile attachment to the empty sectarian nationalism favoured by Fianna Fáil since the Civil War?  Does he not realise that in the current climate he can take advantage, without any loss of face whatsoever, of the structure originally initiated jointly by Mrs. Thatcher and himself &mdash; namely the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Council in the early eighties?  Has the Taoiseach the courage, at the end of the day, to take the risks involved?  If he has that courage, a consensus as real and as powerful as presently exists on the economic management of this country will be forthcoming from this party.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I wish to state that it is my intention to make a short contribution to this debate at this stage.  I am at present formulating a detailed submission on behalf of the Labour Party to the two Governments undertaking the review of the operations of the Agreement.  It is my intention at present that the submission will be published, and that it will cover all aspects of the Agreement as well as its operations.</P>
      <P>The theme I want to address in my remarks today is the administration of justice.  It is impossible to talk about the Anglo-Irish Agreement without talking at length about the administration of justice. It is an area about which the Labour Party have expressed major concerns in the past two years, in common with members of other parties.  But information that has come into the possession of my party in recent times has served to reinforce the concerns that we have expressed in the most fundamental way.</P>
      <P>The information I am about to give the House came into the possession of the Justice spokesperson of the Labour Party, Deputy Taylor, within the last week.  He and I have discussed it at some length, and we have decided that it is in the public interest that the information in our possession should be made public. We have no reason to doubt the authenticity of this information, and we will in due course, for the reasons I will outline, be supplying the documents in our possession to the Taoiseach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before going any further, I want to repeat a point I have made several times before in this House and elsewhere.  We cannot defeat the forces of terrorism by abandoning the standards we have set ourselves as a democratic society.  If we ignore the principles of due process, and equality before the law, if we decide as a society that there are certain people whom it is not necessary to arrest, or to put on trial, but that it is necessary and desirable simply to execute them, if we engage in covering up the truth, then we are guilty of giving aid and comfort to the forces that would seek to undermine the <Col N="598" /> values that are fundamental to a democratic society.  I hold no brief for terrorists. Rather I believe that the way to beat terrorists &mdash; and the only way &mdash; is to bring people together through democratic political action.</P>
    <P>Three alleged terrorists were shot dead in Gibraltar on 6 March of this year. After a great deal of controversy, an inquest was held into those deaths.  A decision was taken by the British Government that that inquest was to be the only form of public inquiry into the circumstances surrounding those deaths. Deputy Taylor and I now have sufficient information to believe that the jury at that inquest was seriously misled on a number of significant points.  We believe that the information given to the jury was so suspect in relation to these points that we must now call on the British Government to reverse its earlier decision, and to arrange for a judicial sworn inquiry into these circumstances.  We also believe, in the light of what we have learned about Gibraltar, that serious question marks must be raised about the handling of the present inquest into the deaths of Gervais McKerr, Eugene Toman, and Sean Burns.  I will return to this subject later.</P>
    <P>To put what I have to say in context, let me reiterate some of the basic facts of the Gibraltar operation.  It commenced at 15.40 in the afternoon of 6 March, when the Police Commissioner in Gibraltar, signed a document which handed over control of the events to the military. Three minutes later, the three alleged terrorists involved were dead on the streets of Gibraltar.</P>
    <P>According to some of those who were observing and analysing the events of those three minutes, one of the key factors which governed the events was the siren of a police car, which went off at 15.41.  To some, this siren was seen as the signal for the start of the action.  This theory was repudiated in the course of the inquest by the evidence given by the most senior officer in the car, an inspector of the Gibraltarian police who was named at the inquest.  This inspector testified that his car was stuck in a traffic jam near <Col N="599" /> the scene of the subsequent action, and that, as he sat in it, he was unaware of the operation going on all around him. In the words of the counsel examining him, he &ldquo;thought that life in Gibraltar was totally normal, that what was happening between him and the Border was the same as happened any other day of the week&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The reason, according to his testimony, that he had turned on the siren was that he had got a radio message instructing him to return to headquarters urgently.  On his way there &mdash; after activating the siren &mdash; he heard shots, he said, and saw people falling to the ground. Notwithstanding the fact that he had just witnessed what he could only have imagined to be a crime, he did not stop. Instead, he crouched down in the back of the car, and instructed his driver to speed up, away from the scene.</P>
    <P>This is what he told the jury.  What the jury was not told was that the same inspector had been named, in an operation order prepared and signed by the commissioner of police, as the officer in charge of two armed firearms teams whose role it was to support the SAS.  He had also been involved in an extensive briefing about the operation on the previous day and could not possibly have been ignorant of what was happening.</P>
    <P>The operation order was exhibit 167 at the inquest.  It was shown to the coroner, but, because it was covered by a D-notice, it was not shown to the jury. A copy of that order is now in the possession of Deputy Taylor and myself.  It is impossible to escape the conclusion that important information was withheld from the jury and that the jury were misled on a very important point.</P>
    <P>Another important witness at the inquest was an off-duty policeman who testified that he heard shouts of &ldquo;Police! Police!&rdquo; before any shots were fired.  This off-duty policeman was presented to the jury as an independent witness and accepted as such by them.  His evidence was important in establishing that warnings were given before anyone was shot.</P>
    <P>What the jury was not told, but what <Col N="600" /> we have now discovered, was that the policeman in question was the brother of one of the armed policemen who was a member of the firearms team supporting the SAS.  It is certain that in an Irish court &mdash; and I have no reason to believe otherwise of the Gibraltar inquest &mdash; such information would seriously inhibit a jury from accepting the independence of the testimony given.</P>
    <P>Testimony was also given at the inquest by two soldiers, A and B, about their movements in the minutes immediately prior to the shootings, in which they were both involved.  independent tests carried out after the inquest have established that it was not possible for those soldiers to have covered the ground they claimed to have covered in the time available.  It can only be assumed that they were a good deal closer to the terrorists than they claimed when the operation started.</P>
    <P>I should say in all of this that no evidence has come into our possession which proves the suspicion voiced by a number of people that this operation was conducted in accordance with a shoot to kill policy.  Indeed, the evidence available to me is that if there was a shoot to kill policy, nothing about it was written down in any instructions to the Gibraltar police. But it is equally clear to me that a number of witnesses at that inquest felt they had something to hide, and hid it successfully. Knowing what I know now, I have been asking myself what other pieces of relevant information were hidden from that jury?  I have not been able to satisfy myself, in the light of all this, that that inquest was a satisfactory attempt to get at the truth of what happened on the Rock of Gibraltar.</P>
    <P>Our Government had an eminent lawyer watching the events that took place at the inquest.  The Government may by now have a full account of his views.  I am sending a copy of the document in my possession to the Taoiseach today.  I will be asking him to have that document weighed against the evidence given at the trial.  I will be asking our Government also to consider whether the interests of truth, justice, and democracy have been served in the course of that <Col N="601" /> inquest.  If they come to the conclusion that these interests have not been well-served they must take the necessary course of seeking a proper, judicial, sworn inquiry.  All the relevant documents in this case will have to be examined. Unless and until we find out what really happened, a serious question mark must hang over the British attitude to the administration of justice.</P>
    <P>The same question mark, it must be said, raises its head in relation to the inquest at present being conducted in Craigavon.  It is abundantly clear already that a decision has been taken that will have the effect of ensuring that relevant information is denied to the coroner conducting that inquest.  The parallels with Gibraltar, right down to the structure of the court-room, are uncanny.  The coroner involved is unlikely to be able to come to a clear, unequivocal decision about how these people died.</P>
    <P>This is an entirely unsatisfactory position, which cannot be regarded as tenable in the light of all the controversy that has surrounded the deaths of these men.  A number of attempts have been made to unearth the truth.  All of these attempts have foundered on the determined efforts of official sources to prevent the truth from getting out.  The cost of these efforts has been enormous.  It is long past time that a different attitude prevailed.  There may well be a cost to be paid for revealing the truth but ultimately, the cost of hiding the truth will be far greater.</P>
    <P>We cannot serve either community in the North by allowing the standards by which we live to be debased.  There may be many who, when they hear of the death of an alleged terrorist, regardless of the circumstances, are glad.  But in their heart of hearts, I do not believe there is anyone living in these islands who would welcome the disappearance of one of the most fundamental rights we enjoy &mdash; the right to a fair trial.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, I do not propose at this stage to go into other aspects of the relations between our two countries. However I do want to reiterate one fundamental point in which I believe very strongly.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="602" /> When I spoke in New York last summer about the Anglo-Irish Agreement, I said that this was a time when it was worth taking risks to make progress. It appears from the reaction to my speech that there are still a great many politicians who would rather cling to entrenched positions than look forward, even if looking forward might lead to a greater chance of reconciliation among the two communities in the North.</P>
    <P>Some of the reaction to what I had to say bordered on the hysterical.  For that reason, perhaps it would be as well if I reminded the House of what I actually said.  Perhaps I should begin by pointing out what I did not say.  For instance, one newspaper headline at the time suggested that I was calling for the removal of the Anglo-Irish Agreement.  This is nonsense. The Anglo-Irish Agreement is the most important instrument to have emerged in the developing relations between Britain and Ireland since the foundation of this State.  To remove it, or to weaken it, would be an unforgivable act.</P>
    <P>When people talk about the Anglo-Irish Agreement, they frequently refer to the effects it has had on the ground in Northern Ireland, or in terms of the effect it has had on cross-Border security.  There is a tendency to judge the Agreement &mdash; to assess its achievements or failures &mdash; by reference to these criteria alone.</P>
    <P>Sometimes the major historical achievement of the Agreement is overlooked in this kind of analysis.  The day the Anglo-Irish Agreement was signed, the British Government, for the first time in the history of our relationship, agreed, in an internationally promulgated agreement, to leave Ireland.  There was a condition, of course &mdash; the condition was that a majority of the people of Northern Ireland must wish for and formally consent to the establishment of a united Ireland.</P>
    <P>This affirmation by the British Government is now enshrined in the instrument formally lodged with the United Nations. Neither the British nor the Irish Government can unilaterally walk away from it. They cannot walk away from it, even if they wanted to, in the context of the <Col N="603" /> review that has now begun.  Talk of dismantling the Agreement, for this reason, is arrant nonsense.  Anyone who has read the Agreement should know that.</P>
    <P>But we cannot blind oursleves to the fact that progress in many areas has been slow and painful.  We cannot ignore the fact that violence continues unabated, particularly the bestial violence of the IRA.  We cannot forget that when major difficulties in Anglo-Irish relations emerged &mdash; caused, in the main, by arrogant and insensitive actions by the British establishment &mdash; the structures of the Anglo-Irish Agreement were unable to help in bringing those difficulties to a satisfactory conclusion.</P>
    <P>However it is undeniable that the Agreement has forced Unionism to come to terms with reality.  After spending a year in the belief &mdash; which turned out to be a delusion &mdash; that the Agreement could be brought down by the bully-boy tactics of old, many Unionists have been forced to analyse their position more coldly, and more realistically, than at any time in the past.  And many of them have come to the belief that there is no future in isolation.  That does not mean that they are now willing to countenance a united Ireland &mdash; to believe that they might would be totally unrealistic.  Despite what he might say, the Taoiseach, Deputy Haughey knows this as well as I do.  But many of them are willing, perhaps for the first time, to discuss the breaking down of barriers.  I believe that dialogue now might hold the key to a major step forward.</P>
    <P>I am not by any means the first politician to have said that now is that time for dialogue.  Speaking in a televised discussion recently, Harold McCusker said that if the Anglo-Irish Agreement were got out of the way, Unionists would make a major effort to put something better in its place.  If they failed, he said, they could not then object to the full rigours of the Agreement being imposed on them again.  Writing in <i>Fortnight</i> magazine, John Taylor has said that he would not rule out a structure to encompass <Col N="604" /> relationships on the whole island.  Speaking on RTE Radio, John Hume has said that he looked forward to the day when something better could be put in place of the Anglo-Irish Agreement.  Even those politicians in the South who were most critical of my position earlier this year seem prepared to countenance change. Deputy Peter Barry said on RTE Radio that a concession to Unionism must be preceded by a concession by Unionists &mdash; he did not say there must never be any concession to Unionism.  Deputy Geraldine Kennedy prefaced her personal attack on me by calling on the Taoiseach to put concrete proposals for dialogue with Unionism on the table.  The Taoiseach, as we know, has said again and again that he is willing to talk, or at least to listen, to Unionists.  Mr. Molyneaux has indicated several times that if the atmosphere was right, he would not be found wanting.  The UDA have called on the Unionist leadership to enter into immediate dialogue with Dublin.</P>
    <P>All of these &ldquo;vibrations&rdquo; have a number of things in common.  First, they are all suggestive of goodwill towards the idea of dialogue.  Second, they are all expressed in terms of generalities.  Third, they are always coupled with some expression of the ritual position.  For instance, Deputy Haughey always takes care to denigrate the idea of devolution every time he says that he wants to hear what the Unionists have to say.  The Unionists talk about dialogue, but always say &ldquo;no power-sharing&rdquo; in the same breath.  Other politicians talk about the flexibility of the Anglo-Irish Agreement, while being very careful to hold it up as a monument cast in bronze at the same time.</P>
    <P>I did not feel that way about the Anglo-Irish Agreement the day it was signed, I said it was a framework to build on, and I have never departed from the view that the Agreement was a living, breathing thing, whose aims and objectives were every bit as important as its structures. On 8 March this year, in a speech which referred to the Agreement as a process, and not a monument, I said:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="605" /> the operations of the Conference are due to be reviewed later this year.  I do not believe that it is beyond the ingenuity of both Governments, if there is a will to do so, to ensure in the context of that review that the structure of the Conference is developed to a point where it does not inhibit further dialogue with Unionist opinion. Clearly, any review must ensure that it remains possible for the interests of the minority community to be fully and effectively represented &mdash; but that can be done, I feel sure, in a way that Unionist opinion can live with.</P>
    <P>When I said that, there was no outcry. When other politicians talked about dialogue, there was no controversy.  For my part, I believe strongly that dialogue is the only way forward.  I believe if we want dialogue, we have to do more than talk about it &mdash; we have to do something to facilitate it.  We all know that it will take a great deal to generate the trust and goodwill that will be necessary if dialogue is to succeed &mdash; or even if it is to be sustained for a reasonable period, so that people on all sides can come to see merit in talking.  That is why I believe we should do something.  What I suggested was modest, even though specific.</P>
    <P>I suggested in the context of an unequivocal statement by Unionists about their attitude to power-sharing, the Irish Government should agree to a suspension, for a predetermined and limited period of time, of the Secretariat &mdash; not of the Agreement, not of the Conference, only the Secretariat.  The proposal did not imply in any way that bilateral contacts between staff or between Ministers should cease.  Neither did it imply that issues of concern to Nationalists should not be raised and dealt with.  Neither did it imply any lack of faith in the aims and objectives of the Agreement in the overall sense.</P>
    <P>The reason for making that proposal was a simple one.  Its purpose would be to create a window, in which dialogue could take place in an atmosphere of greater trust.  The reason for limiting the time would be precisely to counter the <Col N="606" /> suspicion expressed by some that suspension would be seen by some Unionists as a victory, and that they would redouble their efforts to have the whole Agreement dismantled.  In effect, what the Irish Government would be saying to Unionists, if they were to agree to my proposal, would be &ldquo;for the next six months you will not have what you have described as the spectre of Maryfield hanging over you.  We are taking this step because we do not want to have discussions with you under duress.  We want to talk to you on a basis of equality, respecting your position and your commitment to your views.  We want to show you that we are serious about dialogue, and we want to give you the opportunity to demonstrate your own seriousness.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the central issue &mdash; the issue of whether or not people are serious.  It is up to us, all of us who care about peace and human life, to flush out those who are phony on this issue &mdash; those who are content to talk about dialogue, but in their hearts are not prepared to take the first step towards creating the framework for dialogue.  Above all, we have to seek to flush out whatever seriousness is there and to build on it.</P>
    <P>John Hume, for instance, is clearly one of those prepared to take risks for peace. He has taken an enormous personal risk in the dialogue he has undertaken with Provisional Sinn Féin and, clearly, he has done it in the interests of peace.  I know many people, whose views I respect and admire, who disagree with his decision to take that risk.  For my own part, I hope and pray that he succeeds.  I do not believe that we can prejudge the issue &mdash; there will be great glory if those talks succeed, but there is great courage even in undertaking the risk.  That sort of courage must be extended to the other half of the community in the North.  We cannot wait until the Unionist population is browbeaten into talks.  Their right to self-determination through the political process must be regarded as co-equal with that of Nationalists.  Even if it were likely to happen in my political lifetime, what kind of victory would there be in it?  The only victory I want to see is a victory for <Col N="607" /> all the people of Northern Ireland.  That will come when they all have an equal say in the shaping of their own future, in peace and with a prospect of prosperity. If politicians have to go out on a limb to try to move one step closer to that kind of victory, surely it is a step worth taking.</P>

      <P>There are many aspects of the Minister's speech which I would like to follow up on but unfortunately because of the time constraints I will only be able to refer to a number of them.  Before going on to deal with the issues that I specifically wish to deal with I would like briefly to refer to a number of the points made by Deputy Spring in relation to the Gibraltar incident. Nobody in this House would quibble with the essential need to ensure that neither this State nor the British State descends to the level of the sectarian terrorists who are tearing Irish society apart and that it is absolutely essential that the law be applied scrupulously and fairly in all respects, be it in Gibraltar, Northern Ireland, Britain or in the Republic. However, a very clear distinction has to be made between our concern about and demand for that need and the suggestion that any such concern renders us sympathetic to or ambiguous or ambivalent about the campaign of terror which the Provisional IRA in particular are waging against the people of this island.  It has to be made clear that they are waging a campaign of terror against the people on this island.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am extremely concerned at the way in which public representatives and the media jumps on to the bandwagon of concern following the arrival at a verdict in a court case, be it in Northern Ireland, Britain or in Gibraltar.  We should be extremely cautious about the way in which we respond to these events.  We are, whether we like it or not, if we jump on this bandwagon without giving any serious thought to the consequences, lending indirect sympathy to the terror gangs.  As I said earlier, I am not suggesting that we should not be concerned about this need or not insist on the rule <Col N="608" /> of law, but we must avoid at all costs the State descending to the level of the terrorist and we must be extremely cautious about the way in which we express that view and how we condemn the Provisional IRA who have no hesitation whatsoever about shooting a family to bits without any effort being made to provide them with the right of appeal.  I would make that point very strongly in responding to what Deputy Spring said.</P>
    <P>I was very disappointed that in opening his remarks he referred to the three alleged terrorists in Gibraltar.  The reality is that the Provisional IRA have claimed that the three people involved in the Gibraltar incident were an active service unit and I was quite concerned to hear RTE refer to them as an active service unit.  I have yet to hear RTE declare the Provisional IRA to be a sectarian Nationalist terrorist gang.  Rightly, they quite often refer to Loyalist terror gangs and Loyalist murder gangs but I have never heard them refer to the Provisional IRA as a sectarian terror gang.  As I said, the media and public representatives have to be extremely careful about the way in which they address themselves to the very serious, entangled problems of this island.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer briefly to the question of devolution because there is a great deal of ambiguity on the part of the Irish Government in relation to this issue. Article 4 of the Anglo-Irish Agreement states quite clearly in part (b) that it is the declared policy of the United Kingdom Government that responsibility in respect of certain matters within the powers of the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland should be devolved within Northern Ireland on a basis which would secure widespread acceptance throughout the Community.  The Irish Government support that policy.  I have repeatedly asked the Tánaiste and the Taoiseach in this House to make a statement on whether they support devolution but they have failed to do so.</P>
    <P>The latest response was that it is not a realistic prospect but it will never be a realistic prospect until the British and Irish Governments seriously address <Col N="609" /> themselves to the question of how devolution can be brought about.  All the constitutional democratic parties in Northern Ireland, in principle at least, agree on the need for devolution and a Bill of Rights.  Significantly, under Article 4 of the Anglo-Irish Agreement both the British and Irish Governments agree that there is a need for devolution and that it is necessary for progress, yet this matter has never once been discussed at any of the meetings of the Conference, either during the term of office of the Coalition Government or of the Fianna Fáil Government.  The question has to be asked: why?</P>
    <P>The signing of the Anglo-Irish Agreement raised many hopes and fears.  Three years on, the hopes have not been met while the fears have not been assuaged. The principal hope, though it is an undeclared one, of the signatories was that the Agreement would help in reducing the alienation of the Roman Catholic community, thereby benefiting the SDLP electorally at the expense of Sinn Féin. This has not happened.  On the contrary, Sinn Féin have maintained their share of the vote in Northern Ireland and have spent the best part of this year in formal discussions with the SDLP on the best way forward for Nationalists.  This has been an extraordinary turn around during the past three years.</P>
    <P>This in turn has confirmed the worst suspicions of the Unionists who were excluded from the discussions which led to the Agreement and who were then expected to accept it as a <i>fait accompli.</i> The Agreement weathered the &ldquo;Ulster Says No&rdquo; storm but the great bulk of the Unionist population are as fundamentally opposed to it as they were in 1985.  The level of violence has increased despite the hopes and claims for improved security, while the principal source of that violence &mdash; the Provisional IRA &mdash; enjoys an enhanced status among Nationalists as a result of the talks between Sinn Féin and the SDLP.</P>
    <P>There is little evidence then to suggest that the Agreement has brought about any positive changes in attitude among the mass of the population.  People are <Col N="610" /> more divided than they were in 1985 and there is greater pessimism about the future.  This pessimism is reflected in recent opinion polls.  In September a Marketing Research Consultancy poll found that 62 per cent of Catholics believe the Agreement has achieved little or nothing since its introduction.  A poll carried out by the <i>Belfast Telegraph</i> last month found that 64 per cent of Catholics believe that it has not led to an improvement in the position of Nationalists.  The same poll found that 26 per cent of Catholics were now less in favour of the agreement than in 1985.  These findings do not, of course, tell the whole story.  They need to be measured against the expectations which the Agreement and its advocates generated.</P>
    <P>The situation has deteriorated to such an extent that some observers believe that in Northern Ireland today there exists a more sectarian and more brutally divided society than was the case three years ago.  It is further believed that the agreement has encouraged people to identify their sectarian affilitations, and thereby weakened the position of those in favour of a secular and democratic society.</P>
    <P>For their part the SDLP who had a major input into the creation of the Anglo-Irish Agreement have reverted to mainstream Nationalism and are openly distainful of effort to find a solution confined to Northern Ireland.  Austin Curry of the SDLP has made it clear that they have no historical or ideological commitment to devolution within the existing constitutional framework.  The Provisionals, who are dedicated to destroying the constitutional framework by force, have found common cause with the SDLP in seeking to further the Nationalist case and they are convinced that the basis of a pan-nationalist alliance, embracing Fianna Fáil, exists. The emerging Nationalist consensus puts national unity above all other considerations, including life itself.  Thus, the SDLP have no qualms about talking to the Provisionals who continue to demonstrate that they have no qualms about murder.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="611" /> The prospect of solving the Irish question has turned many heads in the past and it would seem that in this respect Mr. Hume has been caught with the idea that he will find a place in history.  This would seem to be his reason for meeting the Provisionals.  It is a strange paradox that the SDLP have met nearly every party in Northern Ireland, including the Provisionals, except the major elements in Northern Ireland which have to be brought into a democratic solution, that is, the Unionist parties.  Perhaps at some stage Mr. Hume might get around to meeting them.  I hope he is not going to leave it until after he has found a solution which suits him, the Provisionals and the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
    <P>It is time we accepted that the Provisionals are a racist, sectarian organisation and that they must be beaten not simply by making declarations of abhorrence whenever they engage in atrocities but by ensuring that the democratic parties in Northern Ireland get together to form a democratic devolved government in Northern Ireland backed by a Bill of Rights.  There is no other way forward in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>The greatest and most immediate need is peace.  This requires the isolation of the terrorist and the defeat of terrorism.  This is easier said than done but done it must be.  Northern Ireland, and indeed the Republic, cannot afford another 18 years of chronic, unresolved conflict.  The cost in human terms is too high and the violence must be ended before it is too late. This is an issue which might usefully be addressed by the parties to the Anglo-Irish Agreement.  The fight against terrorism needs a clear political direction and is not simply a question of security. The question, ultimately, is one of defending democracy and all democratic parties have a duty in this regard.</P>
    <P>With regard to the current review of the workings of the Agreement, present circumstances demand a fundamental reappraisal and not just a tinkering around with how the Conference should meet or the terms of what they should discuss.  It must consider whether radical <Col N="612" /> changes are needed in the way the Agreement works.  There is evidence to suggest that the Unionist leadership would be willing to enter into serious talks about the political reconstruction of Northern Ireland and the development of new institutional arrangements with the Republic. Any changes to the workings of the Agreement which would facilitate such talks should be made.  For example &mdash; and this is a point The Workers' Party have made repeatedly &mdash; the Maryfield Secretariat inflames Unionist opinion and does so unnecessarily.  The Secretariat should be relocated.  The Minister in his speech said that he believed the location of the Maryfield Secretariat gave confidence and a feeling of security to the Nationalist community.  That is not so. There is no evidence whatsoever to back up that view.  In fact, the opinion poll to which I referred earlier clearly shows that this is not so.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, provision should be made for a cessation of meetings of the Conference to allow for serious inter-party talks in Northern Ireland.  A firm declaration from the British and Irish Governments in favour of democratic devolved government for Northern Ireland, together with agreement on a Bill of Rights, would do much to make progress possible.  It would then be up to all the democratic parties to show how serious they are about bringing an end to the drift in which we are at present involved.</P>
    <P>As I said, there were a number of points with which I wanted to deal with regard to the Minister's speech but there is not sufficient time for me to do so. Perhaps some other Member of my party will be allowed in on the debate during the day.  I want to emphasise that there are certain basic principles which have to be adhered to if peace is to be established on this island.  The first of these is that no paramilitary gang, regardless of how they may appeal to our instincts in relation to a united Ireland or anything else, have a right to kill in our name&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;whether they be Loyalist gangs or Nationalist gangs. That has to be said loudly and clearly by every Deputy in this House.  Progress will only be possible in Northern Ireland through dialogue and it is the responsibility of the British Government and the Irish Government to ensure that the conditions are created for that dialogue to take place.  It is the height of folly for the SDLP or the Fianna Fáil Government to imagine that by refusing to budge they can in some way force the Unionists to accept an All-Ireland dimension.  That is just not on.  It is simply prolonging the agony of the people of Northern Ireland by insisting that they will not allow talks to take place because they have in some way decided that the Anglo-Irish Agreement has been set in stone.</P>

      <P>This is a very important debate and it is right and necessary that the Dáil should have an opportunity to look at the record of the Anglo-Irish Agreement.  The debate so far has been conducted in a very constructive manner, which is to be welcomed.  I was surprised to hear Deputy Dukes refer to the run down in the process, having regard to the fact that the Conference has met on more occasions this year than in any previous year.  The agenda has also been broadened. We on this side of the House are very pleased at the work of the Tánaiste and the Minister for Justice and appreciative of the amount of effort and energy they have put into working with the Conference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the joint statement issued after the last Conference on 2 November both Governments agreed that the emphasis in the review should be on a positive programme for the future and they reaffirmed their commitment to the Agreement. However, much as we may be concerned at the lack of progress since 1985 and the strains caused by a number of <Col N="614" /> British Government decisions during the past difficult year, we must look to the future.  It is important to have a realistic sense of what can be achieved by the Agreement.  It is not in itself a panacea for all the ills of Northern Ireland, but it has the potential to make advances which will benefit all the people of Northern Ireland.  The Government are determined to continue to imbue the review process with a sense of urgency and to continue their task in the Anglo-Irish Conference in a positive and determined spirit.</P>
    <P>Our approach to the review is important for what the working of the Agreement represents i.e. the working of the Anglo-Irish relationship.  The two Governments have agreed that the review should incorporate an overall assessment of the work of the Conference to date in terms of the stated objectives of the Agreement and the relationship between the two countries.  I stress this point from the joint statement of the last Conference about the relationship between the two countries.  Although the Agreement has its own institutions in the Conference and Secretariat, as well as its objectives in Articles 2 to 10, it is fundamentally about the Anglo-Irish relationship and it is important as a further step in the development of the relationship between the two Governments, which began with the communiqué issued from Dublin Castle in 1980 following the meeting between the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister.</P>
    <P>I was surprised at Deputy Kennedy's criticism of the Taoiseach.  No Taoiseach has put more effort into working to resolve the Northern Ireland problem and no Taoiseach has been more sensitive to what needs to be done.  It is important to recognise that at that meeting in 1980 he was to be the first Taoiseach to raise to an international plane the whole context of Northern Ireland and the resolution of the difficulties which exist on this island.  I have had personal experience of the Conference in the health area. In December and June last, I had very useful and constructive meetings with my <Col N="615" /> counterpart in Northern Ireland, Mr. Richard Needham, MP. At those meetings we agreed on a number of measures for improved cross-Border co-operation in the area of health.  Such measures include expanded arrangements for cross-Border referral of patients who would benefit from highly specialised medical treatment; joint assessment of the possibilities for major investment in highly specialised medical procedures which could be made available on a 32-county basis; co-operation in the production of public information material; and improved arrangements for co-operation in the event of major accidents and emergencies.  Last month we agreed to launch in the same month the measles, mumps, rubella immunisation programme on both sides of the Border. These are just some of the areas of positive co-operation between the North and South which are being further developed. There is, I believe, scope for greater co-operation and I hope that the current review of the working of the agreement will provide an impetus for expanding the range of such co-operation.</P>
    <P>We must all be concerned at the level of violence in Northern Ireland, going back well beyond the past 20 years.  There is no such thing as an acceptable level of violence.  Anything that damages or injures the individual or takes his life is entirely unacceptable and must be so to all right-thinking people on this island. We must be concerned about certain aspects of what is happening in Northern Ireland.  I would refer to the administration of justice and the relations between the security forces and the community, which are of particular interest to the constituents I represent who live along the Border.  Their concern is not only for those living on the northern side of the Border.  Their concern is also for themselves because many of them have direct experience of the problems that the Conference is seeking to address and bring to an end.</P>
    <P>The following is a quotation from the report by Lord Scarman into the civil disturbances in Northern Ireland in 1969:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="616" /> It is painfully clear from the evidence adduced before us that by July the Catholic minority no longer believed that the RUC was impartial...the effect of this hostility on the RUC themselves was unfortunate.  They came to treat as their enemies, and accordingly also as the enemies of the public peace those who persisted in displaying hostility and distrust towards them.</P>
    <P>Now, after 20 years, there is still a serious lack of confidence on the part of the Nationalist community in the administration of justice.  Building that trust and confidence is a complicated and sensitive task.  It will not be achieved by relying simply on new or tougher security measures.  A political policy is also required and concrete measures are desperately needed to improve the present situation.  Confidence in the institutions of State is fundamental to any normal society.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Foreign Affairs has already spoken about the continuing problem of harassment by the security forces of members of the Nationalist community in Northern Ireland.  This is an every day problem experienced by ordinary people.  It is a fundamental problem because it goes to the heart of Nationalist alienation.  It is a very serious problem because harassment of youngsters by the security forces can cause them to turn in anger to the IRA.  It is a problem which simply must be solved. The responsibility lies with the senior officers of the RUC, with the local commanders of the armed forces and with the British Government, who have failed to take sufficiently direct and co-ordinated action to monitor incidents of harassment and stop them recurring.  Even after 20 years there appears to be a belief in the British Government that security is the answer to the problem.  Nothing could be more unrealistic because security by itself will solve nothing.</P>
    <P>This year marks the 20th anniversary of the original civil rights protest.  The failure at that time to address the real <Col N="617" /> grievances of the minority community has been compounded by subsequent failures which have been exploited by the men of violence on both sides and have led to the continuing instability of the past 20 years.  Too often the British Government have sought to tackle the symptom of violence without at the same time addressing the underlying causes of instability in Northern Ireland.  There is now in the Anglo-Irish Conference and Secretariat a serious attempt by both the British and Irish Governments to address those underlying causes.</P>
    <P>It is important to stress that the role of the Irish Government is to put forward views and proposals.  It is the British Government who in the final analysis take the decision and bear the responsibility for each specific action of Government, althought it is important to note that the Agreement requires that determined efforts should be made to resolve differences.  There are certainly different approaches and there are frequently different views on matters that are discussed at the conference table and, indeed, on some matters that are decided without due regard for the prerogatives of the Conference and the necessity for prior consultation &mdash; the Tánaiste gave an example of the Stalker report.  I know my colleagues, the Tánaiste and Minister for Justice have a difficult and sensitive task, but it is a vital one which deserves the appreciation of this House and of Nationalists throughout Ireland.</P>
    <P>I would recall what the Taoiseach said in his opening statement to the New Ireland Forum in 1983:</P>
    <P>It is common ground amongst us in the Forum that we are prepared to work in close co-operation with any British Government to bring forward a solution to the problem that continuously distorts Anglo-Irish relations and relations within this island because no British Government will be able to provide any solution to the problem other than in partnership with the Irish Government.</P>
    <P>Those are words which we will do well to remember in assessing the controversies <Col N="618" /> of the past year and what our attitude should be for the future.  They represent the bedrock of Irish Nationalist views of our relationship with Britain in so far as Northern Ireland is concerned.</P>
    <P>In recognition of this reality, the Government accepted the agreement on coming into office and we have committed every effort to making it work as effectively as possible through numerous meetings of the Conference &mdash; in 1988 there were more meetings than in any other year &mdash; through the constant channel of the Secretariat and through the diplomatic and informal contacts which are available to us.</P>
    <P>We have pressed the agenda of reform in regard to the administration of justice and relations between the security forces and the community.  We have committed our energy and resources to the task of saving life and property in both parts of this island, which is what security co-operation aims to do, and we have broadened the agenda to give high attention also to economic, social and cultural development, and especially to fair employment.  It is encouraging to see that there is some move towards improving the economic situation in west Belfast.  I would like to see this extended to other areas, especially to both sides of the Border.</P>
    <P>It has been recognised that the Border has had a devastating effect on the economy of towns like Clones in my constitutency, which is surrounded on three sides by Fermanagh and has its hinterland not alone cut off by the Border but by road-blocks which do not give people access to the town.  I would like to see more development through the International Fund set up under Article 10 of the Agreement.</P>
    <P>There is need for urgent action.  This morning the Tánaiste quoted the percentage of Nationalists who are dissatisfied with the Anglo-Irish Agreement. It is not that they are expecting too much but there has been too little by way of change to date, and we would like to see some improvement in this area.</P>
    <P>This morning, Deputy Dukes referred <Col N="619" /> to a unitary Ireland.  I would not apologise to anyone for believing that a united Ireland is ultimately the right solution. Fianna Fáil still adhere to the thrust of the Forum report.  It was disappointing to note this morning that the Leader of Fine Gael appeared to be effectively abandoning this agreed Nationalist position. The Government will use the present review to redouble those efforts in the Conference and secretariat to further develop the Anglo-Irish relationship.</P>

      <P>I want to make a very brief reference to what Deputy Spring said today.  My views on what happened in Gibraltar on 6 March are fairly well known.  At the time I thought the security forces had the power to arrest and bring people to trial and that that should have been done.  I agreed with Deputy De Rossa when he rebuked Deputy Spring for referring to alleged terrorists.  These people were terrorists.  They were sent to kill, maim and destroy property. However, I believe they should have been arrested and brought before a court and I was critical of the British Government's handling of the affair.  For that reason, I will not be critical of the British Government when they arrest people and bring them before the court, because that is the way the rule of law should operate and I will not adopt a different standard when something happens outside the residence of the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland to that adopted when something happened in Gibraltar.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know how authentic are the documents Deputy Spring says he has.  In my view he has taken the right decision in submitting them to the Government, to let the Government process them and take the matter up with the British Government, if necessary.  Whether Deputy Spring should have said this to the Government in private or in this House is a matter on which I will not adjudicate but if he has important evidence in this regard, then the right step to take was to give it to the Government. The Anglo-Irish Agreement was put <Col N="620" /> before this House three years ago as a framework within which progress could be achieved in Northern Ireland in order to end sectarian divisions, counter discrimination and injustice and begin the process towards reconciliation and stabilisation. If the Agreement has not yet reached its potential, it is not because of any inherent defect in the Agreement itself but because it has not been worked in the past 18 months.</P>
    <P>In the first 18 months the Agreement showed that it was capable of delivering on a number of levels.  There was considerable progress in a number of areas: in housing &mdash; the destruction of the Divis flats in west Belfast and the flats in Derry &mdash; in laws relating to the handling of parades &mdash; a sensitive area and last year the marching season went off almost without incident for the first time in 100 years &mdash; in the law on incitement to hatred, in the policy on the Irish language, in prisons policy &mdash; the so-called &ldquo;detained at the Secretary of State's pleasure&rdquo;&mdash; in the laws on flags and emblems, in the law on the handling of police complaints, in the area of the supergrass trials, in the reform of the Emergency Provisions Act, in the accompaniment of the UDR by the police &mdash; when I was co-chairman I pushed this at every Conference meeting, even though there had been improvement.  I fully appreciated the logistical difficulties faced by the Chief of the RUC in this regard, but progress was much too slow &mdash; in the most sensitive areas there was not a sufficiently high level of accompaniment of the UDR by the RUC &mdash; and most crucially of all, in relations between the police and the minority community in the administration of justice.  We cannot underline too often the necessity for any community having confidence in the security and police forces.  Otherwise it is a recipe for the destruction of democracy.</P>
    <P>The fact that President Reagan in his last few months in office sent a further note of encouragement to both Governments to continue their work on the Anglo Irish Agreement is an indication of the value which our friends in America place on the Agreement and the potential <Col N="621" /> they see for achieving the objective of bringing about peace and reconciliation. I am pleased that the President remembered the anniversary of the Agreement and encouraged us to work harder at it.</P>
    <P>The cancer of discrimination in employment has been eating away in Northern Ireland for many years but the legislation which will, I hope, be passed within the next six months will change this.  The slow pace of progress in Northern Ireland is directly attributable to the failure of the Dublin and London Governments to work the Agreement to the full.  Both Governments are to blame in this regard.  The Minister for Health spoke about the number of times the conference met this year and the Tánaiste said exactly the same thing.  Unfortunately, too many of these meetings were not convened on a regular basis to do the ordinary work of the Conference but were called as a reaction to some insensitive handling of an issue by the British Government.  The Anglo-Irish Conference should not operate on the basis of crisis management, it should be a practical working conference and firm in its purpose to pursue the objectives of the Agreement.  Article 3 of the joint communique issued with the Agreement states that the Agreement has the aim of promoting peace and stability in Northern Ireland; helping to reconcile the two major traditions in Ireland; creating a new climate of friendship and co-operation between the people of the two countries and improving co-operation in combating terrorism.</P>
    <P>In the past 18 months the momentum for change and progress has slowed to a halt.  Article 7, which sets out the priority of tackling the relations between the security forces and the minority community and the identification of measures which would promote confidence in the administration of justice, has been ignored by both Governments with the result that the men of violence continue to dictate the agenda.  We continue to have crisis meetings and it was only at the last meeting, after I had called attention to it numerous times, that they decided that these matters should be at <Col N="622" /> the top of the agenda for next month's meeting of the Conference.  The administration of justice and the issue of no confidence in the security forces should be at the top of the agenda of every meeting of the Conference.  Now, when it comes to the review date, both Governments, belatedly realise the necessity for a practical programme of action.  They also propose to take a number of months to complete the review.  No satisfactory reason was given by the Tánaiste or the Minister for Health for taking four months to review the Agreement.  The delay is totally unacceptable and only came about because of previous inactivity on the part of both Governments.  Did they not know over the past three years that the Agreement had to be reviewed in November 1988?  They have done nothing in the meantime.</P>
    <P>Since last January we have been saying what is required and late in September the Leader of Fine Gael, Deputy Dukes, outlined our proposals for the next stage of the Anglo-Irish Conference.  This delay encourages extremists on both sides to feel that they have another period of time in which to get rid of the Anglo-Irish Agreement.  The Provisional IRA will continue their bombing campaign in the hope that they will disgust the British Government so much they will walk away from the Agreement.  The Unionists must change their position &mdash; I do not say that in any sense of triumphalism as I do not wish to see them humiliated in any way &mdash; but they must not be given any further hope that this delay means that if they push harder the Agreement will become unbalanced and will not continue. It was an extremely silly decision by both Governments to take this long to review the working of the Agreement.</P>
    <P>We accept and look forward to making a contribution towards bringing together the leaders of parties to which the Tánaiste referred and we will have an input: Over the last number of years people in both parts of the island have been forced to re-think their position and to confront the reality of the divisions and instability in Northern Ireland.  I was disappointed to hear the Minister for Health talking <Col N="623" /> about the old-fashioned Fianna Fáil unitary State because it is not in keeping with what is required at the end of the 20th century.  I very much regret the intransigence of Fianna Fáil whose only option is a unitary State, whatever the cost to either or both communities in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>I should like to remind the Taoiseach and Minister O'Hanlon that they put their names to the whole Forum report and not just to the part dealing with a unitary State, the only part which the Taoiseach seems to recall.  During 1983-84 Nationalist politicians representing all the parties, with Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil, Labour and the SDLP, participated in the New Ireland Forum.  Our report demonstrated a radical re-think by constitutional Nationalists and by all the people who put their names to that report.  The Forum report, Chapter 4.15 recognises the right of Unionists to effective, political, symbolic and administrative expression of their indentity, their ethos and their way of life in a new Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Anglo-Irish Agreement of November 1985 recognised that a condition of genuine reconciliation and dialogue between Unionists and Nationalists is mutual recognition and acceptance of each other's rights.  The Unionist community in Northern Ireland must recognise that we in our part of Ireland have made progress in meeting them, and that that progress is internationally recognised, in our acceptance of their rights as citizens of this island.</P>
    <P>The Agreement represents a framework for progress.  It is not a solution, nor was it ever intended to be.  If real progress is to be made, then all sides will have to rethink their positions and consider options other than their first choice.  Nationalists must be prepared to look at options other than a united Ireland and the Unionists must be prepared to consider a devolved power-sharing administration.  The British Government have moved, the Irish Nationalists have moved and I believe &mdash;<Col N="624" /> I do not want to say this in any triumphalist sense &mdash; that the Unionists must accept that they too have to move. The Agreement can facilitate that rethink as indeed it represented a change in the perception of the British Government of the role of the Irish Government in Northern Ireland.  I will have to remind the House that just six years ago the British Prime Minister stated in the House of Commons that an Irish Government or an Irish Minister had no role and no function in anything relating to Northern Ireland.  Now Ministers from both Governments sit at the conference table and discuss issues that directly affect the lives of the people in Northern Ireland.  Irish Ministers know their point of view is and must, under this internationally binding agreement, be taken into consideration.</P>
    <P>It is to the Unionist community that many politicians on both islands are looking for the final unlocking of the political impasse.  There is evidence of an internal debate among the Unionist parties about the best way to proceed.  Dialogue is crucial to the process of achieving peace and stability in Northern Ireland.  However, as I have pointed out on many occasions, the kind of dialogue necessary for real progress requires all the parties involved and engaged in the process.  The Taoiseach has indicated on a number of occasions his willingness, and indeed his desire, to engage in talks with the different parties in Northern Ireland.  One wonders what strength of purpose lies behind these indications.  I am not alone in wanting confirmation of the substantial policies which underlie these public statements &mdash; public statements do not constitute the dialogue itself.  The potential for success in many talks which the Government may undertake in the coming months will depend on Mr. Haughey's ability to convince all parties that he has a clear, unambiguous and constructive vision of the future for all the people on this island.</P>

      <P>I am sorry.  Clarity of vision and firmness of purpose are essential and any kind of equivocation which hangs over the operation of the Extradition Act is hardly likely to inspire confidence in defeating terrorism.  There has been some talk recently about the 1976 Act. That Act was meant to operate in cases where extradition did not work.  It is not a substitution for extradition.  Both Acts must be used in this regard.  Extradition must be kept in place and the 1976 Act should be used after that if necessary.</P>
      <P>The future of the country lies in the hands of those who are willing to commit their energies to the long and often difficult process of achieving peace, prosperity and equality on this island.  In the Anglo-Irish Agreement we have the means of bringing that about.  I have no hesitation in welcoming this debate and I hope that another three years will not elapse before we can review the Agreement again.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Collins) Gerard Collins">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to comment on the issues, and particularly the allegations, raised by Deputy Spring.  Any information he has, when it is received, will be very carefully examined.</P>
      <P>It is important that the Dáil should have this opportunity to consider the record of the three years since it debated the Anglo-Irish Agreement.  I think the House will agree that the debate should be conducted in a constructive spirit which will help assist the Government's conduct of the review of the Agreement with the British Government over the next few months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In accordance with Article 11 of the agreement, this review is about the working of the Anglo-Irish Conference.  In the joint statement issued after the last conference on 2 November, both Governments recognised the political importance of the review process as an opportuntiy at the end of three years to undertake a thorough and serious review of the working of the Conference under each of the headings of the Agreement. They also agreed that work would begin on an overall assessment of the work of <Col N="626" /> the Conference to date in terms of the stated objective of the Agreement and the relationship between the two countries. They agreed that the emphasis should be on a positive programme for the future and they reaffirmed their commitment to the Agreement.</P>
    <P>Deputies will recall that it was here in Dublin eight years ago that a British Prime Minister acknowledged for the first time that the problem of Northern Ireland could only be solved by the joint action of the two sovereign Governments. The establishment of the Anglo-Irish Conference and the Secretariat was a further step in the new relationship between the two Governments which was set in motion at that time by the Taoiseach, Deputy Haughey, and the British Prime Minister, Mrs. Thatcher.</P>
    <P>Since the Agreement concerns the relationship between the two Governments, the review means more than stocktaking and internal processes, although these things are important.  It means a serious assessment of the quality of the relationship that has been developing between the two Governments as well as the product of that relationship so far.</P>
    <P>It is clear from the public debate that is already taking place on the third anniversary of the Agreement, that there is very wide support for the development of the relationship between the two Governments and for the efforts which this Government have made in that direction since taking office in March of 1987. We made it clear at once that we regarded the Agreement as legally binding and that we would work it vigorously and as effectively as we could.  I believe the record shows that we have spared nothing in doing just that.  We have held frequent, regular meetings and we have pressed forward with an agenda of economic and social development, fair employment, confidence in the administration of justice, including relations between the security forces and the community, and security co-operation.</P>
    <P>Nor have we neglected the question of political progress.  We would like to have a situation in which members of the Unionist community were also playing <Col N="627" /> their full part in easing tensions and planning constructively for the future.  Unionists now have an opportunity to take a step forward and I seriously hope that they will respond positively to the invitation of both Governments to convey their views on the review process.</P>
    <P>I want to turn now to security co-operation for which I have specific responsibility. Article 9 of the Agreement says that with a view to enhancing cross-Border co-operation on security matters, the Conference shall put in hand a programme of work to be undertaken by the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána, the Chief Constable of the Royal Ulster Constabulary and, where appropriate, groups of officials in such areas as threat assessments, exchange of information, liaison structures, technical co-operation, training of personnel and operational resources.  The Agreement also states, and I think it is important to stress this, that responsibility for police operations shall remain with the heads of the respective police forces.</P>
    <P>The House will not expect me to go into the detail of discussions in the Conference on cross-Border security co-operation. Suffice it to say that it is acknowledged by both Governments that security co-operation is now the best it has ever been.  Relations between the two police forces are close and constructive. Each force does things its own way within its own jurisdiction, while co-operating to meet the common objective of protecting the lives of all the people of this island.</P>
    <P>I will not pretend that the two sides always agree on issues that arise in the security area.  In security as in everything else, co-operation is a two-way street. Full co-operation is given to the British Government in their efforts to control the security situation, to prevent acts of violence and to bring violent offenders to justice.  We expect the same, and we receive the same, in relation to threats from the North to peace and security in the South.  Listening as well as talking is part of security co-operation.  There are policies we will advise against and there are policies we believe should be adopted <Col N="628" /> or pursued more actively.  At the end of the day, I stress again, decisions are made by each Government in their own jurisdiction. Each Government are responsible in their own decisions and co-operation is pursued on that basis and only on that basis.</P>
    <P>It sometimes appears that the Government are being pressed on a continuing basis in the British media and by British politicians to &ldquo;do more&rdquo; on security.  I want to say that this view is not put forward by Mr. King or by his deputy, Mr. Stewart, with whom we have excellent and cordial relations, nor by responsible members of the British Government and the security forces, but it is still there.</P>
    <P>Let me say that security co-operation is about the saving of life and property and the maintenance of peace and order. That is a duty of both Governments.  Both Governments have firmly condemned violence and seek to bring it to an end. Both Governments seek to control the security situation in their own jurisdiction. Both Governments seek security co-operation to these ends and both Governments keep all aspects of security under review with a view to making improvements.  That is a constant ongoing process.  There is no question of one Government pressing the other to co-operate to act in the interest of saving lives.  There is no question of either Government being reluctant to do so. What may be a question from time to time is the method of doing so.  When we hear of more security co-operation being required, what is meant more often than not are measures which we on the Irish side believe will not only fail to bring an improvement to the security situation, but will actually make it worse.</P>
    <P>The record of the Garda Síochána in recent times has been quite remarkable and I want to take this opportunity to pay a tribute to them.  As the House will be aware, following the arrest of the <i>Eksund</i> in October of last year, a nationwide arms search was initiated by the Government and carried out by the Garda with the support of the Army.  &ldquo;Operation Mallard&rdquo;, as it is known, was a decided success, but the record does not end there. <Col N="629" /> It has a wider context.  Since the beginning of 1986, the Garda have seized over 850 firearms, about 190,000 rounds of ammunition, almost 5,000 lbs. of home-made explosives, over 630 lbs. of semtex, large numbers of home-made pipe bombs, mortars and grenades, detonators, assorted bomb-making materials and various explosive and incendiary devices.  These finds have been occurring regularly.  As recently as last Monday, the Garda seized a major haul of nitrobenzine, a substance which is used to boost the detonating ability of home-made explosives.  Much remains to be done to discover the other weapons and explosives which are concealed North and South.  We are proud of the record of the past three years and proud too of the close support the Garda Síochána may rely on from our community in their efforts to protect life and property and counter subversion.</P>
    <P>I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate the RUC on their finds in Northern Ireland and, in particular, on the exceptional find this morning in Markethill, County Armagh.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not correct to say that there has been no response to the Arts Council's proposals.  They have formed the background to the consideration of Exchequer and national lottery funding of arts and culture.  Total <Col N="630" /> funding by my Department of cultural projects and agencies and of the Arts Council increased to £16.3 million in 1988 as compared to £11.1 million in 1986. That represented a 46.8 per cent increase.  As recommended by the Arts Council's five-year plan, considerable additional funding was provided from lottery sources to maintain support for existing arts centres and facilitate the creation of those planned for major centres of population.  Funding totalling £1.6 million was given to 15 specific projects endorsed in the council's plan.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Tánaiste is talking about in terms of funding given to various areas of the arts has nothing whatsoever to do with the question asked. Will he give me a response to the question as to why the Arts Council were never invited to discuss their plan and why there was no formal recognition that such a plan existed?  The plan was a five-year development plan produced by a body who have statutory responsibility for development of the contemporary arts. Why was no indication forthcoming at any stage from the Taoiseach or his Department that they had any consideration or regard for this plan?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="The Tánaiste Brian (Snr.) Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly the plan can be considered, but I was at pains to say in the reply that there are a number of other avenues in respect of arts and culture that have been facilitated to the very substantial degree of increase I have mentioned, outside the Arts Council themselves.  The Arts Council are not the sole mechanism through which funds can be allocated to arts and culture projects and programmes.</P>

      <P>The document in question, the plan of the Arts Council, was sent to the Taoiseach's Department in June 1987 after six months' hard work by the Arts Council arising from the Government publication <i>Access and Opportunity, A White Paper on Cultural Policy</i> which was brought out in January 1987.  The question of funding through <Col N="631" /> the Arts Council to the arts was addressed in this document.  They did not ask to be the sole funder of artistic endeavour but they fulfilled their statutory obligations. Would the Tánaiste not agree that to disregard the work of an expert body of people involved in the artistic world in every aspect and to ignore the just demands of festivals and bodies all over the country&mdash;&mdash;</P>

It is not as if, as the Deputy suggests, there is no contact between the Arts Council and the Department of the Taoiseach.  There are regular ongoing discussions between them on allocations and desirable funding of projects, but there is a more flexible approach in that it is not just within the Arts Council as such but other means are being adopted whereby valuable work can be done by way of expenditure on arts and culture.</P>

In view of all he has said about additional funding separate from estimated funding, have the principles of the plan prepared by the Arts Council been accepted?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="The Tánaiste Brian (Snr.) Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a black and white matter of that kind.  There are a number of bodies under the arts and culture heading and Deputy Higgins himself is well aware of one in my own Department where we have doubled the funding under our cultural allocation by topping up the Exchequer contribution by funding from the national lottery.  Then you have the Arts Council and a number of other bodies who do not qualify either under my heading or the Arts Council's heading.  It is not a black and white matter of considering plans; it is a question of meeting projects and programmes submitted and allocating moneys after consultation with the officials and the Director of the Arts Council on how best funds should be allocated and where they should be allocated.  We are not in a strait jacket of a plan.  We are dealing with art and culture.  We are dealing with matters that are outside the narrow framework of a plan or anything of that nature.</P>

      <P>Considering the extensive moneys that are allocated to the arts area, do the Government have any proposals or plan for the future, their own or that of the Arts Council, for the devlopment of art?  Will the Taoiseach, at this stage meet with the Arts Council to discuss that matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="The Tánaiste Brian (Snr.) Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>I will certainly take up this matter with the Taoiseach's Department. Both the Taoiseach's Department <Col N="634" /> and the Department of Foreign Affairs have benefited enormously from the lottery, and it is very important to remember that.  While one can have guidelines, arts and culture require an ongoing treatment depending on the circumstances of each case.  Surely the Government have shown their bona fides by the increase of the order of 47 per cent in expenditure in 1988 over 1986 under the heading of arts and culture.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>The necessary structural adaptations to enable the establishment of a gallery of modern art at the Royal Hospital, Kilmainham have to be completed before it can be opened to the public.  In the meantime, the generous gift from Mr. Gordon Lambert of works from his collection is being conserved in a portion of the building.</P>

      <P>They only began a short while ago.  I can write to inform the Deputy fully, but I can tell her that they <Col N="635" /> will take another 12 months to conclude. The work started early in 1988.  There are substantial adaptations being undertaken which will take another 12 months.</P>
      <P>An allocation of £500,000 is being made from the national lottery for this purpose and this is another example of our bona fides in this matter.  When we have the space, the Gordon Lambert Collection will be on display and the public will be admitted.  That is an example of what I meant when I said in response to the earlier question that this is ongoing and covers a much wider field than that envisaged in the original plan.  We are now adopting a very wide and flexible approach to all aspects of arts and culture and this is an example of where we are spending money as of now.  We have a treasure house in the Royal Hospital in Kilmainham.</P>

I would remind the Tánaiste that the Arts Council is the body who have statutory responsibility for the contemporary arts in Ireland, and if modern art does not come under contemporary arts, I do not know what does. It is a pity that this information has to be dragged out of the Government at Question Time.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>The Arts Council and the Department of the Taoiseach are the two main areas concerned with the development of arts and culture.  Monitoring is an ongoing factor.  Obviously the day to day administration of institutions that money has been allocated to will be borne in mind considering future allocations. That goes without saying.  The thrust has been towards capital allocation of late, particularly from the Taoiseach's Department.  That is better than getting involved in day to day administration.</P>

Tá cúram na seirbhíse ar Chóras Iompair Éireann agus tá an bord ag ullmhú cuntais iomlán dom faoi láthair faoin tseirbhís san fhadtréimhse. Féadfaidh an Teach a bheith cinnte de go scrúdóidh mé an tuairisc seo láithreach bonn agus go socrófar ceist na seirbhíse gan mhoill.  Idir an dá linn, leanfaidh Córas Iompair Éireann ar aghaidh leis tseirbhís farantóireachta a cuireadh in ionad an <i>Naomh Éanna</i> le déanaí trí shocrú a rinne an bord le conraitheoir príobháideach.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising from the Minister's reply in which he referred to CIE, would he not agree that CIE have acted irresponsibly in their knowledge that the <i>Naomh Éanna</i> would not pass its certification test and that they allowed the service to go out of existence without any contingency plan and gave short notice to their employees?  What basis is there for the assurances given to the islanders last Sunday week by the Minister of State at the Department of Education that the Government were hopeful of European funding for financing the roll-on roll-off service?  Finally, does he accept the report which was commissioned and agreed and cost £30,000, which was put forward to his Department so many years ago when he was previously a Minister in the Department for a resolution of this problem in the long term?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Firstly, I reject the Deputy's suggestion that CIE were irresponsible in regard to this matter.  If CIE had not put in place a service I would accept that they would have been irresponsible. I do not accept that they were irresponsible because they have put in place a good service to the islands as of now.  The other question the Deputy asked related to some statement made by the Minister of State.  I am not aware of what exactly the Minister of State said, but I would like to place it in the general context of what is going on at present, namely, consideration in the regions of all kinds of development with a view to availing of the new double structural funds in Europe.</P>

I am anxious to establish the status of an assurance given on behalf of the Minister by the Minister of State at the Department of Education last Sunday week at a public meeting attended by Deputy Molloy and myself.

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not true that the Minister's Department have had this matter under active consideration since 1978 when they received the first B &amp; I report on the transport of passengers and goods to the Aran Islands and also that the Aran Islands transport committee submitted a report to his Department in October 1984 and that both of these reports recommended similar solutions, basically, a daily roll-on roll-off service for Ros a'Mhíl?  Would he now indicate his decision regarding the type of boats to be used on the service, the mainland and island terminals and the structure of the organisation to run the services?  There is no money involved.  It is just a decision of Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy that there were proposals in my Department when he was a member of Government and in the mid-eighties as well.  I want to repeat and to make it clear to the House that as of now and in the new circumstances Roinn na Gaeltacht and CIE are putting a plan together which I have not yet received and I cannot make a judgment on it until I have seen it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Tourism and Transport if his Department are combining with any other Government Department in a formal structure in order to develop a cohesive transport plan in the approach to 1992.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned to ensure that our transport sector is equipped to meet the challenges and opportunities which the Single European Market will present and that the sector is adequately developed to allow Irish industry to compete effectively in Europe.  I am, therefore, reviewing with my colleagues, the Ministers for Finance, Industry and Commerce, the Environment, Energy and the Marine, the priorities which need to be set and the measures which should be taken to meet the needs of Irish industry and Irish tourism, having regard particularly to our island location.</P>
      <P>At national level, the Government are at present preparing a development plan for presentation to the EC Commission to ensure that Ireland is fully equipped to meet the challenges posed by the completion of the internal market in 1992 and that we obtain the maximum possible assistance from the EC in financing the plan.  The specific proposals I am developing for the transport sector will fit within this overall framework and are designed to ensure that in the approach to 1992, Ireland will have efficient, high quality and cost-effective transport services to meet the needs of our trading sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As part of the Government's national awareness and information campaign, I held a conference on the implications of the single market for the tourism and transport sectors on 2 November.  The <Col N="648" /> conference was addressed by representatives of the European Commission, Government Departments, State bodies and transport operations and was attended by upwards of 150 representatives of State bodies and trade and professional organisations.  The purpose of the conference was to impress on the tourism and transport industries the opportunities and challenges which the Single European Market will present and to obtain the views of these two sectors on the problems and questions that need to be addressed.</P>
    <P>My prime objective in the run up to 1992 will be to enable the transport and tourism sectors to derive maximum benefit from the opportunities presented by the Single European Market, and to ensure that Irish Industry is not disadvantaged by our peripheral location within the European Community.  We shall have to ensure that our cost structures, regulatory frameworks, development programmes and initiatives are flexible enough to enable us to capitalise on the new opportunities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his comprehensive reply.  The purpose of the conference held on 2 November, which was so well attended, was, the Minister says, to impress on industry the need for preparation for 1992.  My supplementary question to the Minister is: in view of the fact that the people speaking at that conference used the occasion to impress on the Minister the need for cohesive policy and for considerable expenditure on transport infrastructure, what response does he intend making to the call by very many different sectors, including the Confederation of Irish Industry, for cohesive work on sea, airport and roads facilities?  I am well aware that the Minister does not control the whole of the transport area.  I might repeat my question: in view of the calls made at that conference, what formal structures will the Minister be putting in place, with his colleagues, to develop a cohesive transport structure including roads, sea and air?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The substance of my reply gave an indication to the Deputy.  I agree with her that it is a two-way process and the conference was convened for that purpose, so that I could tell them where I saw challenges, even dangers, and opportunities, so that, in turn, they could indicate to me and my Department where they thought Government action could be taken to improve the position.  I did mention that I am working specially with the Department of Finance, Industry and Commerce, Environment, Energy and the Marine as of now, precisely for&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>But there is no special formal structure in place?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Ministers for Finance, Industry and Commerce, Environment, Energy, the Marine and Tourism and Transport meet, the Deputy is entitled to her interpretation as to whether or not that is formal.  But the fact is that, with the backing of our Departments, we are addressing precisely the question the Deputy raised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>When can we expect to see a cohesive transport plan for 1992 from this Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be well ahead of 1992.  As the Deputy very properly said, there are areas not covered by my Department but which are covered within the range of Ministries I have just mentioned.  The plans to impact on the Structural Funds must and will be in place long before 1992.  I could speak at some length on the sectoral parts of transport and what is being done at present. However, that is not covered by the question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOMalley" hpid="Mr. P. O'Malley Mr. P. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree with the point raised by Deputy Hussey that a formal structure needs to be put in place to co-ordinate transport policy.  Given that the Minister does not have responsibility for all aspects of transport he cannot report to this House on matters relating to road development, ports, international shipping, all of which <Col N="650" /> are integral parts of an overall comprehensive transport structure?  It is unsatisfactory that the Minister is not able to answer questions in this House in relation to transport generally because his responsibility does not apply to those areas I have mentioned.  Arising out of that, as I am sure the Minister is aware, the Confederation of Irish Industry have been saying for a long time that 9 per cent of their total manufacturing costs are devoted to transport functions on which they spend approximately £1,000 million per annum.  In order to be more cost-effective would the Minister not agree that we must develop a comprehensive transport policy and that formal structures must be put in place to achieve that aim?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I take on board the comments made by Deputy Pat O'Malley. Quite frankly I do not see any logic in the statement that if a group of Ministers with responsibility over the whole range of transport and infrastructure are meeting, working hard and studying these problems it would be any better to have a formal committee or arrangement in that regard.  I did take the opportunity of addressing the Confederation of Irish Industry &mdash; mentioned by Deputy O'Malley &mdash; on these problems.  I am fully aware of the study which the Confederation of Irish Industry undertook indicating that it cost them 9 per cent of their total expenditure to provide transport whereas, in Europe, it costs 5 per cent. What we are actually addressing at present is a reduction in the gap between 5 per cent and 9 per cent in favour of those involved in Irish industry who carry the 9 per cent transport costs.</P>

      <P>I can tell the Deputy that that matter has been discussed with the Commissioner.  Without doing any violence to normal expectations, or being over euphoric, I can say that the Commissioner is very hopeful that substantial sums of money will be available from the Structural Funds.  Also under consideration is the establishment of a special transport fund within the Commission. Some EC Members are opposed to the idea of a special transport fund as distinct from the structural funds we have been discussing during this Question Time. The present Commissioner is committed to such a separate transport fund.  I might add that there is an <i>ad hoc</i> fund in existence from which we have been benefiting now for some years.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Tourism and Transport the arrangements he is making to compensate for the loss of one of the three United States air carriers into Ireland, Northwest Airlines, which ceases operations on 26 November 1988.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Northwest Airlines, who operated daily services between Boston and Shannon during the 1988 summer season, has announced their intention to cease operations between the US and Ireland after their last flight on 25 <Col N="658" /> November.  While the decision to terminate services is to be regretted, I am satisfied that Aer Lingus have adequate capacity to meet demand between Ireland and Boston this winter.  With regard to next summer, plans by Aer Lingus to increase their capacity on this route and other North Atlantic routes are well advanced.  These involve the acquisition on a temporary lease basis for the summer of an additional aircraft which will enable Aer Lingus to operate a daily service to Boston, two additional flights weekly to New York and a once weekly service to Chicago, to which Aer Lingus will be resuming services after an absence of eight years.  As a result, Aer Lingus will have their largest ever schedule of services and fleet on the US-Ireland routes in 1989.  Aer Lingus are also planning to increase their marketing and advertising expenditure in support of plans for tourism development.</P>
      <P>While I would welcome additional US carrier service to Ireland, I am satisfied that the total capacity to be provided by Aer Lingus, Delta and Pan Am on US-Ireland routes in summer 1989 will be higher than in 1988.  Looking beyond 1989 I would like to see direct service to Ireland from additional points in the US, including in particular a point on the west coast, and negotiations on that issue have been commenced with the US authorities.</P>

      <P>The Minister will be aware that the loss of the Northwest Airlines service will mean the loss of some 30,000 tourists and that the airline now run a service between Detroit and Paris. In his reply the Minister raised the question of flying rights to the west coast.  In view of the fact that the reports on those discussions are not optimistic and the fact that the US authorities are being less than helpful in this matter would the Minister not see, as part of his responsibilities, the need for him to get involved in these discussions in regard to flying rights to the west coast and that it is he who should be out in America conducting these talks?  These matters must be treated with <Col N="659" /> much more seriousness than is the case at present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the figure of 30,000, I think I have already answered that question and indicated the services for 1989.  These will more than cover the number taken to this country in 1988 or the capacity that was available in 1988. Secondly, with regard to the negotiations for a locus on the west coast, preliminary discussions have already taken place between the highest ranking officials in my Department and officials in Washington. The Deputy said that the vibes she was getting on that were not too good.  All I can say is that the discussions will resume in the early part of 1989.  The Deputy will realise that there will be a change in the administration in the United States and that this in a sense was in the background all the time the discussions were taking place.  We will resume the discussions strongly&mdash;at ministerial level, if necessary &mdash; to try to get a place on the West coast of the US for Aer Lingus.  I can assure the Deputy of that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">

      <P>The Minister indicated that Aer Lingus should be able to take up the market segment left over as a result of the withdrawal of North West Airlines.  May I ask the Minister if he is concerned that North West Airlines who have a vast route network in the United States, who have had Ireland in their marketing system, who have been selling Ireland as a tourist venue, will, given the fact that they have withdrawn from servicing Ireland, obviously be selling against Ireland by virtue of the fact that they will be catering and servicing routes they have retained within their operations?

      <P>I can tell the Deputy that I am confident with regard to the filling of the slot.  The Aer Lingus L-1011 which has been acquired for this particular route is much larger than the DC 10 which operated on the route before.  The capacity of the Aer Lingus plane is 344 seats while the capacity of the DC 10 is 282 seats.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 47 and 69 together.  Revenue figures covering the full range of specialist holiday activities, including angling, are prepared only on an annual basis.  Data for 1988 will not be available until the first quarter of 1989.</P>

    <P>Since taking office I have consistently requested Bord Fáilte to target the <Col N="663" /> special interest segment of the international tourism market.  Angling ranks high on the list of sectors which they are actively and successfully marketing in this regard.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately they are being impeded by the activities of anglers and others in the anti-rod licence campaign who, as I stated in a press release issued on 8 November, are holding the tourism industry up to ransom.  I have directed Bord Fáilte to inform overseas anglers that there is ample good fishing available in Ireland and anglers will be directed to these areas where they will be both very welcome and enjoy good fishing.</P>
    <P>Specific marketing initiatives for any tourism product are the statutory responsibility of Bord Fáilte.  Therefore, I have no comment to make on the last part of Deputy Hussey's question other than to express my confidence that Bord Fáilte's promotion of angling will continue to be both accurate and effective.</P>
    <P>I understand the Minister for the Marine will be providing details regarding development plans for inland fisheries, including angling facilities.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Tourism and Transport the specific action he is taking to meet the targets set out for tourism growth in the <i>Programme for National Recovery;</i> whether these targets are realistic; the growth in tourism, revenue and job creation which have been achieved to date; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 17, 37 and 48 together as they all relate to the tourism growth targets set out in the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the House is aware, a Central Review Committee, comprising representatives of the parties to the <i>Programme for National Recovery,</i> has been established to monitor implementation of the programme.  Statements issued on the <Col N="666" /> implementation of the programme, including the job creation targets, have been laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I understand that further statements will be issued from time to time.  The employment arising from the improved tourism performance will be monitored using sectoral employment surveys conducted by the Central Statistics Office, in conjunction with data on tourism revenue.</P>
    <P>The tourism growth targets, as set out in the programme, relate to tourism revenue and numbers and job creation.  On the basis of tourism performance in 1987 and the indications for 1988, I am confident that these targets are both realistic and attainable.</P>
    <P>While there are no revenue figures available as yet for 1988, market estimates for the first nine months show an increase of some 13 per cent in overseas visitor numbers compared with the corresponding period in 1987.  This is very close to the 15 per cent growth target set by Government.  Growth of this order, on top of a 12 per cent increase in visitor numbers in 1987 when tourism revenue passed the £1 billion mark for the first time, is already estimated to have created over 12,000 extra jobs in the economy over the two years 1987 and 1988.</P>

      <P>If the tourism targets set out in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> are to be achieved; would the Minister not agree that growth in tourism revenue and in visitor numbers would have to increase at an annual rate of 15 per cent?  Would he not further agree that there is no evidence that that kind of growth has taken place in the last season? Hoteliers, restaurant operators and other people in the industry are saying that nothing like that level of growth has been achieved.  If that trend continues, would he not agree that it would not be possible to meet the targets set out in the <i>Programme for National Recovery?</i></P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Tourism and Transport the action which is planned by his Department and the Department of Finance to avert the serious threat to Irish tourism arising from the proposals by the EC to impose VAT on air tickets and other transport fares.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the Commission's proposals to harmonise tax rates, a uniform structure for VAT in all member states is envisaged.  There would be two rates &mdash; a standard rate in the range 14 per cent to 20 per cent for general application to goods and services, and a reduced rate in the range 4 per cent to 9 per cent for a limited number of items.</P>
      <P>At present international passenger transport by sea and air within the Community is zero-rated for VAT purposes. Domestic passenger transport is exempt from VAT.  Under the Commission's proposals the reduced rate &mdash; that is 4 per cent to 9 per cent &mdash; would apply to both forms of passenger transport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="668" /> International freight transport by sea and air is also zero-rated for VAT purposes at present and it would be subject to the new standard rate, that is 14 per cent to 20 per cent.  In the case of domestic freight, the current VAT rate of 25 per cent would be reduced to the new standard rate &ldquo;A&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Decisions have not yet been taken on the Commission proposals because in relation to the package of proposals for harmonisation of indirect taxes generally, it will be necessary to proceed in a planned, pragmatic and realistic manner. Only when member states have assessed the financial, budgetary, economic and social implications of the measures for them, and the practical consequences for their economies and national budgets will decisions be taken.  Detailed negotiations on the package are taking place in the EC Council of Finance Ministers.</P>
    <P>Several participants in my recent European Conference on Tourism and Transport referred to the adverse effect which the Commission proposals for imposing VAT on access transport fares would have on their enterprises and on the tourism industry generally.  I am, therefore, very much aware of the views of the transport and tourism sectors and he Deputy can rest assured that these views will be taken fully into account.  The Minister for Finance will be pressing strongly in the Council of Ministers to ensure that the maximum consideration is given to the particular difficulties faced by Ireland as a peripheral member state and that appropriate Community solutions are developed to offset the particular problems which the package as a whole poses for Ireland.  I will be monitoring developments very closely with a view to ensuring that access transport costs to Ireland are maintained at the most attractive levels possible.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his comprehensive reply.  In view of the island status of this country, will the Minister take into consideration the fact that half of our tourists come to this country by air?  In Europe only 3 per cent of tourists travel to different countries by <Col N="669" /> air.  I understand that a crucial meeting on this topic will be held in December. In view of the crisis effect that this would have in the undoing of access cost reductions to Ireland, will the Government and the Minister in particular consider asking for a derogation from this new VAT rate?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> published by the Government in 1987 set out specific targets for the tourism industry over the five years to 1992.  These are to create an extra 25,000 jobs; attract an additional £500 million of foreign tourist revenue and to double the number of foreign tourist visitors.  The policy measures by which these targets are to be achieved are also set out in the programme.  All initiatives taken by the Government since we took office have been and will continue to be fully consistent with these.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have almost completed the first two years of the programme and the Deputy will no doubt be glad to hear that we are on line to achieve our targets; 12,000 jobs have been created, foreign <Col N="670" /> tourism revenue has incresed by almost £190 million and the number of foreign visitors is up by almost 30 per cent on 1986.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that the Taoiseach's undertaking to produce a medium term programme for tourism and an action plan was made after the publication of the <i>Programme for National Recovery,</i> will the Minister now confirm that there is no such plan in his Department and that the tourist industry, who were led to expect this plan by the Taoiseach in Kilmainham on 27 November, can now expect no such plan in relation to tourism?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>This State will spend an estimated £172 million this year on security connected with the Northern Ireland situation.  That continues to represent almost four times <i>per capita</i> the level of expenditure by the taxpayer in Britain in respect of Northern Ireland.  That expense is incurred at a time of national austerity and financial belt-tightening, but we do not grudge it.  We make that expenditure willingly because it is in our own interest to do so and in the interests of preserving lives in the North.  People in Northern Ireland are our fellow Irish men and women and we aspire to unity with them in a new Ireland.  Our efforts in regard to security co-operation are all the more necessary because of that feeling and that aspiration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Extradition is an internationally accepted instrument in the fight against <Col N="757" /> serious crime and international terrorism. I draw attention to serious crime because in the public discussion that takes place on extradition, the focus tends to be on the extradition of persons accused of terrorist offences.  It is important to bear in mind that we all have an interest, not only in preventing acts of terrorism and bringing terrorist offenders to justice but in tackling the increasingly serious actions of what are called &ldquo;ordinary&rdquo; criminals although the threat they pose to us and to our children, for example, through kidnapping or illegal drug trafficking is far from &ldquo;ordinary&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>We all agree that extradition must not be unreasonable or arbitrary and that an extradited person should be treated properly and given a fair trial.  The Government consider that it is right and necessary to have extradition but to have it subject to reasonable safeguards.  That was the balance which the Government sought to strike in bringing forward the Extradition (Amendment) Act, 1987.</P>
    <P>There are other legal instruments which can be used in the fight against terrorism and serious crime, perhaps more effectively than extradition in certain cases.  One of these is the Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Act, 1976.  We are examining with the British Government how the reciprocal legislation in this area can also be used to advance legal co-operation.</P>
    <P>I believe that the efforts of the Government since taking office, and the efforts of the previous Government, are recognised by all the people in the North, including Unionists.  It is a remarkable fact that the area in which by far the most people in Northern Ireland believe there has been improvement since the Anglo-Irish Agreement is the area of security co-operation between the Garda Síochána and the RUC.  In a recent poll published in the <i>Belfast Telegraph</i> on 4 October 1988, 47 per cent agreed that there had been an improvement, including 38 per cent of Protestants, in security co-operation.  That compares with only <Col N="758" /> 21 per cent who thought that the Anglo-Irish Agreement had led to an improvement in the administration of justice, and even fewer, 13 per cent who thought the Anglo-Irish Agreement had led to an improvement in job prospects.</P>
    <P>The same poll to which I have just referred asked people in Northern Ireland whether they believed that terrorism would most likely be defeated by security measures, by political measures, by a combination of security and political measures, or could not be defeated at all. By far the largest number, 42 per cent, believe that terrorism will most likely be defeated by a combination of security and political measures.  It is all the more striking that a slightly larger proportion of Protestants than Catholics, 44 per cent, believe this to be so.</P>
    <P>Of course the issue of confidence in the administration of justice cannot be treated merely as an aspect of more effective security operations.  Its inclusion in Articles 7 and 8 of the Agreement reflects its wider importance as a political factor in Northern Ireland.  It is a major goal to be pursued in its own right as a means of attacking the vicious circle in which the absence of confidence and the absence of political consensus reinforce each other for the worse.</P>
    <P>Building confidence in the administration of justice and better relations between security forces and the community in Northern Ireland involves two things.  First, the level of public confidence is directly related to the policies pursued by the authorities and to decisions taken by them in pursuit of these policies.  Confidence in the administration of justice must be adversely affected by, for example, the decision not to prosecute on foot of the Stalker-Sampson report when evidence clearly existed to support the prosecution for the perversion of the course of justice.  The decision recently announced to make major modifications to the right of silence is also a decision which has affected confidence negatively.</P>
    <P>Secondly, the level of public confidence is related directly to the practical experience of people in their everyday <Col N="759" /> encounters with the security forces and the legal system.  Measures need to be taken urgently not just to show willingness to improve these relations but to remove or reduce the objective causes of the widespread view that the security forces engage in conduct which is well beyond, or completely unrelated to, reasonable security measures, in other words, harassment.</P>
    <P>There has been a number of positive developments in the administration of justice over the last three years.  The supergrass trials which were such a cause of controversy and concern because they involved as many as 30 defendants tried on the uncorroborated word of an accomplice informer before a single judge without a jury, have been brought to an end.  At the same time, however, there has been no &ldquo;substantial expression&rdquo;, in the words of the Agreement, of the aim of public confidence in the administration of justice.  The Government continue to be of the view that on objective legal grounds, as well as on the grounds of increasing public confidence, the method of trial for scheduled offences in the Diplock Court needs to be reformed.  We remain of the view that a three judge court of first instance is the right step to take.</P>
    <P>The Government have already expressed their deep concern at the changes to the right of silence which have now passed through the Westminster Parliament and which go far beyond the provisions in our jurisdiction in the Criminal Justice Act, 1984.  I draw attention especially to the change which will enable an adverse inference to be drawn by the court if a person chooses not to give evidence. This is not only a major modification of the principle that the prosecution must prove its case, it will also increase the burden already borne by the single Diplock judge.</P>
    <P>In the area of the police, the Tánaiste has noted on a number of occasions the improvement in the security provided to members of the Nationalist community during the marching season and the more impartial decisions of the police in the <Col N="760" /> conduct and routing of parades.  It is clear, however, that the issue of harassment requires urgent attention and that the real need here is to put measures in place which, without prejudice to the right of people to have recourse to the courts or the formal complaints machinery, will monitor complaints and bring a prompt end to reprehensible behaviour by the security forces where that is warranted.</P>
    <P>I have to say, too, that the level of accompaniment of the Army and UDR by the RUC is not at all satisfactory and that much more needs to be done to implement the formal commitment in the Hillsborough communique to the application of the principle that the armed forces, including the Ulster Defence Regiment, operate only in support of the civil power with the particular objective of ensuring as rapidly as possible that, save in the most exceptional cases, there is a police presence in all operations which involve direct contact with the community.</P>
    <P>In the prisons area there has been progress in conditions and on the question of release, especially for young prisoners who committed their offence at an age younger than 18 and who were given indeterminate sentences.  The Government are conscious that a number of persons were caught up in violence in Northern Ireland in the 1970s at a very young and impressionable age and they recognise the importance which the families of the prisoners and the Nationalist community in Northern Ireland attach to the issue of prison releases.  It is an area which the Government consider extremely important, which is kept to the forefront of discussions with the British Government and in which we wish to see progress sustained.</P>
    <P>In summary, the review of the working of the Agreement over the next few months will examine the overall record of the Agreement in detail and it will seek to imbue the Anglo-Irish process with a new sense of urgency.  Strong foundations have been built for the Conference and Secretariat but it would be wrong to suggest that we are satisfied <Col N="761" /> with the scope and pace of change to date.  Much more needs to be done in particular in the area I have been speaking about, the administration of justice and relations between security forces and the community.</P>
    <P>Before I conclude I want to return to the emphasis I laid at the beginning of this statement on the importance of joint action by the two sovereign Governments to deal with the problem of Northern Ireland.  It has been said &mdash; and I agree &mdash; that the very serious difficulties we have had in the last year or so would have caused even greater strains had the machinery of the Agreement, the Anglo-Irish Conference and Secretariat, not been there to be used and to permit an immediate exchange of views.</P>
    <P>It is important to recognise that our relationship with the other island is a unique one.  The contribution of Irish people to the politics and the economic, social and cultural advancement of Britain has been extraordinary.  Britain is our largest trading partner and &mdash; let us not forget &mdash; we are Britain's seventh largest trading partner.  We give each other voting rights.  We have a common travel area.  British and Irish people can move freely from one jurisdiction to the other and it is important to bear that advantage in mind when we consider the problems which undoubtedly exist in the operation of security measures such as the Prevention of Terrorism Act.</P>
    <P>Our development as a State, our international achievements in the United Nations and elsewhere, our membership of the EC, and now our participation in the Anglo-Irish Conference have all helped to place the relations between the British and Irish Governments on a basis of sovereign equality and mutual respect. That gives us reason for no little pride as well as hope and determination to improve our relations still further, to end the problem of violence in our land and to reach a historic understanding among all sections of the people of Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Having listened to the Tánaiste's contribution this morning, I am extremely disappointed with the uninspiring opening address we got from him. I sense a sort of begrudging acceptance that this Agreement is in place and that our Government are doing the minimum they possibly can to keep it ticking over. I say that in all sincerity because I suppose it is understandable when one considers the attitude adopted by Fianna Fáil when this Agreement was signed and the efforts made at that time by, in particular, the Tánaiste to do all in his power to damage the impact of the Agreement in November 1985.  It is important that we state that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having said that, let me say that I sincerely hope that if anything arises out of this debate today it will push the Government into a more positive attitude towards the Anglo-Irish Agreement, because an Agreement of this nature will succeed only if both parties to that Agreement want it to succeed.  In order for it to succeed it needs leadership, and there is a glorious opportunity for this Government, for the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste to show some inspired leadership in this instance, some understanding, compassion and sincerity towards the people who are plagued with this horrible problem day in and day out in the Six Counties. It is an opportunity for the Taoiseach to bury the remarks he is supposed to have made to Deputy Neil Blaney at the formation of this Government when <Col N="763" /> Deputy Blaney in this House stated that when he asked the Taoiseach what he intended to do with the Anglo-Irish Agreement the answer Deputy Blaney got was that he intended to let it wither away.</P>
    <P>In these circumstances those of us on this side of the House were for the first eight or ten months of the life of the Government extremely sceptical about the attitude of the Government towards the Anglo-Irish Agreement, because literally nothing was happening.  It is important also for those of us who perhaps regard ourselves as the younger generation on this island to ask those people who consistently refer back to Civil War politics and to aspirations that we all hold but know in the short term cannot be achieved, to leave us alone and give us an opportunity of living our lives like young Irishmen and women who want to forget about the past, who do not want to bury our aspirations but just to live in peace and harmony in the real world. The reality is that one million people on this island say they want nothing to do with a united Ireland and, despite what aspirations any of us has, we are not going to bomb those one million people into submission.</P>
    <P>Let me make a suggestion.  This debate would have been far more fruitful if we all had come into this Chamber and somebody started at page 1 of the Agreement and read out the preamble and Articles 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 and let us go through each line of this Agreement and ask how far we have gone to try to bring about what this Agreement is really trying to do, that is to give both communities in Northern Ireland an opportunity to live in peace.</P>
    <P>The Agreement goes on to say that it recognises that those of us who support the Nationalist viewpoint do not have to forfeit our right to a united Ireland, that some day if there is agreement of a majority in Northern Ireland that will come about.  It says equally to the Unionist population that until that day arrives we are not going to force them into something they do not want to go into.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="764" /> I have listened to many debates on TV and radio and in here, and it appears that the number of people on this island who have read that document must be extremely limited, because the ignorance displayed in some of the comments on both sides of the divide in Northern Ireland shows either that people do not want to know what is in it or do not want to understand clearly what is in it.  I and my party would be only too delighted if, tomorrow morning, the Taoiseach could sit down with the Unionists in Northern Ireland and go through this document, find out what their fears are, listen to their grievances and come back into this House to see could we co-operate to bring about a situation by which the aims of this Agreement could be achieved.  We are dealing here with people's lives.  It is just not good enough to play party politics. Those of us who have children would not like to have to face the day-to-day problems that people in Northern Ireland are facing.  When their children leave home they do not know if they will come back safely.  If they go out to shop, a bomb may go off, and maybe their son or daughter will be maimed for life.  Their son or daughter might be coaxed into some subversive organisation that can point to the constitutional politicians and claim, perhaps with some justification, that we have failed to find a solution.</P>
    <P>All of us who are interested in constitutional politics have a moral obligation to forget our grievances in relation to what went on in this island in the past and to come together to find a solution that, first of all, will bring about peace and stability.  We are all marvellous at issuing statements every time a bomb goes off and sympathising with the unfortunate people who are affected by such an atrocity, but actions speak louder than words and I am afraid we have failed to a great extent to persuade those who hold a different viewpoint that we are not about to take them over or to impose something on them against their will and that this Agreement is something really positive.</P>
    <P>As this debate is supposed to be about <Col N="765" /> the review of the Anglo-Irish Agreement, it is important that we look at what successes we have had and what we should be trying to do in the future to improve the situation.  There have been some successes and the Minister announced those this morning.  We have had an improvement in policing in the marching season and an end to the supergrass trials; we have had the beginning of an economic programme in West Belfast and preparation of new and, hopefully, effective fair employment legislation; but these are all things that one would expect in any free, democratic society.  We are talking about the right of people to get a job irrespective of their religious or political beliefs.  All of these things we talk about as successes are things that any reasonable, free, democratic society would expect for its inhabitants.</P>
    <P>Over the last 18 months we have had meetings between the Tánaiste and his opposite number in the UK, in accordance with the Anglo-Irish Conference. Despite what the Tánaiste may tell us it would appear to us that all of these have been about crisis management and security problems that arose and had to be attended to.  Unless there is something we do not know about, that is a fair assessment as far as this side of the House is concerned.</P>
    <P>All of the blame is not on the side of our Government.  The British Government must realise they also have a role to play in the success of this Agreement, that they are in a position to bring about changes if they want to do so.  I have openly criticised the attitude of the British, particularly in relation to some incidents that have occurred in the past, for instance, the Gibraltar affair when it was quite clear that the security forces should have made a better effort to arrest the three individuals in question and bring them before the courts.</P>
    <P>I know the British authorities at times take exception to criticism, but it is only fair and proper that if we have something to say we should say it straight to their faces and make them realise that every time they make decisions like this they make it twice as difficult for us here to <Col N="766" /> deal with terrorists and subversives. Every time an incident like this occurs it results in marvellous publicity for the Provos and drives people into their arms, despite our efforts to persuade people towards constitutional politics.  The British must respect the difficulties we have here and the cost to this island of the security we have to supply because of a border that was created many years ago, a border that is extremely difficult to secure and police and that is costing this country vast sums of money.  At the time of the Forum it was estimated that the loss of tourism revenue up to the beginning of the troubles was in excess of £1,000 million.  I understand that the additional costs of security to us last year were £180 million.  God only knows what losses we have had in investment opportunities in the past 20 years since these troubles started.</P>
    <P>What do the young people say to us when they hear these figures being thrown out?  If we had £1,000 million to invest in jobs for the 250,000 people that are unemployed, that money would be far better employed than it is on what it is being used for at present, to keep the Provos, the UVF and other subversives and terrorists just at bay.  It is important that we get this message across loud and clear to every citizen of this country.  Like other Deputies in this House, I attend meetings and have been on radio programmes and people telephone in and want to know why politicians do not talk about unemployment and emigration rather than about Northern Ireland.  They have this notion that because we talk about Northern Ireland we have only this aspiration of a 32 county united Ireland. The message has not got across to the Irish people that as long as that problem remains in Northern Ireland this country suffers a vast loss of revenue day in and day out, never mind which should of course come first, the loss of lives of citizens of this island.</P>
    <P>It is vitally important that we realise that when we talk about finding a solution to Northern Ireland we are talking about people's lives, the people who are living there on a daily basis, whether Unionist, <Col N="767" /> Nationalist, Catholic or Protestant.  That is the situation we have to face.  We are dealing with people's lives; we are dealing with lives down here; we are dealing with loss of investment opportunities and with a type of society that nobody will want to live in.  I just want to put on record, like my colleagues, Deputies Dukes and Barry, what we want on this side of the House.  First, we want regular meetings of the Anglo-Irish Conference.  We want ongoing discussions on important political items.  Many of the problems that have arisen over the last 18 months would not have arisen if there was regular political contact between elected politicians to discuss these problems on an ongoing basis.  When there is loss of contact mistakes are more likely to be made.  Nothing has been done in the last 18 months to create confidence in the administration of justice in Northern Ireland.  Only recently the Tánaiste was talking about something that Deputy Peter Barry was speaking about 18 months ago, three judge courts.  This is only a new item on the agenda.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I will very quickly put a couple of points on record.  We want to see a devolved Government in Northern Ireland, political discussion that will bring that about and regular meetings of the Conference to deal with that aspect. We want the promotion of cross-Border co-operation in relation to economic and social development.  We can see an all-Ireland rugby team appearing on a pitch. Why can we not have more contact through sport which can break down barriers, as has been proved in the past?  Of course we want cross-Border security to deal with the common enemy, terrorism, and of course we will support reasonable extradition arrangements.  We, like other parties in this House, want safeguards. We want only people who have a case to answer to be extradited, not people who are just to be questioned.  We do not want <Col N="768" /> any suspension of the Agreement; we want talks with the Unionists in Northern Ireland so that the main purpose of the whole operation, a devolved government, will be achieved.</P>
      <P>I should like to thank the Chair for his tolerance.  A time limit of 15 minutes on an important subject like this is very short.  I hope that at the end of the debate something positive and constructive emerges.  We should all reaffirm our commitment to the Anglo-Irish Agreement and the working of it.  This side of the House will always be available to give a positive response.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Reynolds) Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Tánaiste in his opening statement, and my colleagues in Government in their earlier interventions, have addressed a wide range of issues that will arise in the course of the review.  They have commented on the symbolic and substantive achievements of the Agreement, the ground that has been covered in the past three years and the outstanding issues that have to be urgently addressed.</P>
      <P>I share the sense of urgency which has been expressed in this debate.  The human and economic costs of violence in Northern Ireland are appallingly high. The most poignant and tragic loss of course is that of the lives of men, women and children.  It is a loss of chilling finality which can never be made good.  But while the dead are rightly mourned, our first duty is to the living, to the vast majority of people of both communities in Northern Ireland who long for normal, peaceful lives lived in a society which offers dignity and decency to its citizens.</P>
      <P>When we talk of lives of dignity and decency, it is shorthand for much else. It encompasses the political, legal and economic environment in which people function.  It means a fair deal in education, housing, jobs; it means equality before the law; it means acceptance of the culture and ethos of different traditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The harsh reality is that many or all of these basic democratic rights were withheld from the Nationalist community during the Stormont years.  A veneer of <Col N="769" /> normality covered over the discrimination and repression; but that veneer cracked under the civil rights demands of the late sixties.  For 20 years the society of Northern Ireland has been torn apart, and the healing process was bound to be a long one.</P>
    <P>That veneer of normality that covered the discrimination and repression was not all one-sided.  Television programmes many years ago showed up bad housing conditions on the Shankill Road.  I watched the emergence of Dr. Ian Paisley from the social problems in that area.  The social problems were bound to explode.  I recall discussing the matter with business associates over lunch in Belfast in early 1970 and their view was that the problem was so bad that it amounted to a time bomb waiting to explode.  They said that once that time bomb was set off the problems would be with us for a long time.  In fact, they forecast that thousands of lives would be lost.  I did not believe that forecast but how right those people were. They could see how deep-rooted the problem had become.  Many people were left uncared for for a long time with the inevitable result.</P>
    <P>The Anglo-Irish Agreement is an attempt to create a basis on which dignity and decency can be restored to the lives of the people of Northern Ireland, particularly the minority community.  That it has succeeded in part is indisputable. That it has failed to wholly succeed is also, I would suggest, indisputable.  The main questions are: does it hold promise for the future?  Does it have a potential that is capable of being realised?  I believe that the answer to those questions is &ldquo;yes&rdquo;, but in saying so I must emphasise that there is a need for a much stronger commitment from the other signatory to the Agreement, if it is to realise its potential. It calls for much more than over-concentration on security matters to the exclusion of other initiatives which, in my view, could go a long way towards building bridges of trust between the two communities.  The long litany of insensitive, ill-timed statements and decisions that have been issued over the years have not done anything to ease the problem.  In <Col N="770" /> my view they have succeeded, as Deputy Barrett said, in acting as a recruiting force for the IRA while at the same time making the divide much wider.  It is difficult to understand that after that long period of time nothing has been learned about the real problems of that part of our island.</P>
    <P>An issue on which I would like to make some remarks is that of fair employment. We have noted some developments in this area, and the proposed new legislation would appear to hold promise of concrete change, but there is one point worth emphasising, location of industry is probably at least as influential in securing an equitable share-out of employment as is a revision of existing legislation. There is an historical imbalance of massive proportions in Northern Ireland in this respect.  It is no doubt true that industry is attracted to the facilities of the Belfast area, but that is not the only factor.  It is sobering to recall that between 1922 and 1964 of the 111 advance factories built by the Minister of Commerce in Northern Ireland, only 16 were built in the three western counties. While the record improved considerably subsequently, this legacy of discriminatory decisions on location cannot be discounted.  Past decisions may be largely irreversible, but it is essential that their effect is taken into account when decisions are taken which have an influence on location of new industry.</P>
    <P>As Minister with an economic brief I would also like to comment on the scope for action in the economic area.  In my view, that area can contribute in its own way much more than many of the other matters referred to in the debate.  Building up the economies of both sides of the Border could help to reduce the mistrust and bring people closer together.  Article 10 of the Agreement provides that the two Governments shall co-operate to promote the economic and social development of those areas of both parts of Ireland which have suffered most severely from the consequences of instability in recent years.  This applies in the South to our Border counties particularly.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="771" /> A substantial degree of co-operation in the economic sphere has already developed between the two administrations at many levels as a result of the Agreement.  North and South we share many common problems, particularly high unemployment and it is recognised that a co-operative approach in practical initiatives to develop the economy of the whole island is in everybody's interest.  It is through practical co-operation in areas of mutual economic concern that the barriers of mistrust can be broken down. The north-west study which both Governments have agreed to commission is an example of our co-operative approach to addressing particular economic problems in the Border areas.  The study will assess the major economic and social problems of the Donegal, Derry and Strabane areas and recommend a development strategy for the region as well as examine the scope for close co-ordination between the authorities on both sides of the Border.  The emphasis will be on practical and realistic recommendations. An application to carry out this study has been lodged with the EC and we hope for an early response.</P>
    <P>The International Fund for Ireland, which owes its origin to the Anglo-Irish Agreement, is now almost two years in operation and has received substantial assistance from abroad and from the US in particular.  Of over £20 million allocated to projects in the South almost £5 million is currently being expended on a variety of projects under the business enterprise programme.</P>
    <P>The business enterprise programme is geared towards creating viable jobs in the Southern Border counties and in the North.  It has been particularly active in supporting the start-up and expansion of small business and in identifying areas which are not covered by the promotional agencies.  For example, a small business task force has been established which is assisting companies, on a sectoral basis, to identify constraints on the development of their industry and to evolve solutions to them, be they at the production or the distribution level.  County enterprise <Col N="772" /> companies have been established in each of the six Border counties with a mandate to encourage greater entrepreneurship through the availability of revolving business funds, assistance towards workshop accommodation and community economic activity.</P>
    <P>One of the main objectives of the fund was to encourage greater co-operation between North and South and a striking example of its success was the tremendous impact which a joint Galway-Derry initiative made at the first Ireland Trade Festival which was held in Boston last May.  That event was so successful that plans are well underway, assisted by the IFI and CTT, for another festival in Boston next year.</P>
    <P>The IFI have also been actively involved in the development of Irish science and technology particularly through focusing on gaps in the ever-changing industrial infrastructure.  Over £2.5 million has been allocated to projects in the South to date.</P>
    <P>The approach of 1992 and its implications for North-South relations is of particular interest and relevance.  In an EC context we are faced with similar problems as a result of our location on the periphery of the Community.  In addition the elimination of customs barriers between the North and South of Ireland after 1992 will give a strong impetus to Border trade and will eliminate the perspective of the economic border that exists between North and South.</P>
    <P>Even when we have reached the situation of solving all the major cost disadvantages we have internally on the island of Ireland we are still left with a sea dividing us from the mainland market of Europe, the only part of the whole market that will be left without a land frontier.  There, I suggest, we have common problems to take up at EC level as, indeed, we are doing in many other areas.</P>
    <P>1992 is, as we all know, a watershed year for Europe.  I see it as a year of opportunity in every sense.  As barriers come down between the economies of the European countries, they also come <Col N="773" /> down between the peoples of these counties. Any clinging in the six counties of Northern Ireland to the slogan of &ldquo;ourselves alone&rdquo; will become increasingly anachronistic in the nineties.  Equally anachronistic will be those who cling to a siege mentality that is rooted in the history of past centuries.</P>
    <P>The approach of 1992 has certainly not gone unnoticed in the context of North-South relations.  Contacts are taking place at various levels of industry and in other sectors.  I discussed the whole question last July with Peter Viggers, M.P., Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Northern Ireland with responsibility for Industry, when I met him at Stormont Castle to discuss North-South economic co-operation.  We agreed that a major seminar dealing with the issues involved should be held in the Irish Institute at Louvain in December next. The purpose of this seminar is to prepare industrialists and senior representatives of public sector agencies North and South for the elimination of trade barriers in 1992.  The choice of the Irish Institute at Louvain, a seventeenth century building which has itself been refurbished by trainees from both sides of the Border, is symbolic of the spirit of co-operation which exists between the two Governments on this issue.</P>
    <P>The contents of the Forum report on &ldquo;The Economic Consequences of the Division of Ireland since 1920&rdquo; remain highly pertinent today.  The report noted that the division of the island has given rise to considerable economic costs, North and South.  I quote - &ldquo;For example in the absence of co-ordinated long-term planning, capital investment in areas such as energy, education and health, has entailed considerable duplication of expenditure.  The impact on areas contiguous to the Border was particularly adverse.  Not only were they detached from their trading hinterlands, but the difficulties of their location were worsened by their transformation into peripheral regions at the dividing line of two new administrative units&rdquo;.  I would suggest that 1992 offers us an opportunity, if we wish to avail of it, to redress <Col N="774" /> some of the economic consequences of that division.</P>
    <P>I mentioned at the outset of my comments the human and economic cost of the violence in Northern Ireland.  The human cost dwarfs all others.  But even if we were not driven to act by the human tragedy of Northern Ireland, there is a compelling economic argument for action.  The direct and indirect costs to our economy since 1969 for the violence in Northern Ireland were estimated by the Forum, in 1982 prices, at over £2,000 million.  The same calculations, done today, would obviously result in a far higher figure.  In today's climate of financial stringency, we can afford it even less now than at any other stage.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the review process as envisaged will devote adequate attention to the advancement of work in the economic and social areas.  If the litmus test is to be, and we have made it so, what issues make a difference to Nationalists in their daily lives, I have no doubt that time spent on these issues is well justified.</P>
    <P>There are many areas where we can work together to improve the economic lot of the people of this island.  I believe that the more we work together the closer we can come to one another.  From a personal view and as one who lives within 35 miles of the Border area I am very familiar with the culture, the habits and the traditions of the people of Northern Ireland.  From my business contacts, for long before I came into politics I had done business with many business people in the North of Ireland &mdash; I can say openly and honestly that they have made a major contribution to the total development of this island, whenever that opportunity has been afforded to them.  Many times I have spent my holidays there.  Since my children were very young they, too, have spent their holidays in the North of Ireland in mixed communities.  Only in that way can we understand exactly what the people say, what the people feel, what the people think.</P>
    <P>As an example, I might say that some 12 years ago I sat down with a customer of mine in the North of Ireland and talked in his sittingroom about the problem for <Col N="775" /> three or four hours.  He had a strong Unionist tradition, he had been an election agent for one, William Craig, and subsequently a lieutenant.  He put to me the following very straight question: &ldquo;as a businessman, would you eliminate Santa Claus?  I replied in an honest manner that I would not and I threw the question back to him and asked: &ldquo;what happens some Christmas if Santa Claus does not arrive? He replied, in the good tradition, in the strong work ethic and business community sense of the North of Ireland, &ldquo;we will look for the best deal wherever we can get it.&rdquo;  Dr. Paisley is a man with whom my company have done, and still do business too.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to go into the terms in detail as that was done this morning on behalf of the Progressive Democrats by Deputy Kennedy.  I want to talk in more general terms about the Northern Ireland situation at present.  It is very welcome that the Dáil is debating a primary issue of life and death in this country.  It is a sad reflection on the factual level of real interest, as distinct from the level of rhetorical interest, which politicans in the Republic accord to the problems of Northern Ireland, that the topic is so rarely debated in this House.</P>
      <P>We must avail of every opportunity at our disposal to spell out the constitutional and peacefull way forward to a resolution of the conflict there.  We in the South have a vital role to play in this process, not merely in representing the views and aspirations of the Nationalist minority to the British Government, but also in working to assuage the legitimate concerns of Northern Unionists <i>vis-à-vis</i> the Republic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To fully understand the enormous breakthrough that the Anglo-Irish Agreement represents in relations between the two islands, and in the quest for a resolution of the divided Nationalist loyalties of people living on this island, it is really necessary to try to take a perspective that is longer than three years.  In other words, I have no doubt that a longer-term historical perspective <Col N="776" /> on the accord will surely adjudge it to have been the most important development in that context since the Government of Ireland Act which partitioned this island.</P>
    <P>To appreciate what a significant turning point it has been, one has only to recall the declaration of four years ago by the British Prime Minister, Mrs. Thatcher, that Northern Ireland was as British as Finchley, her own constituency.  She would not state that today, she simply could not.  Nowadays the Irish dimension of Northern Ireland is accorded significant recognition alongside the undoubted British dimension that exists there.  It is institutionally represented by the Anglo-Irish Conference and the Conference Secretariat at Maryfield, Belfast, which has civil servants from the Republic ensuring a permanent and continuous input to the governmental process in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>Of course there is a long way to go yet in the battle for full equal status for the Irish dimension of life in the North which is the tradition, right and aspiration of Nationalists living there.  Above all else, there is a need for practical changes and ceaseless sensitivity in ensuring that the legal and judicial process of the North is transparently fair and just at all times to the minority there.  In the face of the constant IRA terrorist campaign, I accept there are very severe difficulties facing the forces of law and order in the North, but I stress the unique importance of justice and fairness being meted out to the Nationalist minority at all times, not only because that is an absolute right anyway but because any lapses in that sensitive area, or merely apparent lapses, are always pounced on and fully exploited by the IRA murder gangs and their publicists in Sinn Féin to seek to further poison Anglo-Irish relations, to seek to further alienate Northern Nationalists from any coming together with their Unionist neighbours and to win further gullible recruits for their evil actions.</P>
    <P>Therefore there are many legitimate areas of Nationalist concern in Northern Ireland not yet adequately addressed either by the Anglo-Irish Agreement or <Col N="777" /> otherwise.  However, to appreciate the significance of the fundamental progress marked out by the Agreement we have only to look at the events of the past three years from the perspective of the Unionist community.  For them it has been an unprecedentedly traumatic departure.  They felt, as they saw it, totally let down, betrayed and abandoned by the British.  They saw a British Government &mdash; a Tory and Unionist one to boot &mdash; reducing their union status to one of mere conditionality rather than being an absolute right any longer.  That conditionality is to the effect that if a majority emerges in Northern Ireland which favours unity with the Republic then the British will not stand in the way of that happening.  On the other hand, it should be noted that the Tánaiste this morning, in reviewing the Articles of the Agreement one by one, never even mentioned Article 1 which, from any standpoint, is perhaps the most imporatant of all the Articles in the Agreement.  Article 1 in particular constitutes an enormously significant breakthrough.</P>
    <P>In passing we must not overlook the undoubted courage required of a British Government in taking such an initiative from their point of view.  That point was legitimately expressed by Mr. Tom King in his RTE interview last evening.  In the Republic we would be less than generous not to acknowledge it.  As Tom King put it, the Agreement demanded a far greater break with tradition on the British side than on the Irish side.  Notwithstanding that, the Agreement was totally condemned at the time by Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>We are always more than quick off the mark in the Republic to criticise the British for their undoubted transgressions and failures where Ireland is concerned.  Nonetheless we should give credit where it is due and when it is due.</P>
    <P>The changed nature of the union of Northern Ireland and Great Britain signalled at Hillsborough not only challenges the Unionists' sense of their Britishness, their political future and the obligation it imposes on them to look to a wider relationship on this island; it also throws down a very clear challenge to <Col N="778" /> Nationalists, not least in the Republic, to work to create a genuine majority in the North which, of necessity, must include many Unionists who will accept and see no threat in some greater links with the Republic and, in the first instance, with their Nationalist neighbours in the North.</P>
    <P>The <i>New Ireland Forum</i> gave rise not just to Nationalist Ireland's case for new institutions &mdash; partly realised in the signing of the Anglo-Irish Agreement &mdash; but also demanded of Nationalists of a constitutional tradition a fundamental respect and tolerance for the diversity of traditions on this island and, specifically, to recognise the Britishness and Protestantism of Ulster Unionists.</P>
    <P>We have talked on this part of the island of generosity but how have we acted?  We have said that the Unionists would be surprised at how far we would go.  But how far have we gone?  We agreed in the <i>New Ireland Forum</i> on the need for mutual tolerance and respect. But have we moved from that formal expression on paper into a genuine national political philosophy?  In a word, have we moved one whit from mere lip service to tolerance?</P>
    <P>Last year, in a shameful, callous, disgraceful action, the IRA struck at the heart of Unionism, showed just how well they understood the power of symbolism and tradition on this island and between these islands by blowing a Remembrance Day service at Enniskillen to human shreds.</P>
    <P>The Nationalist majority on this island aspire, to one degree or another, to the eventual unity of the country.  The realistic fulfilment of that aspiration is a long way off.  But the road to its achievement, whatever its constitutional form, follows two broad but opposite signposts. One points the way to the militarist antidemocratic murder campaign of IRA terrorism, aided and abetted by their mouthpieces in Sinn Féin.  Happily that is the road taken by a tiny minority of Irish Nationalists only.  The other road is that of constitutional nationalism where sometimes progress is frustratingly slow. <Col N="779" /> We stick to that road in the certain knowledge that the reconciliation of differences will never occur through force. But to be constitutional, to talk of generosity, to signal a willingness to enter into dialogue &mdash; positive as that may be &mdash; is not sufficient in building the necessary bridges to Unionists.  Constitutional Nationalists themselves must seize the symbolic ground on which the IRA so callously stride.  The process required is not a mysterious one.  With courage, taking the long view, it is not even a difficult one.  As well as waving the flag of generosity there are occasions when we must come out of our own trenches and, with the courage and generosity of our own constitutional values and vision, step into no-man's land with all its attendant risks.  What I am saying in another way is that, in this area &mdash; where we have had oceans of verbal Republicanism &mdash; action will always speak louder than words.  For example, it spoke very clearly on the question of the breakdown of marriage.</P>
    <P>Last Sunday, one year on from the Enniskillen atrocity, and an entire generation and more from what was being remembered, an ecumenical service was held in Dublin to honour 50,000 Irish men who made the supreme sacrifice in the First World War.  This was a day, less in this Republic but perhaps more so in Northern Ireland, where the Britishness of the Unionist mentality found expression.  Why could our Government not be represented in any capacity whatsoever in its own capital city, symbolically building one of those necessary bridges where action speaks louder than words, where one picture that told its own story would be worth more than a thousand rhetorical repetitions of the theme of some future unspecified generosity?  It might represent a small gesture but nonetheless an important symbol, and symbols seem all-important on this island.  Last Sunday, and every such Sunday, when an Irish Government stays away, and hides behind the agreed formula of an entirely proper national day of commemoration, <Col N="780" /> we do no service to our long-term Republican aspirations.  How better to build bridges than by standing on such occasions with people of another tradition? It should be remembered that standing with them is not standing for them.  They represent their own cause; we do not.  Standing with them does not require of us an abandonment of what we represent and to which we aspire. What standing with them shows is simply a respect for the tradition which may not be in the mainstream of this Republic but which nonetheless, is not alien to it, and which carries its historic legitimacy and right to respect.</P>
    <P>We have had sufficient verbal Republicanism and flag-waving.  Could one blame any Unionist looking southwards last weekend from concluding ruefully that, so far as Fianna Fáil and the Irish Government are concerned, it is a case of by their deeds shall they be known.</P>
    <P>It appears to me that the Anglo-Irish Agreement at present would be working very well if it were little more than a committee that met occasionally and discussed various relatively unimportant matters that arise from time to time.  By all accounts there is a very good relationship between the Tánaiste and the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland. There is a kind of social <i>bonhomie</i> between them which enables them to get on well on a personal basis and conduct the affairs on the agenda before them. But the real agenda so far as the Anglo-Irish Agreement, Anglo-Irish relations and the situation in Northern Ireland are concerned, cannot be conducted between those two people.  It has to be conducted by the two Prime Ministers, either in person or on the telephone.  Their commitment has noticeably been lacking.</P>
    <P>It is hard to believe that it is three years yesterday since the British and Irish Prime Ministers met, other than for those brief ten minute meetings at European Councils.  It is only they who can break the logjam which unquestionably has arisen in terms of making political progress.  It is only they who can restore the great sense of possibility and hope <Col N="781" /> which existed after the signing of the Agreement at Hillsborough three years ago.  It is not enough for them, the Tánaiste or any Minister here to say that we now have regular monthly meetings of the Anglo-Irish Conference and that that in itself is enough.  There is a necessity for a political commitment at the very highest level.  Political commitment at the very highest level achieved what was achieved in November 1985.  The same thing is called for now and this House should call for it not just from the Taoiseach but also from Mrs. Thatcher.</P>

      <P>Tá sé de phríbhléid againn páirt a ghlacadh sa díospóireacht seo ar an socrú Angla-Éireannach.  Is é an cuspóir atá againn ná mionscrúdú a dhéanamh ar an socrú sin, an méid atá déanta agus ar ród atá romhainn.  Ó cheart is léirmheas atá i gceist, agus tá súil agam go mbeidh dea-thoradh ar an léirmheas sin, is é sin go rachaidh sé chun sochair don socrú Angla-Éireannach.</P>
      <P>As many Deputies will be aware, I had considerable doubts about the terms of the Anglo-Irish Agreement when it was signed by the British and Irish Governments three years ago.  It was however an international agreement entered into by two sovereign Governments and lodged at the United Nations in New York.  It would be damaging to our standing among the nations to do an Ali Pasha on a solemn international agreement.  We considered, when we took office in March 1987, that the Anglo-Irish Agreement was binding on us.</P>
      <P>I mentioned considerable doubts.  I still have considerable doubts about the quality of justice available in the Six Counties. Many of my constituents who, as the House knows, live along the Border have serious doubts in this regard.  These are intelligent balanced citizens, the kind of people upon whom we rely for jury service and whose impeccable behaviour as citizens gives weight to their doubts and opinions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We need movement on reform of the administration of justice and, in particular, of the Diplock Court system.  As <Col N="782" /> against this, I should like to welcome the new emphasis which the Conference has been giving recently to prison issues, out of which has emerged the promised review of SOSP cases.  As we are all aware, Fr. Denis Faul regularly campaigns on this issue.  I cannot over-emphasise the importance of a positive outcome to this review.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste is quoted in yesterday's <i>Irish News</i>, page 1, as saying that &ldquo;during the review period the Government will be drawing up a positive programme for future action with a view to broadening and deepening the work of the Conference&rdquo;. I know that the administration of justice must loom large in that positive programme.</P>
    <P>The present Government however, as they did in every other policy area, took a conscious decision to use the machinery immediately available to them &mdash; in this case, the Anglo-Irish Agreement &mdash; and tried to develop its potential in an imaginative and dynamic manner, and there has been some progress on an agenda of reform of importance to Nationalists. Supergrass trials are gone.  A code of conduct for the RUC has been introduced. The marching seasons of the past two years have been the quietest on record.  Work is well advanced on new fair employment legislation, but let me strike a note of caution and warning here. The Government will reserve their final position on this new legislation until they see and study the fine print of the text. We are not prepared to give blank cheques in this or any other areas.  The record in that area is particularly bad.  I recall seeing a career guidance teacher's book in a very large and quite distinguished post-primary school in the Six Counties which contained a column &mdash; a column which should not have been there &mdash; with the heading, &ldquo;possibilities of employment in chosen career in Northern Ireland&rdquo;.  Whereas opportunities were open in Britain and the South of Ireland, only the word &ldquo;nil&rdquo; could be read in the other column, a column that should not have been there.</P>
    <P>The Government also consciously tried to broaden the approach taken by their <Col N="783" /> predecessor and to extend the work of the Conference and Secretariat more actively into the social and economic areas.  I have already spoken of our decision to give a new impetus to the fair employment area, an issue of central, daily concern to the Nationalist community in the Six Counties. In addition, the Government, through the Conference, were successful in having the British Government introduce a special £10 million package for west Belfast for 1988; this will be the first instalment of multi-annual and, we would expect, progressively more substantial support for west Belfast.  I would fervently hope that this initiative might be extended to include disadvantaged areas in other parts of the North, including Unionist areas of deprivation.  When I spoke here on this issue three years ago I referred to the deindustrialisation of areas in the North and I am sure that this matter will be a source of concern for the Anglo-Irish Conference in the future and will come under surveillance in the study being carried out on its workings.</P>
    <P>The reference to disadvantaged areas leads me on logically to the International Fund for Ireland.  The fund was established under Article 10 of the Agreement &ldquo;to promote the economic and social development of those areas of both parts of Ireland which suffered most severely from the consequences of the instability of recent years&rdquo;.  The fund to date has been supported almost exclusively from the United States, and here I must pay the warmest possible tribute to the generosity and instinctive concern for Ireland shown by so many of our friends in Congress there over the years.  Indeed, today President Reagan underlined their commitment to that type of generosity in the future and we must be grateful to him and the American people.  I know I will be forgiven and understood if I single out Speaker Tip O'Neill for special appreciation. The two Governments owe an exceptional debt of gratitude to Mr. O'Neill for his concern, commitment and dedication to ensuring that the fund successfully got off the ground with substantial financial support available to it. <Col N="784" /> Being of Donegal stock, it pleased him to be able to use his influence in that regard.</P>
    <P>Neither our predecessors nor ourselves were, of course, happy that a disproportionate share of the burden of financing the fund fell on the United States. We, therefore, took up actively the question of a joint approach to the European Community with the British Government. Here I must pay tribute to the Tánaiste who succeeded in convincing his opposite numbers on the British side of the importance &mdash; symbolic as well as substantive &mdash; of a Community contribution. This can be very important in the eyes of the Europeans and Americans. The response from the Community was swift and positive and a European contribution will now be available to the fund from next year on.</P>
    <P>The operation of the fund has, of course, already been reviewed by both Governments.  Following discussions at the Conference earlier in the year, a joint paper on future strategy was conveyed to the board of the fund who recommended that the fund should be focused to a greater degree in future on disadvantaged areas in Northern Ireland and that, secondly, they should consider supporting one or more imaginative cross-Border flagship projects.  We are particularly pleased that the board of the fund subsequently established a Disadvantaged Areas Initiative and decided to consider supporting a number of cross-Border flagship projects.  I mentioned the word &ldquo;symbolic&rdquo;; symbolism is very important in this regard and the key is the sharing of the project between North and South.</P>
    <P>One of the flagship projects which is under active consideration at the moment, and to which the Government attach high priority, would involve linking the waterways of the entire island through the reopening of the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell Canal.  I understand that the board of the fund are commissioning a study on, <i>inter alia</i>, the tourism potential of this linkage and that it is hoped that this report will be before them early in the new year.  The Government, for their part, have established a <Col N="785" /> high-powered inter-departmental committee to ensure that there are no bureaucratic blockages or hold-ups to the early advancement of this historic endeavour. The possibility of providing access to a system of waterways unique in Europe can only be fascinating and exciting to anyone with a feel for the tourism potential of this country and there are waterways I know from having sailed them.  A reopened canal would recreate for the people of Fermanagh, Cavan and Leitrim &mdash; and indeed for the country as a whole &mdash; an invaluable and unique facility.  I, as Minister for Tourism and Transport, look forward to the early advancement of this project and I will continue to give it every possible support and encouragement, both inside and outside Government.</P>
    <P>What I have outlined up to now has been by and large the positive part of the balance sheet of the Anglo-Irish Agreement. There is, however, a very considerable amount of work still left to be done before we can say that the operation of the Agreement has made a significant and visible impact on the plight of the Nationalist community in the North.  We need urgently to see a major move on harassment, which perhaps is the greatest source of concern to, and alienation of, Nationalists today.  A system of responding quickly and effectively to complaints of harassment needs to be put in place as a matter of the highest priority.  And this system should be accompanied by the closest possible monitoring of patterns of harassment.  This is an issue of the deepest concern to the Government. Harassment is the recruiting sergeant for violence.</P>
    <P>Secondly, the commitment on the accompaniment of the UDR, set out three years ago in the communique issued with the Agreement, needs, after three years, to be made effective.  I spoke about that three years ago as well.  It is, in particular, unacceptable that in Nationalist areas, and on access routes into Nationalist areas &mdash; and there are many parishes in my county, half of which are in County Cavan and half in County Fermanagh &mdash; the UDR should continue, <Col N="786" /> three years after the signing of the Agreement, to be unaccompanied.  The implementation of this commitment, given the history of the UDR, is the minimum reform necessary at this time.</P>
    <P>It is time to take stock after three years of the progress &mdash; and the lack of it &mdash; achieved under the Agreement.  I welcome the decision of the last Conference that the review should be &ldquo;thorough and serious&rdquo;.  I should wish to see each of the operational articles of the Agreement examined in detail and recommendations made on how their potential might best be developed.  Apart from the confidence and administration of justice areas, I believe it is crucially important that the potential for co-operation in the economic and social fields be exploited and maximised, including the implications for both parts of the island of the completion of the Single Market in 1992.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy Reynolds, has already spoken about this. There is enormous potential in this area which, if we can succeed in harnessing and developing it, will be of the greatest possible advantage to the people of this island, in the North as well as in the South and Unionist as well as Nationalist.  I hope that my remarks will be seen always in the joint context, the North-South context, because that is what the Agreement is about.  At present in the United States we are doing joint marketing of the North and South in the tourism field.</P>
    <P>Before concluding, I would wish to place on record my very strong support for the development of the widest possible dialogue between all the political parties on this island.  As the Tánaiste said, as reported in yesterday's <i>Irish News</i>, &ldquo;Logic, realism, and commonsense all point towards the need for such dialogue&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Ireland will never realise its full potential unless all of us, of whatever tradition and in whatever part of the country, accept that we share a common destiny together on this island.  That was the theme of my remarks when I came to this House 14 or 15 years ago.  We must, together in Ireland, Unionist and Nationalist, confront the view sometimes <Col N="787" /> heard from the other island that there is no solution to our problem.  There is, and must be, a solution.  It will be found in large part in the two great traditions in the island getting together and agreeing on how we will share this island together to the maximum benefit of all our people. That is a common theme of Mr. John Hume MP, MEP.  Again I want to refer to my contribution in 1985 which recognised that.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would like to wish the review every possible success.  It will require great commitment, imagination and foresightedness on the part of both sides if the process is going to make the impact of the Agreement more relevant and more responsive to the real needs of people on the ground.  It is largely against this background, and it is a challenging and formidable one, that the outcome of the review will be judged.  I want to repeat that harassment and unevenhanded justice are the recruiting sergeants for violence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The whole purpose of the Hillsborough Accord was to make possible political progress in Northern Ireland and, in particular, to make possible the hastening of the devolution process and the restoration, if possible, of some kind of power sharing executive of the kind which existed briefly in 1973-74.  That progress was intended to be achieved partly by inserting an irritant &mdash; I mean the word in a benign sense like the piece of gravel introduced into an oyster in order to produce a pearl &mdash; in the shape of the Irish dimension in northern government.  The presence of a small number of Irish civil servants is a purely symbolic thing but, as Deputy O'Malley said here half an hour ago, this is a country in which symbolisms go a very great distance, sometimes far further than practical measures.  I recognise the importance of symbolisms and even though the thing could not weigh very heavily on people's practical lives, I have no doubt that the presence of an Irish official dimension in the governmental <Col N="788" /> process in Maryfield does mean something disagreeable, unwelcome and unfamiliar to the ordinary Northern Unionists or Protestant just as it would be unfamiliar, disagreeable and unacceptable to us if there sat in on Government processes in Merrion Street looking over every Minister's shoulder a couple of gentlemen or ladies from Whitehall.</P>
      <P>We have to understand, even though it takes an effort to understand it, the Unionist mentality.  Deputies, particularly those like Deputy Wilson from the Border counties, are always at pains to tell us how well they understand the Unionists, that they have been dealing with them all their lives.  Even Deputy Reynolds, who does not strike me as being a Border-type, was boasting a while ago that he lived only 35 miles away from them.  We are always hearing about how well they are understood but I think it is only the very odd Deputy who makes the point here that they, too, have sensibilities and that if we try to put ourselves in their position &mdash; even though I have no sympathy with the history behind their activities; I realise that they laid down the ground on which their present misfortunes have been built &mdash; and tried to reverse the irritations under which they now live we would find that we too would think we had plenty of reason to be intransigent and to be grumbling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present political progress towards devolution and power sharing is blocked by the Unionists refusal &mdash; I know I am telescoping a whole spectrum of opinions and views in the Unionist camp by putting it like this &mdash; to do business with or talk to anybody for so long as the Anglo-Irish Agreement is in place.  That is unreasonable of them even when I take into account their sensibilities which I have tried to draw the attention of the House to but I wonder if it would be possible for us to do something outside the Anglo-Irish Agreement which would not cut across it and which might signal to them that we, too, are willing to have bruised sensibilties in the interest of the higher value of normalising conditions for ordinary people in Northern Ireland; that we, too, will endure some blow to our pride; <Col N="789" /> that we, too, are willing to put something in our pocket and forget about it or put it up on a shelf and leave it in abeyance in the interest of creating decent, neighbourly, Christian civilised conditions in that one part of western Europe where they do not exist for many people.</P>
    <P>The suggestion I would make to the House &mdash; it is not a new one but I have not heard it made here yet today &mdash; is that the Government should consider initiating a referendum to remove from Article 3 of the Constitution the unrealistic and offensive claim to the effect that this House, this Parliament and Government, are entitled as of right to exercise jurisdiction over the Six Counties of Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>In 1966, before he left office, Mr. Séan Lemass, then Taoiseach, set up a committee to review the various provisions of the Constitution.  That committee unanimously recommended a change in Article 3 to a less abrasive formula, a formula in which a claim of right on behalf of this House, and on behalf of the Government supported by this House, nowhere appeared.  That lasted only a couple of months until former Deputy Kevin Boland shot it down in flames at a Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis and all the &ldquo;guff&rdquo; Republicans ran for cover.  That was the last that was heard of that.  I am speaking from memory but I think that report was signed by Séan Lemass himself, George Colley, David Andrews, Eoin Ryan and Bobby Molloy, although he has now moved to another party, and I may be forgetting a couple of Fianna Fáil names.</P>
    <P>I wish Fianna Fáil could find it in their hearts to look at this report again, to revive it and see if they could swallow that as well as all the other things they have swallowed, and promote a referendum and on the same day as the European elections which are due to be held next June.  This could save money and would serve to muffle the fuss which a referendum of this kind will cause.  When the referendum is passed, as I believe it would be because this party would support it as would the Progressive Democrats and the Labour Party, it would signal to the Unionist population that we <Col N="790" /> too are willing to endure a thorn in the side.  If it was what I might call a real thorn in the side and if we had any real basis historically for grievance about having to face facts and incorporate into the Constitution something realistic instead of something unrealistic and offensive, it would be a different matter, but there is not such a reason.</P>
    <P>I am sorry to rake up ancient history seeing that I so frequently advocate that we should ignore it, but the plain fact is that the only representatives of the Irish Nationalist tradition which could be found signed a treaty in 1922, and ratified it subsequently by legislation in 1925, which recognised the status of Northern Ireland.  Everybody here knows, it was poison on the side of the people who signed the treaty to do that.  Collins, Griffiths and Cosgrave thought it was a temporary settlement, that it was only a matter of time before the Border would disappear, but this was all they were able to get for the moment.</P>
    <P>Twelve years after the 1925 Settlement Act we enacted a Constitution, admittedly by plebiscite &mdash; and I cannot question the people's right to enact what they like &mdash; which effectively said to the British and the people of Northern Ireland that they cannot rely on our word in a document, that they cannot rely on a promise given as solemnly on our behalf as it is possible for a promise to be given, and we incorporate this provision which flies in the face of the faith we had offered them.</P>
    <P>It is all very well to talk about duress; virtually every peace treaty is signed under duress but the rest of the world has to be able to rely on it otherwise there would never be peace.  If there was nothing to be gained from a peace treaty the victor country would never sign one because it would be open to the vanquished to turn around as soon as they got their breath back and break it.</P>
    <P>I have to ask the House to put themselves in the shoes of a population with whom, historically, I have no sympathy. What use is there talking in the grand language of Deputy Wilson about the two great traditions in the island when his <Col N="791" /> own party's record is one of ignoring one of those traditions, of trampling and spitting on it and regarding its views, values and wishes as irrelevant, not weighing in the balance against Article 3?</P>

      <P>I do not mean to speak excitedly to Deputy Wilson, although he has a short fuse at times, but he is the target of what I am saying now because he and Deputy Davern are the only two in the Fianna Fáil benches at present, and Deputy Davern seems to be more laid back about this than Deputy Wilson.</P>
      <P>I have to ask Deputies to put themselves in the position of a Unionist being told we have to co-operate when all he has to do is open page 1 of the main text of the Constitution and he finds the words:</P>
      <P>Pending the re-integration of the national territory, and without prejudice to the right of the Parliament and Government established by this Constitution to exercise jurisdiction over the whole of that territory, ......</P>
      <P>What is he to make of somebody who talks friendship in one breath while holding up a placard inscribed with those words?  When he asks if the pacard will be taken down because it is causing annoyance, he is told we cannot do that because we would be selling out the dead generations if we did.  One dead generation which fought to set up this State were willing to compromise on this, thinking it was only a temporary measure, but they were willing to offer faith to the other people who live on this island and to the British, and they acquiesced in the Twenty-six Counties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To take that step I believe it would unfreeze relations and dismantle the distrust of which the Minister for Industry and Commerce spoke about earlier.  If it does not do that, then I must admit I am at the end of my resources.  I cannot think of anything else we could do.  We have taken the special position of the Catholic Church out of the Constitution and we <Col N="792" /> have done our best in the teeth of the hidden opposition of the Fianna Fáil Party to put the law in regard to divorce on the same footing as it is everywhere else in Europe.  I cannot think of anything else we could do.  We will have shot our bolt, but at least let us shoot that bolt and make that effort.</P>
    <P>On a recent television programme I was asked by the interviewer, who thought he had me spreadeagled with this question: &ldquo;If you are so keen on this and if you think your party are of the same opinion, why did you not do it over the last four and a half years you were in Government?&rdquo;  The answer is very simple.  No referendum of any kind has ever been carried in the history of this State against the opposition of either of the major parties.</P>
    <P>Everyone watching Fianna Fáil over the last few years listened to the Taoiseach, Deputy Haughey, talking about Northern Ireland being a failed political entity.  The cheek of him to say that in one breath and with another breath invite them to come to see him and have tea. How can he talk like that to people, illegitimising their institutions in our Constitution and then making fun of them in casual expressions of that sort, cheap, glib expressions which would enrage us if anyone used them about us? What prospect is there for a party with a leader who spoke like that and which bullied the New Ireland Forum &mdash; which I must admit was no difficult task &mdash; into putting a unitary State at the head of their list of preferences, making it absolutely certain that Mrs. Thatcher would throw the lot out the window?  Their intent was to humiliate the Government and leave them in a hole.  What was the prospect that a party with that record would row in on a referendum to amend Article 3? Absolutely none.  That was one foolish referendum the last Government did not embark on because had they done so naturally it would have been defeated and there would have been the same campaign against it, except this time it would be an overt campaign, mounted by the far side.  I know Deputy Wilson would not willingly tell a lie to the House and I <Col N="793" /> do not believe he would even contradict me, but they would have opposed that.</P>
    <P>They are in a different position.  They are dealing with a very different kind of opposition, as they know, on the economic front.  We do not hand trip them. We are not in here every week with Private Members' motions calling for more and more expenditure, whingeing about this, whingeing about that, whingeing about people who think they are left short because of Government measures.  We realise the Government have a disagreeable job to do and we are deliberately, even at the cost of votes to ourselves &mdash; and many of our grassroots do not like it &mdash; refraining from making difficulties for this Government.  As I said, this Government are facing a very different kind of opposition.</P>
    <P>This is a &ldquo;weather window&rdquo;, as I have said in another connection, in which it will be possible to do these things because the Government will not get opposition from over here.  I have not heard this subject being formally debated in the Fine Gael Party &mdash; I do not think it has been debated recently &mdash; but I know that Deputy FitzGerald, the former Taoiseach, thinks as I do about this.  It is not right to involve other colleagues by naming them, but I am as certain as I can be that a proposal to go back to something like the 1967 formula in the report of the Committee on the Constitution would be supported by this party.  This is the moment to do it.  That might unfreeze relations.  That might signal to the Unionists that we are doing something over and above our obligations under the Hillsborough Accord, that we are moving out to meet them at a cost of putting our pride, on many of the words we have spoken, in our pockets, forgetting about them for the moment.</P>
    <P>It may be &mdash; and I am certain it is so &mdash; that there are people up there whose rooted objection to doing business with this State is so ingrained into their bones that nothing will make them think otherwise. If so, I am at the end of my resources.  Who says our lives will be a failure?  Who says we will all pass through the world without any achievement to <Col N="794" /> our names if we do not see a united Ireland?  Would not the achievement of peace and normality for 1½ million unfortunate people be achievement enough? Are we so inhuman that we will postpone that to a childish desire to see a tricolour waving on City Hall in Belfast?  If that is the collective feeling of this House, I will leave it but I do not believe that that is the case.  We have had this idiotic, chauvinistic idea wished upon us and we are afraid to throw it off.  I am sorry to say something disagreeable but if we said we would go back to the position of 1925 we would accept that you had a right to live with your own institutions and that, in order to normalise relations between us and to induce normality in the North, we ought to relinquish our claim.  We would say that we would never revive it although we would always have the aspiration to unity and you could not kill that on us.  We could say that we would not make a claim of right which would always lead you to suppose that even when we were holding a hand out on one side of our body, we would have a hatchet behind our backs.</P>
    <P>I know that Deputy Wilson is a reflecting, thinking man.  I also know that he has a short fuse and a large dose of Ulster blood &mdash; I suppose it is all Ulster blood &mdash; and that I am not, therefore, speaking to someone who is necessarily receptive emotionally to what I am saying. However, I know that intellectually he will listen to me and the House and I would be grateful if he would float this idea in his Government.</P>
    <P>I should like to end by saying this to him in regard to the Government's general performance, by way of analogy and not by way of getting away from the subject.  The moments in which the Government have got applause &mdash; perhaps muted &mdash; and approval from people who never voted for them and perhaps never will vote for them, but who recognise an honest day's work when they see it, is when the Government have gone back on things they said which they ought not to have said, when they have not persisted in politics or attitudes which were wrong.  It may be rather sentimental <Col N="795" /> and sloppy of them but Irish people are inclined to give a cheer to someone who recognises that he has made a mistake or taken up a wrong position saying sincerely that they are sorry.  Irish people admire that and it is a great trait.  They do not value a pedantic consistency; they value somebody admitting and acknowledging, even grudgingly, that he was wrong and doing something else.  The Fianna Fáil Party would come out of it with nothing but credit if they were to initiate a referendum process of the kind I mentioned.  I cannot believe they would not get the assistance of this party, I cannot speak for the Progressive Democrats but I expect the same would be true of them and of Labour.  It would be a major contribution and something which no amount of political rhetoric about the two great traditions in this country could compare in its long-term effect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened to Deputy Kelly and I know his remarks are sincere. Article 41 was considered offensive and it was removed from the Constitution. Similarly, I do not see anything offensive in giving up the aspiration to unity because it is practical and sensible.  The republicanism I should like to see is the kind that came from Sean Lemass, who believed that the person who worked for the Republic, built it up and took pride in an honest day's work would make the country more attractive.  That is the best way forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Too often in the European Community I heard the Reverend Ian Paisley saying that if such and such was in the Republic of Ireland it would be termed a disadvantaged area.  I do not mean disadvantaged in the sense of the areas now being selected by the Agreement but the Glens of Antrim were not included and many areas in south Fermanagh were also excluded because the Government are so far removed from the concept of farming and have no interest in getting a disadvantaged area plan for the small farmers in these areas to keep the small communities alive.  The social aspect was looked for as an example to the Republic <Col N="796" /> from the viewpoint of what had been done and much support was given by the Irish Members to the Northern pleas for disadvantaged areas.</P>
    <P>My main concern is how people are perceiving this Agreement.  We have been talking about both traditions in Northern Ireland but we are largely leaving out another section, the people of the Republic.  I am worried about their perspective of the Agreement.  I am also worried about the emphasis that the press have laid on this Agreement.  They emphasise that any meeting which takes place is always in relation to security. They do not emphasise meetings which discuss economic well-being or social integration.  For example, the broadening of the Agreement by the Government to include disadvantaged areas has not been emphasised.  As far as I am aware, the vast majority of people in my constituency do not even know that such matters are being discussed because of the emphasis on extradition and other areas.</P>
    <P>I support the principle of extradition. It is a commitment which, as a civilised nation, we must have.  However, it worries me that certain aspects surrounding extradition have not been fully explained to the people by the press who continually emphasise the security aspects.  Only one person has been extradited under the amended 1987 Act for an offence which was not of a very serious criminal nature, which did not relate to terrorism.  All the other applications have gone through our court system.  The worrying part is that the public are being fed a line by people who are not openly members of Sinn Féin or the IRA but who are clever, well placed people who express their allegedly independent, serious concern regarding extradition.  Of course, this has been fuelled by the unequal justice applied to Irish people in British courts.  Whether true or false, that is how they see it.  A man who had raped 17 women got the same sentence as the Winchester Three. Officially, these people had done nothing beyond amateurish planning but they got a savage sentence.  This is where the fear <Col N="797" /> of co-operation with extradition and other such matters arises.</P>
    <P>The failure of the British Government to introduce a three judge court is a very serious matter.  We know why Northern Ireland had to get rid of juries, they were not able to bring in a decision because of fear.  However, we introduced a very fair system of a three judge court to deal with terrorist charges.  Each had a different level of experience and could confer with the others.  When the jury system was replaced in Northern Ireland they turned to the Diplock system, a single judge. That judge does not have the confidence of the Nationalist minority in Northern Ireland and he must now contend with the right of silence.</P>
    <P>The right of silence is a major aspect. If one does not want to condemn oneself one need not say anything, but it is now accepted that if you remain silent you are guilty.  I would not like to see that judgment left to one judge.  If the confidence of the Northern population is to be restored we will have to see the introduction of the three judge courts in Northern Ireland.  It is not just the people in Northern Ireland but also the people in the Republic who need to be assured of that confidence in the courts as well as in the police and in other areas.</P>
    <P>People already have doubts as a result of the failure to prosecute in the Stalker-Sampson affair.  The release of Private Thain from jail and the reinstitution into the Army of that same private who had been given a life sentence casts serious doubts among the practical people in the Republic of Ireland.  The men who disrupt communities are now doing so in a much more clever fashion and those people are not even known to be members or strong supporters of the Provisional IRA.  The Gibraltar incident is another such case and the unfortunate remarks of the British Prime Minister in relation to that case bring about a kind of gung-ho situation.  This again casts serious doubts among people in the Republic, people who never supported violence and who would have no hand, act or part in it.  There is a lack of sensitivity by the British authorities in this <Col N="798" /> area.  There are people on both sides to be considered.</P>
    <P>I am delighted that the prison review system is in operation.  The champion of that has been Father Denis Faul who has done tremendous work over the years. He has proved himself to be a very independent person when it comes to helping all the people of Northern Ireland.  I know that the Tánaiste and the Minister for Justice have been working extremely hard on the Anglo-Irish Agreement. While Deputy O'Malley may say that there is a <i>bon homie</i> attitude between the two sides and is facetious about it, I do not think it is fair to say that the progress that has been made has been as a result of anything else but trust and confidence on both sides.  Negotiations nearly broke down on a number of occasions and it was the strong resolve of this Government, through the two Ministers who have been dealing with this matter, who have kept them on the right track.  We should try to ensure that the minority in Northern Ireland have confidence in the system of justice there. The Government should work with the British Government to ensure that that is brought about.  People in the Republic do not believe that a person who is extradited to Britain will get an honest trial. Nobody has been extradited from the Republic to Britain but there is a fear among people that, if that should happen, they would not get a fair trial.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Tánaiste and the Minister for Justice in their continuing negotiations to try to get the support of the vast majority of the people of the island in regard to the introduction of the three judge court system.  Above all they should implement the Criminal Jurisdiction Act which would ease tensions between the people in the North and South.  There was a recent trial of some UDF people in Northern Ireland who were charged with crimes in the Dublin area.  Those people were successfully tried in their own jurisdiction and were sentenced.  That practice should be brought much more into perspective.  I am not trying to diminute the issue of <Col N="799" /> extradition but in the present circumstances it would be fair if the Criminal Jurisdiction Act was brought much more into play.  This should be done and should be seen to be done.  The public should be able to view those matters in the public light rather than from behind closed doors.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what the Government's policy is for development in regard to Northern Ireland.  I have a fairly good idea from listening to various press statements issued by the Government what they are against but I am not quite so sure about what they are in favour of.  Their policy seems to be one of reaction, reaction of horror to the last atrocity, reaction to some recent action taken by some British institution and, to a lesser extent I am glad to say, reaction sometimes to pressures from their own backbenchers.  They have many criticisms to offer as a Government of things that are happening in Northern Ireland but I am not sure that they have any clear idea of what the next step will be to bring about a coming together of the two communities in Northern Ireland.  No suggestions have been made from the Government side as to what should be done next to bring the communities together.  The only concrete proposal of that kind that was mentioned in the Tánaiste's speech was a reference to devolution on which he promptly poured cold water.  If he believes devolution is not the answer, what is his answer and what is the Government's answer to the next step to bring about a solution?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Tánaiste referred to the problems experienced by the Nationalist community since the Agreement was signed. He said: &ldquo;We have in particular to take account of the reality that, to some extent at least, the achievements of the Agreement have so far failed to fulfil the hopes and expectations of many members of the Nationalist community&rdquo;.  He went on to say: &ldquo;That is why all supporters of the Agreement must be sobered by findings which show that only a minority of Nationalists in Northern Ireland feel that <Col N="800" /> the Agreement has made a difference to their daily lives&rdquo;.  He does not say whether he believes the Nationalist community are right or wrong.  He just made that statement without drawing a conclusion from it.  However, he listed five concrete achievements of the Agreement: the improved policing of the marching season; an end to supergrass trials; a new code of conduct for the RUC; the beginnings of an economic programme for West Belfast and the preparation of effective fair employment legislation.  He did not say what further progress is anticipated by the Government or the Nationalist community which would allay the disappointment to which he referred.</P>
    <P>I have read carefully through the Tánaiste's speech and the only concrete suggestions I could see in it as to what should be done, beyond the five elements of progress to which I have referred, are a strengthened commitment to consultation &mdash; whatever that means &mdash; under Article 2 of the Agreement and the introduction of three judge courts.  I would ask the Tánaiste and the Minister a straight question.  Do they believe that if those two suggestions made by the Tánaiste were implemented tomorrow, we would be able to say in two year's time that the Nationalist community were satisfied?  Do they believe that would satisfy them?  If the answer to that is &ldquo;no&rdquo;, they should be asking a much more fundamental question, &ldquo;What else do we need to do?&rdquo; and try to find an answer to that.</P>
    <P>I believe the answer is to be found in the form of devolution on the basis of power-sharing.  If progress is to be made the communities in Northern Ireland must be put under some measure of pressure to take responsibility for the management of their own affairs.  To some extent the Unionists are constantly looking over their shoulder and saying London is responsible for them.  To a certain extent also the Nationalists are looking over their shoulder to Dublin and saying Dublin is responsible for them.  It is almost a relationship similar to that of parents and children.  Children feel their <Col N="801" /> parents are in some way responsible for them, and that being the case, they are reluctant to take responsibility themselves. I stress that that is an analogy, not a reality; it is an analogy that could cause hurt to people and I do not mean it in that sense.  However, I want to say in a positive sense that we must create a means whereby the two communities in Northern Ireland will take responsibility for managing their own affairs, otherwise, two years from now we will still have the same disillusionment that the Tánaiste referred to, despite the major progress that has been made under the Anglo-Irish Agreement and the fact that politicians from the Republic have a direct say in what happens in Northern Ireland.  Despite all that, the Tánaiste, probably not incorrectly, referred to disillusionment. I think that disillusionment will continue in both communities unless the whole climate is transformed by means of devolution.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste said, &ldquo;I simply do not see the prospects in this area are very high at present&rdquo;.  That is an unnecessarily fatalistic attitude.  The Tánaiste must try to make the climate one in which that area will have prospects.  He is a politician and a leader and he should be attempting to lead opinion in Northern Ireland towards devolution rather than simply accepting resignedly that progress cannot be made. The only way we in this House can change that is to try to analyse why there is a reluctance in the various communities in Northern Ireland to go into devolution on a power-sharing basis and consider what we can do to remove that.  The SDLP are probably a little reluctant to enter into power-sharing because they saw what happened to Sunningdale and they feel the guarantees are not ultimately there, that the legs will be cut from under them again as happened when British Prime Minister Wilson failed to stand up to the Ulster workers' strike. Before they would be prepared to be really forthcoming about devolution the SDLP would want much firmer guarantees that that sort of thing would not happen again and they would not be left holding the baby, so to speak, isolated in <Col N="802" /> their own community, supporting policies that a majority in the power-sharing administration got them to agree to and then walked away from them.  We need to address that question about how the SDLP can be given greater assurances that an Ulster workers' strike type of situation will not recur than was offered to them in the Sunningdale Agreement.</P>
    <P>The Alliance Party are the only party who have come out full-bloodedly in favour of devolution in a power-sharing context.  It is important that the document the Alliance Party have produced be analysed to some degree at least in this debate.  They suggest that the Secretary of State should nominate an executive who would, as far as possible, be balanced, representing all the parties in an elected assembly in Northern Ireland, but nobody in the assembly should support violence.  Such an executive would continue in office only if they got repeated motions of what they call &mdash; not confidence &mdash; acceptability from 70 per cent of the members of the assembly, which would require both communities continuing to express acceptance, if not necessarily agreement, with the operation of what would be effectively a power-sharing executive.  That is the way things might work.</P>
    <P>The only reservation I would express about the Alliance Party approach is in regard to how this body would be financed. They say there are two alternative ways of doing it.  One would be a revenue based system where devolved administration would have to raise the money to pay for their own activities.  The other would be an expenditure based system where essentially they would work out what they needed and then go off cap in hand to somebody else looking for the money.  The Alliance Party conclude that they are sceptical about the proposition that it would be possible in a devolved system in Northern Ireland institutions to finance themselves while at the same time maintaining comparable standards of service with those provided in Great Britain. In other words, they want a devolved administration which has devolved power but no devolved responsibility.  They want <Col N="803" /> power-sharing but not responsibility-sharing as far as raising the money is concerned.</P>
    <P>If you want the two communities in Northern Ireland to work together and get away from the sense of looking to somebody else they must be responsible for paying and taking the tough decisions in regard to how they will pay for what they are going to do in Northern Ireland, and not simply saying they are going to Brussels or London to look for more money if they reach an <i>impasse</i> in their discussions and can go no further because they have not got the ability and have not taken responsibility for raising the funds themselves.  If a devolved administration were to work on a power-sharing basis it would have to be a devolved responsibility administration that had financial responsibility and had to take tough financial decisions themselves rather than have those simply passed over to London or somewhere else.  However, broadly speaking the Alliance Party are prepared to go along with power-sharing and devolution, and so are the SDLP so long as the problems I have referred to about having the ground cut from under them as happened before can be addressed.</P>
    <P>One might say the Unionist parties are totally opposed to this ideal, but if you read the Unionist parties' document, admittedly published before the Anglo-Irish Agreement and entitled <i>The Way Forward</i>&mdash; a happy title &mdash; you will find they criticised the SDLP for not entering the Assembly because if they had entered the Assembly it might have been possible for cross-community support to have been achieved for an Executive under the terms laid down by Secretary of State Prior.  They said that because the SDLP did not enter the Assembly devolution was paralysed.  Therefore, in a sense, in a sort of backward way, they are accepting that devolution and power-sharing on a cross-community basis are desirable if only because they are criticising somebody else for frustrating it from happening. They do not actually propose power-sharing in <i>The Way Forward</i>, but <Col N="804" /> what is interesting is that they propose a concept that perhaps imaginative politicians here could build on, that is the concept of a bill of rights.  What they have in mind is a bill of rights for individuals, not for a community, to be explicitly set out in legislation which would oblige the devolved administration to respect these rights of individuals.  The effect of such legislation would be to provide machinery whereby &ldquo;any action on the part of the Northern Ireland devolved institution conflicting with any listed right would be declared void and any act of the Northern Ireland administration conflicting with any such right would be declared unlawful.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>They admit that this proposal, &ldquo;may be considered by some to be too modest, but they (the Unionist Party) have watched while grander and more ambitious schemes have failed.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste might consider taking the Unionists at their word and saying, &ldquo;OK, we know you are not in favour at the moment of devolved administration involving power-sharing; you want something slightly different from power-sharing, but could we build on this concept that you are in favour of a bill of rights?&rdquo; Why not say there should be a bill of political rights for communities as well as rights for individuals, a right not just to an individual to fair housing for himself but the right for an individual to feel his community is entitled to a fair say in housing policy as distinct from just a right for himself?  Could we extend the concept of a bill of rights to include community rights, in other words, rights for the minority as well as the majority, as well as simply rights for individuals?</P>
    <P>Politics, frequently, is taking somebody else's ideas and using them to achieve something one wants to achieve.  There is nothing underhand or unworthy about that.  It is, in a sense, the art of the politician to find a way of building across what appears to be an unbridgable gap. There may appear to be an unbridgable gap at the moment between those of us who want a power sharing administration <Col N="805" /> in the North so that peace and harmony can be restored and people in the North who are Nationalist but against violence and who want something concrete to give allegiance to just as Unionists of the same temper will have.  In the concept of a Bill of rights put forward by the official Unionists there is something that one can at least build on and talk to them about. That is why I am disappointed that the Government have been so vague and impersonal in the invitation they have issued to the Unionist community.  We have said that we would be prepared to talk if they are prepared to talk, but no invitations have been issued.  I hope in that short description I have given of the party's policies and concerns about devolution that the Tánaiste will see that there is fertile ground for a political initiative by him to achieve devolution and that he should not simply stand back and wring his hands and say circumstances are unpromising.</P>
    <P>The last point I want to make is in regard to integrated education.  I hope the Minister for Education will have something to say about that.  The Northern Ireland Office has proposed that a simple majority of a board of governors of a school or 20 per cent of the parents of that school can initiate a proposal to change the status of the school to make it an integrated school, that if such a proposal is carried the board of governors would be obliged to have a postal ballot on the proposal.  They further propose that there should be preferential treatment in regard to grants given to integrated schools in Northern Ireland.  The Catholic Bishops have responded to this by saying that they own the Catholic schools, that the trustees are the actual legal owners of the schools, and that while the Church does nothing to oppose or obstruct efforts of people whose sincerity they respect and who feel that integrated schools is the way forward, essentially they, the Bishops, feel that the proposals put forward are unfair and unjust in a number of other respects, particularly in regard to the integrity of Catholic education and the amount of effort they put in over the years to put <Col N="806" /> the schools there, and in that a transient majority could simply take them away from them.  I believe that bitterness arises from not having certain common experiences. Somebody with whom one has common experiences, with whom one has lived, worked and played, however long ago it may have been, is somebody one would find it a lot harder to engage in violent conflict than somebody who is simply a name on the electoral role or in a telephone book.  If all the Catholics are educated in one set of schools and all the Protestants are educated in another set of schools it would be extremely difficult to get people to realise that those about whose movements they are giving information to subversive organisations are actually human beings who, if they only got to know them, they might like quite a lot.  The reason they do not get to know them is, to a very great extent, that they never got the opportunity to do anything with them.  They play different games; they go to different schools; they may live beside one another but they have virtually no common experience.</P>
    <P>I respect and support the ethos of Catholic education.  Religious education is extremely valuable and, in a world where it does not cause other problems, it is something that one should have but in the particular circumstances of Northern Ireland one is talking about having to adjust a scale of values.  There are other values that are also important and one of those, in the context of integrated education, is building a community with peace and reconciliation and understanding between individuals.  While I do not think it is right for politicians down here to tell the churches how they should order their affairs &mdash; we are suspicious of other people telling us how to order our political business &mdash; we should open up some dialogue with the churches about the possible role of integrated education, in the long run, not providing a panacea for the problems in Northern Ireland but starting a process that will make alienation and treating people as objects rather than as human beings something that is much less possible than it is at the moment.</P>

      <P>I am very glad to participate in this debate today and to have been here for that very spirited and interesting contribution from Deputy Bruton.  The review provided for in the Anglo-Irish Agreement is in the following terms:</P>
      <P>At the end of three years from signature of this Agreement, or earlier if requested by either Government, the working of the conference shall be reviewed by the two Governments to see whether any changes in the scope and nature of its activities are desirable&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>While it is clear that what is envisaged is a review of the workings of the Conference rather than of the Agreement as such, the statement issued after the meeting of the Anglo-Irish Conference on 2 November leaves no doubt but that both sides are determined that the review process should be as broad as possible.  That statement makes clear that the two Governments have committed themselves to ensuring that the review will be thorough and serious.</P>
      <P>According to the same statement, the review will have both a historical, evaluative aspect and a forward-looking character.  It will look back over the experience of the past three years and assess the working of the Conference during that time.  This work will entail a careful appraisal of how the Conference has measured up to its potential under each of the articles of the Agreement.</P>
      <P>The main emphasis, however, will be on a positive programme of work for the future in order to further the aims of the Agreement.  Over the next few months this programme will be drawn up with the greatest possible account being taken of views expressed to each of the Governments. The Government naturally hope that all constitutional political bodies, including the Unionists, will avail of this opportunity to come forward with their views.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Anglo-Irish Agreement is often criticised for allegedly having delivered too little, but it is surely not correct to judge it solely on a list of its achievements <Col N="808" /> over a three-year period.  The Agreement is more than its past record or even the present agenda of the Conference.  It provides us with certain mechanisms which the Government are committed to using for the benefit of all the people of Northern Ireland and particularly of the Nationalist community.</P>
    <P>The Anglo-Irish Conference and the Secretariat are now firmly established. The Conference is now meeting more often than at any time over the past three years.  This year alone it has met nine times and a further meeting is envisaged for next month.  If we were to take a European analogy, this is almost as often as the meetings of the Council of Foreign Ministers in Brussels.  The Secretariat in Maryfield operates on a 24 hour basis and has proved itself to be a most effective channel for dealing with the whole range of issues covered by the Agreement.</P>
    <P>Of course there have been other positive developments.  The improvements in the policing of the marching season over the last two years have been widely acknowledged.  There has been a new code of conduct for the RUC.  The supergrass trials have ended.  Co-operation on security matters continues.  New fair employment legislation is to be introduced. The Fund was set up and has now turned its attention to disadvantaged areas and there has been the beginning of an economic package for west Belfast.</P>
    <P>However, if achievements have been made, a great deal remains to be done. The constant complaints made by the Nationalist community of harassment by the security forces cannot be ignored. An effective way of responding to these complaints, together with a careful monitoring of the patterns they indicate, would seem to be basic elements of any progress in this area.  The need of the Nationalist community to feel greater confidence in the administration of justice must find a response in practical ways which can allay their concerns.  The economic aid to west Belfast must continue and other economically disadvantaged areas must be helped in a similar fashion. The new fair employment legislation must meet the most rigorous standards if <Col N="809" /> it is to be effective on the ground.  In a situation where studies over the past 20 years have consistently shown that Catholic males are two-and-a-half times as likely to be unemployed as their Protestant counterparts, there is clearly no room for half measures.</P>
    <P>In my own area of education, Deputies will have been aware that there has been an ongoing discussion in recent months on the merits of new education proposals for Northern Ireland.  The consultative document proposing new structures for education in Northern Ireland published at the end of March evoked much comment. This was followed by a period of consultation with the various interests involved and a further document &mdash; again with consultative status &mdash; was published at the beginning of October.  Much of the concern of the Nationalist community has centred on the position which would be allocated to the Irish language in the new proposals.  The latest document gives enhanced standing to the Irish language in the school curriculum and is more satisfactory than the first consultative document. I would hope that, in the final document &mdash; to be published next year &mdash; the effort to meet the widespread concern about the status of the Irish language will carry through and will result in proposals which can command general acceptance in the Nationalist community.</P>
    <P>The Irish language, and the concerns of the Nationalist community about the cultural aspects of their identity, are of course ongoing matters of discussion in the Conference and there have been some developments in these areas in Northern Ireland in the recent past. There has been progress in the use of Irish in official correspondence and in the recognition of Irish personal names in the same context.  The Northern Ireland Arts Council have provided some funding for Irish language and cultural activities.  An Irish writer-in-residence scheme to be shared between Queen's University and the new University of Ulster at Coleraine, has been set up.  The use and knowledge of Irish were the subject of a question in the continuous household survey of 1987 and will similarly figure in <Col N="810" /> the general census of 1991.  A bilingual ordnance survey map, together with an accompanying gazetteer of place names in the Irish and English versions, has been published and a research unit into Ulster place names has been set up at Queen's University.  Progress remains to be made, however, in many areas such as the use of Irish in street names.</P>
    <P>I should like to respond to the comments by Deputy Bruton on the proposals in the consultative documents, particularly in relation to integrated education. Integrated education formed part of the proposals in those documents and it is expected that the final proposals will be submitted next year after the various interests have given their opinion.  In regard to integrated education, there remains much of interest to educationalists North and South.  I have studied the earlier documents and I continue to have an interest in this matter.</P>
    <P>Before concluding I want to place on record my wishes for the success of the review process.  It is a valuable opportunity to carry forward the work of reform and political progress in Northern Ireland.  Such political progress we all acknowledge must take full account of the value and identity of the two traditions there.  We can only hope that the Unionist community will take to heart those reassurances and will have the confidence to engage in open and constructive dialogue in the very near future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder sometimes if the Unionist community are as intransigent as some people make them out to be. The difficulty lies not with the Unionist population but with their political leaders. It might be a lot easier to talk to the ordinary Unionist if that person was allowed an opportunity to express his or her views on what is happening in Northern Ireland and how the problems there might be solved.  We might find that they would be considerably more forthcoming than we are led to believe.  It is also my belief that a number of prominent Unionist politicians, when having discussions in private, often express the view that they would like to get involved in <Col N="811" /> dialogue but the fear of being branded as a traitor stops them from doing so.  The name Lundy lives on in Northern Ireland after 300 years.</P>
      <P>In my view there is a type of cat and mouse game taking place between senior Unionist figures, each one being too willing to brand the other as a Lundy if there is even an attempt at compromise on the issue of power-sharing.  That is why it is a great pity that some of the questions put at Question Time since the Dáil resumed on 19 October have not been answered in as honest a fashion as we would like.  For instance, a number of direct questions, and supplementaries, have been put to the Tánaiste, substituting for the Taoiseach, asking if any approaches had been made to Unionist politicians either formally or informally. We have not been given an answer to those questions, they have been hedged. We received some fudged replies to different questions.  It is unfortunate if we cannot have straight talk in our national Assembly.  We will not solve the problem in Northern Ireland on our own.  It has to be solved by the people of the 32 counties.  We need to be honest with one another and we should be given straight answers to our questions.</P>
      <P>I accept that there is a necessity for confidentiality in case movements are afoot for some secret or open talks. People may not wish to give the game away in case such talks would be disrupted, but I am not convinced that is the case.  The Government should have made approaches long ago to Unionist politicians in an effort to get dialogue going. I made an attempt two months ago to get a debate going on the question of a power-sharing assembly in Northern Ireland.  The political leaders on the Unionist side in Northern Ireland, whether they are members of the DUP or the OUP, are scared stiff of being branded as traitors or Lundies.  However, somebody else must take their place if they opt out, if they do not accept their responsibilities, if they do not lead their people as elected leaders should.  Somebody must fill that vacuum.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="812" /> In September, I appealed to the leaders of the three Protestant churches in Northern Ireland, the Church of Ireland, the Presbyterian Church and the Methodist Church, to endeavour to get Unionists to sit down and talk with the other constitutional parties on the island.  It need not necessarily be in the island, it could be just the other constitutional parties in Northern Ireland.  I am thinking primarily of the SDLP and the Alliance parties, we might possibly also include The Workers' Party and the Labour Party but I understand that they are very small in numbers and influence there.  Nevertheless, everybody who is in favour of a constitutional settlement should be included &mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>And Fine Gael, too.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but they do not count as an entity there.  Every group should be consulted.  I am making the point that the Church leaders are the next most important group of people where public perception is concerned in Northern Ireland.  The problem there, for all practical purposes, is perceived by the rest of the world as a religious conflict.  It is not just the Unionists and the Nationalists, it is the Protestants and the Catholics but we know that that is not the case.  The religious aspect has gone out of it for a long number of years but the fact remains that the influence of the churches is still very strong and is second only to the influence of the politicians who have reneged on their responsibilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wrote to the Leaders of the three Protestant Churches, to Dr. Eames, the Church of Ireland Archbishop of Armagh, to the Right Rev. Dr. Godfrey Brown, the Presbyterian Moderator and to Mr. Stanley Whittington whom I believe is the President of the Methodist Church although a change has taken place in the meantime and, I think, Mr. Eyre is now President of the Methodist Church.  In restating that case and in asking them to get together I would add to it, the Leader of the Catholic Church, Cardinal Ó Fiaich.  When some of these people wrote back to me they asked why <Col N="813" /> all the churches had not been involved. The point is that it is not the minority groups that are causing the impasse but rather the Unionists and their representatives in the Protestant Churches. That was the reason I wrote only to those three.  I have no doubt that Cardinal Ó Fiaich and people like Dr. Edward Daly and Dr. Cathal Daly would be only too glad to get involved in dialogue which might lead to the setting up of an assembly which would be powersharing in all its aspects.  I make that plea again and I would go further and say that it is time a forum was set up within Northern Ireland where everybody and anybody who had a view to put as to the formation of a powersharing assembly could be listened to and where even people who had a view that there should not be a power sharing assembly could be listened to.</P>
    <P>As I said initially, there are strands within the Unionist community, and those strands are considerable, who want to see an end to the bloodshed and who are willing to share power with the Nationalist minority.  I believe there is a considerable interest among the Unionists to have that take place.  Why not give them some vehicle to express their willingness to take part in such an assembly? I would go so far as to say that Unionist politicians &mdash; perhaps not Unionist leaders, they might only be councillors &mdash; would only be too willing to come in and express their views.  Some of those views would probably be favourable towards the formation of a powersharing assembly, some would not.  Some people would be afraid of being shot or assaulted or of being ostracised from within their own community.</P>
    <P>Let the Unionist politicians take to heart the very clear message that every time there is a murder in Northern Ireland, every time there is an atrocity by the IRA &mdash; even for that matter an atrocity by the UDA or any paramilitary group &mdash; they should ask themselves if they share any part of the blame.  Of course they do, so long as they refuse to talk.  The surest way of undermining the IRA or any paramilitary group is to have <Col N="814" /> a powersharing assembly where the public can be represented and have their views represented.  So long as the people of Northern Ireland are denied such an assembly there will be violence.  Let these people understand clearly &mdash; I think they do understand but they refuse to recognise it publicly, and that is what is so awful &mdash; that there is no military solution to the Northern problem.  It is no good blaming the security forces when there is an atrocity in Northern Ireland.  It is no good blaming the British Army, the RUC or the security forces in the 26 counties and it is no good blaming lack of security on the Border, the basic reason lies with the Unionist politicians who refuse to accept powersharing.  Until that is recognised and until something is done to see that talking takes place the bloodshed will continue.  There is not a military solution.</P>
    <P>When looking at the review of the Anglo-Irish Agreement let us consider the setting up of a forum where ordinary people, civic leaders and Church leaders can come in and express their views as to what should happen, and shame the Unionists, who have abdicated their responsibility, into talking.  It must be done and it should be done sooner rather than later.</P>
    <P>I will quote very briefly from a letter I received from Dr. Godfrey Brown, the Moderator of the Presbyterian Church in Ireland.  I think it is informative and helpful.  In his letter he said it must be clearly recognised that failure to do so &mdash; by that he means failure to get involved in dialogue &mdash; has by no means been confined to the Unionist parties who for their part have found a great reluctance on the part of the SDLP politicians, in spite of their public protestations of an open door, to engage in discussion.  I find that extraordinarily difficult to believe because I had assumed that the SDLP were at all times willing to enter into discussions.  I would be amazed if anything to the contrary were true.  It is very important that people get together so that they can iron out these misunderstandings. I am quite sure it is a misunderstanding.  Dr. Brown is an outstanding man and he is an exceptionally <Col N="815" /> moderate individual and a very good leader of his flock.</P>
    <P>If there are misunderstandings they are largely due to the fact that people are not sitting down and talking.  I am asking civic leaders, religious leaders and representatives of the constitutional parties in Northern Ireland to get together and start talking and embarrass the Unionist leaders, who have shown nothing but moral and political cowardice to date, into going into an assembly and sharing power with the minority.  That is the only way there will be a solution to the problems. It is the only way in which one can undermine the IRA, the INLA, the UDA, whoever.  It must be done.  These people must be castigated for their failure to show a little bit of courage.</P>

We are entitled to an answer.  If he has not &mdash; and I suspect he has not &mdash; then I implore him to do so as quickly as possible.</P>

      <P>Today's debate takes place just after the third anniversary of the signing of the Anglo-Irish Agreement.  This Agreement is the culmination of a process which began at the meeting between the leaders of the British and Irish Governments in December 1980.  The aim of both Governments was to establish a framework for the future conduct of Anglo-Irish relations and, to quote the words of the Preamble to the Agreement:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recognising and respecting the identities of the two communities in <Col N="816" /> Northern Ireland, and the right of each to pursue its aspirations by peaceful and constitutional means;</P>
    <P>The campaign of violence in Northern Ireland which, in the words of the New Ireland Forum, has affected almost every family in terms of death, injury and intimidation has also led to harmful economic consequences.  There is a need, in the interests of all the people of this island, to deal with violence by means of an adequate security policy.</P>
    <P>The response to violence must take place in an environment in which fundamental human aspirations can find expression and in which basic human freedoms can be exercised.  That is the context within which we must operate. To forget it is to treat the symptoms rather than the disease.  It is to run the risk of Government action being perceived as dismissive of the concerns of the broad mass of the people who wish to live in freedom and peace, who wish to live with justice, in accordance with the rule of international law, and to pursue economic and social advancement as of right.</P>
    <P>Alienation and deprivation can be fertile ground for exploitation by the men of violence.  The challenge is to achieve a balanced implementation of the Anglo-Irish Agreement so that violence can be dealt with while, at the same time, the political, social and economic aspirations of the people can find a fruitful means of expression.  We must never let the men of violence feel that they can set the agenda for the elected representatives of the people.</P>
    <P>I have said that it is obvious that there is a campaign of violence in Northern Ireland.  It is equally obvious that there is alienation and economic and social deprivation suffered in disproportionate measure by the Nationalist community. It is nauseating to law-abiding people to hear the perpetrators of violent acts, or their supporters, deliver lectures on economic and social deprivation.  This nausea must not blind us to the fact that political alienation and economic and social deprivation do exist.  We must be as diligent in the fight against alienation and economic <Col N="817" /> and social deprivation as we are in the fight against terrorism.  We care about people's basic rights.  We will not leave a residue of discontent to be exploited by those who espouse violence.</P>
    <P>One of the main causes of Nationalist alienation is a belief that it is difficult, to say the least, to achieve remedial action in respect of their legitimate grievances. The Anglo-Irish Agreement must be seen as a vehicle to respond to these concerns. It can only do so if its work results in practical action on such questions as freedom, peace, justice and equal opportunities for economic and social advancement.</P>
    <P>The challenge facing the people of Ireland and Britain, as the Anglo-Irish Agreement completes its third year and as we enter the process of review, is to redouble our efforts to seek, in a practical and tangible way, a political response to the problems of Northern Ireland.  The Agreement provides a framework within which the ingredients for such a response can be found.</P>
    <P>Both Governments will, during the review process, examine what has been achieved under the Agreement and seek to build on it for the future.  Both Governments remain committed to the Agreement and to the framework set out therein for intergovernmental relations. We remain committed to it because we see it as the best framework for the conduct of Anglo-Irish relations and because we see it as having proved itself as a forum for intergovernmental relations. In itself, that is a major achievement.  The achievements of the Agreement have so far failed to fulfil the hopes and expectations of many members of the Nationalist community.  However, it is important that we give full weight to the positive developments that have taken place: improved policing of the marching season, an end to supergrass trials, a new code of conduct for the RUC, the beginnings of an economic programme for West Belfast, the preparation of new and, we hope, effective fair employment <Col N="818" /> legislation &mdash; all these deserve recognition as developments that are beneficial, or partially beneficial, to the Nationalist community.</P>
    <P>There is a sense that the Agreement marks a commitment by both Governments to find a means of giving priority to the problems of the people of Northern Ireland.  The Agreement and its potential for achieving progress are now facts of political life.  That potential, or promise, represents a challenge to both Governments. We must now review the workings of the Conference with a view to meeting that challenge by delivering on the potential of the Agreement.</P>
    <P>There are, of course, links on social security.  My area of social welfare provides a good opportunity for ongoing contact between the Northern Ireland authorities and ourselves.  Earlier this year, I travelled to Belfast to meet Mr. Richard Needham, Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State with responsibility for Health and Social Security matters in Northern Ireland.  We had a wide-ranging discussion on recent developments in the field of social security of common concern, including statutory sick pay, the extension of social insurance to the self-employed, the provision of social security pensions and schemes to assist the long-term unemployed to obtain employment.  We also discussed measures to combat fraud and abuses of our social security systems.</P>
    <P>Of particular interest to both of us was how rates of benefit and conditions of entitlement compare as between the Republic and Northern Ireland.  The comparison reveals that both systems are broadly similar in structure and scope of coverage.  However, when it comes to the rates of benefit, the payments here, even after allowing for the punt/sterling difference, are in many cases higher than those in Northern Ireland and Great Britain.  This is a measure of the progress we have made here in recent years, particularly since 1980, and of the commitment of the State to those in need.</P>
    <P>For example, the personal rate of payment for an old age pensioner is some 17 per cent higher here than in Northern <Col N="819" /> Ireland.  The following table sets out a <Col N="820" /> comparison of some of the main social insurance payments:</P>

    <P>Notes</P>
    <P>1.  No increases are payable for child dependants in receipt of unemployment benefit or disability benefit in the case of British claimants.</P>
    <P>2.  Social welfare recipients in Northern Ireland may be entitled to family credits.</P>
    <P>In addition, our pensioners, aged over 66, are entitled to free travel and, under certain conditions, to free fuel, free electricity and free telephone rental.  The Northern Ireland authorities were very impressed with the range of additional schemes we provide for the elderly and other social welfare beneficiaries.</P>
    <P>In addition, pensioners and the long term unemployed here receive a Christmas bonus of 65 per cent of their weekly social welfare income.  In comparison a bonus is payable only to pensioners in Northern Ireland and Great Britain.  Even then the bonus only amounts to £10 for the pensioner.  By way of contrast, a contributory pensioner here with a dependent spouse will receive a bonus of IR£66.50.  An unemployed person on long term unemployment assistance with a wife and three children will receive a bonus of £64.20 as against no bonus in the North.</P>
    <P>People often do not realise that our social welfare system compares very favourably with other developed countries, including our nearest neighbour. Social welfare recipients on benefits generally receive higher payments while we have some catching up to do on their child support levels.</P>
    <P>Contact and co-operation at local officer level, between officers of my Department and their counterparts in the <Col N="821" /> DHSS, continue in relation to individual cases and is working satisfactorily.  In addition, head office officials from both sides meet from time to time for discussions and to agree on a common approach to the administration of the EC Social Security Regulations.</P>
    <P>A feature of both appeals systems is their actual and acknowledged independence from the central paying Departments.  While the Northern Ireland system is of a more formalised independent nature worthy of further consideration, the accessibility and informality of our system of appeals must not be under-estimated.  It is important to strike the correct balance between formal independence and accessibility and flexibility.  These are all issues which I will be particularly conscious of in the current review of the appeals system as promised in the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i></P>
    <P>While there are may differences between the systems operating here and in the North there is a common approach in that the principal aim is to ensure that the scarce resources available are directed to those most in need.  Deputies will be aware that in the last budget we provided extra increases for those on the lowest rates of social welfare.  In considering possible strategies for the next budget I am looking at opportunities to address some of the issues raised by the recent research on poverty carried out by the Economic and Social Research Institute.  The social security system in the UK has been undergoing major change in recent times and their supplementary benefit scheme has been replaced by a new scheme of income support. In addition, they have replaced their family income supplement with a family credit scheme.  Again, the stated aim is to ensure that the resources are targeted to those in greatest need.</P>
    <P>Another area where I had the pleasure to see at first hand the practical demonstration of cross-Border co-operation was the recent launch of a north coast tourism project undertaken by the Inishowen Community Development <Col N="822" /> Group and the Glens of Antrim Community Development Association.  I was happy to be able to assist the Inishowen Community Development Group with funding through the Combat Poverty Agency.  This joint venture is a concrete example of the benefits which can flow from co-operation between communities and serves to highlight the mutual benefits of that co-operation for communities on both sides of the Border.  Such cross-border co-operation can only serve to further the cause of peace and reconciliation on this island.</P>
    <P>The Irish and British Governments have committed themselves to a thorough and serious review of the Anglo-Irish Agreement.  The results of such a review will need to be seen in practical terms in a relatively short timescale. If the review fails to do this, we run the risk of damaging the credibility of the Agreement.</P>
    <P>Failure to renew our efforts to achieve tangible progress also runs the risk of conveying the impression to the men of violence that they have a veto on political progress in Northern Ireland.  We, as constitutional Nationalists, are dedicated to ensuring that no such impression can be gained.  We know that the achievement of a political and constitutional order, in which all may give legitimate expression to their aspirations and seek economic and social wellbeing, is no easy task.  It begins with a general framework of commitment to issues such as peace, justice, stability and order, which the overwhelming majority of people accept as basic values.  Credibility in pursuit of these basic values can only be sustained by a practical response to the everyday concerns of all the people.  In the case of Northern Ireland, the general framework is there in the form of the Anglo-Irish Agreement.  Indeed, it includes a specific and practical agenda across the range of political activity.  The feeling among Nationalists is that action on foot of that specific agenda has been too slow.  We must now move more quickly, especially in the areas I mentioned earlier, namely, recognition and respect for the identity of the Nationalist community, fair <Col N="823" /> employment, economic and social issues, justice including the introduction of three judge courts, and relations with the security forces.</P>
    <P>Nationalist impatience must be seen in the context of the message which the Agreement conveyed three years ago that a serious attempt was being made to address their grievances.  The two Governments agreed on a framework for progress backed up by a specific agenda. If Nationalists perceive a reluctance to recognise their identity in a tangible way, it will adversely affect the optimism and confidence necessary for political progress. Implementation of the specific agenda of the Agreement is seen as an indication of the will to make political progress.  It is a vital preliminary to creating favourable conditions for political movement.  Any perceived reluctance to implement the specific agenda of the Agreement risks losing the hope and confidence engendered by the Agreement. We must not risk losing the sense of hope and confidence that exists in the Nationalist community and which is as vital to the creation of a favourable political climate as it is to the creation of a favourable economic climate.</P>
    <P>The conditions for progress have been identified.  We now need to make a renewed effort to proceed with the specific agenda of the Agreement to provide the necessary impetus for political movement. That will be the main task of the review now beginning.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>During the course of my contribution I would like to dwell on the economic problems of this island.  I sincerely believe that all of us have failed to give due consideration to the economic problems caused by the continuing turbulence in Northern Ireland.  If we reflect on the alienation which is felt by communities living in certain suburbs in central and west Dublin, to which the Minister for Labour made reference in recent times, and if we reflect on the alienation which is felt by those living in Toxteth and other working class areas in Britain and if we reflect on the tension <Col N="824" /> that exists between those communities and the police we will see that conditions are ripe in places like west Belfast for tensions to exist and for disagreements to occur with the police even if there were no religious divisions and no partition of this island.  We should give a good deal more consideration to the economic dimension and I believe that the British Government have never adequately considered this dimension of the Northern Ireland problem.  It is true that there is a very large net transfer to Northern Ireland from the British exchequer but it is also true that average income in Northern Ireland is a great deal less than that in Britain and it can be confidently asserted that the average income among the Catholic community in Northern Ireland is even smaller.</P>
      <P>We have been promised some progress in respect of fair employment but I do not think there has been enough talk about this problem, let alone enough action.  There are difficulties but as important as progress in respect of fair employment is, the creation of employment, a difficult task at any time as we in this Republic know, is even more so in Northern Ireland.  Those of us who represent constituencies with high unemployment must understand the sense of hopelessness and alienation which is felt by those who are unemployed.  If that hopelessness is a fact of life for families for one, two, three or perhaps more generations and has become ingrained, is there any way in which people so alienated and bereft of hope could ever identify with the establishment sought to be imposed on them, leaving aside any tribal loyalties or any religious divisions?  Of course not.  As a Deputy for west Dublin, which has some of the worst unemployment black spots in Europe, it is very easy for me to understand the hopelessness and alienation felt by many people in west Belfast, Strabane, Newry and other places in Northern Ireland, without there being any tribal or religious divisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been repeated several times during the past 60 years that this State alone of the 13 States of northern Europe <Col N="825" /> is in the slow lane of economic growth. Even during the sixties when we had relatively high growth by our standards we have always been in the slow lane alone. Most countries have been in the middle lane of economic growth and some have been in the fast lane of economic growth. We need to keep reminding ourselves of that fact so as to brace ourselves for the sort of economic and political change which is necessary not alone on this island as a whole but in this Republic.  Many things must be changed.  There are many factors in this Republic of our own making which have contributed to the fact that this State alone in northern Europe is in the slow lane of economic growth.</P>
    <P>However, all of the faults do not lie entirely within the Republic.  A significant contributing factor to our lonely isolation in the slow lane in northern Europe has been the division of this island.  The economic effects of partition have been devastating for this Republic, for Northern Ireland and for this island as a whole.  I want to reiterate that we in this Parliament, the Government of this Republic and the British Government must give much higher priority to the economic problems that exacerbate the divisions in Northern Ireland and which perhaps so significantly contribute to the cause of partition in this island.  This fact is much more important than has ever seemed to be recognised by any Government or political party.</P>
    <P>As I have said, job creation is a difficult task and it is particularly difficult to create new jobs in the sort of turbulence which exists in Northern Ireland.  If we are to remove some of the principal causes of alienation we have got to start creating jobs.  We have to show the Catholic Nationalist community that they are not regarded as second class citizens.  Of course, there is a reluctance to try to achieve this by sacking Protestant workers in some of the State-owned enterprises like Harland and Wolff and Shortt Brothers where discrimination against Catholics is most emphatic. Bishop Cathal Daly was reported from America as saying that this should not be <Col N="826" /> so and that we cannot attempt to create employment for Catholics by sacking Protestants.  They are very generous words spoken by Bishop Cathal Daly and they are words that need very careful consideration, as does anything that distinguished Churchman says, but it makes the task of achieving fair employment in reality very much more difficult.  If fair employment is deferred and postponed for years to come, as seems likely, notwithstanding the promised legislation, are we not leaving in place one of the worst nettles in the situation?  Are we not allowing to fester and continue the biggest factor causing alienation?  I do not think we can just sit back and accept smugly that the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and the British Government are doing everything they can about employment and fair employment.  If they even gave the same lip service to employment and fair employment which they give to security, and rightly so to security, I believe that would be greatly appreciated by those families who are in the third or fourth generations of unemployment and whose families have never known employment.</P>
    <P>Of course unemployment is a problem throughout the European Community but it is a particular problem on this island, both North and South.  There are certain things we could do about it if we could only get our act together.  Great hopes are placed in 1992 and the move towards a Single European Market for the creation of jobs throughout the Community. I hope that those hopes and portents are more than fulfilled because we on this island badly need jobs.  I do not think we should under-estimate the contribution a lot more jobs in Northern Ireland would make towards easing the tensions, stresses and divisions of that beleaguered part of our island.</P>
    <P>In the few minutes allowed to me I have purposely dwelt exclusively on the economic aspects of the Northern Ireland problem and, at that, not even in the sort of detail I should like to have done. However, that is not to say I am not concerned about other factors in Northern Ireland.  I do not criticise the British <Col N="827" /> Government for being very concerned with security nor should our Government be criticised for being very concerned with security.  Going back to the economic dimension, the fact is that the security problems &mdash; murder, extortion, kidnappings &mdash; and all the things which are happening as a result of the Northern problems not only have awful negative effects in humanitarian terms but have huge negative effects in economic terms as well.  Security is in our interests.  Security problems affect jobs in this Republic as they do in Northern Ireland and all of us should be more conscious of that fact.</P>

      <P>I wish to outline the totally unworkable nature of the Bill proposed by the Progressive Democrats.  Within 24 hours of the introduction of the Bill by their Chief Whip, their Leader, Deputy Des O'Malley, acknowledged that it is unworkable.  It is proposed that four trustees should be selected by the 125 sport and youth organisations.  Such an election would be a farce.  People involved in arts and culture, social welfare and health would be trying to determine the appropriate expenditures in areas of youth and sport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another ridiculous feature of the Bill is that it would necessitate the setting up of a bureaucracy which would have to submit a report to the Minister for Finance which would contain details of all applications received, particulars of <Col N="828" /> applications approved, rejected or deferred and the reason for the decision in each case.  The preparation of such a report would require a large bureaucracy. Thousands of applications are rolling into the Department at present.  The Bill proposes a ludicrous jail sentence and fine of up to £50,000.  Are the Progressive Democrats not aware that there already exists a mechanism whereby anybody who misappropriates public funds can be brought to justice?  What a slur this is on the many people throughout the country who work voluntarily in raising funds for sports organisations, youth clubs and other community projects in an effort to better the community.  Deputy Harney has impugned all those people by suggesting that any misappropriation should be subject to fines of up to £50,000 and prison sentences.  The Bill is clearly unworkable.</P>
    <P>I turn now to the controversy about information being given to Ministers and backbenchers of my own party about allocations made within their constituencies. There is nothing new about that practice. It has been going on since before I became a Member of this House and I make no apology for it.  I have here a list covering capital grants of approximately £4 million, with a name of a Fine Gael Deputy written after each allocation so that they would be informed first.  If I were to go to the provincial newspapers I would find the same headlines as those for which Fine Gael now blame us.</P>
    <P>Deputy Harney also alleged that Ministers' constituencies have been treated more favourably than others.  Now that the facts are being put before the House, it is evident that this is not the case. Ministers' constituencies do not fare any differently from other constituencies.</P>
    <P>This legislation was originally put forward by Fine Gael.  If the method by which they handled grants in the past is anything to go by, then they would handle the allocation of lottery funds under the grant scheme in the same way as we have done.  Time ran out on them but that did not bother some Fine Gael Deputies and Ministers who made allocations which they intended would come from lottery <Col N="829" /> funds four months before the lottery was introduced.  That was before the last election.</P>
    <P>The basic question is one of choice. The duty of Government is to govern and implicit in that is the process of making choices between competing priorities.  In the unlikely event of the Progressive Democrats ever becoming part of a future Government, will Deputy O'Malley throw himself into a frenzy of indecision because he has to make grant allocations in Limerick East?  He certainly did not do so during his previous ministries.  We could refer to facts and figures which would show that quite clearly.  Would Deputy Harney agonise because of grant allocations being made in Dublin SouthWest? Will Deputy McDowell, that intrepid mould breaker of Dublin South, spend sleepless nights adjudicating over every penny being spent in his constituency? I think not.</P>

      <P>There are clear guidelines which must be adhered to.  There are clear responsibilities placed on Ministers which they must carry out.  Today on RTE's &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; programme the Deputy Leader of the Progressive Democrats, Deputy Michael Keating, denied that he had reallocated funds which had been allocated by his predecessor and that all the new allocations went to his own constituency, with the exception of one which was allocated to the area in which he lived.  The facts about this reallocation are in the file before me, which I will show to the Progressive Democrats and Deputy Keating if they wish.  Let me reiterate that there was nothing wrong in what Deputy Keating did.  He acted in a proper way and I have no objection to it, but in the light of all that the Progressive Democrats have said during the past six months it is most interesting to see the way in which their Deputy Leader handled those allocations during his ministry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The total amount available to him during the nine or ten months when he <Col N="830" /> held my position was allocated to his own constituency, with the exception of one grant which was made to the place where he lived.  I received a call today from somebody in Dunshaughlin to tell me that the grant allocation was never actually spent.  The Progressive Democrats are a party who want to ensure that the facts do not spoil the story.  Deputy Keating mentioned on radio this morning that he had a scheme for the allocation of his moneys and that therefore it was proper, but he said that we have no scheme for the allocation of funds.  I will be happy to give to Deputy Harney details of the scheme we have, which is exactly the same scheme that was used by Deputy Keating and every other Minister in this position since 1980.  There is no difference. There has been clear accountability and my officials in the Department of Education have carried out their responsibilities.  No wrong was done by us.  I am sure the Fine Gael Members will acknowledge that there is no difference in the way the scheme was operated.  If they do not acknowledge it, there are some interesting facts in this file which I will make available to them in case they have any doubts about how they acted when in Government.</P>
    <P>Another accusation made by Deputy O'Malley and Deputy Howlin is that Deputies went around the country handing out cheques.  I categorically deny that any cheque was given by my Department to any Deputy since I became a member of this Government.  I challenge Deputy Harney, Deputy Howlin, Deputy O'Malley and Deputy Creed&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. F. Fahey Mr. F. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking about my Department and I am sure Deputy <Col N="831" /> Woods is quite capable of dealing with his.  If a Minister hands a cheque to anybody he has overall responsibility for his Department and there is nothing wrong in doing that.  No cheque was given to any Deputy or Minister in my Department in the allocation of £27 million.  I refute categorically the incorrect statements which have been made in this House in that regard.</P>
      <P>One wonders about the real motivation for this legislation.  The proposals are so ridiculous and unworkable that they were rejected by other parties before the Bill was introduced.  The Leader of the Progressive Democrats admitted this the night after his Chief Whip proposed the Bill.  This proves the Bill was not introduced with the intention of enacting its proposals into law.  This Bill, and all that has been said about it in recent months, has all the hallmarks of what motivated Deputy O'Malley and Deputy Harney to set up the Progressive Democrats in the first place &mdash; their aversion and hatred of Fianna Fáil.  If you analyse their statements and comments you will see they are underlined by a common theme of bitterness, which I regret.  Anyone who constantly talks of scandal, fraud, illegal dealings, political slush funds and gombeenism, absolutely without foundation, must be bitter.  Even though I have had to bite my lip on many occasions about those wrongful allegations in the last six months, I hold no bitterness towards the Progressive Democrats.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill and I would like to clarify a number of issues on behalf of <Col N="832" /> the Labour Party.  The Minister of State would want to be careful not to stretch language beyond the bonds of credibility, bearing in mind his last comments.</P>
      <P>It is timely that we are having this discussion on the national lottery because we could do without some of the acrimony it has led to in this House.  What is at stake is the national lottery, something that has become an important aspect of public policy and an important method of raising finance.</P>
      <P>I notice that Deputy Creed is in the House.  Much credit must go to him for the work he did behind the scenes over many years, he researched proposals and looked at the various options open to government.  Perhaps this could have been done sooner but there were many obstacles and the concept of the lottery, the idea of introducing something which had an element of gambling in it, was an obstacle in itself.  In the end, Deputy Creed brought forward his proposals and the administration of the lottery was awarded to An Post.  For my part I was very glad it was awarded to An Post, a very reputable organisation.  I believe they have handled their brief with a professionalism which is perhaps new to this country.  In that respect I believe it is timely that we should have this discussion tonight.</P>
      <P>I am concerned that the national lottery would survive what has been going on in political circles for the last 12 or 15 months.  As I said, a review is timely and necessary and whether there would be political disagreements about the disbursement of the funds or the lack of accountability, I believe that review would have to take place at this time for a number of reasons: first, the national lottery has exceeded all predictions of the amounts forecast in the original preparation of the lottery scheme; and second, the surplus moneys become public money which can be used for good or ill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is very important that we as public representatives and the Government, as the elected Government, would be seen to be accountable and that we can remove <Col N="833" /> the lottery itself, the running of the lottery and the disbursement of funds from the rancour which has prevailed in recent months.  Many comments have been made, and the accuracy of some could be questioned, but the bottom line is that something needs to be done in relation to the lottery.  Some politicians believe something has to be done in relation to the disbursement of funds and others believe there has been a misdirection arising from the fact that more moneys have become available than were originally envisaged.</P>
    <P>When the suggestion of a Private Members' Bill was brought forward some months ago, discussions took place between the Leaders of the Opposition Parties, in good faith.  I believe the 166 Members of this House are capable of taking different views and looking at different suggestions of how to spend public money, and realising that what might be a priority in Mayo on a Monday might not be a priority in Kerry, that it might well be that priorities in Dublin are different from those in rural Ireland.  At the end of the day the discussions were held in good faith to see if we could hammer out a proposal which would be acceptable to everybody.</P>
    <P>Progress was slow in getting it on to the Floor of the House, but when the Progressive Democrats indicated that they were going to move their Private Members' Bill, I did not believe it would solve the problem.  I did not believe, even if their Bill had a majority in this House tonight, that that would solve the lottery difficulties and save the lottery from the kind of rancour we have seen in recent months.</P>
    <P>As I read the position, regardless of whether the Second Stage is accepted by the Government tonight, it would be very difficult to have the Bill brought back to the House in the coming months.  To suggest that the Bill could have any influence prior to the 1989 budget would be misleading.  In that context I did not believe from the start that the Bill would achieve what its promulgators believed. At that time, the Labour Party discussed all the possibilities and two weeks ago to <Col N="834" /> the day the Labour Party Whip negotiated to have discussions with other parties on the national lottery.</P>
    <P>On 4 November I sent correspondence to each party leader in the Dáil, including the Taoiseach.  My main suggestion and it is important that this be clarified, was as follows:</P>
    <P>I am, therefore, proposing that further acrimony and party infighting on this issue should be avoided.  The most sensible way to do this would be for each party to nominate a representative to a small working group which would advise the Government on ways and means to ensure efficient and accountable administration of the lottery in future.  The Government would then be in a position to promulgate a mechanism which would have all party support, and whose underlying purpose would be to ensure that the lottery will continue to have the widest possible level of public support.</P>
    <P>I received responses from party leaders, but I have to admit that it did not appear that my suggestion was acceptable or that a motion in our name was seen to be the correct direction to take.  The Taoiseach's office contacted me last Friday to the effect that the Government had considered the proposition of my letter of 4 November and felt it was acceptable and that contact would be made by the Minister for Finance, who was delegated by the Government to deal with the matter.  That is where we are at present.</P>
    <P>It is important, as the issue will not be resolved here this evening, that I outline my views &mdash; and those of my party &mdash; on the role of the surplus funds of the lottery. As I said at the beginning, it may well be that my priorities are not those of the Government or of other parties in the House.  However, I am entitled to express those views and to have an input to the group which will be set up later on.  We should look to that group with confidence and everybody should approach it with the intention of ensuring that the lottery fulfils the purpose for which it was set up.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="835" /> The terms of the motion which I suggested originally were:</P>
    <P>Dáil Éireann, being conscious of the need to ensure that public support for the projects supported by the national lottery continues at a very high level, and being committed to the principle that funds from the lottery should be used to support projects which enhance the life of the community, and being concerned lest there be any perception in the community that national lottery funds are allocated in any partisan way, resolves as follows:</P>
    <P>1.  That proceeds from the national lottery should be used to support projects in the following areas, in the proportions specified in brackets: Youth (15%); Sport (20%); Arts/Culture (20%); Irish language (5%); Health (20%); Tourism (5%); Local Amenities (15%).  Projects in these areas must satisfy the overall criterion that they will enhance the life of the local or the national community.</P>
    <P>2.  That in so far as is practicable, funds from the national lottery should be used for new projects in these areas, and should not be used to replace existing Exchequer funding on current activities.</P>
    <P>3.  That responsibility for allocations under these headings should be vested in the appropriate Ministers, subject to the following provisions:</P>
    <P>&mdash;that overall responsibility for the national lottery should be vested in the Minister for Finance, who will submit an Annual Report on the way in which he has discharged his responsibilities to the Dáil, and that such report may be accepted or rejected by the Dáil;</P>
    <P>&mdash;that each Minister with responsibility for allocating funds should do so only with the consent of the Minister for Finance.  Day to day administration of funds should be delegated to the appropriate agencies within Departments, and to <Col N="836" /> Local Authorities where appropriate. Each Minister should publish a statement of the priorities he intends to follow in the allocation of funds, such statement to be included in the Annual Report prepared by the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>4.  That any organisation applying for national lottery funds must do so on a prescribed application form.  Such application form must contain a description of the organisation making application (including a statement of the organisation's financial status); the reasons for which funds are sought; the ways in which an allocation of funds will enhance the life of the local community; the job creation potential of the project (if any).  Organisations receiving lottery funds must, in due course, submit a report to the relevant Minister on how the funds allocated have been used.  Application forms and reports from bodies to whom funds are allocated should be available for inspection in the relevant Government Departments.</P>
    <P>5.  At any time, the Government of the day can bring forward proposals to the Dáil to review any aspect of the operations of the lottery.  Such proposals (other than proposals for legislative change) must be put to the Dáil in the form of a Motion.</P>
    <P>In outlining what I consider to be the procedures which this lottery scheme needs, they may not be all encompassing in relation to all the possibilities, they might well meet with rejection in part or in whole but they could form a basic discussion document in relation to the group which will be set up, in which I hope all parties will participate and which will report back to this House.</P>
    <P>On the communication being received from the Minister for Finance discussions were held in an open manner and in a spirit of goodwill to try to bring about a situation acceptable to this House.  In relation to the suggestion which I had made prior to the debate in this House, <Col N="837" /> the Minister for Finance replied to me in the following terms:</P>
    <P>Further to our discussions on arrangements for disbursal of the surplus revenues of the national lottery, I confirm the Government agreement to the proposal discussed by us in the terms set out below.  Following receipt of a letter dated 4th November 1988 to the Taoiseach by Mr. Dick Spring, T.D., Leader of the Labour Party the Government have agreed to a proposal that each group in the Dáil should nominate one Member to a working group to advise on the effective and accountable disbursal of the lottery surplus.  It is hoped that this advice will be available to the Government prior to the introduction of the 1989 budget.</P>
    <P>It is important that the charge of this group will be to bring about effective and accountable disbursal of the lottery surplus.  That is also important in relation to some of the remarks made in this House on the last occasion and tonight in relation to the capacity and responsibility of politicians to carry out their functions.</P>
    <P>It is a very silly argument that we are not responsible or mature enough to administer the surplus lottery funds when you consider the total amount of funding disbursed by Ministers in various Departments throughout the course of any financial year.  We would be doing a disservice to ourselves and to politicians who may succeed us in this House if we say &mdash; which has been said in effect &mdash; that we are not capable of regulating our own affairs or of administering a sum of money less than £100 million per annum and that it should be done by a High Court judge, a board of trustees or someone outside this House.</P>
    <P>By and large, there are honourable people in this House and if they are not they are put to the test on a very regular basis.  Who can comment on high judicial people or officers outside this House in terms of their credibility in relation to the disbursement of funds?  They may have pet hobbies or areas of priority which may have little or no relevance to the priorities of local authorities, working or <Col N="838" /> other groups throughout the country.  If we can approach the working group with an open mind it is the best way forward because the <i>raison d'etre</i> for this discussion is that we want a change in the system, which may very well have come about at any rate when the whole question of the lottery takes place.  The review is perhaps overdue&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I would welcome clarification before the vote at 8.30 p.m. as to whether this Bill is properly before the House.

      <P>This is an unnecessary Bill because two years ago the National Lottery Act was put in position with the agreement of the House and the Government have allocated the funds available from the lottery surplus in strict accordance with that Act.  Why are we here tonight?  Why were we here last night and two nights last week discussing an unnecessary Bill?  I will tell you why.  As a drowning man clutches at a straw, a drowning political party grasps at the national lottery in the hope of being kept publicly afloat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats as a political phenomenon are suffering the morning after optimism where all you <Col N="839" /> have is burnt patches on the ground where the bonfires were.  All you have is a bad case of ingrown rectitude.  There are no broken moulds, no banners with a strange device, no issues, no principles, no core and no direction.  Once upon a time they had outrage, and outrage is your only man.  Everybody likes a bit of outrage.  When you have a Government taking charge of a demoralised country, when you have a Government that is doing the right things with a courage never expected of a minority administration, then outrage wears a bit thin. When outrage wears thin, opportunism begins to surface &mdash; opportunism, sectoral interests, what could be called the &ldquo;Barrington's Hospital Syndrome&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>To the Progressive Democrats, the lottery is a marvellous opportunity.  They have grasped it, tied slogans to it and tried to make a national issue out of it.  They have been helped by the polls, at least by some of the polls.  If you are in the Progressive Democrats at the moment, you pay your money and you take your choice.</P>
    <P>You can believe the surveys that say you are going down the tubes, or you believe the surveys that say the general public &mdash; or a majority of the general public &mdash; would like to see the disbursement of the lottery funds in the hands of an independent agency.  The Progressive Democrats disagree with the first and agree with the second.  I agree with both.  Of course a majority of the general public would like to see an independent agency in charge.  Put that kind of question to the general public about almost anything, and that is the answer you will get.</P>
    <P>Would you like to see an independent agency in charge of buying drugs for the health service?  Would you like to see an independent agency giving out housing grants?  Would you like to see an independent agency in charge of the tax arrangements for children's shoes? Would you like to see an independent agency in charge of the position of God in the Constitution?  The marvellous mystique of the &ldquo;independent agency&rdquo; means <Col N="840" /> that people will often choose it when stopped in the street by a market researcher with a little clip-board.  But if you put the question another way, you would get a different answer.</P>
    <P>At this time, the only relevant democratic question to ask is, do you want the lottery funds disbursed according to strict rules laid down in law and agreed by the Dáil?  But were strict rules laid down in law?  Were they agreed by the Dáil? Surprise, surprise, the answer is yes to both questions.  The next question is who brought in those strict rules?  The answer is the Coalition Government, made up of the two parties opposite.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnneMarieColley" hpid="Miss Colley Miss Colley">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems that the Progressive Democrats have suddenly got very vocal for some unknown reason.</P>
      <P>Fine Gael, the House will remember, were not just part of a Coalition Government; they had a franchise on rectitude at the time and from that position, they made the rules.  As soon as those rules began to serve interests on this side of the House, Fine Gael developed second thoughts.  In fact, if the Progressive Democrats are now the party of shake-and-bake opportunism, Fine Gael are now the party of the chronic second thought.  The problem, thus far, in the contributions made by the Opposition parties is that they have all the words of public concern, but none of the reality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not believe, when we are trying to reverse massively entrenched patterns of emigration, unemployment and national debt, that the general public want to see four days of our parliamentarians' time devoted to the nuts-and-bolts of how national lottery money is spent.  If the general public were asked to make a choice between four days of hard work pulling this country into shape and four days of political posturing by those who did not have the good luck to be in power when the national lottery came on <Col N="841" /> stream, they would tell us in no uncertain terms to get on with the real task.  That is what this Government are going to do, no matter what the result of the vote on this irrelevant and trivial Bill.  We are going to continue with the real task.</P>
    <P>My job here tonight is not to argue with, defend or help the Opposition rearrange their prejudices.  My job is to stitch a few facts into the record.  First, the lottery surplus has been applied to the beneficiary areas in accordance with the 1986 Act.  This year £10 million has been provided for youth as against £3.7 million in 1987.  That includes £4 million for new or additional services for the young homeless, young substance abusers or young people generally at risk. Grants of £3.63 million have been awarded to voluntary organisations on the basis of pre-determined criteria under the youth service grant scheme.  A sum of £10 million has been provided for health services and £800,000 for the relief of suffering caused by wars and natural disasters in developing countries.</P>
    <P>The Government have stuck rigorously in the allocation of available funds to the eligible beneficiary categories and Ministers have allocated the funds available to them in a fair and reasonable way. This is in sharp contrast to the behaviour of the former Minister for the Environment, Fine Gael Deputies and councillors who used the amenity grant scheme provision for 1987 for blatant electioneering before the last general election.  They notified local groups that grant approval for particular projects would be forthcoming a month before the formal allocation notifications were issued from the Department.</P>
    <P>The disbursal of the lottery funds was done in an effective and efficient way, despite the fact that the funds were greatly in excess of what had been expected.  This is in sharp contrast to the bureaucratic maze which would result from the proposals in the Bill.  When a party like the Progressive Democrats have majored on the elimination of waste and unnecessary bureaucracy, you expect them to avoid waste and unnecessary <Col N="842" /> bureaucracy in the lottery, too, but that is not so.</P>
    <P>In place of the present straightforward and democratic arrangements under which broad assignments of lottery funds are made by the Government and decisions in relation to use on particular projects are made by Government Ministers, what they now want is a more elaborate and expensive new procedure under which these functions would be entrusted to a board with no democratic basis whatever.</P>
    <P>Once upon a time, the Progressive Democrats talked about the need to cut public expenditure and reduce the numbers of public servants &mdash; once upon a time, like a few months ago.  Right now it is time to change principles and dance. Right now we find them seeking to expand both public expenditure and the numbers of public servants.  Right now, they want to break nice cost-effective moulds and replace them with bigger, costlier and less efficient moulds.  But that is an opinion and I promised the House I would deal in facts.</P>
    <P>Let me give an inescapable fact.  If there are thousands of worthwhile applications, and £72 million to distribute, not everybody is going to get money.  My Department alone received well over 2,000 applications for lottery funding.  It was not easy for the Department to handle numbers of this order with the small staff available for the purpose, but they managed.  They managed with the knowledge that our system has safety factors built into it.  No money was going to be spent by my Department until the paperwork was in place, until the project was completed to the satisfaction of the local authority engineers and certified by them to be in order.</P>
    <P>A board set up under the terms of the Bill under discussion could not operate in that way.  There would be no alternative but to treat every application on a bureaucratic basis with all the expense, delay and trouble which that would cause, not only to the board itself but to the applicants as well.  There would be extra expense all round, extra delays, extra frustrations and, at the end of the <Col N="843" /> day, just as many disappointed applicants.</P>
    <P>The more one considers the procedures proposed, the more it becomes clear that those who drafted the Bill do not understand or appreciate how proper public accountability operates or the need to get projects going as quickly as possible.  If Christmas is coming, you do not want it postponed until a board of directors reexamines the 12 days.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I will come to that.  If good news is due you do not want it postponed while someone puts forms through some kind of bureaucratic liquidiser.  You want someone who is responsible and who is publicly accountable, and that is what this Bill would do away with.</P>
      <P>If sections 12 and 13 of this Bill were enacted responsibility for public accountability would be removed from the Minister for Finance and other members of the Government because they would be, more or less, required to obey the instructions of the board.  Let us get to the bottom line on this.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The bottom line is that Ministers with responsibility for national policy on matters connected with their Departments' functions would have no say over the spending of large amounts of public money in those areas, and the expenditure would be in the hands of unelected individuals who would not be publicly accountable for their decisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Coming back to areas of my own responsibility, my Department have been <Col N="844" /> allocated a total of £9.53 million for three expenditure areas: projects associated with the Dublin Millennium, public library services, and amenity projects.</P>
    <P>In the case of the Dublin Millennium, grants were allocated to the company specially set up to promote the Millennium &mdash; Dublin Promotions Organisation Ltd. &mdash; and they contributed to an extensive programme of events during the year.  Each programme was drawn up by the Millennium Company and approved by their board of directors and forwarded to the Department of the Environment for approval prior to any grant being allocated or paid out.  Community and youth projects were covered. Arts and cultural projects were covered. Environmental improvement projects were covered.  In all £700,000 was allocated for these events.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Grant issues to the Millennium Company were restricted to costs associated with the specific projects approved by the Department of the Environment and grants were processed on an agreed system of recoupment. Details regarding the allocation of the £700,000 grant were announced on 21 January, 1988.</P>
      <P>The Millennium has proved a very successful event nationally and internationally and it will have a continuing influence in the years to come.  Without the funds available from the lottery, there is not doubt that the various things I have mentioned simply would have taken place.  That was good news and it is continuing good news for Dublin.  It was good decision-making about where the money should go, but there is no applause from the Opposition parties about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second area of expenditure of lottery funds by my Department is the public library service.  This is a very praiseworthy and excellent expenditure area for lottery funds.  Public library branches are spread throughout the country. They are accessible to the public in every <Col N="845" /> county, and it is a public service which is used by all sections of the community, not just by people of voting age.  The funds from the national lottery were allocated to local authorities on the same conditions as those applying to other capital and current services provided by the authorities.  These conditions were accepted by various Governments and by the Comptroller and Auditors General over the years.  Again it was good news, continuing good news, for the library service. It was good decision-making about where the money should go, but again no applause from the Opposition parties, not even the sound of one hand clapping&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Like this.  But then, the Opposition have been busy.  Fair enough. They have been busy focusing on the third area of expenditure for which I had to allocate funds, the amenity project scheme, because it was in that area they figured they might make some cheap political capital.  It was good judgment, if you think about it.  When a Department allocated so much money so publicly to so many good causes, there has to be something the Opposition can fight with, something they can use to prove they have all their ducks in a row, all their oars in the water, all their outrage intact.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I will.  It is hardly necessary for me to labour the point of how difficult it was for me to make a selection in those circumstances.  I had over 2,000 <Col N="846" /> applications, practically all of which were for really worthy projects but the sum available to me allowed me to allocate only one-tenth of the grant-aid sought, so what was I to do?</P>
      <P>I decided to allocate the grants to those projects that seemed most worthy and most likely to produce really worth-while community benefits while seeking to achieve a fair balance between different areas.  In the particular situation there was no way of avoiding having to disappoint many applicants.  Another person acting on the basis of what he &mdash; or she &mdash; thought best might have selected quite a different set of projects for assistance, but he could not have avoided disappointment for a great many people any more than I could.  It would just have been a different set of people who would have been disappointed.</P>
      <P>But, you see, I am a Minister of Government and I have been given responsibility each and every day for decision-making, and the reality I live with every day of my life is that I must disappoint people &mdash; groups and individuals &mdash; who do not deserve to be disappointed. That is the reality lived with every day by every member of this Government, whether as local representatives, as individual Ministers or, collectively, as a Government.</P>
      <P>The reality is that because we are public figures, because we are identified public figures, people can make that disappointment very clear to us.  We cannot hide behind the bureaucratic collective suit of pinstriped armour which the board this Bill suggests could hide behind.</P>
      <P>There is no hiding by the Minister for the Environmment or by any other Minister. On television, on radio, at public meetings, I have answered every question put to me &mdash; I am being charitable when I say I floored them on TV, and I have never complained about the questions or even the questioners.</P>

      <P>Of course, there are people who say that the allocations which I made are unbalanced as between different <Col N="847" /> areas.  We have heard a fair bit about that.  The allocations made are not in strict proportion to the population or other equivalent criteria as between different areas.  There were crucial considerations to be taken into account other than strict demography.</P>

      <P>Those crucial considerations include the level of interest shown in different areas and the worth of the projects proposed.  It depends where you are coming from, what opportunistic glasses you are wearing when you examine the allocations.</P>
      <P>For example, 16 counties fared better &mdash; when their allocations are considered as a proportion of grant assistance sought &mdash; than did my own County Mayo.  I make this point so as to demonstrate that facile comparisons of allocations and population levels are only part of the story.</P>
      <P>In making the allocations from the national lottery funds this year, I had to look at the whole story.  I had to do what I did last year when the funding was provided from voted moneys.  I had to make a judgment between two good options &mdash; and, inevitably, in every case, I had to disappoint at least one of those good options.</P>

      <P>That is unworthy of the Deputy, knowing his track record.  I have been here 11 years and I have never yet made a personal attack on anybody in this Chamber and I am not going to start tonight.  I appreciate that criticism of the nature I had been referring to is inevitable in the particular circumstances.  I do not object to it except to the degree that it may lose sight of the fact that where resources are limited, some projects must fall by the wayside, for the time being at least.  I do, however, take exception to criticisms of this kind coming from people <Col N="848" /> who were themselves responsible for patently flawed allocations the previous year.</P>
      <P>Attention has been drawn to variations in the level of my allocation as between different areas.  These variations are fully justified, but what did I find on taking office last year?  I found that the day before he left office, the outgoing Minister had made allocations of the available funds.  Had any attempt been made to allocate funds on a fair basis?  Not a bit of it.  No less than 13 counties failed to receive any allocation at all while no less than 88 schemes in the Dublin area devoured the lions' share of the available money.  Eighty-eight schemes were assisted in Dublin while West Mayo got nothing at all.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The unfortunate thing is that there are things that nettle people. One would have expected that, with that kind of track record, people on the other side of the House, instead of criticising my allocations, would have slunk quietly away and hoped that their own grossly lopsided administration might be forgotten with the passage of time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That situation was deplorable and I had to rectify it despite the fact that my <Col N="849" /> action would be understandably unpopular with those who had been promised grants by the previous Administration and now found these grants cut or entirely withdrawn.</P>
    <P>A further point which must be emphasised is that projects being aided under the amenity grant scheme are not some airy fairy dreams of philanthropic do gooders.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  These are projects which have been well thought out by those in the various communities who have a genuine interest in the protection and enhancement of the local environment.  To suggest that these projects, or any of them, are unworthy of assistance is most unfair to these people, many of whom work long hours &mdash; long unpaid hours &mdash; in their spare time on the projects.</P>

      <P>We should be thankful that this country abounds with such good people and we should condemn out of hand any attempt to create a furore which could discourage their efforts.</P>
      <P>As far as payment of grants is concerned, strict criteria apply.  There is nothing secret or hidden about the scheme.  The conditions relating to the scheme were publicly available and included in a reply to a Parliamentary Question on 18 May 1988.</P>
      <P>The scheme itself is administered by the county councils, county borough corporations and Dún Laoghaire Corporation.</P>
      <P>The projects being grant aided are carried out under the supervision of the local authority and grant payments are made by my Department to local authorities for redistribution to the various projects. In applying for grants, the local authority is required to certify that, <i>inter alia</i>, the project, when completed, will be of public utility and will be available for public or community use as far as practicable. There will also have to be adequate arrangements for management and maintenance and for meeting running costs, if any.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Expenditure in respect of each project <Col N="850" /> must be certified to have been incurred in accordance with the conditions of the scheme before payment is made.  These are not slipshod methods of administration. They have resulted in the funding of projects which will make a substantial difference to local communities the length and breadth of this country.</P>
    <P>They have also, inevitably, resulted in disappointment.  What is interesting is that disappointed applicants have not tended to interpret their lack of success on this occasion as either a negative judgment on them or as a final dismissal. They know neither of those is true.  They have been disappointed &mdash; but the overwhelming majority of the unsuccessful applicants have been quietly dignified, and at the same time, quietly determined to succeed next time around.</P>

      <P>The only people making political capital out of the national lottery are the opposition parties, in particular the Progressive Democrats.  The sponsors of this Bill have failed to justify the reasons for the two major changes sought: establishment of a new quango; and dilution of public accountability for expenditure of public money.  The sponsors have not proved their case.</P>
      <P>In contrast the Government position is clear and unambiguous.  We have proved our case.  Government Ministers have detailed how they have scrupulously adhered to the present legislation.  The conditions for grant allocations are available for public scrutiny.  There are arrangements for normal accountability for the proper expenditure of the lottery funds.  Nobody is challenging it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill and the position adopted by the Deputies across the House has nothing to do with the proper allocation of lottery funds.  Instead, it is an unholy alliance to embarrass the Government at the expense of the national lottery.  It will not work.  The Government are unembarrassed. The Government have their eye on the ball.  The Government have a <Col N="851" /> job to do and are going to do it irrespective of how the Progressive Democrats might try to embarrass them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Now let me tell the House what is going to be achieved by the posturing of the Opposition on this non-issue. What has been achieved is that a vague negative has been attached to the projects to which funding has been given. That is unfair.  A vague negative has been attached to the lottery itself and that is unfair.  We could do without those vague negatives.  Locally and nationally, we could do without them.</P>
      <P>In the interest of all of the projects which in the future will be funded by the lottery, I would ask the parties opposite not to proceed with this Bill.  In the interests of good public administration and cost-effective management of lottery funds, I ask them not to proceed.  In the interests of enabling and empowering and enlarging community effort, sporting possibility, artistic endeavour and the options for our young people, I ask them not to proceed with a Bill so flawed, so mean, so grudging in its intent.</P>
      <P>There is a question that has been raised by Deputy Spring.  The Government have nothing to hide in the matter.  Everything has been done in accordance with agreed long-established procedure and there is total accountability to this House for all moneys disbursed under the lottery by various members of the Government.  No money has been misappropriated. Nobody has got money that they were not entitled to and no cheques have been paid to any unworthy causes or to any unworthy projects and it should not be implied or suggested inside or outside the House that anything untoward was done during the disbursement of these moneys.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, to help stop the needless waste of parliamentary time and the further pursuance of this needless and flawed Bill the Government have, following receipt of a letter dated 4 November 1988 from the leader of the Labour Party, Deputy Dick Spring to the Taoiseach, agreed to a proposal that each <Col N="852" /> group in the Dáil should nominate one member to a working group to advise on the effective and accountable disbursal of the lottery surplus.</P>

    <P>I should like to address a few remarks <Col N="853" /> to the Taoiseach.  I am glad that he is back on his feet and I wish him good health.  I should like to tell him that the Fine Gael party do not need any lectures from him, or from Deputy MacSharry, about our responsibilities.  The Fine Gael party, despite the snide remarks of the Labour Party in the last 18 months, have acted responsibly on every financial issue that had to be dealt with.  However, when it comes to the abuse of public funds the Fine Gael party will not bow to threats from the Taoiseach, or anybody else, about elections.  That message should be delivered loud and clear to the Taoiseach. When it comes to rigging constituencies or abusing public funds we will not be bought off by Micky Mouse advisory committees.</P>
    <P>Two weeks ago in our efforts to get all Opposition parties to combine to say stop to Fianna Fáil we tabled a comprehensive motion on this issue.  We wanted to say to Fianna Fáil, &ldquo;stop these abuses; this is not Fianna Fáil money; the party did not collect it and did not have anything to do with the establishing of the national lottery.&rdquo;  We wanted to say to the Government that the only thing they did was to send the Taoiseach to release baloons to launch the national lottery. We have been told how great Fianna Fáil are and heard of the big sums of money they are giving out here, there and everywhere. It is not their money; it was collected from the workers of the country who buy lottery tickets weekly and none of us has a right to say where it should go.  The Minister for the Environment alleged that his predecessor, Deputy Boland, abused the lottery funds.  I challenge the Minister to tell me of one penny of lottery funds that was wrongly distributed by Deputy Boland.  He should remember that the funds concerned were not from the national lottery but from the budget.  The debate is about national lottery funds.</P>

Fine Gael will act responsibly to get the country back on a proper footing and if we have to march into the division bodies behind the Minister for Finance for the good of the country we will do so and we will not apologise to anybody, as we have done on occasions.  Had the Minister for the Environment, and his colleagues, adopted a similar attitude for even half of the time we were in Government 35,000 people would not have had to emigrate last year and we would not have 250,000 on the unemployment register.  We would be well on the road to recovery but, unfortunately, they objected to every measure we took to put the country's finances right.  They abused democracy and went to the highways and byways to tell the Irish people that the monetarists were abusing the public finances.</P>

Last night, for the first time in my seven years as a Member I was ashamed to be a Member when I heard Ministers castigating Deputies about grants that had been given.  What must the public think of us?  It was amusing to hear Fianna Fáil say that they never did anything wrong.  If that is the case why is it that they are playing footsie with the Labour Party and setting up an advisory committee? That is being done because the Government are afraid of a defeat in the House.

All that is necessary is for the Government to stop their messing and establish independent bodies to distribute the funds.</P>

      <P>The Deputy should look after the rain falling in Sligo.  I am not one of those people who contend that politicians should not make decisions.  It is the responsibility of the Government to decide where lottery funds should be spent.  If the Minister for Finance decides that 20 per cent should go to the health services, 15 or 25 per cent should go to sport and recreation, and the Cabinet agree, that is fine by me although I may disagree.  However, from that point on Ministers or TDs' should not parade around the country trying to fool the public that they are giving out the money. The money comes from the national lottery and not from taxes.</P>
      <P>The comprehensive proposals put forward by Fine Gael relate to the distribution of funds.  We are not denying that the Government, who are answerable to the public, have the responsibility of making the decisions.  We want, for example, a sport and recreation council, established on a statutory basis, to produce long term plans for proper sporting facilities for our young people.  They should be given lottery funds to be allocated in accordance with a prepared plan. It is a pity that the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, is not present because I should like to remind him that since May I have been writing to him seeking assistance for a small football club in Ballybrack, an area that is mainly made up of local authority houses.  The club field 17 youth teams.  Between May and October I sent at least five reminders to the Minister of State and my secretary phoned his office on many occasions.  In October I received a phone call to say that the Minister of State had not received an application. I was seeking a grant of £5,000 to tarmacadam a small piece of land around a sports hall.</P>

      <P>We have three Deputies in our constituency from the Fianna Fáil party, Deputies Lynch, Hilliard and Dempsey, three Senators and an MEP. Recently, my colleague called them the silent seven and the more I think about it the more I believe they are the silent seven because they have allowed this to continue that only £2 per head of population was granted to our particular constituency over the last number of months.</P>

      <P>I have not been silent.  It is of interest that we are 27th in the list and we are collecting about £50,000 a week from lottery tickets in County Meath.  It was a lot higher.  Evidence was given here last night by Deputy Creed that the overall amount of money being <Col N="859" /> collected on a weekly basis in every county in Ireland is dropping drastically. I ask the Members of this House why it is dropping drastically.  It is dropping drastically because the people out there are not happy that the money is being allocated fairly and squarely.  It is being and has been allocated to the Minister for Finance's constituency at the rate of £27 per head of population, to the Minister for Education's constituency at the rate of £10 per head of population, and we could not get the figures for the Minister for the Environment.  I do not believe they want to give out the proper figures. The rate of allocation in the Dublin area is £18 per head of population and the Carlow/Kilkenny constituency got £1 per head of population.  It is incredible that the people out there want and demand change in this area.  I call on Deputy Lynch &mdash; who has joined us &mdash; Deputy Dempsey and Deputy Hilliard to come in here tonight and vote with the Opposition parties against the unfair allocation of funds by these Ministers over the last six months.  I am asking Deputy Lynch to put his money where his mouth is tonight and come to the Opposition benches and vote with us against what has been happening regarding these allocations.</P>
      <P>I might add that the Minister of State at the Department of Education, Deputy Fahey, informed us last evening of the allocations in the constituency and again we came out No. 19 on the list in the constituency.  We got £100,000.  I thank him for all the allocations that were made by all the Ministers.  Let us be fair about it, give what is due to every county and constituency in the country and there will be no need for debates here.  Because it is unfair is the reason 75 per cent of the people are seeking change in this area. All we are asking is that the Minister be fair in the allocation of lottery funds.  Out of the amount of money that is collected in our constituency only £2 per head of population goes back into it.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Harney for giving me a few minutes.  I will be very brief in my remarks.  I would like to express the opinion that I support the Bill as proposed by the Progressive Democrats.  I have been speaking with the Progressive Democrats about the particular legislation which they propose and I was hoping to speak for about five minutes.  As a result of a decision made by the Labour Party, for some unknown reason, they have accepted a combination of letters from the Minister for Finance.  In a very short time he will be the ex-Minister for Finance.  I would like to take this opportunity of saying &ldquo;Ray MacSharry, congratulations on your appointment as EC Commissioner&rdquo;.  In view of the comments made by the Labour Party about the distribution of national lottery funds it was a very lame excuse to accept this as some type of promise from the Government.  It reminds me of a little argument about the Health Estimates last year when our own party &mdash; or the party I belonged to at the time, Fine Gael &mdash; reneged at the last second and Deputy Dukes, the leader of the party, came back with a little piece of paper in his hand but we never heard anything about the committee since.  I presume the same will apply in relation to this matter.  There is no doubt that the distribution of the lottery funds has been a scandal.  We see people like Deputy MacSharry, and say, Deputy O'Kennedy spending an entire weekend in a constituency giving a few pounds here and a few pounds there when there are so many people&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;who are entitled to it not because of political affiliations but by right.  In the late seventies or early eighties Cuspóir first thought of a national lottery and then everybody jumped on the bandwagon.  I would like to pay tribute to the politician, Deputy <Col N="861" /> Creed, who took up that at the time. Nobody ever envisaged that £70 million would come into the national lottery. People in general would accept a few pounds of a slush fund for Ministers or Ministers of State who were not able to perform in the particular portfolio to which they had been appointed and then they could do something else with it but suddenly when the public discovered that there were funds of £70 million, it became a different matter.  I am aware that somebody approached Deputy Flynn in relation to a project in the Castlebar area and he said: &ldquo;Sure, I will organise it and I will get the funds for you and all the rest of it&rdquo; without having the slightest idea as to what he was talking about. Indeed, the Minister of State was very caustic in his remarks here last night&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This evening's debate marks the end of <Col N="862" /> a fortnight in which the attention of the nation has been drawn to the abuse of ministerial power in relation to the application of national lottery funds.  During that debate the Progressive Democrats consistently have championed the principle of independent control over the allocation of this huge national resource. Throughout the debate the Government have attempted to deflect public criticism from their method of application on the grounds that many of the recipients are worthy causes.  That is not and never has been the issue.</P>
    <P>Events have completely vindicated our position.  By showing determination, especially in the face of the sabre-rattling by the Taoiseach and Government Ministers, this party have ensured that the democratic wish of the people to have fair and independent control over the allocation of national lottery funds cannot be thwarted by a Government bent on low standards in the practice of politics.

      <P>While the official Government line in this House has been to deny that there is anything wrong in the allocation of national lottery funds, <Col N="863" /> privately, senior Government Ministers have admitted that there has been abuse and that this abuse has been damaging to the national lottery itself, to the ends for which it was established and to those who were seen to manipulate it.  I might add that it is no coincidence that the Ministers for Justice, Defence and Agriculture have not come to this House and spoken about the manner in which they sought to abuse national lottery funds in their constituencies.</P>
      <P>Now, at the eleventh hour, the Government have decided to buy off criticism by a face-saving device of promising all-party consultation with a view to improving the national lottery.  Unfortunately, the committee cannot bring about legislative change or force upon the Government a standard of behaviour, or a system of allocations which is acceptable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The commitment given to the Labour Party by the outgoing Minister for Finance &mdash; and I should like to congratulate him on his appointment today as our new Commissioner to the EC and wish him well during his term of office &mdash; is vague and insubstantial.  It was designed to create the illusion of concession where none really existed and where none can be presumed.  This concession was won solely because the Progressive Democrats pressed this issue home to the point at which the Government faced defeat this evening.  As all the media have pointed out, it was quite absurd to suggest that to force change on this issue could destabilise the economic consensus or undermine the credibility of this Government. The only injury this Government could sustain on this issue would be a self-inflicted wound arising out of their unwillingness to face facts, to accept the public's judgment and to conform to reasonable standards of political behaviour. They thought they could bluff or threaten the Dáil into passive aceptance of their right to turn a national institution like the national lottery and State resources of that kind into a system of overt and undisguised patronage.  The election threat was idle and dishonest <Col N="864" /> and, when it failed, a different attitude emerged.  To use a phrase employed by Government handlers in 1987, it was a question of who would blink first. Because the Progressive Democrats, Fine Gael, The Workers' Party and Independents held steadfast on this issue, refusing to be intimidated or bluffed, the Government have decided to blink or, more correctly, to wink or nod at the Labour Party by agreeing to a face-saving formula.</P>
    <P>We welcome any concession.  We doubt the value of the deal the Government have entered into with the Labour Party.  In this matter it is noteworthy that the commitment of the Government is to permit each group in the Dáil to have one Member only represented on that committee.  That excludes The Workers' Party.  They will not be the only group let down by this decision this evening.  The public, who overwhelmingly support the principle of independent control of national lottery fund allocations, have been short-changed as well.  The suggestion implied in the Government's commitment to the Labour Party, that next year's budget may be the occasion of reform, is questionable.  The abuse of the national lottery cannot be cured in the context of a budget.</P>
    <P>Had the Government been willing to commit themselves to genuinely investigating independent control of the national lottery, of course, this party would have been happy to withdraw our Bill but, because they are unwilling to do so, we are pressing our Bill to a vote.</P>
    <P>The suggestion that an all-party system of overseeing national lottery funds is preferable to a single party system ignores one fundamental fact &mdash; to us &mdash; all party patronage is just as wrong as is single party patronage.  The national lottery is a public institution, not a collection of political spoils to be handed out by one, two or three parties.</P>
    <P>This evening the people can judge for themselves which parties in this House stand on principle and the need for fundamental legislative change in the case of such grave national scandals.  I will not have been the only person to have <Col N="865" /> referred to such scandals.  Several independent commenators, media writers, and people on television programmes have all been unanimous in contending that this Government have sought to abuse the national lottery.</P>
    <P>During the course of his contribution this evening the Minister for the Environment quite appropriately referred to Christmas.  For this Government and many of their members, behaving as they do, like Santa Clauses around their constituencies, it was a most appropriate term.  He referred also to the appointment of independent agencies and wondered whether they should be put in charge of various other funds.  An independent agency could well take charge of the Minister for the Environment. Indeed is it not the Bunny Carr school of government we have seen in operation here for quite some time?  The Minister for the Environment went on to justify the manner in which he has allocated moneys.  I have not doubt that it is not coincidence that the Minister for the Environment comes from County Mayo and that that county received the largest single allocation from the moneys available in his Department &mdash; over £400,000 in comparison with £43,000 for County Louth and £47,000 for County Kilkenny.</P>

      <P>Last evening the Minister of State at the Department of Education, Deputy Frank Fahey, criticised me for wishing to dilute some of the funds away from sport and recreation and put them to other uses.  I make no apology for saying that.  At a time when one-third of our population lives in poverty, when sick children cannot be treated in Crumlin Hospital, other priorities for national lottery moneys and all public moneys should be found.  I make no apology for saying, yes, less money should go to sport and more to health.  I make no apology for saying that our emigrants, too &mdash; the people being forced to leave this country because of the actions of successive Governments &mdash; should get assistance from the national lottery.  Indeed only <Col N="866" /> today I received a letter from the action group for Irish youth, a group based in London, from which I might quote two sentences.  They refer to an interview given last weekend in the <i>London Irish News</i> by the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, when he said that none of the money from the national lottery would be used to aid Irish welfare organisations in Britain.  They say that, while their application was acknowledged, they have received no further correspondence from the Department of Education since then. The group went on to say: do you think it is correct for a Government Minister to disclose the results of funding applications to the press before notifying the applicants themselves of the decision?  I want to say to the action group for Irish youth that they need not be surprised; that has been the way this Government have behaved in relation to this matter.</P>

      <P>I am indeed honoured and delighted to have the opportunity of contributing to probably one of the most important debates to come before this House for many years.  As one who represents a Border constituency like Louth, I am, as it were, as close to the coalface as any in this State can be.  Not only has my area suffered because of the artificial imposition of the Border in that farms and households have been literally cut off from each other but also because my hometown, Dundalk, probably had the largest influx of refugees into this State from the North during the 1970 troubles. Because of this it is particularly vital to the people I represent that any effort to stabilise the situation on this island should be supported.  It is in that context that we are now discussing the Anglo-Irish Agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a member of Fianna Fáil, I am committed to the establishment of a united Ireland by peaceful and constitutional means.  I am convinced that there will only ever be peace and stability on this island when we have such a situation. Not only do I see that unity as a physical unity but also a unity of minds and purpose.  However, this unity cannot be imposed on an unwilling section of the population.  The fears of that tradition must be allayed and it is only by dialogue that that can be achieved.  The bomb and the bullet have only caused to hinder any chance of fellow Irishmen coming together.  Thankfully, the position is by <Col N="871" /> no means irretrievable.  That is why constitutional politicians must renew their efforts to continue the progress made in recent years.</P>
    <P>The Anglo-Irish process as we know it, originated from the Anglo-Irish summit in December 1980 between the Taoiseach, Deputy Haughey, and Mrs. Thatcher. It progressed through the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Council founded in 1981, the New Ireland Forum in 1984, and ultimately the Anglo-Irish Agreement in 1985.  It may very well be that the different Governments then &mdash; and indeed now &mdash; had different expectations arising from that Agreement.  Perhaps one party saw it as a means to an end and the other party saw it as the end in itself.</P>
    <P>The language used in the Agreement is vague, perhaps purposely vague.  I do not think it would stand up to a detailed examination by the highest court in the land, as to what was in the minds of the parties thereto.  However, it is this very vagueness which has been one of the best attributes of the Agreement, in that it has allowed both sides scope to manoeuvre.</P>
    <P>In my opinion, there is nothing more vague than the declaration in Article 1 (c) of the Agreement, which states:</P>
    <P>If in the future a majority of the people in Northern Ireland wish for and formally consent to the establishment of a United Ireland, they (the two Governments) will introduce and support, in their respective parliaments, legislation to give effect to that wish.</P>
    <P>Under this, a day could arrive when the Nationalist people in the North become the numerical majority, i.e. 50 per cent plus one.  What would happen then to the Unionist people who, at that stage, would not only be a minority on the island, but also a minority in the Six Counties?  Would that be the end of our troubles?  I think not.  It might only allow the transfer of dominance from one community to another.  This is not what I see <Col N="872" /> as leading to a peaceful future on this island.  It is for this reason that the Unionists should see that the only way forward is through dialogue with all parties on these islands.</P>
    <P>Another area which has engendered much debate is the present review.  Article 12 allows for the review of &ldquo;the working of the Conference&rdquo; in order to see if any changes in the scope and nature of its activities are desireable&rdquo;.  This was, in my opinion, specifically restricted to the Conference only, in order to ensure that there be no dilution of the terms and aims of the Agreement.</P>
    <P>Recently I had the opportunity of meeting a number of officials from the US who had direct responsibility for the administration, at their end, of the Anglo-Irish Fund, which was set up as a result of the Anglo-Irish Agreement. When asked by them if the agreement had made any difference, I informed them that a large portion of my constituents would say that all that it has done is to allow the British Army to put a &ldquo;ring of steel&rdquo; around the area close to the Border; that it has made life a lot more difficult and dangerous for the people who live close to the Border.  The springing up of permanent check points all along the Border has been a source of contention with the locals.</P>
    <P>If asked, most people in the Republic would find it difficult to point to the benefits of the Agreement.  They might justifiably say that it has made little or no difference.  Similarly, in the North, the Nationalist people may even say it has made matters worse.  However, if you were then to ask these people should it be scrapped, I have no doubt that the majority would be against that.  Why? The reason is simple.  Because it is generally perceived that the Agreement is an indication that, at long last, the British Government are not going to stand down under pressure from the &ldquo;No Surrender&rdquo; cries.  Too often in the past they have bent under pressure and I am happy to say there is no sign of that now.</P>
    <P>As I have already stated in a previous debate on Anglo-Irish relations, I have <Col N="873" /> had occasion to contact the Secretariat on numerous occasions in order to gain information or movement on individual cases of people who live on the northern side of the Border.  I have found the Secretariat mechanisms to be very beneficial and expeditious and indeed, most people involved have been mildly surprised with the responses and results obtained.  The fact that the Secretariat allows a permanent presence of officials from the Republic within the North is certainly a shock to the Unionist thinking.  The fact that it is up and running well is further proof that the Agreement has in fact helped to change the lot, however slightly, of some of the Nationalists who have requested its help.  It has been a reassurance to them that their interests are being protected.</P>
    <P>Looking at the impact of the Agreement in general, there is a widespread perception in the Republic, and indeed the North, that the British Government have used it solely as a vehicle for better security but without any movement on other aspects of the Agreement, notably, a proper system of justice in the North and harassment, to name but a few.  For instance, the Extradition Act, 1987, was postponed by the Coalition Government in order to see what changes would be brought forward in the meantime in order to boost confidence in the administration of justice in the North.  Nothing of any great worth came forward.  We are still waiting.  What happened to the harmonisation of areas of criminal law?  I am glad to see that the British Government are coming round to our Government's view that greater use of the Criminal Law Jurisdiction Act, 1976, is more beneficial than the more cumbersome and sometimes ineffectual extradition procedures.</P>
    <P>I would like to make it quite clear that we will not wear the use of this extraterritorial legislation in addition to present extradition procedures.  It should be emphatically stated that if a person goes through the extradition procedure and is not finally extradited, he cannot face double jeopardy under the Criminal Law Jurisdiction Act.</P>
    <P>Devolution is referred to in Article 4 <Col N="874" /> (c).  Deputy Dukes recently made great play of the fact that neither Government seemed to bring forward proposals for that.  Deputy Dukes is showing a naivete in that there is no point, in my opinion, in bringing forward any such proposals until the parties within the North are inclined towards them.  At the moment, both seemed to be against such proposals in varying degrees.</P>
    <P>In my opinion, nothing will have any chance of working until such time as the Unionists are clear in their own minds, as to where they see their future.  If there is any chance of peace and stability on this whole island, it can only be when the Unionists talk on equal terms with their counterparts in the North and also with the rest of us down here.  This is why the talks without pre-conditions, as offered by the Taoiseach, are vital to the future. The Unionists must know by now that after three years neither Government will back down on this Agreement.  Unless they talk to the rest of us, they will remain &ldquo;out in the cold&rdquo;.  That cannot be good for the Unionist people in the long run. In the Unionist Task Force report <i>An End to Drift,</i> the authors said as much.</P>
    <P>The implementation of the three judge courts in place of the present one-judge system in the North may not make any difference in decisions being handed down, but I have no doubt that it would help allay the fears of people in the court system there.  A system similar to our Special Criminal Court would be preferable, where there is a judge from each of the District, Circuit and High Courts.</P>
    <P>On the question of harassment, I am sorry to say that this is still a major complaint of the people with whom I come into contact.  In the Border area the policing role has been reversed, in that the Army are, in my opinion, the primary force.  It is quite clear that an Army force is not re-active, like a police force.  It tries to take action before situations arise and that is why we have had numerous events in the recent past which ultimately have led to unanswered questions.</P>
    <P>I am happy to see that the Government have put a greater emphasis on this and on other issues which directly affect the <Col N="875" /> lives of the people on the ground.  It is because of this that the people, particularly in the North will gain confidence in the Agreement.</P>
    <P>In the areas of economic, social and cultural matters there has been some progress. For instance, the Anglo-Irish Fund has made a start both in the North and in the Republic.  In my own area the following are the major matters which have arisen as a result of the Anglo-Irish Fund: the launch of the Louth County Enterprise Fund which is very welcome; the Investment Company based in Dundalk which deals with investments along the Border and the incubator units in the regional technical college while assistance has been given to the worthwhile efforts of the Dundalk Enterprise Company. Substantial amounts of money have been spent in my constituency to boost tourism and employment.</P>
    <P>There have been some misgivings concerning the emphasis placed by the trustees of the fund.  It is felt that greater acknowledgement should be given to areas of particular disadvantage, such as the south Armagh north Louth area.</P>
    <P>The fair employment White Paper published in May 1988 is to be welcomed and we await the details.  I would suggest that the fines mentioned in the White Paper are not enough against defaulting employers.  I feel that greater emphasis should be given to the use of State grants and contracts to ensure the implementation of the proposed changes.  The situation where unemployment in Catholic areas is two and a half times greater than in non-Catholic areas must change, and change quickly.</P>
    <P>The interparliamentary party first proposed at the Anglo-Irish Summit in 1980 is given support in Article 12 of the Agreement.  I welcome the recent setting up of the sub committee who are actively examining this and I hope that the interparliamentary party will be in place in the near future.  It will help to put Irish affairs higher on the British agenda than they have been up to now.  It will also <Col N="876" /> help to demolish some of the myths on both sides.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would say that the agreement is a two-way process.  It would appear from this side of the Irish Sea that most of the &ldquo;give&rdquo; has been on this side. I have said before that the perception, particularly in my area, is that it has been used purely as a means to tighten security without, at least, equal emphasis on the other items mentioned in the pact.  This must change if the Agreement and its process is to be advanced.</P>
    <P>The insensitivity shown by the British side in certain instances has not helped this side explain to the general public down here what we are trying to do in order to ensure that there is some progress on the political, legal, economic and social sectors within this island.  Politically tainted decisions, such as the Thain release and the non-prosecution of RUC men suspected of conspiracy, make it very difficult for people in the Republic and indeed, the Nationalist people in the North, to have confidence in the British stated desire to &ldquo;develop our unique relationship&rdquo;.  Nor do these decisions show that there is greater &ldquo;close co-operation&rdquo; between our countries.  Similarily, the timing of the decision to announce the ending of the right to silence would lead one to believe that the British Government does not care a jot for the feelings of the Irish people.</P>
    <P>I would implore the British Government to be far more aware of the genuine fears and aspirations of the Irish people and to take them into account when they are making future political decisions.  If they do not, further progress, particularly on this side of the Irish Sea, will be very difficult to achieve.</P>
    <P>The Anglo-Irish Agreement is of benefit to this country purely and simply because it is the best we have on offer. The constitutional politicians in the North have to get together and the Unionists have to talk, as Deputy Deasy said earlier, with the consitutional parties down here so that one day we can all sort out our differences.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to participate in this debate as someone who was in this House on the first occasion the Anglo-Irish Agreement, was debated, and when it was concluded, during the lifetime of the last Government.</P>
      <P>I listened with some sadness to the contribution made by the Tánaiste this morning.  He eloquently summed up the difficulties that have arisen on this side of this divided Ireland with the Anglo-Irish Agreement while failing to acknowledge the failure of his party in Government to take the type of action the Agreement necessitated.  He talked on the need to revitalise the implementation of the Agreement and to rekindle a sense of urgency.  It seems to me that that need to revitalise the Agreement and to rekindle a sense of urgency derives from this Government's neglect of the Agreement, neglect of the Conference, and is due, too, to this Government turning many of the meetings that have taken place under the Anglo-Irish Agreement into fire brigade or emergency meetings forced on them as a result of a major act which created concern.  Instead of the conference being used to set the agenda, to seek to confront the problems of Northern Ireland, on too many occasions over the last 18 months ministerial meetings have been a reaction to events that affect Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Meetings of the Conference should be on a more regular and planned basis and should be designed to bring the intentions of the Agreement forward and seek to confront problems before they arise rather than solving problems which already exist.  What this Government on occasion have done by their neglect of the Agreement is to hand the agenda from the democratically elected Governments of this State and the United Kingdom to the men of violence in Northern Ireland.  It has been the acts of the men of violence in Northern Ireland which, on occasion, have dictated the pace of the Conference, the pace of meetings and the timing of meetings, instead of the Governments themselves.  We have had the reality of a Government <Col N="878" /> who have not moved on this issue except when they have been forced to do so, a Government who had a distaste for the Anglo-Irish Agreement when in Opposition and who have reluctantly sought to work some aspects of it since they came into office.</P>
    <P>When I say I regard the Tánaiste's speech with some sadness, I make a similar comment about the speech I have just heard and the speeches of other Fianna Fáil Deputies.  There has been a failure in their contributions to recognise some of the failures on our part in working the Agreement.  A portion of this debate has been used by some Fianna Fáil Members &mdash; not the Tánaiste &mdash; to engage in good old fashioned &ldquo;Brit bashing&rdquo;, to blame the British for all our problems.  I found it distressing to listen to the previous speaker's contribution and to note that at no stage was there any comment or condemnation of the acts and atrocities committed by the IRA and other violent groups in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>Catholics and Protestants are killed every week by the IRA and other subversive groups.  There is murder and mayhem in areas not too distant from this capital city.  Too many of the speeches we have heard this evening avoided any reference or condemnation of that type of violence and those types of acts.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste said we were celebrating the 20th anniversary of the first civil rights march in Derry and the third anniversary of the Anglo-Irish Agreement, but no mention was made of the fact that this weekend we were celebrating the first anniversary of the atrocious murders which took place in Enniskillen on a day when people came together to commemorate their dead.  There was no mention of the upwards of 50 people seriously maimed and injured.  Many of those are still suffering injuries from which they will never fully recover.  Just over a year ago they were blown apart in the square in Enniskillen.  In a debate such as this there should be some mention of that kind of atrocity.</P>
    <P>As democratic politicians we should, on all sides of the House, in a debate as serious as this, be seen to be unequivocal <Col N="879" /> in our condemnation of the men of violence. Of course, the Fianna Fáil Party have some difficulty with this.  I fully accept that members of the Fianna Fáil Party who are Members of this House do not generally support what is done by the men of violence but there is a degree of equivocation within the ranks of the Fianna Fáil Party which means that people often are not quite clear enough in the words of condemnation they utter. There is an avoidance of confronting the extent of the problem and commenting on it.  As Deputy Dukes said, there is a certain degree of sneaking regard for the men of violence, a degree of unacceptable ambivalence.  We have seen that in recent months within the Fianna Fáil Party.  There is an anti-extradition committee, a purely Fianna Fáil phenomenon, who are not really concerned with the system of justice in Northern Ireland or in Great Britain; they are a committee which basically have some degree of support for the fellow travellers and the men of violence.  The committee were formed by members of the Fianna Fáil Party who, quietly and secretly, believe that there should be some turning of the head, some ignoring of the violence and mayhem which the men of violence create on this island.</P>
    <P>There is not, within Fianna Fáil, a committee concerned specifically with peace and reconciliation.  We do not have a committee which found the need to get together to vociferously oppose the shoot-to-kill policy of the IRA.  Indeed, it is extraordinary how, when the British army behave in ways about which many of us in the House would raise questions, people who are Members of this House are prepared to use the phraseology &ldquo;shoot-to-kill&rdquo;.  I cannot recall ever hearing a member of the Fianna Fáil Party condemning the shoot-to-kill policy of the IRA.  I invite a member of the Government, in the contributions which remain to be made, to utter that type of condemnation because it is far too simplistic, as the previous speaker did, to condemn certain changes in British law which seek to enable the men of violence <Col N="880" /> to be brought to justice.  We have changed the laws in this State; we have the Offences Against the State Act and we established the Special Criminal Court with three judges.  We introduced the Criminal Justice Act in 1984 which amended and changed our laws to facilitate the Garda in seeking to bring to justice the men of violence.  It seems on occasions that what is acceptable for us to do within this jurisdiction is not acceptable &mdash; to some members of the party opposite &mdash; for the British Government to do within their jurisdiction.  Co-operation is a two-way process and on occasion it is far too easy to cast stones across the water instead of examining our own actions.</P>
    <P>In regard to the Forum report, the Tánaiste stated that it stressed the overriding urgency of action and underlined the need, not merely to arrest the cancer, but to create the conditions for a new Ireland and a new society acceptable to all her people.  The conditions for a new Ireland require changes on the entirety of the island and a degree of vision from the Government on this side of the Border in seeking to establish some degree of confidence on the part of the Northern majority in our goodwill and credibility.  The tragedy is that Fianna Fáil, in Opposition and Government, failed utterly to make any meaningful contribution to creating the conditions for a new Ireland.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil have maintained a tribal approach to sensitive social issues which undermines the credibility of claims of generosity to be extended to the Unionist minority on the island in the event of major political changes taking place.  It is not good enough simply to say that the Forum report stated that there is a need to create conditions for a new Ireland. There is a need to make a positive contribution towards creating those conditions and it is a very poor political policy simply, on a regular basis, to announce that when the Unionists sit down and talk to us we will then be willing to be generous.  The difficulty is, from a Unionist perspective, that very little generosity has been seen from the contributions <Col N="881" /> made by Fianna Fáil in Opposition and Government in dealing with the issues which they regard as matters of some sensitivity.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil have shown ambivalence in relation to extradition.  The anti-extradition committee do not believe &mdash; no matter how many people are murdered, no matter what the circumstances of the murder &mdash; that those who have committed such murders or who are charged with them, should, in any circumstances, be brought before the courts in Northern Ireland.  Indeed, it is ironic to hear members of the Government talking about reliance on the Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Act, 1976, because they opposed the enactment of that measure when it came before the House.  I do not believe that there is any seriousness of intent to use that Act just as I said in this House 12 months ago that I believed the amendments being introduced to the extradition process would create a facade of extradition continuing to operate when, in reality, the whole system would be clogged up with legal complexities and would not in practice operate.  No more than one or two people have been extradited from this State for violent murderous acts since the start of the year. Perhaps a Government speaker will confirm if I am right.  That measure, enacted about this time last year, has in effect brought extradition to an end although some members of the Tánaiste's party have not yet recognised the fact, hence the anti-extradition committee are still running around.</P>
    <P>The failure of this State to be sensitive to the feelings of the Unionist population could never have been more evident than in the totally unnecessary controversy that arose in recent weeks over &mdash; of all things &mdash; the wearing of a poppy.  If we have difficulties on this island in accepting the manner in which those of different traditions and backgrounds show respect for and commemorate the dead, how will we finally agree the systems of government that will respect and protect the rights of people living on this island?  It is extraordinary that not a single Government Minister was willing to make any <Col N="882" /> comment on this controversy in the last few days other than, when asked, to assure the media that in no circumstances would they wear a poppy.</P>
    <P>There was no concept of the fact that not merely had 49,000 Irishmen lost their lives in the First World War but that just a year ago people commemorating the dead were bombed to death in Enniskillen.</P>

      <P>I beg your pardon.  One would have expected an extra degree of sensitivity from the Government in relation to this issue.  There has been a total failure by Fianna Fáil in Government to bring forward any possibility of devolution.  The Fianna Fáil Party are locked into a time warp of unrealistic goals and expectations.  They seem to be blinded by the possibility of the concept of a unity that will not come about for many generations.  They are confined in an ideological strait jacket of their own making.  The time for movement is now. If we are to take the agenda away from the men of violence we must establish within Northern Ireland meaningful political structures which give both the majority and the minority there a role to play in the political process.  To date this Government have failed to make any contribution towards the achievement of that goal.  I would hope that in the context of the review of the workings of this Agreement the Government would reassess their own contribution since they have come into office and, in doing so, would recognise the need to regard it as a matter of urgent priority to make a positive contribution towards the establishment of a devolved assembly in Northern Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Energy and Communications (Mr. R. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>As other speakers have said, it is timely that this House reflects upon the Anglo-Irish Agreement three years after its signing and as the two Governments begin the review of the workings of the Conference.</P>
      <P>At the outset, I would like to pay tribute to the quality of most of the contributions to this important debate which reflect the seriousness of the issues which we are considering and the special nature of the Northern Ireland problem.  Indeed, there is no other problem which has so deeply affected the lives of all of us on this island and which successive Governments and Members of this House must address with a greater sense of responsibility.</P>
      <P>I have listened with increasing depression to that sterile piece of Fianna Fáil bashing that we have just heard from Deputy Shatter, which masqueraded as a contribution to a review of the workings of the Agreement.  He did his usual throwing of dirt at Fianna Fáil in relation to violence and made accusations in relation to some attitude that he feels exists within Fianna Fáil with regard to violence.  He said that no comment had been made by any Minister in the debate in relation to violence.</P>
      <P>The Tánaiste, in opening the debate this morning, said emphatically that there is no acceptable level of violence.  How much more precise can he be?  The Minister for Justice in his contribution said that both Governments have firmly condemned violence and seek to bring it to an end.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce said that the most poignant and tragic loss is that of the lives of men, women and children, a loss of chilling finality which can never be made good. That has been the theme running through the debates and contributions of our Ministers and other speakers on this side of the House all day.  That mere fact has never occurred to Deputy Shatter.  What he is best at is grovelling and throwing muck wherever he thinks it can stick.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to refer to a couple of the points made by Deputy Dukes in his <Col N="884" /> intervention this morning.  Deputy Dukes was critical of the comprehensive scope of the review outlined by the Tánaiste in his opening statement.  The leader of the Fine Gael Party suggested, and Deputy Barry repeated this point, that the review would be substituting for the normal work of the Conference.  This is an absolutely unsustainable argument.  How would Deputy Dukes suggest that the two Governments review the &ldquo;working of the Conference&rdquo;, as envisaged in Article 11, without reference to the subject matter which has formed the agenda of the Conference over the past three years?  The review is not some academic exercise divorced from the reality of Conference discussions. Deputy Dukes' approach would lead towards a minimalist review, instead of the in-depth exercise that is appropriate and necessary.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dukes was also critical of the Tánaiste's reference to dissatisfaction among members of the Nationalist community about the operation of the Agreement. The Tánaiste, while setting out at some length the advances achieved under the Agreement, also spoke of a feeling among many Nationalists that the Agreement has not made a substantive difference to their daily lives.  I am not sure whether to take Deputy Dukes's response entirely seriously.  He suggested that a large majority of people in the Republic would take a similar view that the Government decisions here had not impacted on their daily lives.  I would strongly question any such contention. But even if it were true, it is an entirely mistaken point for the following fundamental reason.</P>
    <P>In the Republic, we live in a normal democracy.  It is not a society torn apart by the fundamental divisions that exist in Northern Ireland.  We do not have a situation where 40 per cent of the community have had underclass status for over 50 years.  The situations North and South simply cannot be compared.  I think Deputy Dukes does a disservice to the Nationalist community by making this false comparison.</P>
    <P>As the House is aware, in the past year I have been involved directly in meetings <Col N="885" /> of the Intergovernmental Conference. On the basis of that experience I should like to offer my contribution to today's debate.</P>
    <P>We have frankly to admit that while the period since November 1985 has seen a number of positive developments, it has not been a period of uninterrupted progress and success.  The past three years has not seen the end of violence or the political reconciliation of the two traditions on this island which we long to achieve.  Neither have the two sovereign Governments involved in the Agreement arrived at a resolution of the age-old difficulties which so bedevil our relationship. The two are inextricably bound together and are essentially part of the same political challenge.</P>
    <P>In recognising these realities, it must be fairly admitted that from the outset the Agreement was burdened by some exaggerated claims from a number of its exponents.  In fact the Agreement was a development of the important process begun in 1980 &mdash; it was not the end of that process.  Its significance, however, was that it provided new systematic arrangements within which the two Governments could pursue a broad range of objectives aimed at improving conditions within Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>I do not propose in this debate to dwell upon the disappointing and difficult aspects of the Agreement.  When this Government assumed office in March 1987 they took upon themselves the responsibilities bequeathed to them by the previous Government.  One of those responsibilities was the implementation of the Anglo-Irish Agreement.  We made clear from the outset that we would fully work the structures of the Agreement and attempt to achieve the maximum benefits under its provisions especially in regard to bringing reforms and improvements in the position of the Nationalist community in Northern Ireland.  It is that concern to achieve the maximum possible under the Agreement which has informed and motivated our efforts over the past 20 months.</P>
    <P>Shortly after our election to office a programme of work for the Conference <Col N="886" /> was established and meetings of the Conference began to assume a regular pattern. The frequency at which those meetings have taken place clearly shows the Government's commitment to working the Agreement and contradicts the ill-informed statements made by some of our critics.</P>
    <P>During the first six months of this year, when Anglo-Irish relations were under their greatest strain in recent years &mdash; strains in no way caused by the Irish Government &mdash; we insisted that the processes of the Agreement and the Inter-governmental Conference be used to their fullest extent possible.  As the House will be aware, I was asked by the Government to attend several meetings of the Conference during that difficult period.  We insisted at that time that the issues and events which caused so much hurt and dismay here and among the Nationalist community in Northern Ireland should be brought to the Conference. We insisted upon voicing that dismay clearly and unequivocally at special meetings of the Conference and sought to convince the British Government of the need for a change in policy. There was a good deal of straight talking at those meetings.  There was no pretence that real differences did not exist.  We left the British Government in no doubt as to these feelings.  We also left them in no doubt as to our full commitment to work the processes of the Anglo-Irish Agreement and of our expectation that this commitment be fully reciprocated by the British Government.</P>
    <P>It is not my purpose today to go into the issues of the Stalker-Sampson affair or the other severe difficulties which emerged at that time.  The House is well acquainted with the issues.  What I would wish the House to reflect on is the way in which the Government fully utilised the Anglo-Irish Agreement to pursue these issues in a forthright and constructive manner.  There was no attempt to obfuscate or avoid what were real differences. We insisted on our role and our rights under the Agreement as a guarantor of the rights of the Nationalist population in Northern Ireland.  In spite of the grave <Col N="887" /> differences involved, the British Government never challenged that role and those rights.  This was a far cry from the exchange of curt telegrams and the dismissive attitude of past years when we sought to assert our rights to be consulted and to advise on issues relating to Northern Ireland.  Our legitimate concern in these matters is now accepted as a fact of life in the relationship between our two Governments.  The responsible attitude of the Government to the Agreement in the difficult early months of this year played no small part in underpinning that position.  Indeed, that responsible attitude was rightly endorsed beyond these shores not only in the international media but by friends of Ireland in Europe, the US, Australia, New Zealand and elsewhere as well as &mdash; I may emphasise this point &mdash; in Britain.</P>
    <P>By fully utilising the Agreement and the Conference in particular we avoided a dangerous decline in Anglo-Irish relations.  Instead of allowing the differences and difficulties to fester unattended in a diplomatic stand off, we used the Agreement to keep dialogue open.  I must, of course, admit frankly that, although we kept the dialogue open and avoided a serious rift in Anglo-Irish relations, the British Government did not reconsider a number of those decisions which they took in their own interest. As the Taoiseach told the Dáil on 17 February last, we had reached an impasse on those vital issues relating to the administration of justice and confidence in the legal system.  Nevertheless, we retained these issues on the agenda of the Conference so that we might pursue them more fully as soon as a fruitful opportunity arose.  As Members of the House will be aware from the Joint Communique from the last Anglo-Irish Conference, the next meeting of the Conference will deal with these very issues of confidence in the system of justice and relations between the security forces and the community in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>While admitting last February that we had reached an impasse on these vital <Col N="888" /> issues, the totality of Anglo-Irish relations was not allowed to reach an impasse.  We ensured that, in spite of all, other important matters on the agenda of the Conference should be pursued vigorously. Thus by the June meeting of the Conference we were in a position to welcome jointly progress made in the area of fair employment following the publication of the British White Paper on the subject.  Given my own involvement at the time in pursuing this question of fair employment, it is right that I recognise and acknowledge to the House the seriousness with which the British Government and their officials have addressed the views and proposals of the Irish Government on this subject.</P>
    <P>That June meeting also pushed ahead with proposals to alleviate the economic and social problems of west Belfast.  In addition we were able to review the positive developments regarding our joint approach to the European Commission for a contribution to the International Fund for Ireland while at the same time devoting attention to improving the functions and targeting of the fund.  The same Conference meeting also discussed education reform proposals for Northern Ireland and agreed to reinforce bilateral contacts between Ministers on economic and social questions.</P>
    <P>Thus, at the end of the most difficult six months in the Agreement's short life we had ensured that, in spite of all the problems, a real programme of work had been achieved and, indeed, had outlined the programme for the following months. This reflected the determination on the part of both Governments to push forward with the work of the Conference in all important areas where progress could be achieved.</P>
    <P>In considering the responsibility of my Department I can immediately see areas where co-operation could be developed under the Anglo-Irish Agreement in the future.  For example, in the area of energy the maintenance of two separate electricity grids within one island is clearly wasteful.  Increased co-operation between the two electricity boards would be of great benefit.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="889" /> On the question of broadcasting I am very conscious that the reception of RTE TV is very weak, if not absent completely, in many parts of Northern Ireland.  I am aware there are some technical reasons that this is the case, nevertheless I am anxious that the issue be raised at political level in the context of the Agreement.  Indeed, the broadcasting of Radio na Gaeltachta in the Belfast area could also be looked into at that stage.</P>

      <P>In looking back over the past 20 months I am sure any fair minded observer would conclude that this Government have pursued a most constructive approach to the problems of Northern Ireland.  We have sought to promote dialogue between politicians and between the two sovereign Governments. Not only have we kept faith with the Anglo-Irish Agreement, we have pursued its opportunities and used it whenever necessary to relieve tension.</P>
      <P>We have never pretended the Anglo-Irish Agreement was the enduring solution or the last word to be spoken on the painful problem of Northern Ireland. The Agreement provides a means to address some of the symptoms of that problem and, it is hoped, to build confidence and greater understanding.  The Agreement does not exclude political moves and dialogue outside its ambit.  As a Government we have worked at that Agreement constructively.  In approaching the review of the workings of the Conference we will seek to ensure, with the assistance and constructive views of the Members of the House, that the Agreement is used to its full potential.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DinnyMcGinley" hpid="Mr. McGinley Mr. McGinley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe it appropriate and proper that we here in this House should avail of this occasion, the third anniversary of the signing of the historic Anglo-Irish Agreement, to express our thoughts and opinions on the operation, successes and perhaps failures since its signing on 15 October 1985, three years <Col N="890" /> ago.  I believe the signing of the Agreement to be a major milestone in the long and complicated relationship between this country and the UK.</P>
      <P>Major credit must go to the former Taoiseach, Deputy Garret FitzGerald, whose patience, commitment and perseverance contributed so much to the signing of that Agreement.  Before ever becoming Taoiseach he showed a deep understanding and knowledge of the situation in Northern Ireland.  He has spoken extensively on the subject, and the Agreement itself stands as a major monument to his and his Government's efforts, comparable with the Treaty of 1921 or the Sunningdale Agreement.</P>
      <P>Other Members of that Government, particularly Deputy Peter Barry as Minister for Foreign Affairs and Deputy Dick Spring as Tánaiste, also made a most significant contribution.  I am afraid the attitude of the present Taoiseach and of the Fianna Fáil Party has been ambivalent from the beginning.  They expressed reservations about the Agreement's constitutionality, but never had the courage of their so-called convictions to challenge this matter in the courts of the land.  It is easy to cast doubts on the constitutionality of any legislation or agreement. We can all practise being fireside lawyers, but the litmus test of our seriousness and conviction is to challenge it in the courts, and this test has been failed by Fianna Fáil both in Opposition and now in Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Agreement itself provides a framework for a process.  It was never meant to be the final solution.  Unfortunately, there is no such thing as an instant or easy solution to the complicated and complex problems of Northern Ireland.  The problem is one of division between people, a division which has been intensified by the paramilitary activities from both sides.  The legacy of bitterness built over the past 20 years makes reconciliation infinitely more difficult. Given its complexity, the problem needs the serious and continuous attention of both Governments and the Agreement, through the Secretariat and the <Col N="891" /> Intergovernmental Conference, has provided the machinery towards this end.</P>
    <P>The first requirement is to deliver equality to both sections of the community. Only on this basis can real progress be made.  The Agreement itself was a major step in this direction.  The Irish Government presence in Northern Ireland, the right to make an input to policy making &mdash; how effective this input has been recently is open to question &mdash; the formal recognition of the rights and aspirations and cultural identities of the two traditions within the framework of the Agreement, places Nationalists, for the first time, on an equal footing with Unionists.  However, there is much work to be done to give practical effect to that equality; there are nettles to be grasped and difficult decisions to be taken.  Hence the need for continued commitment by both Governments.  Given our historic experience we have to realise that British Governments have great difficulty in keeping their attention directed towards the Irish problem for any length of time. The negotiating period before the signing of the Agreement was exceptional. Hence the absolute necessity to give a wholehearted commitment to ensuring it reaches its ultimate aim of peace, justice and stability.  Failure would have serious implications for Ireland as a whole.</P>
    <P>During the three years of its operation the Agreement has grappled successfully with many of the grievances of the Nationalist community in Northern Ireland.  There has been significant progress in many areas.  There is a fairer distribution and allocation of public authority housing.  There are reforms of the laws on flags and emblems, in the area of supergrass trials, and in the acceptance that security forces, particularly the UDR, have to be accompanied by the police, especially in Nationalist areas.</P>
    <P>However, there are a number of areas where little or no progress has been achieved. This is particularly noticeable where the Irish language and culture is concerned.</P>
    <P>It was understood that an old Stormont Act, namely The Local Government <Col N="892" /> (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act was to be repealed.  This act makes it illegal to have street names in Irish in Northern Ireland. It is still on the Statute Book and the Irish language is not given any status or recognition as far as street names are concened &mdash; not even a second-class status.</P>
    <P>Another area of grave concern is the recently published proposals on education reform in Northern Ireland.  These proposals contain a quite deliberate downgrading of the Irish language in the educational system.  The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State with responsibility for Education, Dr. Brian Mawhinney received many delegations from Irish language organisations, the Catholic Church, the SDLP, and other parties with regard to the Irish language.</P>
    <P>The position prior to the proposed changes was that pupils at secondary school level in Northern Ireland had to take a modern European language.  This could be Irish or any of the other European languages such as French, Spanish, German, Italian, etc.  However, under the new proposals the position is that Irish is no longer recognised as a modern European language and therefore pupils wishing to take the Irish language as a subject must first of all take a modern European language.  This simply means that Irish is losing its status as a modern European language and has been relegated to the position of a third or fourth language.  If this proposal is implemented it will have serious implications for the teaching of Irish to second level students in Northern Ireland.  It is a most definite downgrading of the Irish language, which until now could be taken as a second language.  I would appeal to the Government, particularly the Minister for Foreign Affairs, and the Taoiseach himself who has responsibility for the Gaeltacht, to take the matter up at the Anglo-Irish Conference and with the Secretariat.</P>
    <P>This also has some implications for my own constituency of Donegal SouthWest, where we have nine or ten Irish colleges with thousands of students from various parts of Northern Ireland coming to the Donegal Gaeltacht every year to <Col N="893" /> improve their knowledge of and fluency in the Irish language.  If these proposals are implemented it will have serious implications for these Irish colleges and for the families who are depending on these colleges for their livelihood.</P>
    <P>If Irish as a subject is relegated to second class status in the educational system in Northern Ireland, there is a great danger that people interested in pursuing the study of the Irish language will go outside the educational system for instruction.  It is a well known fact that Sinn Féin are busily engaged in promoting their Irish language classes throughout Northern Ireland, particularly in the urban areas of Belfast and Derry.  It is in the interest of all that Dr. Mawhinney should have another serious look at this entire area and maintain for the Irish language its present status.</P>
    <P>In the special circumstances of Northern Ireland there has been a negative, indeed a hostile attitude, in official circles towards Irish since the state was formed. It is essential for the Conference now to positively promote the language.  Dr. Mawhinney's proposals do not live up to the commitment in the Anglo-Irish Agreement to foster the cultural heritage of both traditions.</P>
    <P>There is also another area to which the Inter-Governmental Conference and the Secretariat could direct their attentions in the immediate future.  That is what is referred to as the `I' vote.  This is legislation preventing people who move from the Republic to Northern Ireland from voting in local government or assembly type elections and it is still in place.  The &ldquo;I&rdquo; in front of the name on the register means &ldquo;Imperial&rdquo; and this indicates that one can vote only in Westminister elections. In view of the fact that local elections are due in Northern Ireland in May 1989 there is great urgency in having this legislation amended or repealed.  It should be dealt with as a matter of urgency and I believe that the Anglo-Irish Agreement would be considerably weakened if it fails to make arrangements for people from the Republic resident in Northern Ireland for years to have a right to vote.  Incidentally this legislation <Col N="894" /> relates to all those people who have gone to Northern Ireland from the Republic since 1962.</P>
    <P>Again, I wish to return briefly to the question of the Irish language.  It is abundantly clear from the commitment and success of those involved in establishing the Bunscoil Lán-Ghaelach in Belfast that there is a demand among the people, particularly the Nationalist population for Irish.  The Bunscoil Lán-Ghaelach in Belfast was given official and state recognition a few years ago after a long struggle and much pressure and negotiation and, indeed, I understand that Deputy Peter Barry supported their efforts when he was Minister for Foreign Affairs in the last Government.</P>
    <P>There is general agreement on both sides of the Border and in the United Kingdom that there has been real progress and co-operation on security matters between the North and South.  The Irish Government have certainly delivered on their side of the bargain.  Extradition, however tenuous is in place. There are regular meetings between the Garda Commissioner and the Chief Constable and the success of their co-operation can be seen in the arsenals of arms, ammunition and explosives that have been found on both sides of the Border. However, some progress has yet to be achieved in the fields of justice and the courts.  The Diplock courts, trials by one-judge and without a jury, are still operating. We must direct our attention towards those areas and now that the Agreement is under review it is opportune that they be taken up at the highest level.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, some progress has been achieved through the Agreement. It is imperative that the Agreement and Conference have the support and commitment of both Governments if there are to be peace and prosperity in Northern Ireland and in this country.  It is very much regretted that the leaders of Unionist opinion in Northern Ireland have not yet consented or seen fit to operate within the framework of the Agreement.  In my view the Agreement protects and safeguards their aspirations <Col N="895" /> and hopes for the future just as it endeavours to do the same for the minority Nationalist population.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. O'Kennedy) Michael O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Other speakers have dwelt on the different aspects of Anglo-Irish relations.  I would like to dwell in particular on economic aspects, both because these are of major significance in themselves and because my own particular responsibility of Agriculture and Food is one where North-South economic co-operation could prove particularly productive and fruitful.</P>
      <P>So much time and energy has been devoted in recent years to reacting to the problems and tragedy in Northern Ireland.  By contrast relatively little time has been devoted to exploiting the great economic potential that can be realised through structured co-operation in areas of common interest.  We will not succeed even in dealing with security problems if we confine ourselves to reacting.  We must look to the common interest which knows no sectarian barrier and which can be translated into a new environment for opportunity and prosperity for all.  Prosperity shared in equal opportunity and justice is the most effective weapon against violence and I propose to focus on the opportunities that exist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is hardly another sector where the interest of North and South can converge as much as they do in agriculture. There is hardly another sector where the interests of Northern Ireland and Great Britain diverge so much as they do in agriculture.  Britain is not a primary producer and, understandably, it is more concerned with consumer interests, with cheap food and with the impact that has on the British community generally than in promoting the development of the agricultural sector in any part of the UK and, for that matter, in the North of Ireland. I do not say that as a criticism of any UK Government but as a matter of fact.  In Great Britain, in contrast with Ireland where agriculture North and South is central to economic development, agriculture has a much lower priority.  These <Col N="896" /> facts are reflected in the strikingly different policies pursued by our Government and that of the UK in agricultural negotiations at Community level.  They are also reflected in agricultural negotiations at the wider world level, now becoming more important, such as the GATT negotiations which will be subject to mid-term review in Montreal before the end of the month.</P>
    <P>In Ireland, our policy is based not only on safeguarding rural incomes but on safeguarding and protecting the rural way of life as an essential element in the socioeconomic stability of our society.  The values, cultures traditions, language, music and song of rural Ireland are at the base of our stability.  The problems experienced in urban conurbations, here and elsewhere, are not characteristic of rural Ireland.  In our policies we are determined to promote and safeguard the rural way of life.  In that context we are developing an effective export strategy in the food sector which accounts for 30 per cent of our total exports.  We are unique in Europe in having an economy based on such a strong sector as agriculture and food, with 10 per cent of GNP based on agriculture and 20 per cent of total employment based on that sector.  We are making a major impact with our agriculture and food exports on world markets. Our fellow Irishmen in the North are becoming increasingly conscious of those facts and are now beginning to acknowledge them publicly.</P>
    <P>It is fair to say that the similar agricultural situations, North and South, have more than once been recognised by the European Community in a practical way.  Most of them derive from initiatives taken by Irish Commissioners, and Irish Ministers, most notably in the Agriculture Council.  When those initiatives were adopted for our jurisdiction they had consequential benefits for our fellow Irishmen in the North, something we greatly welcomed.  I should like to give some examples of initiatives I was involved in.  Initially the calf premium was proposed as a special provision for Ireland at Commission level during the period I served on it.  It was adopted <Col N="897" /> by the Council in 1982 and when that occurred the UK requested, with our support, that the premium should operate in Northern Ireland.  There was never any question of that premium applying in Britain.</P>
    <P>There was a similar decision as regards the additional FEOGA-financed element of the suckler cow premium which also applies North and South.  The value of those two schemes to Northern Ireland cattle producers was more than £5 million in 1987.  Again, similar positive results for Northern farmers followed on from the special western package that we achieved &mdash; elements of which were, happily, applied to Northern Ireland.  We enthusiastically took those opportunities, and many more, of extending to Northern Ireland benefits obtained principally by our own negotiaing pressure.  If and when &mdash; I hope it will be &ldquo;when&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;if&rdquo;&mdash; similar circumstances arise in the future I will certainly follow that policy line.  It is not just a matter of personal preference or commitment because it represents the commitment of the Government who have been constantly encouraging me in that direction.  I am sure I can say that it represents the interest and commitment of every party in the House and the people of this jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>On this island there is a great common interest in the prosperity of the farm sectors, North and South.  I hope it will be possible to promote further co-operation in the future.  As Minister for Agriculture and Food, I have been mandated by the Government to develop the ability and competitiveness of our farmers and our processors in order to realise the full potential of the agri-food sector.  The figures I have just given as to what that represents in our exports demonstrate the commitment to which I have referred and the success of our policies in putting it into effect.  The farm income survey of An Foras Talúntais &mdash; now Teagasc &mdash; for 1987 showed an increase of 30 per cent in farm incomes in the Republic in that year.  Preliminary figures for 1988 indicate that they will show a further substantial increase this year over that <Col N="898" /> record growth and increase of last year. We have now reached the position, by comparison with any other country in the European Community where the farm income situation is the best that has been experienced anywhere throughout the European Community and compares very favourably with performance in other European Community member states including the United Kingdom.</P>
    <P>In stating that fact I want to emphasise that that improvement in farm incomes is at least as much of a consequence of overall Government policies &mdash; particularly the management policies in the economy which have been a consistent feature of this Government and that have been directed so ably by the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance with reduced interest rates and reduced inflation rates &mdash; as it is of anything that I or my colleagues in the Department, Minister of State Deputy Walsh and Deputy Kirk, have been able directly to do in our immediate area.  It is the co-ordinated approach.  We focused on the market and we won.</P>
    <P>We get the best prices for our product anywhere in the world at a premium above any other country in the European Community because of the policies I and my colleagues have pursued.  That is the message that is coming through loud and clear to the North of Ireland as well.  That is what signals to them that now there is a great opportunity and an advantage to be derived from a better and closer liaison with us in the area of agricultural policy particularly &mdash; and I am not excluding others &mdash; where we are represented at the Council, where we have a very effective and constant voice and where we have contacts, personal and otherwise at the Council and at Commission level. This contrasts with our fellow Irishmen in the North who are not represented in any sense at any of these levels.  They look to us with a certain degree of understandable envy at this point.  The message is clear.  The benefit to Northern Ireland farmers and processors can be very considerable if we can agree a framework for <Col N="899" /> dealing with agricultural and food matters in co-operation and consultation.  On behalf of the Government I would be very glad to make myself available, at political or sectoral level, to advance these common interests without any pre-conditions.</P>
    <P>The fact that successive Irish Governments fought hard and successfully for farmers in this jurisdiction &mdash; and indeed in the North &mdash; highlights the benefits that Northern agricultural producers could gain from closer co-operation with us.  This will become all the more important given developments within the European Community budget and the broadening of the redesignated less favoured areas.  On the basis therefore of mutual benefit it would seem reasonable, indeed essential, for both sides, North and South, to co-operate to bring advantage to agriculture for the whole island.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, the common interest in the economy, and particularly in this area, requires that we find a framework for helping our fellow Irishmen in the North or from whatever background &mdash; and it is time we respected each and every background as being a matter of conviction.  Common interest requires that we recruit them in a common effort to their advantage much more than to ours.  I hope the message is coming clearly to them now that we are ready to engage in structures to implement that common interest.</P>
    <P>The Government are encouraged by the efforts which have already been made to find common ground between farming organisations on a North-South basis.  We hope that those discussions can include all representative groups from both sides in the North and in the South.  I am not going to engage in any farm politics at this point &mdash; I have never done so and I will not do so now.  There are two different groups which are easily identifiable in the North &mdash; the Ulster Farmers Union represents, one might say, the majority of establishment farmers who are reasonably prosperous in some instances and very prosperous farmers in some other instances, and the farm group, west of <Col N="900" /> the Bann who represent, by and large, the smaller farmers.  Perhaps it is no coincidence that the group west of the Bann would generally have a greater representation from the Nationalist community, whereas the Ulster Farmers Union would have a greater representation from the Unionist community.</P>
    <P>It is time that in the North as in the South these separate interests were put aside and we co-operated together in a common interest.  I have some little experience in this area as I had the privilege of meeting the Ulster Farmers Union on more than one occasion, and particularly during my period as Commissioner. I hope I was able to demonstrate to them, and I think they acknowledged the consequence of my positive interest, that what motivated me and our party &mdash; and I think all parties here &mdash; and motivates me even more at this point&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>Following the signing of the Anglo-Irish Agreement I had the privilege &mdash; with yourself and others in this House &mdash; to be present and to speak to the debate which followed.  I am honoured to have an opportunity to speak to the pending review of the Agreement and the work of the Conference.  It is timely to reflect on what the Anglo-Irish Agreement set out to do and what it achieved, <Col N="901" /> whether it be limited or not and what it is likely and or capable of achieving.</P>
      <P>Critics of the Agreement will point out that the level of violence has not diminished or decreased.  They will use that excuse as a possible means or avenue to scrap the Agreement.  On this side of the Border and on the other side of the Border there seemed to be, over the past 12 months, some indication that perhaps that might be in mind or if it was possible to reach some kind of tacit agreement along those lines that further progress might be achieved.  I disagree entirely.</P>
      <P>When the Anglo-Irish Agreement was first signed and the Anglo-Irish Conference set up it was seen not as an end in itself but a means of establishing some trust and confidence between two communities as a first timid and diminutive step towards establishing a relationship whereby violence might ultimately be defeated.  In that there is absolutely no reason to believe that the Conference has failed.  At this stage the Conference has established a dialogue, albeit, one between two Governments.  Those who criticise would be well advised to examine the input of the two Governments.  When the Agreement was first signed it had the full support of both the Irish Government, under the leadership of the then Taoiseach, Dr. Garret FitzGerald, ably supported by Deputies Peter Barry and Spring and, on the other side, by the British Government and its Prime Minister, still their Prime Minister.  Both Governments were committed absolutely to the spirit and letter of the Agreement.</P>
      <P>At that time Fianna Fáil, then in opposition, were, to say the least, a little ambivalent about the whole issue.  They gave it grudging support and had a grudging respect for it.  To my mind that undermined their position ultimately when they assumed office because it would be obvious to any other Government negotiating with them that they did not have their hearts in it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now if we examine what could and should be done we find that the Government, the Conference or the two peoples on this side of the Irish Sea and those in the United Kingdom and in Northern <Col N="902" /> Ireland &mdash; it could be argued &mdash; have not moved closer together in the way we should have liked.  However, I do not think that would be possible within the space of three years.  Indeed I do not think it will be possible within the space of the next three years unless certain specific actions are taken by both Governments.  Both Governments have an absolute responsibility.  The Government here have a responsibility to ensure that, instead of public pronouncements or public proclamations following atrocities of one kind or another, discussion takes place at Conference level.  Likewise the British Government have an equal responsibility to ensure that, instead of making public proclamations in relation to sensitive issues, they discuss them at Conference level with the Irish Government where the interests of both the Nationalist and Unionist communities can be dealt with.  Unless the Conference can gain the confidence of both Nationalists and Unionists together there is no possible way it will move toward the kind of structure ultimately which would lead to devolved government and hopefully, at some stage in the future, to a united Ireland.</P>
    <P>Let us ask ourselves another question: whose confidence must we gain?  Looking at it from our perspective on this side of the Border I hope we have the confidence of the Nationalist community.  I sincerely hope that all politicians in this House have the confidence of the Nationalist community, I emphasise the constitutional Nationalist community.  We would then have to ask ourselves whether, equally, we might have the confidence of the Unionist community.  I would have to say that I do not think we have.  Perhaps because of our history, perhaps because we are, by nature, equivocators &mdash; which has been very damaging to us &mdash; but for whatever reason, there is a suspicion in the minds of the Unionist community that perhaps we are not to be trusted.  Perhaps it can be argued, and rightly so, that when they were in the driving seat they did not give much indication to the minority within their community that they would treat <Col N="903" /> them well and did not treat them very well.</P>
    <P>That is all in the past.  If we are to achieve anything in this country it must be by looking to the future.  There is no sense whatever in repeating the mistakes made in the past.  We must plough a new furrow, one of our own, and carve out a niche of our own which hopefully will lead ultimately to the establishment of recognition by both communities of each other's right to exist and each other's rights to be equal.  If the Agreement can be developed along those lines, it will have achieved more than we give it credit for, certainly within the confines of a day-long debate here.</P>
    <P>For instance, whenever a serious atrocity takes place what is the first tendency? The first tendency is for people in both private and public life to speak out and condemn it, and rightly so.  But, when criticism is to be levelled at one or other sector, then the first attitude should be to convene an urgent meeting of the Conference so that behind the scenes, in an unemotional and uncharged atmosphere, away from the glare of publicity, media tension and the hype that goes with it, the parties who are signatories to the agreement should thrash out the problem then before them and perhaps others that may not yet have appeared on the horizon.</P>
    <P>I agree entirely with my Party Leader when he says that there should be more regular meetings of the Conference.  That is obvious.  Let us face it, local authorities meet at least once a month.  We have here a Conference already established, the purpose of which is to try to bring two communities together, to try to bring to an end the horrible dilemma and saga of violence that has beset this country for the last 20 odd years.  Surely it begs more attention than merely to call a meeting whenever a bomb explodes with consequent loss of life or whenever some other serious atrocity takes place?  At least there should be ongoing regular monthly meetings of the Conference.  Intermittently there should be an arrangement whereby, in case of necessity, a full meeting can take place at very short notice.  If <Col N="904" /> we are to replace violence with discussion and dialogue we must have adequately at our disposal the machinery whereby, virtually at the drop of a hat, we can set that machinery in motion, allowing the participants on either side make their contribution?  Regardless of what persuasion or from which side of the political divide one comes, here or in the North, surely there is more to be gained by dialogue than by ducking, retaliating, shooting killing or maiming?</P>
    <P>Likewise, whether it be the Diplock Courts, the Gibraltar shootings or any other issue affecting the communities in the North, the workings of the Anglo-Irish Agreement and the ultimate cessation of the violence, it is absolutely essential that an immediate machinery be made available whereby the two Governments can get together and make their case to one another?  Let them thrash out, before going public, what they intend to do, how they propose to do it and how they can best do it without embarrassing each other.</P>
    <P>There were some suggestions over the past 12 months about the possibility of scrapping the Anglo-Irish Agreement by entering into talks with the Unionist community. It is unfortunate that the Unionist community are not involved.  They say they were not consulted.  Yet the Unionist majority were invited to participate in the New Ireland Forum, as were many others, and some private individuals did participate.  But no group has the right &mdash; in the serious circumstances obtaining in this island &mdash; to withdraw, contending they will not participate unless a particular structure is removed and expect either the British or Irish Government to assume they will be true to their word and will enter into meaningful discussions thereafter.  That is too much to expect.</P>
    <P>I mentioned earlier that we in this part of the island must gain the confidence and trust of the Unionist community.  That is essential.  If that cannot be achieved by politicians, by the public here, then we are going nowhere.  Of course I am talking about the constitutional communities on both sides, whether they be Nationalist or Unionist.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="905" /> As far as the unconstitutional people are concerned, both communities in the North have a great deal to fear and, ultimately, we in the South also have a great deal to fear.  There is no sense in paying lip service to one thing and perhaps doing something else.  There is no sense in holding hands with men of violence or saying behind their backs: well, you know, it was one of the lads or: they did it for Ireland.  They did it for nobody; they achieved nothing and the longer that kind of nonsense continues in this country the worse will be the position and the longer we will be held up to public ridicule before the world, by doing one thing and pretending to mean something else.  I have said before &mdash; and many other people have said in this House and elsewhere &mdash; that surely, at this stage, if we have not learned from our history that that kind of equivocation leads us nowhere, except down the kind of road we have travelled for the past 20 years and from which there is nothing to be gained, we have learned nothing.</P>
    <P>Let us examine just another aspect. Ultimately we all aspire to a united Ireland achieved by constitutional and peaceful means.  In order to be able to do this it is essential that we establish the confidence of the Unionist community and those who are not of our political persuasion.  How do we do this?  As was mentioned by Deputy Shatter, the wearing of the poppy is seen by many people, both North and South, as a way of honouring those who died for a cause.  It may not necessarily be the cause which all of the people in this country subscribe to or all of the people in the North subscribe to but at least they died for a cause. Surely, if we aspire to a united Ireland we must at some stage expect that people of all political and religious persuasions would demand the right to have a day of commemoration and they should be able to commemorate their dead without fear or favour.  How can we expect to establish the confidence of the majority in Northern Ireland at present and inveigle them into a united Ireland if we are not prepared to acknowledge even a small gesture such as the wearing of a flower? <Col N="906" /> Anybody who attempts to so do is regarded as being in some way less than nationalistic, and veiled and not so veiled threats have been made through the media and elsewhere as to the undesirability of anybody going down that road.</P>
    <P>Are we going to say to those people that in the context of a united Ireland there will be one day of national commemoration on which they may honour anyone they wish or are we going to say that there will be one day of commemoration on which, depending upon their persuasion, they will have the right to honour their dead in the way they see fit?  Surely, in a Republic that is something we should aspire to, stand over and guard jealously lest anybody take that right away from either them or us.</P>
    <P>The Anglo-Irish Agreement has been useful and it certainly has not led to an increase in violence even though some people might try to suggest that it has.  A great deal of work still remains to be done.  A great deal can be achieved if the Agreement receives the full support of both Governments.  While I accept that the vision, and I admit it was only a vision, of those who drew up the Agreement, such as Deputy Garret FitzGerald, Deputy Peter Barry, Deputy Dick Spring and the British Government, has not yet been realised I hope that if a further review takes place in three or four years time that perhaps there will be some segments who will believe that at least part of that vision has been realised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughConaghan" hpid="Mr. Conaghan Mr. Conaghan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Conaghan</NameTxt>
      <P>Like all other Deputies I welcome the opportunity of being able to contribute to this debate and I hope the views which I will express this evening reflect the feelings, opinions and attitudes of those who have spoken to me both from my own constitutency and from Northern Ireland.  I suppose it is fair to say that the national question has preoccupied the minds of many Irish people down through the centuries.  One wonders why do the British not leave us in peace and go back to their own country? We have no quarrel with the British people, they are both decent and fair, but <Col N="907" /> in the main, successive British Governments have wrought the most untold misery on the people of this island.  I have no hesitation in saying that since the first British soldier set foot in Ireland there has been nothing but violence, bloodshed, death, persecution, poverty and exile.</P>
      <P>Since 1969 I have seen at first hand rioting, bombings and persecution and I know of many people who were picked up by the police, people who had no involvement, but who happened to be at the wrong place at the wrong time.  In many instances they were brutalised at the hands of a corrupt police force.  I know of many families in my own constituency and in Derry city who are now caring for individuals who could be termed invalids due to the beatings they received at the hands of the police.</P>
      <P>Let me make it quite clear that subversives should be given no quarter in any part of this country, neither should the UDA or paramilitaries from whichever side they come get any quarter.  It is important that our Government should protest at a higher degree to the British Government about the many instances of institutional violence, carried out by the army, the UDR and the police force against Nationalists.  I say this with all sincerity so as to bring to the notice of everyone what this issue is all about.  I believe the Anglo-Irish Agreement contains one important element, namely, that we, as a sovereign Government, can make a case to the British Government on behalf of the Nationalist community in the Six Counties, in the process highlighting any grievances they may have. Other than this I believe that very little has changed.  Violence is still considered to be an acceptable part of life, the police and the army harass the Nationalist community, the courts are seen to be unfair and unjust and the minority community are still considered second class citizens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>After three years one must ask what level of support has the Anglo-Irish Agreement received?  I believe that the most important aspect of the Agreement is that it provides a framework for <Col N="908" /> Nationalists to highlight their grievances and related matters.  On the other hand, we must acknowledge that the Anglo-Irish Agreement is very low on the list of priorities of the British Government.  As far as the British Government are concerned, the only thing that matters is that this is an international agreement which has provided the British Government with a high degree of respectability at international level.  I would suggest to the Government that they as the other partner to the Agreement should highlight at international level the unwillingness of the British Government to push ahead with all aspects of the Agreement.</P>
    <P>In relation to the security aspect, I would like to express my appreciation to the Garda Síochána and to the Defence Forces for the excellent work they have done and are continuing to do in the Border areas.  One might argue as to why we should spend so much on security particularly at a time when money is so scarce, but let me point out that in the Border regions it is vital for the population who reside in those areas that security is maintained at a high degree of efficiency.</P>
    <P>In relation to the economic and social aspects of the Agreement, I would like to say that I am disappointed at the lack of progress.  For those of us who live in County Donegal, particularly east Donegal, the partition of Ireland was both humiliating and exasperating.  Donegal is now practically a geographical and political island because only one main road links it with the rest of the Republic.  The main access roads to County Donegal are from Counties Derry, Tyrone and Fermanagh, about seven in number. These are blocked off by a ring of steel, manned by military personnel.</P>
    <P>Unemployment is a major problem in Nationalist areas, such as Derry, Newry and Strabane.  Despite many efforts cross-Border co-operation has not been accepted by the Northern Ireland authorities. There has been no cross-Border co-operation in relation to agriculture, tourism or industry.  I ask the Government to request Bord Fáilte and the <Col N="909" /> Northern Ireland Tourist Board to get their heads together to draw up a plan to cover the nine counties of Ulster.  At present tourism in Donegal is virtually non-existent by virtue of the fact that we are totally isolated and surrounded by a ring of steel manned by military personnel put there by the British Government. Why, therefore, could a plan not be worked out through the Agreement whereby the tourist boards could at least advertise Ulster holidays in the Republic through Belfast Airport and Larne Harbour.</P>
    <P>Harassment still continues to be a major problem in Nationalist areas.  I can speak of incidents in Derry and Strabane where there is still wholesale harassment despite the many complaints sent to the Northern Ireland Office.  It is common practice for foot patrols to use insulting language to young girls and there seems to be ongoing body searching and stopping of young people in the streets.  I believe this creates the impression among young people that violence may be a better way.  Why should the RUC have insisted on setting up a check point and barricade opposite the police barracks on the Strand Road in Derry.  which disrupted the flow of traffic into the city and badly affected the business of traders in the city centre?  This matter has been under review since last June.  I fail to understand why the Strand Road police station should have been picked from all the police stations in Northern Ireland for preferential treatment such as this at a time when violence was at a very low ebb in the city.  These are the types of situations which the ordinary people in that city have to contend with.  I want to put it on the record that 99 per cent of the people in Derry city are peace loving people but provocation seems to be the order of the day.</P>
    <P>It appears that a code of civil liberties no longer exists.  I am going on information given to me by people from the areas which are affected.  Security forces have the right to break down doors and enter properties and continue to do this. It has come to my attention that when complaints were made to the security <Col N="910" /> forces they claimed that under the Special Emergency Powers Act they had the right to do as they pleased.  How can one have confidence in the security forces or in the administration of justice through the courts when principal witnesses such as members of the police force and the Army have no obligation to give evidence in the courts or at an inquest?</P>
    <P>One must accept that the Nationalist population are sceptical of British justice in relation to its application to Irish men and women.  Some of the happenings in this area during the past couple of years have tended to turn young people away from the democratic process and driven them to support subversive organisations. I think it is fair to say that some of the actions of the British Government have been the best recruiting campaign the Provisional IRA have had.</P>
    <P>Extradition is dealt with under Article 8 of the Agreement and we must accept that extradition goes to the very heart of history.  It is clear that the Government never had any difficulty in signing the European Convention on Terrorism as a general proposition but history imposed on us the necessity to look at Britain differently from all other European countries. Recently a Tory MP said on RTE, with utter arrogance, that unless the Irish Government signed the Extradition Treaty without any alterations the special relationship between Britain and Ireland would be destroyed.  In my view his perception of a special relationship and the Irish view are far apart.  He spoke like a colonial consul talking about a dependent state.  As John Hume rightly pointed out immediately afterwards, this Tory MP spoke as if the Republic was still part of the United Kingdom.  This sort of arrogance was obvious even during the negotiations which resulted in the Anglo-Irish Agreement.  I suppose old habits die hard and some British people have not totally accepted the fact that their overlordship of most of this country has ended.</P>
    <P>Their insensitivity to the reasons for Irish caution and suspicion is boundless. They do not appear to realise that the many problems we have to address in <Col N="911" /> relation to the legislation on extradition have been created by history, by Britain's gory record in Ireland and by the attitude of the British courts and the British police to Irish people.  Any Irish Government who would not seek the safeguards which have been achieved in the extradition legislation would I believe be failing in their duty to Irish people on both sides of the Border.  It is time the British cast away the holier-than-thou attitude with which they seem to clothe themselves when dealing with Ireland or with anything related to the Irish question, and perhaps they should admit that the extradition problems are mainly of their own making.</P>
    <P>With regard to extradition, greater use should be made of the 1976 Criminal Law Jurisdiction Act.  People who perpetrate violent crimes in the name of Ireland and in the name of Irish unity should be severely dealt with, apprehended and made to pay for their violent deeds.  If the rule of law is allowed to break down, then we as democrats will have failed in our duty.</P>
    <P>There is another question which should be addressed through the Anglo-Irish Agreement.  Some relief should be given in relation to the repatriation of prisoners. As Christians we should accept that the fathers and mothers of these unfortunate individuals who are caught up in this terrible conflict should be afforded every opportunity to see their offsprings.</P>
    <P>The framework exists within the Anglo-Irish Agreement to deal with the age-old Irish question.  The facts I have put on the record of the House here tonight are the views held by the people who have to live and eke out their existence in an area about which we in this part of the country have little knowledge and do not realise the difficulties and persecution they have to contend with. Perhaps it is time for some gesture to be made whereby military personnel could be moved back from the frontiers and off the streets of, say, Derry a city which has a peace-loving record.  As I said at the outset 99 per cent of the people in this <Col N="912" /> city would have no hand, act or part in violence.  If the political will is there within the two Governments the Irish question can be settled by peaceful means.  The Anglo-Irish Agreement is the framework under which the objectives can be achieved.  As democrats we must wrest from the men of violence the initiative which perhaps they currently hold to a fair degree.  Our Government must commit themselves to ensuring that the other party to the Agreement, namely the British Government, work towards what they agreed to in the pursuit of justice on this island.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad I was in the House to hear the voice of reason coming from the Government benches, the voice of my colleague from Donegal.  There are so many people in this House and throughout the country who do not have a clue about what the realities are and who are mouthing about this wonderful Anglo-Irish Agreement as if it were the cure-all and end-all for all the problems which exist in our country, particularly in the Northern part of the country.</P>
      <P>It is just three years yesterday since this Agreement was signed and we have heard various speakers today asking what is wrong with it.  I should like some of the people who framed it to set out positively what it has done to improve the lot of our people in those three years.  The Unionists were not consulted in the framing of this Agreement.  Neither was anybody else.  We in this House and people all over the country were not consulted.  A few people put their heads together and somehow came to the conclusion that they were doing something wonderful in making this agreement with Britain to bring about peace in our land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was pointed out to them on the very night the Agreement was signed that there was nothing in the Agreement for the Nationalist people or for this country. It was pointed out that the Agreement contained a clear commitment to do what successive Governments had refused to do from 1977 to that date, this is, to undertake to sign the European Convention for the Suppression of Terrorism. <Col N="913" /> It was recognised by successive Governments from 1977 onwards that implicit in that Convention and our signing of it was the undertaking to extradite our citizens to the jurisdiction of the Six Counties and Great Britain.  For very good reasons over those years the wisdom of our various Governments prevailed and they did not sign the Convention.  However, part of the Agreement was the undertaking by our then Government on behalf of our people, without consulting anybody except themselves, to sign the Convention which had lain there from 1977 to 1985.  As a direct result, we have had the 1986 Extradition Act.  It was not necessary to have it in such an extreme form.  It stemmed directly from the Agreement.  No doubt meetings of the Conference and meetings between the head of this Government and the British Government would have concocted the extreme nature of the Extradition Act which is now on our Statute Book.  It was confirmed in 1987 but enacted in 1986 by the casting vote of the Ceann Comhairle. That is how near it came to not being on our Statute Book.</P>
    <P>The other giveaway in the Agreement was a commitment for greater participation by our Government through the security forces and the Army, securing the Border which we do not want.  We cannot afford to pay the people who are looking after it.  These are the only two positive things that can be pointed out as coming directly from the Agreement.  It was said three years ago that all we were being given was the right to make our protests, suggestions and proposals to this so-called Conference, this get together that has been put together.  The Conference has done nothing since except talk in retrospect about some atrocity and how much more security we should provide at our cost in order to secure the Border we do not want and contain within it, at the mercy of the occupier and their own security forces in the Six Counties, the minority population who have been battered and discriminated against down through the ages.  It has not stopped.  We, if you do not mind, were given the right to protest and make our proposals formally in this Conference.  Without the Conference we <Col N="914" /> would make our protests far more loudly, clearly and spontaneously and with far more effect on international opinion, rather than playing it softly until we have a meeting of the Conference.  Then there is a get together with the British cohorts and their minions and they discuss what happened last week.  Then some agreed statement is issued and Britain's face is saved abroad when she has put her foot in it or put her foot in our face, as she is wont to do so frequently.</P>
    <P>That is not the only thing one must say about the Agreement.  It was opposed by Fianna Fáil at that time.  It was stated with great wisdom and foresight by the present Taoiseach that the Agreement was copperfastening Partition.  Those are the words he used, as I recall.  I do not dispute them.  I agreed with that statement then and I have agreed every day since.  It is true that during the three years the Agreement has aided and abetted the partitioning of our country and the suppression of the viewpoint on this side of the Border that it is right that we should seek the abolition of Partition and the unity of our country.  It has aided and abetted the brainwashing which has gone on for years, particularly since 1975, to make our people believe that Republicanism and Nationalism are no longer noble attributes in the minds of our people but are dirty words, synomyous with subversion.  This has been attained with the willing co-operation, blind it may have been, of successive Governments right up to this day.</P>
    <P>This is not even a discussion.  It is a charade, which is part and parcel of the charade which started three years ago yesterday with the signing of the so-called Hillsborough Agreement, which was supposed to do the devil and all for peace in this land and for the Nationalist people in particular.  It has done sweet damn all for them and they know it.  Those of us who have our eyes open on this side of the Border also know it.  Yet we are to continue with the Agreement and we hear plaintive cries that we should give it a chance.  That was said three years ago. It has had a chance during the past three years and we as a people and as a Government have been kicked in the face and kicked in the ass by Mrs. Thatcher and <Col N="915" /> her Government on every possible occasion.</P>
    <P>We have attained nothing of any benefit to this country.  In particular, we have attained nothing for our Nationalist people in the Six Counties.  The vast bulk of Unionists do not want it either, but for totally different reasons.  Who wants the Agreement?  For whom is it doing something other than Great Britain who concocted it with our own Government in 1985?  How they were misled into believing they were getting something while they were giving something I will never know, but after three years surely they know that nothing has improved.  It would be true to say that lots of things have worsened.  We have extradition which is tearing our people apart, despite the efforts of all and sundry in the Establishment to suppress the views which are anti-extradition to Britain and the Six Counties, and why would they not?</P>
    <P>There was an excuse for the Government in 1985 because they did not realise the full tragedy of what was happening in the Six Counties, but surely to God they are aware of the happenings since then, and especially in the last year and year and a half.  They go traipsing to their Conference meetings, summit meetings, accidental meetings in Brussels, discussing what is happening here and what they will do about it, but whenever Britain can put the boot in she has done so.</P>
    <P>There was the murder of young O'Reilly, the exoneration, after two years, of the soldier who was convicted of murder &mdash; he is back in his unit and we find he was never even taken off the payroll while he was serving his sentence for murder.  There was young McAnespie &mdash; and others who was walking to a football match, still within his own county, and was shot.  There was a big hue and cry here and a big inquiry in the North, but what happened?  Nothing.  We heard he was shot by a ricochet bullet &mdash; as if that made him any less dead &mdash; fired by a British soldier in a pillbox check point in Aughnacloy.  His gun should not have been trained on the road never mind the trigger being pulled.  Then there were the Birmingham Six, a case which has <Col N="916" /> acquired a high profile in the last year or so due to the appeals and the charade of British justice being meted out.  They are still in prison 14 years on.  There are also the Guildford Four, the Maguires and recently the Wiltshire Three, who got 25 years.  I am sure some of the legal Deputies will have read the direction given by the learned gentleman on the bench in that case.  It is worth reading what he said when the jury came back and said they could not agree, but this is only what we can expect.</P>
    <P>We do not seem to realise that we will not get anything from Britain by lying down and letting her walk over us.  She does not think much of us, she never has. She treats us as her minions.  She treats us as her inferiors.  This has always been the case.  The Government of today and the Government of yesterday accept this position.  Never before in our history have we accepted that through our duly elected representatives.  There may have been factions which accepted it and there may have been those who were bruised into accepting it, but never have a freely elected Parliament of our people accepted our second class status <i>vis-á-vis</i> Great Britain who still occupy this country and have not the goddamn notion of leaving it because her plea is backed up by our own well meaning people.  I do not want to attribute anything other than well meaning to even the most daft things people have been doing, because they mean well, but Britain is looking at us and seeing us as she always did, as a lesser people, a lesser race, who deserve less. Now we accept that role in a craven sort of way, thinking that by toadying up to Britain, to Mrs. Thatcher and her Government &mdash; it does not matter a damn whether Mrs. Thatcher is there because no matter who is in power their outlook will not change&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this debate on the Anglo-Irish Agreement.  Like most Members of this House, I would hope that in time we would achieve, with the co-operation of both traditions in the North, the solution set out in the New Ireland Forum for this island of ours. However, we must realise the difficulties in the path to that solution posed by the legacy of history and the violence of the last 20 years.</P>
      <P>The Anglo-Irish Agreement, while it fell short of what we had hoped for, did provide potential for advance, a framework on which the two sovereign Governments, in consultation, could work towards eliminating obstacles to peace and harmony between the two traditions. It was felt that the establishment of evenhanded treatment of both traditions resulting in peaceful conditions would in time open the way, hopefully, towards the ideal solution.</P>
      <P>Now, three years after the introduction of the Anglo-Irish Agreement, it is right and proper that we should look critically at what the Agreement has achieved.  My immediate response, while acknowledging some achievement, is to express grave concern at the limited level of that achievement.  While the very existence of the Agreement and the presence of the Secretariat at Maryfield give a certain reassurance to the Nationalist people in the North, much more substantial results must be achieved before the main bulk of the Nationalist people could be induced to have full confidence in the process of law and order and in equal job opportunities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As we know from the past, it is not enough to set up bodies such as the Fair Employment Agency, but those bodies must be made to work.  My parish straddles the Border and I have viewed with concern the Northern situation over the years.  Two areas which gave rise to great concern were the unfair allocation of jobs and the unfair allocation of houses.  It is <Col N="918" /> accepted that the Nationalists get two and half times fewer jobs than the other tradition.  For many years there was great concern about housing.  The Housing Executive was set up and transformed the housing scene in the North.  They built many housing schemes and I think most people would agree there has been a fair allocation of houses since the National Housing Executive was set up. I believe we have to get that same type of even-handedness into the job area and this must be a priority.</P>
    <P>In making my criticism of the lack of adequate results from the Agreement, I am making due allowance for the very substantial resistance to the Agreement whipped up by a number of Unionist leaders.  Many different tactics were adopted, including open threats of violent action.  However, that level of extreme opposition seems to have lost its momentum and we can hopefully look to some more mature Unionists being willing to enter into debate on how their views can be heard and given cognisance in the process.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that the Unionists and their friends in the Conservative Party in Britain, having failed to have the Agreement either suspended or scrapped, would now seem to be concentrating on rendering the Agreement ineffective in achieving change.  Failure over a period to achieve worthwhile change in law and order, job opportunities and so on would mean that the Nationalist population would not support the Agreement although the vast majority have high hopes for it.  No further time must be lost in getting down to work with the co-chairman to achieve improvements in conditions for the Nationalist people, which they are entitled to expect from the conference but of which they have received little to date.  I appeal to the Minister not to allow his co-chairman to use the Anglo-Irish Agreement as a committee on security which, to a great extent, it has been to date.  It must be made clear that the violence is only a symptom of the problem and that action must be taken on the underlying problems.</P>
    <P>Many people mentioned security <Col N="919" /> which is a very important feature on both sides of the Border.  I congratulate the Army and the Garda on the high level of success they achieved &mdash; and are still achieving &mdash; in seizure of bomb making equipment, guns, etc.  However, the news over the last few days must give rise to concern because there has been a move southwards from the North and a movement northwards from the South of bomb-making equipment and an arsenal of guns and ammunition.  It is also a matter of great concern to me, representing the Cavan-Monaghan constituency, to learn that a map of County Monaghan has also been seized.  It suggests that the people in possession of it did not have the best of intentions.</P>
    <P>We can hold our heads high on this side of the Border so far as security is concerned.  People are continually critical of the amount of money spent on security but it is required for our citizens in Border areas.  In the early seventies, snatch squads came across the Border, there were security men in unmarked vans and bombing incidents in my own constituency with many people killed.  At that time people were very anxious to increase the security in the area and the news today concerning the equipment and map reinforces the need for it.</P>
    <P>Article 10 deals with the international fund and one cannot but be critical of the slow rate of progress in disbursing these funds.  The initial allocation of funding was very unbalanced.  I wrote to Mr. Charles Brett, chairman of the committee, outlining my views.  I pointed out that it was important to have an even handed allocation of the funds in the southern counties along the Border.  He replied and assured me that he would insist on a fair distribution of funds.</P>
    <P>Many speakers mentioned cross-Border co-operation and this is an area in which both sides have fallen down because, despite various committees, progress has been slow.  I was a member of the Erne catchment committee for many years.  They dealt with economic developments and a number of their reports identified areas in need of assistance.  A social and economic committee of the EC also clearly identified disadvantaged <Col N="920" /> areas in a severely disadvantaged region. However, very little has been done to eliminate the problem.  We suggested linking the Erne and Shannon waterways. There were other suggestions, such as demonstration units on the Border and pilot schemes in poultry production but none of them ever came to fruition.  They did not get the political and financial assistance they deserved.  I hope, in regard to this fund, that more emphasis will be placed on disadvantaged areas, North and South of the Border, that they will be identified and seen as flagships in the development of the areas.</P>
    <P>It has often been suggested that in pressing for more results from the Anglo-Irish Agreement we are moving at too fast a pace.  Rapid movement to deal with injustices, such as discrimination against the Nationalist population in regard to jobs, for example, is essential if more young Nationalists are not to become the prey of the paramilitaries.  The financing of jobs should be put into operation as quickly as possible.  When injustices have taken place for over 60 years, development proposals will take time to tease out but there must be energetic and urgent action to stamp out such injustice.  That is the first area to which we should apply ourselves.</P>
    <P>Article 8 of the Agreement deals with legal matters.  If confidence is to be restored in the courts system in the North, the British will have to agree to the suggestion of a three judge court.  The SDLP and their supporters have worked hard to make the Agreement work.  John Hume, Seamus Mallon and their colleagues have had to bear the brunt of the burden and we owe it to them to make the Anglo-Irish Agreement work effectively. If the Agreement reaches its potential it could well be a major turning point in the affairs of this island.  However, if it continues to concentrate almost exclusively on security matters and fails to achieve results in regard to policing, the elimination of harassment, a fairer court system and equality of opportunity and employment, it will have failed and the future of the North and the people of this island will be black.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this opportunity to speak to the House on an historic occasion, the third anniversary of the signing into law of a momentous and historic agreement.</P>
      <P>I do not share the sentiments of the speaker prior to Deputy Leonard, Deputy Blaney, in relation to his total dismissal of the Agreement as being nothing other than a charade.  I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Agreement, we have had a very constructive debate and a considerable, pragmatic and reasoned input from all sides of the House.  As a result of the debate we have heard in this House, nothing other than the good of constitutional democracy will have been served by the manner in which people have addressed the House.  Would that we could go back on the records of the House of this week three years ago. As has already been alluded to by Deputy Blaney, there is a marked contrast in the responsible attitude now coming from the Government benches as distinct from the attitude emanating from the then Opposition benches in terms of hostile reaction to what was obviously the signing into law and bringing into being of a significant measure and an advance in relation to Anglo-Irish relations on this island.</P>
      <P>The reactions in the press during the past week &mdash; they have mulled in their editorials and their articles in relation to the merits of the Agreement &mdash; have been varied.  They have varied from the extreme opposition expressed in the <i>Belfast Telegraph</i> to the more receptive, reasoned, logical appraisal of the Agreement in the editorials South of the Border.  What people tend to do is to adjudicate on the merits of the Agreement in terms of bald questioning, by way of a naked interrogative such as, is it working.  It depends on what your perspective is in relation to the Agreement but I honestly believe that it is working.  The Agreement is an accord between two sovereign powers in relation to how they would jointly see their attitudes to and roles in a troubled corner which we would claim to be part of our jurisdiction and which Britain would claim to be their jurisdictional right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Agreement is working and statistics have shown that.  The Anglo-Irish <Col N="922" /> Conference has met on 22 occasions.  The occasions of the meeting of the Conference have been too infrequent indeed. What we have to do is to see what is in place.  In Maryfield and Hillsborough there is a permanent Secretariat and a permanent civil service in place working together on a joint co-operative basis. There is a Conference which can be, and has been, called together at very short notice in order to resolve differences or to reach mutual agreement in relation to how the various difficulties confronting the Agreement and the parties to the Agreement should be resolved.</P>
    <P>There is more than that involved in the Conference.  It is a significant breakthrough when three Ministers of a Government here can board an Army Air Corps helicopter in Baldonnel, fly across the Border, touch down in Belfast and say: &ldquo;We are here by right; we are here thanks to the Anglo-Irish Agreement, signed in November 1985, which has put in place and copperfastened once and for all the right of the sovereign Government of the South of Ireland to a say in relation to how Northern Affairs, Nationalist affairs and interests, should be handled in the North of Ireland.</P>
    <P>In years to come when we detach ourselves on an objective basis in relation to the merits of this Agreement this nation will thank the people on this side of the Border whose foresight, idealism and vision achieved the heretofore seemingly impossible, that is, the bringing of Great Britain to the Conference table in order to sign, once and for all, an international agreement to underpin minority rights in the North of Ireland.  We owe an everlasting debt to the people who had the foresight, the vision and indeed the mutual trust of Great Britain to make that possible &mdash; they are Deputies Garret FitzGerald, Peter Barry and Dick Spring.</P>
    <P>The record of this side of the House in relation to underpinning minority rights in the North of Ireland has been a proud one.  The record of this side of the House in relation to the handling of Anglo-Irish Affairs has been a proud one indeed.  It was this party when in Government from 1973 to 1977 &mdash; you, a Cheann Comhairle, were a member of one of the parties <Col N="923" /> to that Coalition &mdash; who signed the Sunningdale Agreement, an Agreement which in terms of its achievement should be seen against the backdrop of the previous 50 years.  Who would ever have said that it would have been possible to bring together, on the one hand, Brian Faulkner who epitomised Unionist intransigence heretofore in the North of Ireland, and, on the other hand, Liam Cosgrave as the head of the sovereign Government in the South, to sit at a conference table, work out an agreement, a power sharing partnership in the North of Ireland involving the Social Democratic and Labour Party and the Unionist Party, sharing power in all aspects of life in the North of Ireland with the exception of security?</P>
    <P>That agreement, if it had been persisted with, seen through and underwritten with the same spirit as it was entered into in terms of the confrontation of the Unionist bully boys in the North of Ireland and particularly the Ulster Workers' Council strike, if it had not been capitulated to by the Labour Government in the British Parliament, would have led to an elimination of much of the bloodshed that has been so characteristic of the tragedy of Northern Ireland since then.  It was this party, as a major component in the Coalition Government from 1973 to 1977, that made that possible. Again, it was the vision, the foresight and the idealism of this side of the House that brought together all the strands of opinion in the North and the South of Ireland in relation to the sharing and pooling of their input, knowledge, resources and views in the form of the New Ireland Forum.</P>
    <P>It is wrong for Deputy Blaney to say that there was not consultation.  The hand of friendship was extended.  An open invitation was extended to the Unionists of all shades in the North of Ireland, to all religious and ethnic groups and to all people in all groups, diverse and otherwise, in the South of Ireland to come together and to put their views rationally before the New Ireland Forum in an effort to reach consensus.  Who would have said in the wake of the out, out, out derisory comments of the British Prime <Col N="924" /> Minister in relation to the New Ireland Forum that it would have been possible to achieve the Anglo-Irish Agreement? Yet, against such a backdrop and such a political landscape it was achieved.  It was achieved because of the persistence, the idealism and the commitment of the Taoiseach of the day, Deputy Garret FitzGerald.</P>
    <P>While there is a change of nuances and a change of emphasis in relation to which aspects of the Agreement are of more paramount importance to the two partners in the Agreement, Great Britain and ourselves &mdash; Britain has a security emphasis and we have our own particular emphasis on this side of the Border &mdash; the Agreement is working.  We have managed to lay aside 700 years of tribal bitterness between the two countries and to jointly act as custodians to an Agreement which has the potential, the components and the necessary capacity to resolve the problems in the North of Ireland by first of all ensuring that peace is restored to that troubled corner of our island.</P>
    <P>The Agreement has the potential.  The fact that it is not working is not the fault of the administrations on either side of the Border, although we on this side of the House would like to see a greater commitment, a greater lack of ambivalence, a more wholehearted resolve and a clear categorical statement in relation to where the present Government lie in regard to the long term future of the Anglo-Irish Agreement.  The Tánaiste's references in the House today went a considerable way towards underpinning the faith of the Government side of the House in the Anglo-Irish Agreement.</P>
    <P>At the same time the Tánaiste seemed to cast doubts on the merits and the efficacy of the Agreement.  He said: &ldquo;That is why all supporters of the Agreement must be sobered by findings which show that only a minority of Nationalists in Northern Ireland feel that the Agreement has made a difference to their daily lives&rdquo;.  Yet the next paragraph would seem to contradict that.  The Tánaiste went on to elucidate at some considerable length the achievements of the Agreement such as improved policing of the marching season.  Surely that, in terms of <Col N="925" /> the perspective of the ordinary Nationalist in the North of Ireland, has made a significant difference in relation to his tolerance of the marching season when heretofore he looked with fear and trepidation at the intimidation that invariably occurred, particularly in relation to the Nationalist community in the North of Ireland.  The elimination of the supergrass trials, the introduction of a new code of conduct for the RUC and what we hope will come on stream shortly, the beginning of an economic programme for west Belfast, all in their own way are significant measures which will alleviate greatly the problems and the siege mentality of the minority community in the North.</P>
    <P>Would that the Agreement had been launched on the same unanimous note as we have in this House today.  Deputy Blaney has rightly recalled the allegations from the then Leader of the Opposition that we were copperfastening partition. We saw the typical, ruthless hell-for-leather opposition in relation to the Agreement then as we saw in the stance of that party in opposition on economic affairs.  Doubts as to the constitutionality of the Agreement were cast by the present Taoiseach, Leader of the then Opposition, which were very much a continuation of the man's attitude to the New Ireland Forum.  The ink was hardly dry on the Forum report when major doubts were expressed regarding the various formulae put forward to solve the problems on this island.  Of course, we had the unprecedented measure when the deputy leader of the party was dispatched overseas in order to play down or sabotage the Agreement.  Thank God we are now unanimous on all sides of the House about the Agreement.</P>
    <P>At the end of the day if the Agreement is going to work its devolution aspect is of essence and importance.  Some power sharing local assembly, not a reincarnation of Stormont, should be put in place.  That will require compromise and common sense and a certain yielding by both sides.  For that to take place it is quite obvious, as the Leader of this party has said, that we will have to have a more regular schedule of conference meetings and greater dialogue, and we must show <Col N="926" /> the Unionist community in the North that we do not threaten their existence or identity but that we have genuinely at the core of this Agreement their care and concern.</P>
    <P>I ask the Government please to put their policy on the table once and for all in relation to the Anglo-Irish Agreement, to have a Northern policy and express it without ambivalence.  The centrepiece and major platform on which policy must stand is the Anglo-Irish Agreement of which we in the House this evening joyfully celebrate the third anniversary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. B. O'Keeffe Mr. B. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important to place on the record of the House this Government's commitment to what is an international Agreement.  Since we came into office there has never been any doubt that this Government were going to follow through on arrangements which had an international standing.  It is quite unfair of Deputy Higgins to cast any aspersions on any of the doings of this Government in relation to the Agreement.</P>
      <P>In addressing myself to the review let me say that, three years on, there is major responsibility on political entities in the North to admit that a containment policy is no longer feasible, that a much broader outlook must be taken in the interest of people of all affiliations to mark the way forward.  The millstone of inactivity in the political sphere, nurtured through what I would term implacable stubbornness, has meant violence that has ruined co-operation and goodwill among all shades of opinion in the Northern part of our country. The fact now that both Governments have agreed on the maintenance of the Agreement must be accepted by all. There is a great onus on the Northern Unionists to come in, as it were, out of the cold and accept that invitation, which is genuine and sincere, and have a significant input into this whole democratic process.  Surely the lessons learned from non-participation have served only to continue the misery felt by all persons in Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the security area this Government have done everything possible to hold up their side of the bargain.  We have heard <Col N="927" /> today from Deputy Gerry Collins, Minister for Justice, that we will spend this year £172 million on security connected with Northern Ireland.  That, by the way, is four times <i>per capita</i> greater than what Britain spends on the same thing.  This is an indication on the part of the Government that they are determined to stamp out terrorism that would do damage to our democratic institutions.  We should remember that all of this is at a time of major financial constraints, and we should not be begrudging in this regard. After all, we are dealing with people in Northern Ireland who are our very own and whom we claim to be our very own.</P>
    <P>Let me also take this opportunity to congratulate the Garda, the Army and the Minister himself who, under extreme intimidation initiated or carried out searches throughout the length and breadth of this country after the <i>Eksund</i> find in the full knowledge that democracy in this State was being threatened by subversives. It is a matter of great satisfaction to our legal custodians that they have unearthed 850 firearms, 190,000 rounds of ammunition and 5,000 lbs. of homemade explosives, clearly demonstrating to all and sundry the extraordinary success subversives were having in terms of infiltration.</P>
    <P>Let me come to extradition and pose a question.  Is it not interesting that no case has been brought under the 1987 Act? To me at any rate this suggests that the safeguards brought in by this Government must be working and that the British authorities have not been presenting the type of evidence necessary for such cases to be successful.  Surely everybody must be satisfied that this Act is such a major improvement on its 1965 counterpart.</P>
    <P>The time has come now for the British authorities to recognise the scope offered under the criminal law jurisdiction legislation because of the obvious lack of belief in the 26 Counties that Irish citizens would get fair play in Britain or, indeed, in Northern Ireland.  I take this opportunity to suggest to Mrs. Thatcher's Government that at a time of review she would examine again the cases of the Guildford Four and Birmingham Six and <Col N="928" /> let us for once see that leniency can be applied in cases where conviction was gained under very clouded circumstances.</P>
    <P>I consider that I have a right to say to the British Government that this Fianna Fáil Government have been most forthcoming in meeting the demands placed on them through the Anglo-Irish Conference. However, there is still a major element of dissatisfaction on my part and on the part of many more in this country at the harassment suffered by Irish people at the hands of British forces.  I understand that 90 per cent of all complaints to the Secretariat in Belfast relate specifically to harassment.  Surely the time has come for a response from the British side.  Does it not raise the possibility that there is a problem with specific units of the Army and sections of the RUC?  Is it not possible to pinpoint those groupings, to isolate them and have the necessary corrective action taken against them by the British?  Have we in the South, and the Nationalist population in general, not the right to feel outraged at the shooting of young McAnespie in cold blood on his way to a match and the contrasting freeing of a convicted British soldier, surely grounds for us here in the South to say that there is one law for one side of the population in the North and another law for what they term one of their own?</P>
    <P>One cannot hope to raise confidence in the British administration of justice with such abominations manifesting themselves.  They serve only to help the recruitment drive by the IRA.  It is not surprising therefore that, according to the PSI study, 38 per cent of all Catholics lack confidence in the fairness of Northern Ireland courts in dealing with Catholics. This study should also provide the impetus to restore confidence in the courts.  We must reiterate the need for reform of the Diplock Courts and ensure the introduction of the three judge court for jurisprudence balance.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that progress will soon be reported in relation to fair employment, but here again I suggest that it is necessary to establish a monitoring arrangement for public and private companies to ensure that they adhere to an agreed <Col N="929" /> formula with heavy penalties for those who transgress.</P>
    <P>Economic activity is a necessary adjunct to the establishment of confidence in Northern Ireland.  I want to congratulate the Tánaiste on the major emphasis he is placing at the conference on having funds disbursed into unemployment black spots which are inhabited predominantly by Catholics.  This is a process which must continue because there is no doubt that there is a relationship between unemployment and maladjusted behaviour.</P>
    <P>I will be brief because I want to allow my colleague Deputy Dick Roche in.  The review provides an excellent opportunity to carry forward the work of reform and political progress in Northern Ireland. We are fortunate that spearheading our negotiations is the Tánaiste who must be one of the most able and affable negotiators that this country has seen.  We can look forward with pride and hope, in the knowledge that our negotiations are in safe hands.</P>

      <P>While I am pleased with many of the speeches I have heard, I am disappointed with some.  I find it difficult to understand why Deputies continually make this a British-Irish issue, because it is no longer that.  The issue is not whether the Anglo-Irish Agreement is good or bad.  It is in place; it is signed by two sovereign Governments.  The challenge now is to get people in the North to agree to it, to get the Protestant leaders in the North to agree to it.  If we cannot do that we will make no headway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The bitterness expressed by southern politicians, Catholic politicians, makes no contribution towards progress.  It is driving Protestant people and politicians in the opposite direction.  Unless we put out the hand of friendship to get Protestant people to see that their future is to <Col N="930" /> try to establish peace on this island, to try to work the Anglo-Irish Agreement, we will get nowhere.  We cannot get them to work the Anglo-Irish Agreement if they are against it.  I am at a loss to understand why Government members continually drag the British Government into this when the British Government and the Irish Government entered into an international agreement to try to resolve the problems of Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>We pretend here that there are things called nationalism and unionism, loyalism and republicanism.  The whole world sees the Irish conflict as Catholic and Protestant.  It is not about religion. It is not about the faith we all believe in as Catholics or the faith that we believe in as Protestants.  It has nothing at all to do with religion.  It certainly has to do with intolerant Catholics and intolerant Protestants locked in a bitter sectarian conflict.  That is what it is about in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>If only we could get out of the world of make believe and understand that there is no such thing as republicanism.  Whatever it was meant to mean in the past, it no longer means that; it means Catholic.  It is the same with nationalism.  There is no such thing as nationalism any more.  The Protestants see republicanism and nationalism as Catholic conquest just as we see unionism and loyalism as Protestant supremacy and that is what it is all about.</P>
    <P>When I addressed a cross-section of the community at the first Lisburn Presbyterian Church Hall, County Antrim, I outlined my views on the position of Northern Ireland.  I said that whatever about the past, the present conflict is not between Ireland and Great Britain.  If it was, the British Prime Minister and the Taoiseach would not be co-operating as they are through the Anglo-Irish Agreement. Politicians in Dáil Éireann and Westminster would not have the close rapport which we know exists and which both sides value.  The Irish would not be welcome, or hold such an exceptional status in Great Britain.  It would not be possible for them to go there without a passport or visa, get employment without a work permit, qualify for health and social security services without reference <Col N="931" /> to nationality, be considered for rehousing if there is a family need and, having become resident, qualify to vote, stand for public office and get elected to parliament. Neither would it be possible for large numbers of Irish students to attend universities in Great Britain, and the totality of relations of which we speak would have no meaning.</P>
    <P>British-Irish history has been unfortunate and at times brutally violent.  We have been guilty of terrible deeds to each other &mdash; I would claim that the Irish were mostly on the receiving end &mdash; but who was most to blame is academic.  The fact is that the present political unrest in Northern Ireland is not really British-Irish, but a bitter sectarian conflict between intolerant Catholics and intolerant Protestants who have lost touch with the teaching of Christ and with their own churches.  Undoubtedly some Irish see the conflict as a political struggle but the outside world sees it as Catholics and Protestants killing each other with the British Government wanting out and the British Army trapped in the middle unable to extricate itself.  There is, of course, a popular opinion that there will be no peace in Ireland until the British Army go, but by the same argument they cannot go until there is peace.  Surely there is a message in this for the men of violence.  Just who is keeping the British Army engaged in Northern Ireland? There is another opinion that the British Army is using the violence of the IRA to train teenage soldiers in guerrilla combat, which may be good for the British Army, but bad for community relations and should stop.</P>
    <P>Whatever the words unionism-loyalism nationalism-republicanism were meant to mean they now spell Protestant and Catholic.  Catholics see unionism and loyalism as Protestant supremacy.  Protestants see nationalism and republicanism as Catholic conquest.  We cannot deny nor can we ignore that a strong expression of being Protestant and being Catholic runs constant through Irish society.  Subconsciously and with unnoticed regularity people in both traditions interchange the words Catholic-Nationalist-Republican and, of course, <Col N="932" /> Protestant-Unionist-Loyalist.  When we speak it is not about Protestants, but Loyalists who are in jail; it is Catholics not Nationalists or Republicans who are discriminated against; it is Protestants not Unionists or Loyalists who work in the shipyards.  We talk about Protestant ghettoes and Catholic ghettoes &mdash; the population head-counts are about the number of Protestants and the number of Catholics.  It is Catholic and Protestant candidates who get votes in elections. The votes may have a choice between political parties, but only inside their own tradition &mdash; there are exceptions, but far too few.</P>
    <P>When I, accompanied by my wife, placed a wreath recently where eight teenage soldiers were killed, some people asked was I right?  The answer is a most emphatic yes because what is morally right can never be politically wrong and it also follows that what is morally wrong can never be politically right.  It is Christian teaching that it is immoral to kill a human being, it does not matter who that person is or what nationality or religion they are.  The uniforms they wear or who they work for does not alter the immorality of killing.  Those who kill and destroy have lost sight of the immorality of their deeds and those who support, condone, excuse or conveniently ignore those deeds, share in the immorality of the acts. I cannot understand how churchmen on both sides can be selective in their condemnation of the immorality of killing. It seems that people in uniforms or people out of uniforms or boy-soldiers on a bus, are all legitimate targets and that it is not immoral to kill or destroy them.</P>
    <P>If the killing of a human being is not immoral then nothing is immoral and if churchmen of all denominations do not get that message across, the entire teaching of the Christian way of life is in serious danger.  Churchmen, successors of the Apostles, preachers of the same Gospels, followers of the same Christ, Worshippers of one God, must condemn without equivocation the immorality of killing and the destruction of human life.  Their condemnation must be totally explicit, uncompromising and unreservedly final. Those who are involved in violence must be put in no doubt that the killing of a <Col N="933" /> human being, no matter who he is, what he does, or how he is dressed is immoral and that there are no exceptions.</P>
    <P>As a Catholic I am calling on the leaders of my Church to leave the Protestant community in no doubt as to where the Catholic Church stands on the immorality of killing.  As a Christian I am calling on the leaders of the Protestant Churches to take more seriously that element of religious bigotry which lies at the root of sectarianism, which, in turn, produces sectarian politics resulting in sectarian murder.  I solemnly believe, because of the religious dimension, that clergy of all churches have a more important role to play in finding solutions than is generally acknowledged.  Politicians of all parties are politically impotent without their collective input and the people are calling out for good leadership and an end to violence.</P>
    <P>Political leadership, however, is about more than stating one's own position and in the threatening and worsening circumstances of Northern Ireland.  I wonder just what is the morality of the present political deadlock where politicians refuse or decline to seek solutions which could start a process which would bring violence to an end.  Is it morally right to continue to refuse to enter into political dialogue with democratically elected Governments and elected representatives of the people when we all know that this year has been more violent than last year and that the next year, in the nature of things, is going to be no better?  It might be politically popular not to have dialogue, it might be a political strategy, but in my view it is morally wrong.  Elected leaders cannot and should not allow themselves to be vetoed by the actions of others.  In my statement when I placed the wreath I appealed to elected leaders of the Protestant community to step forward and speak with me.  I am repeating that appeal tonight. I will go to their homes, to their offices, to their party headquarters, to their Protestant halls, to meet and speak with them about peace on this island and our future together.  If we can learn to trust each other nothing is impossible.</P>
    <P>If there are people engaged in violence who sincerely believe, as I think they do, <Col N="934" /> that their involvement is a noble cause in pursuit of a united Ireland can I say to them, Ireland is not ready for uniting, if it was ready Protestant people in Northern Ireland would want to join us.  That is not the case and it is unlikely that they will consider unity until Catholic Ireland can create a society with which they can identify, and, hopefully join.</P>
    <P>When I made that speech last week in the First Lisburn Presbyterian Church Hall I was well received and congratulated on trying to reason with what is happening in Northern Ireland.  I was disappointed to hear Members referring to Britain and Ireland.  This is not about Britain and Ireland.  For God's sake, after 20 years of violence and almost 3,000 deaths, surely we can get it into the back of our heads that it is about sectarianism. We are not making a contribution by pretending that we are good Republicans or good Nationalists.  We are Catholics, Irish Catholics.  Unfortunately, there are people in the North of Ireland who call themselves Unionist and Loyalists but they are not Unionists nor Loyalists, they are Protestants.  Until the Catholic and the Protestant Churches come together and try to iron out these terrible difficulties I see no future for the politicians on this island.</P>
    <P>I sincerely believe, following the many talks I have had with Protestant councillors in Northern Ireland, that increasingly more and more of them are seeing that the only solution to the problem in Ireland is the Anglo-Irish Agreement.  I have been told by good Protestant people that it has never been given a chance. During the seventies, as spokesman for my party, I continually made the point to British politicians that they made a mistake of reading the Irish position as being friends and foes and by looking on the Catholic tradition which I come from as being enemies.  I pointed out to them that hundreds of thousands of our people had gone to Britain, had married and settled there and were good citizens. Enemies do not do that.  Whatever else we are not enemies.  I pointed out to those politicians that tens of thousands of our people had joined their air force, their army and navy and that many of them had fought and died for them. <Col N="935" /> Enemies do not do things like that. However, I pointed out to them that we had an objection to the policies they pursued in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>In my view the Anglo-Irish Agreement got the British Government into a neutral position.  I must ask myself, was my Government as neutral as I would like them to be or as neutral as the Protestant people would like them to be?  I must ask, are the present Government as neutral as they should be seen to be by the Protestant community?  I will leave those questions with the House.</P>
    <P>Last week when Gay Byrne announced that he was going to wear a simple poppy, an emblem, all hell broke loose down here and people phoned him and said the most objectionable things.  That was terrible.  It was terrible that when the Pope said he intended visiting Ireland the Loyalist voice said, &ldquo;do not come here.&rdquo; That was sectarianism in its extreme.  A similar attitude was expressed by those who opposed the wearing of a poppy; sectarianism in the extreme.  I was listening to extreme Catholic opinion, not republican opinion.  When we do not wear a poppy we forget some of the great men of this country who fought in defence of small nations.  Fr. Willie Doyle, a Jesuit from this city, received outstanding recognition for acts of bravery but we have forgotten about him.  We have forgotten about Thomas Kettle, one of our literary geniuses.  We have forgotten about Willie Redmond, a member of parliament, and the hundreds of others who lost their lives, including people from Donegal.  What is the difference between young soldiers who fought in the First World War for what they thought was right and our soldiers who serve with the UN today?  It can be argued that the circumstances are different but how different?  In my view there is no difference except that we are a bigoted people unable to realise that those who died in the 1914-18 war were doing what they thought was right.  I should like to pay tribute to three I knew who fought in the Second World War, Danny and Jimmy Kelly, brothers who lost their lives fighting as navy men, and Willie Morrison, a local carpenter.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="936" /> If the expression of public opinion is echoed by the protests about wearing a poppy, and if that is how far we have come after 20 years of violence, then I despair.  I want to say here and now that next year I will invite Deputies of this House to wear a poppy to respect the people who died in the First and Second World Wars.  It seems terribly strange that we can pay respects to the German sailors and airmen who are buried in our soil and whose bodies were either washed up on our beaches or who crash-landed here.  It is right that we should pay our respects to them but it is very difficult to understand why we can do that with foreigners and we cannot pay our respects to Irishmen who fought for the cause which they believed in.</P>

    <P>I would like to address a few comments to some Deputies who made comments regarding Government attitudes towards the Anglo-Irish Agreement.  It is true that this party expressed reservations regarding certain aspects of the Agreement in 1985.  However, it is blatantly and absolutely untrue that the Government are in any way equivocated with regard to the Agreement.  Untruths, when they are repeated, do not improve, the remain untruths.  Between November 1985 and March 1987 when there was a change in Government there were nine meetings of the Inter-Governmental Conference and there were two separate meetings of ministerial sub-groups.  In the interim period since then there have been 13 meetings. The frequency of meetings has been greater during the period of this Government's term of office.  I wish those facts could sink into the heads of some Deputies opposite.  While I do not doubt their <Col N="937" /> sincerity regarding the Agreement I question the wisdom of their continuously peddling an untruth regarding the Agreement.</P>
    <P>The review of the Agreement now under way affords us the opportunity to redirect and to refocus the institutions and the processes that it has established. In the opening years the emphasis was on security.  Security, while still a priority, is by no means the only priority now.  The agenda for the Agreement must be broadened considerably.  It is my personal belief that the highest single item on the agenda must be the building of confidence.  From our side we have delivered on the security elements of the Agreement.  We can now call on the other party to the Agreement to deliver on the confidence building side.  In Northern Ireland confidence must be built up and, in particular, in the institutions of justice.</P>
    <P>The single judge courts of Northern Ireland are an aberration.  They cause disquiet even within the British Governmental system.  People who are interested in civil liberties not just in this island but on our closest island and elsewhere are concerned about the Diplock Courts. They are not trusted by the Nationalists and they never will be, that is an unfortunate fact of life.  The unfortunate requirement of special courts is well understood by us on this part of this island.  The model of three judge courts which we have adopted could well be studied by the Northern Ireland authorities. At another level confidence needs to be built in the forces of law and order. This can only exist when they are no longer perceived as instruments of harassment or repression.  The facts are that the forces of law and order &mdash; they may just be ordinary boy soldiers &mdash; may be cast in a role which they do not wish but amongst the Nationalist population they are seen to operate as forces of harassment and repression.  There is a vital need for measures to redress the complaints that exist and to ensure that the reason for complaint would be brought to a halt.</P>
    <P>The early release of Corporal Thain some months ago threw into sharp focus the tragic plight of SOSP, Secretary of State prisoners, in Northern Ireland &mdash;<Col N="938" /> both Unionist and Nationalist.  Many of those were involved in crime &mdash; some were involved in hideous crime &mdash; at a very early age.  They entered jail in their teenage years and are now into their thirties. The most rankling injustice amongst these prisoners and their families is not the interminable nature of their sentences but a review system that is frequently difficult to fathom.  I have met the parents and families of some of these prisoners.  They are quiet people who want to live their lives in peace.  They have had enough of violence and they want to be given the opportunity to put the violence behind them but they cannot do so given the position of their sons.  I hope we will see progress here soon as this is one of the things that prop up division in society in Northern Ireland.  I hope that progress will be recorded soon.</P>
    <P>There are other issues in the area of justice, for example, the extraordinary scenes at the inquest which is now taking place in Northern Ireland and the continuing open sore of the Stalker-Sampson affair.  These are events which should not be happening and which should never have happened.  Confidence could be built with improvements outside this island too.  The case of the Guildford Four has been mentioned and it is a case in which I take a particular interest.  It has been allowed to drag on.  Deputy McCartan, other Members of this House and myself met with the Secretary of State 12 months ago.  Eight months ago the Secretary of State received the report on this case and yet progress has not been as rapid as we would have hoped.  We all pray &mdash; because this matter bears heavily on us &mdash; that this long delay is indicative that something positive will happen in that regard.</P>
    <P>The Birmingham Six case was also referred to here tonight.  Those people are not looking for clemency or pardon but for justice.  The intemperate, ill-considered and untimely political intervention during the course of the Winchester trial illustrates the need for greater British sensitivity in all of these issues.  In relation to the Gibraltar affair in which there was extraordinary public interest and the trial by media which was carried on was damaging to progress in <Col N="939" /> this island.  The British establishment should at this stage come to the realisation that their every action impacts on events here.  Their actions should be more measured and in future they should think more of the impact of any pronouncement that they make.</P>
    <P>I sometimes wonder at the advice which is made available to British Ministers dealing with the extradition issue. Since 1985 there has been an unwarranted focus on extradition proceedings by the British authorities.  Each major case affords people who have no interest in peace or justice &mdash; or, indeed, no interest in the people who are being extradited and who are at the centre of these events &mdash; unlimited scope for propaganda and publicity.  These are foolish proceedings when there is an alternative which is acceptable and available.  The Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Act should be more frequently used.  I understand that the previous Taoiseach gave unwise undertakings in this matter in Downing Street in November 1985.  If this is the case he did none of us any great favours. I am pleased that the use of the Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Act will be considered within the wide scope of the review.  I sincerely hope that more sense will prevail in future cases.</P>
    <P>I have not yet mentioned the Unionists and their role in this affair.  I listened with sincerity to the views put forward by Deputy Harte because I believe he speaks with sincerity on all these issues. Deputy John Kelly spoke recently of a Unionist De Gaulle and their need for a Unionist De Gaulle.  De Gaulle resolved the Algerian problems by setting a date for France's withdrawal.  There were French Unionists with only a &ldquo;non&rdquo; in their vocabulary ranged against him. Deputy Kelly may well have got the simile right but I think his geography is questionable.  I would say this to the Unionists: when this State was born we were not found wanting in so far as the southern Unionists were concerned. Their worst fears were not fulfilled.  The Government that assumed office when this State was born was generous to them as were all subsequent Governments.  It is time that Unionist leaders stopped <Col N="940" /> living in their own shadows and walked into the sunlight of rationality.  We live on a small island and we cannot always live apart.</P>
    <P>The Anglo-Irish Agreement is not a perfect document, it can be improved.  It will not be improved if we in this House either underestimate the emotions it engenders or seek to falsely portray where we individually stand on it.  This has been done from time to time by spokespersons from the main Opposition parties.  Sometimes it is done in sincerity, and sometimes it is done in mischief. There may be some minor and short-term political advantage in mis-representing the Government's sincerity, or in mis-representing their commitment.  As in the case of the national lottery, these types of mis-representations may draw a certain degree of publicity from their sloganising but they will do none of us here any service.  We need to talk less about such things and listen more.</P>
    <P>It is a tragedy that so much time is wasted in this House on debates of much less consequence than this one.  It is a tragedy that, as the clock draws to the close of business, there are too few people willing to participate in this debate.  The tragedy of Northern Ireland, that of the divided island of Ireland, is something that touches on all of our lives and is something about which we should all feel the same kind of passion as the last speaker.  We should dedicate ourselves with the level of enthusiasm and passion to every possibility of bringing those divisions obtaining between us to an end.</P>
    <P>The Anglo-Irish Agreement is not a perfect document; it has flaws and I have problems with aspects of it.  I admit all of that, but it does afford us some opportunities and we should grasp them each and every day.</P>

      <P>Deputy Pat McCartan gave me notice of his intention <Col N="941" /> to raise on the Adjournment the subject matter of the funding of the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre.  The matter is in order and I now call on the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, first I should like to thank you and your office for allowing me raise this matter. Second, I should like to thank the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Leyden, for taking time to be present to listen to what I believe to be an urgent but succinct appeal which, at this late hour, just past midnight, can be made quickly without delaying the House unnecessarily.</P>
      <P>Within the past few days the Rape Crisis Centre in Dublin issued a clear and unambiguous statement that, as of 23 December next, they will be obliged to close their doors and cease operating as a service for the victims of what is perhaps one of the most heinous crimes that can be perpetrated on women and young people in our community.  From that date forward they say they simply will not have any more money to pay staff wages, rent, rates or be capable of continuing to provide that service to victims.</P>
      <P>It is a centre that, in the past year, enjoyed a certain but not inordinate amount of public funding.  As I understand the position, from the national lottery, from Government, they received the sum of £20,000, that having been the only occasion on which they received funds from that source.  They received also their standing payment of £21,000 from the Eastern Health Board, that being part of a yearly commitment.</P>
      <P>It is ironic that we must highlight this problem on their behalf and seek urgent assistance from Government particularly when one considers the debates that have taken place in this House in recent weeks in at least three of which concern was expressed forcibly by Members on all sides of the House, first in the debate on the Video Recordings Bill, when the claim was made that video nasties often are the source of and prompt crimes of violence against women.  There were also the expressions of outrage in this House about these types of crime and the need to take effective urgent action to counteract them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="942" /> The introduction of the Child Care Bill opened up a discussion of that matter when fears were expressed by Members on all sides of the House on behalf of children.  Concern was expressed about the need to ensure that adequate child care services were put in place comprehensively on a national level to deal with children neglected.  Even in the past few days, in the course of our discussion on the Supplementary Estimate for the Department of Justice we noted that the Government have extended the remit of the criminal injuries compensation tribunal to the tune of £4 million, recognising the need to ensure where possible that victims of crime are fairly compensated. In the course of that debate the Minister for Justice indicated that he and his Government regarded victims of rape as constituting special cases that must be considered by his Department as a priority in any review of the workings of that tribunal.</P>
    <P>In the context of all of those expressions of concern for women and children, the victims of sexual and violent crime, we are faced with the prospect that a unique and comprehensive services is at the end of its financial tether and existence.  The services provided by the Rape Crisis Centre in Dublin are comprehensive and unique, unique in that there is no other agency in the State that provides the same service, comprehensive in that all the needs of victims of sexual and violent assault, women and children, are provided through the trojan counselling and assistance offered by their employees.</P>
    <P>It is worth outlining some of those services in order to appreciate just how important is this centre to the victims of such horrible crimes.  Since the centre was established in 1979, with the help of a few volunteers and one telephone, it has developed into a professional service second to none and is a credit to all concerned. For example, a victim of a gross sexual assault, once they have contacted the centre, will be given one to one counselling immediately and on demand; there is no waiting; there are no restrictions. The counselling involves a one-to-one interview initially to help a victim cope with the trauma of the offence.  In <Col N="943" /> time the victim is led into an on-going group therapy, in some instances on a daily but, more usually, a weekly basis. The services provided by the centre help people in confronting and dealing with their families, with the police in the investigative procedures, in attending at courts and, then, introducing people to professional services outside, remaining always at the side of a victim helping them to cope with what is often the complete destruction of life around them.</P>
    <P>Because of the lapse of time involved, of those who come to complain of past sexual abuse 70 per cent of those who approached the centre in the year to October 1988 fell into that category. Unfortunately, because of lack of resources, these people are obliged to join a queue.  I understand that at present there are as many as 300 people in that category on long-term counselling with another 300 or thereabouts on a waiting list in the hope that their turn will come.</P>
    <P>The centre has indicated that they have a high throughput of volunteers supervised by full-time therapists.  They need another five at least but they cannot employ additional people or commit themselves to future planning and development because they do not have the guarantee of future funds.  On the question of funding it is important to underline the fact that this is not a handout organisation, one that does not work for itself as well.  For example, their financial report for the year to the end of October 1988 showed that their income from fund raising was estimated at £150,000, of which they raised, themselves, £90,000.  By way of seminars, lectures, collections, donations and counselling fees they managed to raise the remainder of that amount, minus the £41,000 provided in the way I described earlier.  They are obliged to spend £45,000 investing in fund-raising events themselves.  Their single biggest expense, amounting to half of total expenditure, is salaries and wages for their staff.  Therefore, they are trying desperately hard to maintain themselves and they are committing the vast majority of their resources to those working in the field, <Col N="944" /> providing what I say is a most unique and important service.</P>
    <P>Another thing to remember about the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre is that it lobbies Parliament.  It is significant that within two years of its foundation it had succeeded in convincing the Government of the need to update a most outdated law with the amending Act of 1981.  They had not been happy with the workings of that Act and their efforts in this regard were appreciated on all sides of the House, including the present Government, as expressed by the Minister of State, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn on occasions.  Their submissions to the Joint Committee on Women's Rights and to the Law Reform Commission promoted a great number of research douments and proposals in regard to an updating of the law and they have won a commitment from the Government that in the New Year, if not sooner, there will be a further amending Act to deal with many of the outstanding problems in regard to our rape law.</P>
    <P>For that reason it is even more important to appreciate the comprehensiveness of their activities and their impact on society.  In that regard it is worth looking at who the centre helps.  In their analysis of the current year, out of a total of 1,234 counselled it is worth remembering that over 700 were young children or people complaining of the trauma of child sexual abuse.  It is also worth remembering that the vast majority of these had been referred to the Centre by outside agencies, social workers, doctors, teachers and members of the Garda Síochána. Professional and voluntary agencies, not just within Dublin but from all around the country, look to the centre for assistance and advice.  It is therefore urgent and essential that we do something and I hope the Minister when replying will be able to offer some hope to the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre, to all of those agencies and organisations and to all those who urgently need the assistance provided by the centre, young children and adults, the victims of these horrible crimes.</P>
    <P>Earlier I listened to the debate on the National Lottery (Amendment) Bill and I am reminded of the words of the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Flynn, <Col N="945" /> who, in one of the more robust contributions, said that the Government were going to get on with the real tasks once this needless Bill was out of the way. It has now been put out of the way.  The issue was decided upon following a vote of the House tonight and I am asking the Government to regard this issue as one of the major tasks facing us.  The Dublin Rape Crisis Centre gave due notice of the problems facing it.  In terms of finance in order to be able to survive in the coming year it needs a minimum of £100,000 and that is on the basis that it continues with its excellent fund raising work, even though it is questionable whether it should have to carry out this fund raising in view of the excellent service it provides.  I plead with the Minister that in his reply, which I look forward to hearing, he will offer some hope to all those I have mentioned and see to it that the future of this centre is put on a sound foundation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Leyden) Terry Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Leyden)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted that Deputy McCartan was given the opportunity to raise this issue and I should first make it clear that I and the Minister, Dr. O'Hanlon, especially recognise the role of the voluntary agency in the provision of health and social services.  This commitment is reflected in the financial assistance given directly by my Department and through health boards to a wide range of agencies for the handicapped, physical and mental handicapped through the elderly, children and other disadvantaged persons.  In spite of the financial difficulties in the health sector, I have been careful both in budgeting at central level and in my instructions to health boards, to ensure, in a planned and co-ordinated way, the protection and maintenance of the services for the vulnerable members of our community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the other hand, it must be recognised that no agency can assume an open-ended commitment by the State to their undertakings.  It would put us in an impossible position if we were to step in to meet the deficits of organisations which expand their activities beyond their own capacity to finance them and beyond the prior agreement and commitment of <Col N="946" /> the public authorities to support such expansion.  This is what is at the root of the present difficulties of the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre.</P>
    <P>In spite of the fact that they recruited additional staff and assumed additional activities which it must have been clear to them the health board grant and their own fund-raising could not finance, I sought to alleviate their problem by giving the centre a special grant of £20,000 from national lottery funds.  They have, therefore, had in effect what amounts to a 100 per cent increase in their funding from the public sector for 1988.</P>
    <P>Nonetheless, there is now a demand by the centre that I advance them a further and even more substantial grant.  This is unreasonable, and unfair to the many other organisations who are also facing special difficulties at the present and who would have as much claim to such extra State aid as the Rape Crisis Centre.</P>
    <P>There is a further important consideration relevant to the work which the centre asks me to subsidise so heavily. By their own admission, the greater part of their counselling is with alleged cases of child abuse, only a small proportion, at that, of current cases.  I must therefore outline for the information of the House the very substantial and structured provision which I have already made for dealing with child abuse.</P>
    <P>In July 1987 my Department published a new set of child abuse guidelines.  They set out in considerable detail recommended procedures for the reporting, recording, investigation and management of suspected cases of child abuse, including sexual abuse.  These new guidelines have been welcomed by all the various interest groups.  They are designed to ensure a systematic and sensitive approach to caring for the victims of abuse.  The problem of child abuse requires an effective and coherent multi-disciplinary response from our health and social services and this is emphasised and underlined through the guidelines.</P>
    <P>I accept that there is a real need to increase the range of services available for sexually abused children.  I have this year already allocated special funds to enable services at Temple Street and <Col N="947" /> Crumlin Children's hospitals to be significantly expanded.  There is, however, a need also to improve services outside the Dublin area and I have therefore allocated special additional funds of £500,000 from my Department's share of the national lottery surplus to the health boards outside of Dublin to enable them to improve their capacity for the assessment and investigation of alleged cases of child abuse, including child sexual abuse.</P>
    <P>The new Child Care Bill at present before the Dáil represents a significant improvement of the overall legal framework for tackling child abuse.  This underlines the need for agencies like the Rape Crisis Centre to consult with, and co-ordinate their work with, the services of the statutory authorities to ensure that confusion and expensive duplication do not occur in this serious and sensitive area.  Both the health boards and I acknowledge the special role of the voluntary agency in personal services like <Col N="948" /> this but it is out of the question to present them with a blank cheque for activities they undertake without consultation or agreement.</P>
    <P>I must place on record my admiration for the work of the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre.  Nevertheless in view of the serious financial straits the centre is in just now, I am consulting further with the Eastern Health Board in relation to their current and future role.  We will certainly take into account the very detailed submission which has been made here tonight by Deputy Pat McCartan in relation to the very serious and financial difficulties of the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre.  Because I appreciate the serious and difficult situation of the centre, my officials will be fully briefed on the contribution which has been made here this evening in order that the issue can be tackled as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 12.25 a.m. on Thursday, 17 November, until 10.30 a.m.</P>

      <P>Aer Lingus is currently engaged on a programme of fleet development in respect of its European fleet to cater for the expansion in traffic arising from the general liberalisation of European air transport, the increase in inbound tourism and the need to replace older aircraft in the fleet.</P>
      <P>Aer Lingus has already taken delivery of two B737-300 aircraft.  These aircraft were delivered in October-November, 1987 at a cost of $71.3 million.  The company has, with Government approval, placed orders for:</P>
      <P>&mdash;two B737-400 aircraft to be delivered next year at a cost of $71.2 million;</P>
      <P>&mdash;four B737-500 aircraft to be delivered in 1990 at a cost of $108.5 million;</P>
      <P>&mdash;two Fokker 50 aircraft to be delivered next year at a cost of $27.5 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, Aer Lingus has submitted for Government approval proposals for the acquisition of three B737-400 aircraft, one B737-500 aircraft and two additional Fokker 50 aircraft to be delivered in the period up to 1991.  These proposals are expected to cost $164.75 million.  I expect the Government to take decisions on these aircraft shortly.  Aer Lingus also holds options on four B737 aircraft for delivery in 1992 but proposals in this <Col N="673" /> regard, particularly as regards B737 variant, have not yet been finalised by Aer Lingus.  The proposals I have outlined cover the major elements of the Aer Lingus programme of development of its European fleet.  Pending delivery of new aircraft Aer Lingus has leased in aircraft on a short term basis to cater for traffic in the peak.  Aer Lingus expects to finance this programme of expenditure on commercial terms and without a requirement for additional equity.  The programme will be financed from a combination of net profits after tax, depreciation funds, disposal of old aircraft and other surplus assets and from borrowings.</P>
    <P>In relation to its current transatlantic fleet of three B747s, Aer Lingus does not expect to have to replace these aircraft before the mid-1990's.  The company is, however, acquiring on a short term lease basis for summer 1989 a Lockhead L1011 Tristar to cater for general US-Ireland traffic growth in the peak.  The company is at present examining the situation in relation to expansion beyond that period but has not yet finalised any proposals in that regard.</P>

    <P>The licensing of road passenger transport services generally, including in the <Col N="674" /> Dublin city and County area, is regulated by the Road Transport Act, 1932.  A review of the provisions and operation of this Act has been completed in my Department.  That review took account of the views expressed by many interests on the liberalisation of the licensing of bus services and the future role of private bus operators in the provision of scheduled public bus passenger transport services. I am, at present, finalising my proposals for updating the 1932 Act and I will shortly be seeking the approval of Government for them.  Bus Atha Cliath, the CIE subsidiary which was established in 1987, has specific responsibility for the provision of bus services in Dublin and is continuing in its efforts to upgrade and improve the quality of its bus services.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 18, 25, 33, 71 and 72 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government decided last year that no further consideration would be given to extending the DART system because <Col N="676" /> of the high costs of such development and the state of the public finances.  CIE were accordingly instructed in October 1987 to prepare transport investment plans for the Dublin area, involving only bus-based options or diesel services on existing rail lines.</P>
    <P>Last August I received proposals from CIE for improved commuter diesel rail services from Maynooth to the city, a new diesel rail commuter service from Clondalkin to the city and the provision of feeder bus services in the rail catchment areas.  On the bus side, CIE propose to provide new services on a number of peripheral routes, local minibus services in certain suburbs, the satellite towns and some city areas and limited stop services to the city on certain longer journeys. The opening of four new stations at Confey, Coolmine, Blanchardstown and Broombridge on the line from Maynooth is envisaged.  A much more frequent service is also proposed.  The proposal for a new service from Clondalkin envisages stations at Clondalkin, Cherry Orchard, Ballyfermot, Inchicore, a new Heuston suburban station, Phoenix Park, Cabra and Drumcondra with a frequent service.</P>
    <P>CIE have indicated that they would not be able to fund the expenditure required from their own resources and that financial aid of about £30 million would be required for full implementation of the proposals.</P>

    <P>I am fully aware that the completion of the Single European Market by the end of 1992, and the opening of the channel tunnel between Britain and France in the <Col N="678" /> Spring of 1993, are major developments which call for new initiatives in Irish transport policy over the next four years.</P>
    <P>In so far as an Irish Sea tunnel is concerned, an assessment carried out by my Department found that the costs involved could exceed £15 billion, over twice the cost of the Britain-France tunnel, while the potential usage is estimated at less than 20 per cent of that predicted for the Britain-France tunnel.  While the economics of an Irish Sea tunnel therefore rule it out as a serious option, all realistic options including a railway ferry are being examined with a view to seeking EC financial assistance and ensuring that Ireland will not be further disadvantaged by the completion of the Channel Tunnel.</P>

      <P>It is recognised that the loss of revenue which would result from the abolition of duty free sales to travellers within the European Community would be a serious matter for Aer Rianta. Revenue earned by the company from duty free sales in 1987 amounted to nearly £30 million of which £18 million approximately was generated from sales to intra-Community travellers.</P>
      <P>Aer Rianta are at present developing and examining other commercial opportunities and I am confident that any reduction in duty free revenue experienced by the company will be matched by increases in revenue in other areas and that this can be achieved without any significant impact on airport charges.  In this connection I would also draw attention to the considerable success which Aer Rianta has enjoyed in the recent past in negotiating and developing joint venture projects with the Soviet airline Aeroflot.  These achievements provide ample evidence of Aer Rianta's ability to create and to maximise new commercial opportunities on a successful and profitable basis.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Minister for Tourism and Transport (Mr. Wilson) John P. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism and Transport (Mr. Wilson)</NameTxt>
      <P>The competitiveness of Irish tourism is dependent primarily on the price, quality and range of our tourist facilities and on our effectiveness in marketing and selling Ireland as a holiday destination.  Action taken by the Government, since coming into Office, has been successful in bringing about improvements in all these areas.</P>
      <P>This Government's success in reducing domestic inflation to its lowest level for many years has greatly enhanced the competitiveness of our tourist industry. Moreover, initiatives taken on access transport have resulted in a more extensive network of services to Ireland, and at lower fares.  As a result of increased competition in the insurance sector and in anticipation of benefits accruing from the Courts Act, 1988, insurance premia, which are a significant cost item for the industry, have already begun to come down.  The scope of the VAT (Refund of Tax) Order, 1986 was extended recently to enable a greater number of imported tour coaches, both new and up to two years old, to benefit from the effective 10 per cent rate of VAT.</P>
      <P>Improvements such as these in the cost structure of the industry have been supplemented by special promotions such as the Government backed $50 discount off car rental rates for North American visitors this autumn and the &ldquo;Punt Saver Scheme&rdquo; which offered tourists discounts on a range of facilities to the value of £115 for the 1988 tourist season.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government has actively sought to encourage improvements in the quality and range of the tourism product.  Falling interest rates, and significant improvements in tourism performance in the past two years, have helped to create a very positive climate for re-investment by <Col N="681" /> tourism operators.  The extension of the business expansion scheme to tourism, details of which I announced last December, has also proved to be a significant incentive for new investment in the industry. Allocations for tourism-related expenditure have been included in the ERDF &mdash; Special Border Areas Programme Phase II &mdash; and in the assistance schemes operated by the International Fund for Ireland.  All this has resulted in a much accelerated rate of investment and development in Irish tourism, working towards bringing the range and quality of the tourism product to a standard at least as high, if not higher, than that available in competitor destinations.</P>
    <P>Bord Fáilte has adopted a more targeted approach to marketing, identifying specific markets and market segments for promotion, and has increased marketing in the main target markets, in close association with the industry.  As the House will be aware, the Government, in this year's budget, allocated an additional £4 million for a special marketing programme for 1988.  This programme was supplemented by £2.5 million expenditure by the tourist industry.  In October, the Government allocated a further additional £5 million for marketing purposes to further boost tourist traffic next year on condition that it would be matched by the industry.  I am happy to report that the resultant £10 million marketing programme is now underway.  Investment by the industry itself in marketing is essential in the very competitive international market.  The Government is convinced that improved price competitiveness, the new more effective marketing approach by Bord Fáilte, coupled with increased industry support for, and involvement in the marketing and development effort, will ensure that Ireland secures its share of the growing world tourism market.</P>

      <P>As decided by Government, the Dublin Transportation Task Force was reconstituted in January 1988 with the following terms of reference: first to co-ordinate on a non-statutory basis, traffic management and bus priority activities in the Dublin area, devising new schemes where appropriate; second, to settle annually the priorities for funding traffic management and bus priority schemes within its budget allocation in the Tourism and Transport Vote (£165,000 for 1988 and £174,000 for 1989) and third, by these and other appropriate means to pursue the stated aims of reducing traffic congestion, especially at peak times, and promoting and facilitating the use of public transport services.</P>
      <P>The reconstituted task force has been meeting regularly and, in pursuit of the objectives set out in its terms of reference, has embarked on a work programme which builds on the achievements of its predecessors.  The chief initiatives which it has undertaken to date are (1) the extension and enhancement of the closed circuit television (CCTV) traffic monitoring system, including the development of its potential benefits for bus operations; (2) an on-going review of the city's bus lane system; (3) moves to complete the existing computerised urban traffic control (UTC) traffic signal system; (4) promotion of efforts to improve traffic circulation particularly through improved enforcement of parking restrictions and improved controls on road openings; (5) submission of inputs relating to transport and traffic to the Dublin planning authorities and to An Bord Pleanála.</P>

      <P>The DART and other existing rail suburban services in the Dublin area are satisfactory.  On the other hand, some of the bus services are not giving the same degree of satisfaction as regards level and quality of service.  I am informed by CIE that the bus situation should improve dramatically with the completion of the programme for one-person-operation and the introduction of its new ticketing system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As explained in reply to other questions on to-day's Order Paper, the board of CIE, in response to the Government direction of October, 1987, has submitted new investment plans for approval.  The proposals envisage improved commuter diesel rail services from Maynooth to the city, a new diesel rail commuter service from Clondalkin to the city and the provision of feeder bus services in the rail catchment areas.  On the bus side, CIE propose to provide new services on a number of peripheral routes, local minibus services in certain suburbs, the satellite towns and some city areas and limited-stop services to the city on certain <Col N="687" /> longer journeys.  These investment plans are being examined in my Department.</P>

      <P>It is a matter for Swansea Cork Ferries Limited to satisfy themselves that sufficient finance will be available to support whatever services the company wishes to provide.  I have conveyed to the company that the Government would be prepared to consider an Exchequer grant to assist them in marketing and promoting a service for the summer season of 1989, subject to submission by them of acceptable proposals for viable operation in 1989.</P>
      <P>As there is no question of a subsidy from the Government for Swansea Cork Ferries Limited or for any other ferry company, the question of compensation for B &amp; I does not arise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism and Transport (Mr. Wilson)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Finance is fully aware of my concerns about the high cost of car hire in Ireland compared with some European countries and the US.</P>
      <P>As I pointed out to the House on 24 May 1988, in response to a parliamentary question from Deputy Pat O'Malley on car hire costs, while the current state of the public finances would preclude a lowering of excise rates on cars for the time being, efforts are being made by Government to improve the competitiveness of the car hire sector.  Lower access fares, reduced inflation and more favourable rates for tourist accommodation have all helped to improve the competitiveness of fly-drive holiday packages to Ireland this year.  As a result of increased competition in the insurance sector and in anticipation of benefits accruing from the recent Courts Act, 1988, insurance premia have already begun to come down.  The House will also be aware of the introduction this autumn by the Government, in conjunction with the Car Rental Council of Ireland, of a car rental bonus scheme for the North American market.</P>

    <P>The capital expenditure described above will be financed generally from a combination of net profits after tax, non-cash <Col N="693" /> charges, mainly depreciation and disposal of old aircraft and other surplus assets as well as borrowings.  No equity is being provided by the Government for this purpose.  The rate of interest on borrowings would depend on the currencies in which each loan is transacted.  In this regard, Aer Lingus borrows in the most favourable currencies allowing for any exchange risks involved.  Accordingly, is not possible to be precise about the advantage of borrowing with a State guarantee over borrowing without a State guarantee until such time as a specific proposal to borrow is being considered. Aer Lingus advises that the differential could be as low as one eighth per cent. Aer Lingus is not proposing, however, to make use of State guarantees for its borrowings.</P>

      <P>In considering whether to approve air fares, I am obliged under Article 3 (3) of the Air Transport Act, 1986 to have regard to</P>
      <P>(i)  the reasonable interest of other air carriers;</P>
      <P>(ii)  the reasonable interests of users;</P>
      <P>(iii)  the contribution to the economy by the tourist industry;</P>
      <P>(iv)  the necessity to maintain an adequate range of year round services, having regard to the public interest;</P>
      <P>(v)  any representation or objection made to me regarding the tariff;</P>
      <P>(vi)  any air transport or other international agreements in force at the time, to which the State is a party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to (vi) there are a number of <Col N="694" /> international agreements to which I am required to have regard, viz:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  in the case of fares between Ireland the the EC Community members states generally, I am obliged, under the EEC Council Direction of 14 December 1987 on fares for scheduled air services between member states, to take into consideration a wide range of criteria, including the costs of the applicant airline, the needs of consumers, the need for a satisfactory return on capital, the competitive market situation, including the fares of other airlines operating on the route and the need to prevent dumping.  However, and here I quote directly from the relevant EC Directive: &ldquo;the fact that a proposed air fare is lower than that offered by another carrier on the same route shall not be sufficient reason for withholding approval&rdquo;.  The Directive also provides for automatic approval of promotional fare proposals conforming to certain specified parameters.</P>
    <P>(b)  In the case of Ireland-UK fares, the Memorandum of Understanding dated 11 March 1988 between the UK and Ireland refers.  This is generally more liberal in its provisions than the EC fares Directive which I have just mentioned.  It provides for a double disapproval fares regime which essentially means that all fares are deemed approved, unless disapproved by <i>both</i> Authorities.  There is, however, scope for consultation where one side considers a particular fare filed by a carrier of the other side either excessive or that its application would constitute anti-competitive behaviour, likely to cause serious damage to another airline or airlines.  Either side may unilaterally disapprove fares of its own airlines, if they are considered to be excessive or anti-competitive.</P>
    <P>(c)  In the case of Ireland-US fares, the Memorandum of Understanding on North Atlantic pricing, made between the European Civil Aviation Conference (ECAC), of which Ireland <Col N="695" /> is a Member, and the US provides for the automatic approval of fares conforming to certain specified parameters. Otherwise the provisions of the Air Transport Act, 1986 apply.</P>
    <P>I should add, finally, that the fares offered by any airline on any of its routes is primarily a matter for that airline to determine by reference to its own costs, the demands of the market and the general competitive environment, within the parameters laid down by the legislation or international agreements to which I have already referred.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether his attention has been drawn to the fact that in many cases the Revenue Commissioners are effectively denying taxpayers exemption under section 2, Finance Act, 1969, by simply failing to adjudicate on the taxpayers' claims for exemption; and whether it is proposed to amend the section in order to require the Revenue Commissioners to make a decision within a certain period of time failing which the claim for exemption would be deemed to be refused thus allowing the taxpayer to appeal.</P>

      <P>I assume that the Deputy is referring to the income tax exemption under section 2 of the Finance Act, 1969 for certain earnings of writers, composers and artists resident in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where the conditions required by the section have been satisfied concerning original and creative works regarded as <Col N="703" /> having cultural or artistic merit, there is an obligation on the Revenue Commissioners to allow the exemption from tax provided for in the section.</P>
    <P>I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the relief is being administered in accordance with the provisions of the section.</P>
    <P>While a decision as to whether a particular work qualifies for exemption may take a significant amount of time, because of the consultative process involved in each case, the Revenue Commissioners have assured me that in general no inordinate delays are occurring. As the Deputy will recall, in the context of my reply to the question put down by Deputy Máirín Quill for oral answer on 24 March last, I invited Deputies to submit details of any case about which they were concerned and I undertook to have any such case investigated.  Neither my Department nor the Revenue Commissioners can trace representations from any Deputy received on foot of this undertaking.  However, if the Deputy has knowledge of any particular case where difficulties or problems have arisen, I will have the matter investigated on receipt of the necessary details identifying the relevant case.</P>

    <P>The additional yield representing the reduced cost to the Exchequer from allowing the reliefs in question at the lower standard rate of 34 per cent is set out in the following table.  It should be noted, however, that the additional yield shown would be more than outweighed by the cost of reducing the standard rate to 34 per cent.  The question of a corresponding additional yield to the Exchequer from reductions in the 48 per cent rate and the 58 per cent rate does not arise in the context of the tax scheme mentioned as it provides for relief at the standard rate only.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East)</i> asked the Minister for Finance if he will list the companies which qualify for export sales relief; the location of each company; and the estimated tax which will accrue to the Exchequer as a result of the elimination of ESR in the following tax years: (a) 1990-1991 and (b) 1991-1992.</P>

      <P>I have been informed by the Revenue Commissioners that their obligation to observe confidentiality precludes the giving of the information requested by the Deputy in regard to the names and locations of the companies qualifying for export sales relief (ESR).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Export sales relief will cease to be available after 5 April 1990, and while it is expected that there will be an increase in the tax yield as a result, it is not known when precisely this will begin to accrue. The yield to the Exchequer from the replacement of the relief by a corporation tax rate of 10 per cent will depend upon a number of factors such as the extent to which ESR companies will continue to operate in Ireland after that relief has been terminated, and the extent to which ESR companies have accumulated capital allowances in 1990 which can be set off against their taxable profits.  Because of these factors it is not possible to say <Col N="707" /> now what the yield to the Exchequer will be under the new arrangement.</P>

    <P>Staff members employed at Dún Laoghaire harbour yard are currently responsible for both the maintenance of Dún Laoghaire harbour and for the maintenance of Government buildings in the Dún Laoghaire and south-east Dublin area.  The engineering grades also have additional responsibilities for other marine works, apart from Dún Laoghaire harbour.</P>
    <P>Three employees will be retiring shortly, prior to the proposed transfer of responsibility for the management of the harbour to the Department of the Marine, on 1 January 1989.  Under this transfer of function to the Department of the Marine it is not, at this time, proposed to relocate any of the staff physically. While the Department of the Marine will assume responsibility for the majority of the staff, a small number, proportionate to the needs of Government building maintenance in the area, will be retained under the control of the Office of Public Works.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>These negotiations cover trade relations in all sectors, including agriculture.  A number of contracting parties to the GATT have been pressing in the negotiations for full liberalisation of agricultural trade including the abolition of all trade related subsidies.  The Community's position has been firmly opposed to that view and while willing to participate in measures leading, on a mutually advantageous basis, to greater freedom of trade it has made it clear that the fundamental principles of the CAP are not negotiable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can accept the broad thrust of the Community's approach in the negotiations to date.  My principal aims are to ensure that the Community's actions in recent years are matched by equivalent actions by other trading countries, that the eventual agreement recognises the special characteristics of European farming and that the Community can continue to support the farming community and rural areas generally.  For that reason, I strongly oppose full liberalisation of trade <Col N="716" /> which would have very adverse consequences for European producers and for the Irish economy.</P>
    <P>At my request and that of my French colleague, the Council of Agriculture Ministers discussed this whole issue on 14-15 November.  It generally agreed on an approach clearly in line with these views and recommended that the Community's position at the special Ministerial Mid-Term Review in Montreal from 5 December should be drawn up on that basis.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Food if his attention has been drawn to the fact that some farmers in County Carlow have not yet been paid the calf premium for the second half of 1987; that an inspection has not been carried out to date; and if he will take urgent action to expedite the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>A small number of herd-owners applied in January 1988 for calf premium on calves born in the second half of 1987.  I understand that nearly all inspections on foot of these applications have been completed and that payment on all such cases will be made shortly.</P>
      <P>The vast majority of farmers waited until June 1988 to apply for premium on their calves born in the second half of 1987 and also on their calves born up to 15 June 1988.  Inspections on foot of these applications are nearing completion.  It is a requirement of the calf premium scheme that premium cannot be paid on a calf until it reaches six months of age so payment on foot of these inspections cannot commence until after 15 December 1988 &mdash; that is until after all calves born up to 15 June 1988 have reached six months of age.</P>
      <P>Due to pressure of payments under the disadvantaged areas schemes, suckler cow and special beef premium schemes it is expected that payments in respect of applications lodged in June 1988 will not commence until January 1989 and continue for approximately two months.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Food whether the ewe premium should be paid in respect of the number of animals presented for inspection and retained for the 100 day period from 13 March 1988 in the light of the difficulty for many farmers in the production of veterinary, Garda Síochána or veterinary laboratory certificates now required to account for losses between date of application and inspection; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. O'Kennedy) Michael O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The EC regulations governing the operation of the ewe premium scheme which is fully funded by the European Commission specify that the premium is payable in respect of the number of ewes the applicant undertakes to keep on his holding for 100 days from the closing date for receiving applications which this year was 11 March.  These regulations also provide that if, at inspection, the applicant presents less than the number he undertook to maintain, the premium will only be paid on the number he actually presents on condition that the decrease in numbers took place as a result of natural circumstances relating to the life of the flock.</P>
      <P>To comply with audit requirements, applicants may be asked to produce supporting evidence that their ewe numbers fell because of natural circumstances i.e. disease, marauding dogs etc.  My Department have no evidence to suggest that it is any more difficult now to obtain veterinary or Garda Síochána certificates than at any time in the past.</P>

The farm income survey published by the then An Foras Talúntais shows that an improvement of 30 per cent took place in average farm incomes in that year and present indications are that farmers are benefiting from a further significant income improvement this year.  As regards the disparity between sectors, AFT (now TEAGASC) National Farm Survey results for 1987 indicate that the improvement in incomes in the non-dairy sector was greater than that which occurred in dairying.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Communications (Mr. R. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have said before in replies to similar questions, I would like to see foreign language services on Cablelink. However, it is a matter for the company to decide the foreign services it wishes to relay.</P>
      <P>The problem is that the number of services available exceeds the capacity of the system.  In the light of this I understand that Cablelink are examining the feasibility of &ldquo;time-shifting&rdquo; a selection of such services &mdash; i.e. to record them &ldquo;off-air&rdquo; and relay them outside broadcasting hours on another channel.</P>
      <P>All cable operators are statutorily obliged to relay the television services of RTE and it is my intention to extend this obligation to the independent television channel.  I do not consider that it would be appropriate for me to oblige cable operators to carry one particular foreign service rather than another.</P>

      <P>Because the time taken by An Bord Pleanála to process appeals can vary considerably, the average time taken to deal with appeals is not regarded as a reliable indication of progress and information of that kind is not sought by my Department from the Board.  However, at the end of September, 1988, over 50 per cent of appeals were on hand for less than 3 months, 87.4 per cent of all appeals were less than six months on hands and 98.7 per cent of all appeals were less than 9 months on hands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Certain basic procedures must be followed in relation to every appeal and <Col N="735" /> delays due to factors outside the control of the board can occur.</P>
    <P>The possibility of introducing a time limit for appeals has been given careful consideration.  I am advised that the imposition of absolute time limits on the appeals process, or parts thereof, would be unacceptable.  However, the performance of the Board is kept under constant review with a view to ensuring that all avoidable delays are eliminated.</P>
    <P>An Bord Pleanála is composed of a chairman, deputy chairman and 4 board members.  The current staff complement is 61.</P>

      <P>The acceptance of a tender in respect of a pilot scheme for this estate was approved on 11 October 1988.  Further phases of work will be conditional on a satisfactory cost and technical outturn to this project. A sum of £2.3 million was allocated this year to Dublin Corporation in respect of their estates at Cloverhill, Darndale, Fatima Mansions and St. Mary's Mansions. The apportionment of the allocation is a matter for the corporation. Authorities will be notified of their 1989 allocations as soon as possible.  The actual level of funding that can be provided each year for individual projects will be dependent on the amount of capital available, the competing demands for assistance from other authorities, and the priorities accorded by the corporation to their various schemes.  It is not possible, therefore, to give an indication of the likely timescale for completion of the Cloverhill Estate project.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware of the great work undertaken by the Irish Wheelchair Association and its branches.  I have allocated £150,000 to the National Branch of the Irish Wheelchair Association from the <Col N="745" /> 1987-1988 Health allocation of national lottery proceeds and will consider their position as sympathetically as possible when I am advised fully of my allocation of lottery proceeds for 1989.  In these circumstances I see little prospect of giving further separate allocations to local branches of the organisation.</P>
