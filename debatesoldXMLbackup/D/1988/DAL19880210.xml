      <Col N="1663" /> Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ToddyOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to relate my remarks to the Bill before the House and to say that in large measure it is not acceptable to the Labour Party.  I should like to state here the position of the Labour Party in relation to broadcasting. I believe that this Bill lacks any definition of broadcasting principles, that there is nothing in it to indicate what we want from our broadcasting service and the way we want it to develop in the future.</P>
      <P>The most striking feature of the Government's approach to the development of broadcasting &mdash; an approach shared by Fine Gael in the last Administration &mdash; is that they propose initiating a new broadcasting system without any accompanying analysis to justify that approach.</P>
      <P>New technology and the availability here of additional frequencies requiring a review of broadcasting policy cannot be doubted.  Equally something had to be done to regularise the position in which many illegal broadcasting systems operated.</P>
      <P>The response of this Government and of Fine Gael during the term of office of the last Administration has been to react to the new technological opportunities and the problem of illegal broadcasting systems in a purely pragmatic way. Neither party has made any reference to the fact that broadcasting fulfils cultural and social roles in society highly significant in themselves, indeed more significant than the product of most other institutions in the State.  Broadcasting is not a normal social product; it serves to inform and reflect cultural and social values.  The extent to which broadcasting will inform and reflect cultural and social values in a positive way will depend on the terms of reference of the broadcasting system and of the structures within which it operates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In most societies decisions to change or modernise the broadcasting system have <Col N="1664" /> been preceded by serious national debate, the publication of a White Paper or the inauguration of a special commission on the subject.  Such options have been avoided here.  As a result this House is now being asked to evaluate a proposal for a new broadcasting system without the benefit of a clear statement of Government policy on broadcasting or of an analysis by an independent commission on the role of broadcasting in society and how that role can best be fulfilled in the new circumstances. Rather, policy appears to be dictated primarily by the need to respond to the existence of illegal broadcasters.</P>
    <P>In so far as the policy proposed may have other motives, and given the lack of justification by the Government of their proposals, these motives can only be the Government's desire to see more friendly persons in charge of radio and their feeling that the alleged hostility of some of RTE's staff to the Government party can be best dealt with by an alternative broadcasting system.</P>
    <P>Since the inauguration of broadcasting in the State, policy has favoured the public service model as appropriate to our circumstances.  The concept of public service broadcasting was enunciated again in 1974 in the Broadcasting Review Committee report the last occasion on which an independent review of broadcasting was undertaken.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party are of the view that the concept of broadcasting as a public service should continue to underpin an Irish broadcasting system.  We are not aware of any arguments forwarded by this Government or others which would suggest that this concept be set aside.  In this regard we see no reason to set aside the objective of the broadcasting system set down in paragraph 3.4.3 of the Broadcasting Review Committee report of 1974, although we do accept that the basic principles set down in the paragraph may need further clarification in the light of technological and social developments since then.</P>
    <P>In essence, the objectives of broadcasting policy should be to provide a balanced service of information, <Col N="1665" /> enlightenment and entertainment, to provide a means whereby people can communicate with each other within Ireland and between Ireland and other countries; and to provide for the expression of Irish identity in all its forms. It will be noticed that the concept of broadcasting as a means of achieving individualistic returns on private investment does not in itself constitute an aspect of the objectives of broadcasting policy set down in the committee report.  What concerns me about the Sound Broadcasting Bill, 1987, which is before us today is that it does not attempt in any way to reflect this balanced approach to broadcasting, or indeed to ensure the growth and future of public service broadcasting.</P>
    <P>The Irish public service broadcasting system has served the nation well.  It is internationally recognised as such and, overall, retains the affection and respect of the Irish public.  RTE radio, despite the individual criticisms which can be made of it from time to time, has been able to retain a large audience for a widely varied and highly informative service. It provides a reasonable balance between information, education and entertainment in a way which is beneficial to society.  Irish sound broadcasting in its legal form has not succumbed to crass commercialism and does not seek to hold a large audience by arranging its programming at the level of the lowest common denominator of public taste.</P>
    <P>The fact that RTE radio has been able to hold its audience in this manner is a credit to those law makers who determined that Irish sound broadcasting should be a public service and should seek to provide an appropriate balance of information, education and entertainment in its schedule.  The decision to opt for this form of broadcasting service and to reject a broadcasting service based on commercial interests was not accidental on the part of earlier legislators. It reflected a philosophy that broadcasting has a purpose to serve the public interest and that this purpose was likely to be obstructed by the increasing of commercial interests.</P>
    <P>We know the philosophy of previous <Col N="1666" /> legislators and of the Broadcasting Review Committee of 1974 on the subject of broadcasting.  We do not, however, know the Minister's philosophy in setting out to fundamentally change Irish sound broadcasting because he has never stated a philosophy of broadcasting.  Instead, he is simply reacting pragmatically to pressure groups.</P>
    <P>The Bill before us is grossly deficient on the grounds that it says nothing about the objectives of the new broadcasting system which the Minister wishes to inaugurate.  Beyond imposing a requirement that a minimum of time be given over to news and current affairs and that a maximum time limit is placed on advertising, the Bill has nothing to say about the philosophy of broadcasting which will redesign the new system.  Nor has the Minister given us any information of substance of the likely consequences financially and in programming terms of setting up a private radio system in opposition to RTE's existing national broadcasting service.  The Minister has said nothing of substance about the financial implications for RTE of subjecting them to intense commercial pressure from a rival radio system inside the country at a time when they are under immense commercial pressure from competition, especially in television from abroad.  To avoid this issue, as the Minister has done, is an act of gross irresponsibility.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Minister is opting for private commercial ownership of local radio and has ignored totally the argument put forward by those, including the Labour Party, who believe that a significant segment of local airwaves should be given over to non-commercial community groups, thus democratising the airwaves to the greatest extent possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Energy (Mr. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy does not seriously believe that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ToddyOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>We do indeed.  The Minister I believe has said that he will meet this need at a later date &mdash; live horse get grass.  In fact, however, he has pre-empted the position in this Bill.  The <Col N="1667" /> Minister in truth does not believe in the rights of communities to own and run their own broadcasting service.  He believes in the right of private individuals and commercial interests to run local radio instead.</P>
      <P>I believe the motives behind this Bill are clear.  The Government wish to hand out licences to owners and, in return, to be eventually rewarded in terms of sympathetic coverage.  I believe too that the Government party have felt for a considerable time that their views do not receive sufficient sympathy from RTE presenters and programme makers.  For this reason they are setting out in this Bill to teach RTE a lesson.  I want to say that if Fianna Fáil feel they receive unfair treatment from RTE they can make known their feelings through long-standing procedures.  The Government have no right to seek to punish RTE in a way which places the quality of Irish broadcasting itself at serious risk.</P>
      <P>We in the Labour Party accept that apart from the need to put illegal broadcasters out of business, the broadcasting system cannot stand still.  Changes are necessary.  What is important, however, is whether we wish to use the airwaves in ways which enhance the public interest or whether we wish simply to hand them over to private interests to do with them virtually what they wish under minimal public control.  Labour reject the latter approach.  What we have before us is a Bill, the effects of which will be to introduce two commercial tiers into broadcasting in Ireland.  There will be little public responsibility in terms of news and current affairs output, which will represent 20 per cent of programmes of total output.  All the other conditions attached to licences are essentially at the discretion of the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Bill as published the Minister has presumed unto himself large powers over the appointment of the advisory committee.  I certainly welcome any diminution of these powers and will be supporting the motion from the Irish <Col N="1668" /> Congress of Trade Unions that a Statutory Radio Authority should have representatives of community interests in order that some protection be provided against the threat posed to broadcasting standards by throwing open the airwaves to commercial operators.  I will be asking the Minister to ensure that the advisory committee have representatives from the trade union movement, since this is the biggest voluntary organisation in the country and represents half a million workers.  I will also be seeking a change in the Bill's proposal that the committee's meetings be held in private because I believe that public accountability is extremely important where broadcasting is concerned.  I could understand confidentiality on some issues, but I feel that the general business of meetings must be open to public scrutiny and comment.  If the Minister has any particular political or other reason for wanting secrecy at these meetings I think he should spell out his reasons to the House today.</P>
    <P>I am also unhappy with the sections of the Bill which concern the applications for licence and the criteria under which these licences may be provided.  As I have already stated in my comments on the Telegraphy Bill, I believe this Bill should be put through at the earliest possible moment and all those operators who defy the new law should be deemed ineligible for licences under the Sound Broadcasting Bill.  On the last occasion, when both Bills were before the House, I said that the Labour Party would be prepared to go ahead with the Boardcasting and Wireless Telegraphy Bill, 1987, to ensure that the airwaves were cleared of illegal operators and that anybody who behaved illegally would not be eligible.  This is an effective way of determining the character of those who apply for licences under the new legislation and to flush out their attitudes to the law of the land.  Those operators who would continue to abuse the law after the implementation of the Telegraphy Bill should be immediately barred from operating radio stations under the Sound Broadcasting Bill.</P>
    <P>Apart from the Bill being wholly on who should be granted a licence, section <Col N="1669" /> 3 is also inadequate on determination in relation to applications for the granting of sound broadcasting licences.  This section is at best aspirational and at worst totally ineffective.  The Bill on this section runs the risk of falling into the same pattern as British broadcasting.  For example, I understand that applicants for licences under the British legislation promised to provide a measure of news, documentaries and varying musical programmes. These promises were made by all types of operators when they applied for licences but when they came to operate on the air they were unable to provide this variety and they then had to appeal their case.  On several occasions the British public ended up with wall to wall pop music from licensees who had promised a dynamic and progressive service to the British public on their initial applications.</P>
    <P>Section 3 reminds me of the British experience and I should like to put the Minister on alert to this situation.  He should know that if the section is to be effective, it must be tightened up with safeguards to ensure that we do not experience what happened under the British legislation.</P>
    <P>I should also like to refer to section 7 of the Bill which concerns variation of terms or conditions of a sound broadcasting licence.  I ask the Minister what is to stop a licensee promising to provide a variety of services and programmes and then being unable to do so after a period of time and simply changing the conditions under which the licence was issued.  The Minister must be aware of the enormous loophole in the legislation on this point which is unacceptable to the Labour Party.</P>
    <P>I should like to again commit the Labour Party to their support for public service broadcasting.  During our term in Government we went a long way towards the development of legislation which would have given a fair crack of the whip to RTE.  I regret that the present Bill does not even attempt to do that.  The Bill has very serious and long-term implications for RTE both in terms of revenue, jobs and the quality of programming.  We supported the then Minister, Deputy Jim <Col N="1670" /> Mitchell but, unfortunately, we fell at the last hurdle.  That was a bitter disappointment to the Labour Party because it was one of the 14 points under which we went into Government.  We clearly understood that broadcasting would be developed by democratically controlled community interests.  Unfortunately, that was not acceptable to the Minister, Deputy Mitchell, at the time, which was regrettable.  The Labour Party took up a position which they still hold and if at some stage they contemplated entering Government, that option is open to them.  It is something to which we would have to give very serious consideration and I will be suggesting to my party that it would be one of the pre-conditions.</P>
    <P>There is a unique facility in Cork which has been under-utilised.  RTE in Cork has not been expanded to any great degree since it was introduced by a Labour Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, Dr. Conor Cruise O'Brien.  The facility has served the city of Cork and the surrounding area very well.  They have a full-time, professional staff who are capable of producing better things and I ask the Minister to give due consideration to expanding the Cork service because it rates very highly in the southern area.</P>
    <P>The Bill is a regressive step although its effects will not be felt for four or five years&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the House is aware that two Bills are being debated, the Sound Broadcasting Bill, 1987, and the Broadcasting and Wireless Telegraphy Bill, 1987, but that they will be voted on separately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ToddyOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I dealt with the other Bill previously, so I confined my remarks on this occasion to the Sound Broadcasting Bill, 1987.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>This is most welcome legislation as it has been obvious for some considerable time that radical changes in the radio broadcasting legislation are required.  It is an indictment of our whole <Col N="1671" /> parliamentary system that simple, sensible legislation like this took so long to come before us.</P>
      <P>I will deal mainly with the Sound Broadcasting Bill, 1987, which offers for the first time freedom of choice of the airwaves, freedom of competition for listeners, a breach of State monopoly and the chance of a totally developed broadcasting at community and national level, which must surely be welcomed.  The Bill, when it comes into operation, will afford the most exciting prospects and the opportunity for talent to flourish in the area of broadcasting, which must also be welcomed.  In the words of one editorial, the Bill offers a challenging prospect and one which promises to revolutionise the airwaves over the next few years.  I cannot, therefore, understand the dismal comments of the last speaker on the Bill. The proposals provide for an expansion of the radio service by providing additional capacity to the tune of at least one national independent station, 24 community or county stations and up to 100 town and neighbourhood stations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There cannot but be broad consensus on these particular issues.  A further area touched on by the Bill is the format of the Government body to regulate the system.  That has already attracted a degree of hostile attention, with which I wish to deal first.  The emphasis in the Minister's proposals is to establish the simplest structure possible to administer and regulate the radio service and, therefore, to minimise the cost to the taxpayer and the potential radio operator.  This seems to be a sensible approach. However, this proposal has met with a small storm of protest from those who occasionally find themselves on the left. It is difficult to understand why, because the criteria established in the Bill for judging any application for a licence are clear-cut and straightforward.  It is not necessary to establish an elaborate authority to oversee this operation.  The last thing needed at this stage is yet another bureaucratic structure to put its dead hand on development.  The Minister indicated in his speech that he is open to <Col N="1672" /> advice and suggestion in this matter.  My advice to the Minister &mdash; for what it is worth &mdash; is to keep the whole area simpler. The Minister's argument that radio services do not need or warrant the creation of another bureaucratic authority is correct.  The print media in this country do not suffer the restricting yoke of any regulatory authority controlling, monitoring and overseeing their output.  Why should radio have to operate under such a yoke?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right.  I am not in favour of restrictive measures in any form in this area.  The yoke should be lifted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ToddyOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">

    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>If this Bill is amended to the point where we place new broadcasting stations under a comprehensive system of detailed control, we will strangle the broadcasting initiative at birth, which would be a tragedy.  Members of the National Association of Community Broadcasting, in their welcome for the Bill, seemed to make a great deal of sense when they praised the simple, non-complex way in which the Bill achieves its aims while suggesting that a few fundamental guidelines are desirable.</P>
      <P>The second aspect of the legislation which I wish to touch on is the place of community broadcasting in the new order.  In County Wicklow there are two fine examples of what I regard as the peak of community broadcasting.  In north Wicklow, Bray Local Broadcasting has been operating since August 1979 and provides&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="ToddyOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not their fault.  It is up to this House to introduce legislation to bring some sense to the air waves.  This station has been providing a unique mix <Col N="1673" /> of programmes to the people of north Wicklow and south County Dublin.  The stereotype image which is being put forward in this House of a mindless diet of pop and more pop is shattered when you look at stations like BLB.  Another stereotype image of the so-called pirates is also shattered by this station.  Far from being a buccaneering non-tax paying profiteering, money spinning venture, BLB is entirely a community-based organisation. Its management committee is democratically representative of the various interests in the community.  It is a co-operative venture with all the profits, if any, ploughed back into the co-op and being invested in expanding community based broadcasting.  The station offers a community service in the best sense of the word.  It provides a mix of music, jazz, classical, Irish, etc., and popular programmes, general chat shows and has open access to various community organisations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ToddyOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure your Labour colleague in Wicklow will be interested in what you are saying.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ToddyOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no provision in the Bill for such a structure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>Nor is there anything in the Bill which would destroy such a structure. If we take the Deputy's route this structure has no opportunity of taking root at all.  In south Wicklow, Arklow community radio has for the last six years provided the same type of community-based station.  This station is again a cooperative venture and it offers the people of south Wicklow and north Wexford a unique brand of local broadcasting and it deals not only with an urban situation but also with a rural situation.  It is my belief that the Touche Ross report is correct when it suggests that it would be very difficult indeed for pure speculative investors to get the type of return on investment from small town, or even county stations, which a typical investor <Col N="1674" /> would be seeking.  This being the case, I submit that when it comes to licensing special attention should be given to the role of community stations such as BLB and the Arklow station.  If there is a choice to be made for a licence between a community station and a commercial applicant in an individual case, I would favour the licensing authority coming down in favour of the community stations. Doing so would, I suggest, enhance the long term viability of any station.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>It would also ensure that the broadest possible mix of programming would be available.  This comes to a point Deputy O'Sullivan has made, how do we define a community station.  We already have a ready-made definition available to us.  I am sure the Deputy has been circulated with a copy by the National Association of Community Broadcasting.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;which fulfils these charter requirements is a community broadcasting station, any station which does not fulfil those is not.  The simple broadcasting of a couple of stray dog notices as we get on some of the Dublin pop stations does not turn that commercial enterprise into a community enterprise.  This is an important point because Deputy Richard Bruton in putting forward Fine Gael's response came dangerously close to adopting a policy which has been peddled and which has been circulated to Members of this House by one of the Dublin commercial stations. This station which exists on an unvaried diet of hot hits has been suggesting that in a fit of benevolence the four commercial stations would sponsor a community access programme of what they call in their piece of paper &ldquo;baby stations&rdquo;.  This concept would deny any community stations any real control of <Col N="1676" /> their operations and would put them at the whim of purely commercial operators. I cannot believe that this is what Deputy Bruton or indeed what Fine Gael want to happen.</P>
      <P>I hope that the licensing authority will be mindful of the National Association for Community Broadcasting's charter. When it comes to licensing, incorporating the charter in the guidelines of the licensing body would do no harm.</P>
      <P>A final point I should like to touch on is the position of RTE.  They have taken more than their fair share of criticism over the years, some of it justified, much of it not justified.  This Bill should not be seen as undermining RTE as the national public broadcasting service for Ireland. Rather than see the proposals as a threat I submit that RTE should see the new order as a challenge.  I hope that the Bill will have a speedy passage through this and through the other House.  I hope also that politicians who have been messing about with broadcasting reform for the last decade will desist from any further obstructionism.  There has been enough political messing in this matter for ten years now.  I hope that this positive legislation will not be impeded by cant or by any unreal ideological arguments being trotted out for whatever reasons by people on the Left.</P>

      <P>The fact of the matter is that the then Government in which I was a Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and subsequently Minister for Communications agreed the heads of a Bill. That Government at that time included a Member of this House who subsequently and without notice, having resigned from the Government in the meantime, opposed the same Bill.  That was submitted to the then Joint Committee on Legislation, where it was discussed during a period of eight months.  Neither before its publication by the Government nor during that eight month period was there any intimation to me as Minister from <Col N="1678" /> any of my Labour colleagues that there was the slightest problem with the Bill but after the Joint Committee on Legislation completed their report a press conference was convened within a week, without any notice to me and the first I heard of the Labour Party &ldquo;problems&rdquo; was in the newspapers.  Subsequently, amazed though I was, I tried to discuss with the Labour Party what exactly they wanted. After many meetings, always with different people from deputations from the Labour Party, it was clear that that party did not know what they wanted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, needless to say I rebut entirely the outrageous assertion made by Deputy O'Sullivan and what I have said can be fully vindicated from papers which are in my possession which are a record of what went on in discussions during my period as Minister.</P>
      <P>One of the things I feel very sore about is my own failure as Minister to finalise the arrangements in relation to radio. They were frustrated by a total lack of consistency on the part of the Labour Party whose Ministers in Government had several times approved the proposals put to this House.  There is not much point in going on about that anymore; what we now need is to get good legislation passed and implemented.  I consider that the editorials which welcomed the publication of the Sound Broadcasting Bill &mdash; the Broadcasting and Wireless Telegraphy Bill is the same as that which I published &mdash; were premature in that they commented on the Bill as if it had already been passed and in place. That is nearly three months ago.  There are many hurdles still to be overcome. The House has a duty to confront this issue and to provide sensible legislation to deal with this issue and to implement and enforce that legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been a lack of will to enforce legislation and that includes legislation in regard to transport, road traffic, health <Col N="1680" /> contributions, etc.  I suppose it is best highlighted by the failure to enforce the wireless telegraphy legislation against the pirate stations.  The House will recall that in May 1983 soon after I became Minister I decided it was time to enforce that legislation, to get the pirates off the air and to get in new legislation.  They were put off the air but, unfortunately, that resulted in marches on the street and scurrying backbenchers of all parties, including the Labour Party, pressurising the Government not to enforce the legislation. Overnight it became Government policy to phase in legal local radio as we phased out illegal local radio.  I have to say that the political difficulties caused by the Labour Party were exacerbated by the typical opportunism of the Fianna Fáil Party in Opposition when they opposed everything.  My party in Opposition are not going to oppose everything but we certainly are going to propose constructive improvements to legislation before the House.</P>
    <P>One of the dangers in a debate in relation to radio is that many people with very strong points of view have their own perceptions of what sort of radio broadcasting we should have.  We hear such phrases as &ldquo;public service broadcasting&rdquo; and proposals which sound reasonable when presented in regard to the requirements about culture and language.  As Minister I had great trouble in resisting imposing what essentially would have been a middle-aged, middle-class and middle-brow regime on local broadcasting. If other people had their way we would have a stale socialist regime for broadcasting which would not even reflect modern-day socialism or modern day working-class attitudes or requirements in relation to broadcasting.</P>
    <P>Both this and the other House will want to be extremely careful not to try to say in legislation what is good for the listener and that this is what we are going to provide.  At the end of the day it is the listener who will decide what form independent broadcasting is going to take.  Presumably, when this legislation is enacted a broadcasting authority which I hope will emerge in this Bill &mdash; it is not <Col N="1681" /> in it as yet but I am sure that this House is going to see to it that it will be included &mdash; will provide licences consistent with viable radio to reflect the desires of the listening audience.  It is they who ultimately will decide the success or failure of particular stations and not the overwhelming middle-class propensities of this House.  As I have said, it would be both a shame and a disaster if we were to end up with a middle-class, middle-aged and middle-brow broadcasting system.</P>
    <P>We want a vibrant alternative radio which will provide a number of different forms of alternatives.  There are many types of listening audience.  There are those who want to listen to wall-to-wall, hot hit music 24 hours a day.  There are others who want to listen to country and western music all day.  There are others who want to listen to a lot of politics all day &mdash; God help us &mdash; and there are others who want to listen to religious broadcasting all day.  Indeed, I received more correspondence in relation to the Irish Christian Broadcasting Service, which is a religious pirate station, than I did about anything else.  There is room for special interest groups in broadcasting.</P>
    <P>Much of the variety which can be provided for the listening audience will be constrained by the size of the audience. At the end of the day the size of the audience will only be able to support so many stations.  That is a matter which the Touche Ross report addressed.  I believe that report, which, was commissioned by the then existing independent local radio commission, is too conservative.  If Touche Ross are to be believed, we will end up with no more than three or four local radio stations.  They are too conservative in that respect.</P>
    <P>In my view there is room for several more of what I would call local radio stations as distinct from community radio stations and many more community radio stations which would either operate as separate community stations for a specific number of hours per day or per week independently or, alternatively, and I see this as a more likely long-term development, operate as satellites of wider local <Col N="1682" /> radio stations.  The community station could serve a local area and opt out of a wider local service for so many hours per day or per week.  That does not exclude independent community services but it is likely that such an opting out procedure will take place in years to come.  It is important that in this legislation we allow for such a variety of developments.</P>
    <P>I accept that there are a number of community stations in existence today, mainly pirates.  From the information available to me it appears that some of those stations are extremely good examples of what good legal community stations should be.  When the Bill is passed, and this applies more to independent local radio stations as distinct from the pirate stations, such stations will have to observe provisions in other legislation.  For example, they will have to comply with social legislation concerning the condition of office premises and conditions of employment.  The chances are that the cost structure for legal services will be somewhat higher than that of illegal stations who not only break wireless telegraphy legislation but also contravence laws concerning PRSI, PAYE, and so on.  We ought to recognise that there will be a cost penalty for legal radio compared to illegal stations. Touche Ross recognised that in their report and, perhaps, gave undue weight to that penalty when deciding that a specific number of stations should be allowed operate.</P>
    <P>A central omission in the Bill, if not the central omission, is the absence of an independent regulatory authority for independent broadcasting.  Broadcasting will not be independent if it is left to the Minister of the day to grant licences.  I was disappointed to hear Deputy Roche reiterating the Minister's initial proposal. The Minister, having heard the unanimous reaction of Opposition parties, said he had no hang-ups about this matter and that we would have an independent authority, but it appears that there has been a climb down on that.  I should like to warn the Minister that we will be tabling amendments requiring the setting <Col N="1683" /> up of an independent broadcasting commission or authority to deal with the licensing of local and commercial broadcasting. I am certain that such amendments will be carried by the House.</P>
    <P>The argument put forward by Deputy Roche was that we should not have another layer of bureaucracy, a fashionable type of argument.  We do not want another layer of bureaucracy if we can help it, but I have been advised that the cost of an independent commission would be quite small and, in those circumstances, highly desirable.  I do not think anybody can be under any illusion about the danger of putting in the hands of a Minister, who is subject to pressures of all types, the power to licence radio stations.  It would not be a good move and I hope the Minister will accept our view that it would not be advisable to take on that power and that there should be a statutory independent body to licence stations.</P>
    <P>The Minister has told us that he will have an advisory committee to assist him but that is not good enough.  We must have a statutory body that will be independent of the Minister.  People may say that the Minister will appoint such a statutory body and that is true.  The Minister appoints the RTE Authority but the broadcasting legislation was amended in 1976 to ensure that that Authority will be independent and could not be dismissed at the whim of a Minister or Government. Under that legislation the Authority can be dismissed only by a decision of both Houses of the Oireachtas.  I suggest similar provisions in relation to independent broadcasting.  We must remember that the Minister has spoken of a national commercial radio station and a national commercial television station.</P>
    <P>There have been developments in relation to cable satellite television and we may have, although this has slowed down somewhat, direct broadcasting satellites. Those developments will have implications outside of RTE.  The great weakness in the argument of those who want to protect RTE from any competition is that we cannot do so because <Col N="1684" /> through cable television we have the British stations and we will have direct broadcasting.  As technology develops, broadcasting will become an international issue which will not recognise national frontiers.  That will give rise to questions as to how we should regulate such broadcasting or, if we can regulate it will national parliaments have the power to do so?  In many respects national parliaments will not be in a position to regulate because they will be dealing with trans-frontier issues.  Such matters are being discussed at EC level and, more importantly, at Council of Europe level. Many questions arise in regard to this issue such as advertising standards, copyright and national security.  We must look at those issues in a new context because of the developments in technology.  In the context of this legislation that will mean that in regard to television and radio, competition is unavoidable.  That was the big weakness in the position of the Labour Party, in so far as a clear position was discernable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I was simply correcting the Deputy's suggestion that international competition exists, which is a profoundly ignorant opinion, since 80 per cent of the trash of the world comes from two countries, Canada and the United States of America.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Anyone who tries to prevent competition in broadcasting might as well have been out on Killiney beach last night trying to hold back the tide.  It is impossible, yet a small number of people have been able to hold back legislation to provide for legal competition, as distinct from the illegal competition which we have had to endure for so many years.  I do not intend to dwell at length on the international issues which now arise and the need for an effective international forum to deal with these issues.  A great deal of progress has been made in the Council of Europe in teasing out the international issues but it is painstakingly slow.  Even less progress has been made at EC level, perhaps rightly so since this question is bigger than the EC.  The Minister when replying might give the up-to-date position in relation to the Council of Europe and the EC on the many issues which arise covering such questions as copyright, public morality, public security and advertising.</P>
      <P>I have already made it quite clear that this party will be proposing amendments to make provision for an independent broadcasting commission or authority. The omission of provision for such a body is a central weakness in this Bill.  We will oppose a Bill which does not include that provision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, at the launching press conference, talked about county stations as if all counties had similar population figures and topography.  Some counties have mountain ranges which affect the radiation of signals from a transmitter. Some countries are odd-shaped, such as Roscommon or Leitrim.  The south of <Col N="1686" /> County Louth is close to Dublin.  To talk in terms of county stations is even more absurd then trying to maintain signals within national frontiers.  That is not the way it will work.  A number of factors must be taken into account, especially the demographic and topographic factors.  The size of population will be a significant factor in deciding how many stations can be sustained, because most stations will depend on advertising. There is a finite advertising pool.  There will be some stations, perhaps, which will not want advertising but will be funded by subscriptions, as the Irish Christian Broadcasting Service seems to be.  Talk about county stations was simplistic and showed a lack of grasp of the subject by the Minister which can perhaps be explained by his desire to get on with the legislation, a desire I fully share.  I should not like him to be hoist with his own petard by speaking along those lines. These matters should not be decided by the Minister but by an independent regulatory authority if and when it is set up.</P>
    <P>The ownership and security of transmitters is another central question.  What about the transmitters belonging to stations which discontinue broadcasting for some reason, for example, bankruptcy? In the Bill which I introduced we provided that transmitters would in the case of premature or untimely closing or closure due to bankruptcy, fall into the temporary ownership of the independent commission for a period of, say, six months and would be exempt from the provisions of bankruptcy legislation so as to allow for the continuity of broadcasting while alternative contractors or franchisees were sought out for that service. If we have a total free for all, as some Deputies and others would wish, and allow stations to come and go with the minimum of regulation, there is a danger that we will have slapdash broadcasting with stations here today and gone tomorrow. While I am in favour of minimalist regulation, I enter the <i>caveat</i> that it must be consistent with viable and vibrant radio.  There is no point in having stations on the air which will collapse within a few months.  We would end up with greater <Col N="1687" /> confusion than at present.  There must be some minimalist control which will be dictated by the desires and the size of the listening audience.</P>
    <P>What if a licensed station collapses and there is a strong local demand for it to resume?  The previous legislation made provision for this.  Perhaps the Minister would elaborate on the control of transmitters in that situation.  There is also the question of the security of transmitters so that they could not be seized by subversive groups and used for purposes which the law never intended.  I presume the Minister or the commission will lay down minimum standards of security.</P>
    <P>A further problem is the maintenance of transmitters and the adjustment of their focus from time to time.  In the United Kingdom the Independent Broadcasting Authority took on the role of maintaining transmitters and of making whatever technical changes had to be made.  That frequently meant that the broadcasting stations had problems with the transmitters which affected the range and more often the quality of sound received by the listeners, who had to wait months until the IBA were ready to do the maintenance work.  That was highly undesirable.  It affected the quality of alternative radio.  It is important that situation would not be repeated here.  I understand that since then changes have been made in the United Kingdom and that is no longer the case.  I think that local stations now maintain their own transmitters.  I certainly hope that will be the case here.  In addition, I hope that a minimum technical criterion will be laid down requiring stations to give a proper quality of sound.</P>
    <P>It is also important that the maintenance of transmitters is correct and up-to-date so as to avoid co-channel interference or interference with television or telephones.  It is a fact that in certain parts of the city, in the vicinity of these stations, that when the people who live there pick up their telephone they find to their utter annoyance that they cannot make or receive phone calls because they <Col N="1688" /> hear the local pirate station which is interfering with the line.  I know also of one or two cases very close to an illegal station in my own constituency &mdash; which I did my best to close down and I was not very popular for doing that &mdash; that if you put a fork on your washing machine you could hear the illegal station.  That is no joke. Those problems could be very well repeated when we have legal local radio. Obviously whether it is the Minister or an independent Authority who will grant licences they will only grant licences that have technical clearance.  Licences will be granted for particular frequencies on the spectrum.  However, if the equipment is maintained badly and diverts from those frequencies the same type of interference both with other stations at home and abroad, with other television services and indeed with people's telephones etc. could arise.  That is why there is a need for proper technical maintenance and that the maintenance should be overseen by the technical people in the Department of Communications.  The Department have the technical competence and they should be able to enforce the legislation. Otherwise we could have as many, if not more, problems than we have already in this area.</P>
    <P>While I am on the question of interference with other stations, a more worrying aspect is that not only do the present pirate stations interfere with other stations, some at home and some abroad &mdash; we are subject to international law as well as domestic law and have obligations internationally &mdash; but they frequently interfere with the emergency services, the Garda, the fire brigade, and the ambulance service.  Although to be fair, almost any time such a problem has arisen a telephone call to locate people quickly has almost always been responded to and the interference has ceased until it arises again.</P>
    <P>A very worrying problem is the problem with non-vocal means of communication, such as instrument landing systems at airports.  This is where the real danger arises from straying outside the legally authorised frequencies on the spectrum.  There have been cases where <Col N="1689" /> the instrument landing systems, which are non-vocal means of communication, have been interfered with.  When you are listening to a radio station you can hear interference or if you are in an ambulance you can hear the interference and you can complain about it, but the problem in non-vocal systems such as instrument landing systems is that nobody will know the instrument landing system is a bit off key and, in fact, you might be on the wrong flight path.  I would not want to raise any scares but this is a problem.</P>
    <P>There have been pirate stations in the vicinity of our airports and there have been cases of interference with vocal means of communication such as radio systems which communicate with aircraft, or Radio Éireann or the BBC. There is also a danger of interference with non-vocal means of communication, the principal one being instrument landing systems.  That is why it is terribly important to have the legislation passed and to ensure that the technical frequencies are wisely chosen and that we make provision to ensure they are enforced.  That would require the enforcement of proper maintenance standards, etc.</P>
    <P>I do not know how long it will take this legislation to pass through both Houses of the Oireachtas.  Clearly it will take a number of weeks.  That having been done, there is the question of how do you phase out illegal radio as you phase in legal radio.  I would not be surprised if this question has still eluded solution in the Department of Communications. The thorny question is at what point do you close down pirate stations?  What will public reaction be to this?  How soon can you get legal stations into place?  It seems likely that there will be a gap of some months.  I will explain why.</P>
    <P>First, if contracts are issued, any reasonable investor who is going to invest in a broadcasting station is going to want to know precisely or as much as they can about the market in which they are operating.  They will want to be assured for instance about the number of stations planned which they will be competing with as that is the only way they are going <Col N="1690" /> to know the market share they can hope to have.  Some of the people could have very good plans laid for an independent broadcasting service on the basis that they were going to be the only one.  Touche Ross may say the market is such a size, but they could think differently and if they got 15 per cent market share they would break even, because they would be the only service other than RTE.  If having made their investment, suddenly there is going to be a second, third and a fourth station licensed, the groundwork is changed.  That is no basis for planning. The Minister or the Authority will have to make clear from the outset (a) what number of stations they intend to license and the range and franchise area and (b) and that the broadcasting and wireless telegraphy legislation is powerful enough, effective enough and that it will be enforced to remove all unlicensed competition from the field.  Otherwise you will create enormous difficulty in business planning.  You will create obstacles, not to put it any stronger, for people making the investment decision to go ahead and seek a franchise and to become involved in radio.  These issues have to be resolved.</P>
    <P>Given the political weaknesses &mdash; and I fully own up as being part of that weakness over the past ten years &mdash; about enforcing existing broadcasting and wireless telegraphy legislation, I think that investors will want to be assured that the new broadcasting and wireless telegraphy legislation before the House today is going to be effective and will be enforced. That means putting pirate stations off the air in advance.  It would be necessary anyway from a technical point of view because the frequency spectrum, although with modern technology it is less limited than it used to be, is still finite. There are only so many stations with such ranges that can be fitted into the spectrum which has been allocated to this country. For technical reasons as well as our international obligations there has to be a clearing of the spectrum.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister could tell us how he sees the transition being handled.  How long will the transition take?  How soon <Col N="1691" /> will we have legal services up and running after the close down of illegal services? How does the Minister see it happening? At what point will the illegal services be put off the air?  Will pirate stations qualify to apply while still on the air?  What time will be needed, for instance, to acquire studios and transmitters, to get planning permission and staff?  Planning permission alone takes a minimum of two months after the application is lodged with the local authority and if there is an appeal it could be another six or ten months, and that after the legislation is set up.  That is not allowing even for the necessary drawing of plans, acquisition of sites etc.  That is why I thought that some of the editorials when the Minister had his press conference were a little premature in congratulating him on solving this problem.  Had there been similar editorials five years ago I would have introduced the legislation then.</P>
    <P>Many hurdles have to be overcome yet and I hope the Minister has what Deputy John Boland calls the &ldquo;bottom&rdquo; to tackle this problem and see this matter right through.  The problem will not be solved in a matter of days or even weeks.  It will require the Minister's full and extensive energy &mdash; which he has in abundance &mdash; and commitment over a long period.  Let us face it, one reason this problem has not been tackled is the political fall-out of closing down certain pirate stations.  It may be a little less than it was in 1983 when I had the temerity to try to close them down.  There are problems, and the Minister is a Minister in a minority Government.</P>
    <P>The nonsensical behaviour that has been a feature of this House for the last ten years, with Oppositions recklessly opposing, should be ended for all time. The approach from all sides of the House should be constructive and sensible in tackling and solving problems.  That is the approach I will advise my party to adopt and they will need no pushing on that. We want this problem solved.  We do not <Col N="1692" /> want directives and nonsensical opposition put in the way of the present Minister such as was put in my way when I was Minister.</P>
    <P>I hope Second Stage of this Bill will be passed before many more weeks elapse. We will need a couple of weeks between that and Committee Stage so that all Members of the House will have an opportunity to frame constructive amendments to improve this legislation, in particular amendments dealing with the setting up of an independent broadcasting commission.  I hope the Committee Stage will not rush through this House because it is important that we refine and improve this Bill.  I hope also it will not take too long to get it through this House and the other House so that we can start on the road to sorting out a problem which for too long has not been resolved and has been allowed to fester because of political inaction.  Whatever justification can be adduced for that inaction, action has not been taken and the problem has not been resolved.  Let us aspire to have these problems solved as quickly as possible.  If one year from today we have a satisfactory legal regime of radio installed we will be doing well. That should be our minimum objective.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Mitchell for allowing us a rare insight into the workings of the Coalition.  I sympathise fully with his position.  We should note his comments and appreciate his experience on this legislation, and I am looking to phase 2 from Deputy Higgins who, I understand, has something to say after my contribution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In introducing this legislation this Government recognise the right of our people to communicate at national level. and community neighbourhood level. The new legislation will cause increased competition on the airwaves, in particular for RTE.  RTE have been referred to and we should comment on their position in debating this matter.  This will have a positive effect on our national radio-television station and I have no doubt they will meet this challenge as <Col N="1693" /> they met the challenge from illegal pirate stations for a number of years.</P>
    <P>The challenging task facing the Minister is the setting up of a new independent commercial radio structure involving one national station that will reach every valley in the country, as he said.  Up to 24 local stations, up to 100 town size and a further 100 neighbourhood stations will be provided.  Unlike his predecessors, this Minister has faced up to his task and placed innovative, practical legislation before this House.  He has been open to suggestions, and I look forward to Committee Stage when, the Minister said, he looks forward to proposals and amendments.</P>
    <P>The Minister is, in effect, opening up the airwaves to the people and finally outlawing the pirates.  In commenting on these Bills I pay tribute to the role of RTE in providing an excellent service over the last 60 years.  They have competed with the best in the world.  I refer the Minister to a point made by an RTE trade union.  I know many Deputies, like myself, received various documentation about this.  The points the trade union made are valid and should be noted, that while it is intended to allow ten minutes' commercial time in any hour for the new commercial stations, RTE are allowed only seven and a half minutes' commercial time in any one hour.  There is also no legal limit on the hours of broadcasting for the new commercial stations. We must ensure that we do not discriminate unfairly against RTE in introducing this legislation.  There may be a requirement to amend the Broadcasting Authority (Amendment) Act, 1976 to allow RTE to compete on an equal basis. I understand RTE at present are allowed to carry no commercial advertising between the hours of 7 and 11 p.m.</P>
    <P>The legislation before the House is in line with international developments. The last Government, sad to say, squabbled in public for four years on their proposed Radio Bill on ideological grounds and allowed up to 70 pirate radio stations to operate illegally.  These two Bills will bring to an end this state of chaos on the airwaves that was bringing <Col N="1694" /> the law into disrepute and interfering seriously with RTE and the emergency services.  The days of illegal broadcasting are over.</P>
    <P>I welcome the setting up of the two local radio stations in the Dublin area. This will bring all of us into the airwaves in our city and county.  The problem of illegal stations has been particularly acute in the Dublin area and it was not just the interference with our airwaves that was so undesirable and irritating, but the proliferation of illegal masts on the Dublin mountains is a most unwelcome development. As one living close to the Dublin mountains I say it has a devastating visual effect on the south Dublin mountains.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision for the setting up of a neighbourhood or local community station.  As a result of the mobility of people in County Dublin and the insular and lonely existence of many people, particularly elderly, in modern suburbia, there is an urgent need to build up a sense of community in the Dublin area.  The establishment of a neighbourhood radio service will lead to a vibrant, hopeful and living community that can communicate and discuss, reach out to the lonely and bring people together.  It will make a pleasant change from the plethora of illegal stations at present infringing on the privacy of our homes.  This legislation will be of considerable benefit to the blind and will allow them to play a more active role in their own communities.  In effect, these Bills create the environment and atmosphere that will allow the talents and investments potential of this country to be realised in the world of broadcasting.</P>
    <P>The implications for employment are worthy of note.  The Minister said 800 to 1,000 people will be employed in the new services to be set up under this Bill. Government interference will be minimal. The new service will, in effect, regulate itself.  The sole source of income will be advertising and this will mean healthy competition.  The stations will survive only if they have the audience.  The stations to be established under the Bill should reflect Irish culture, Irish language and a minimum amount of news and current affairs.  The previous Minister referred to <Col N="1695" /> this point and we will all have our own views on it.  I should like to express some of my own views during the course of the debate.</P>
    <P>The Minister is anxious that the new radio regime will not simply provide wall to wall music.  This is a very desirable objective.  With the growth in the number of satellite TV channels the level of wall to wall music in our homes is at an all time high.  Many of us have had our fill of the computerised music that is thumped out on these stations and, indeed, is also dished out at times by RTE 2.  I want to give as an example a song that was recently in our charts called &ldquo;You Are Always On My Mind&rdquo; which was recorded by a group called Pet Shop Boys.  This was an upbeat version of a Willie Nelson song and I believe it was an insult to many music lovers like myself. Obviously this is not a question for legislation but, to digress I might say that the music industry should seriously consider banning this type of treatment of established and well-loved songs.  If this trend continues as it is at present there will be many redundant drummers in the years ahead as the natural sound of the drums is replaced with the aid of modern technology by computerised machine music. It is a very worrying trend and I certainly hope it will not continue in the future. For this reason I welcome the reference in the Bill to the quality of music.</P>
    <P>If I have one criticism of RTE 2 it is that we do not hear enough quality Irish performers on that station.  The previous speaker referred to young listeners and I accept that they represent the market we must reach out to.  Many young listeners would like to hear more of musicians and singers such as Mary Black, Christy Moore, De Danann, Davey Spillane, Paul Brady, Donal Lunny and Dolores Keane, to name but a few.  These are Irish men and women who embody in music the true traditional spirit and express it in modern day language and song.  They are, in effect, part of a cultural renaissance and this movement should be reflected on our airwaves.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1696" /> I might say that young people are not just interested in the modern day interpretation of traditional music as expressed by the artistes I have mentioned but are also very much aware of the vast resources of pure traditional music that is present in the country.  Any new radio regime should realise that it will have a responsibility to plumb this vast reservoir of traditional music which tells a story as it unfolds of the exciting new interpretations of this deep tradition. There is a wealth of material in this country and the new legislation should embody and recognise this vast source of Irish music that has been referred to by many speakers.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that there will be a requirement that all stations will have to carry a minimum amount of news and current affairs programming.  I should like to see some expansion of this proposal to include cultural, educational and historical matters.  The aim of this is to interrupt this wall to wall music and this is most desirable.  I am pleased that the existing pirates will not be debarred from applying for licences.  They are illegal establishments and their growth was obviously a response to public demand at a time when the existing broadcasting services were not responding to the needs of the public.  When they came on the scene they were an exciting new dimension to broadcasting and we should accept and face up to that fact.  When stations such as Radio Nova arrived on the scene, with good quality and a wide range of music, they gave valuable experience to young disc jockeys and journalists, may of whom have since moved on to RTE. The pirate stations were the catalysts for the establishment of RTE 2 and this proves the point that competition produces better service all round.</P>
    <P>The new legislation will be applied systematically to those pirate stations that persist in illegal broadcasting.  The penalties will be very severe for those who break the law: on summary conviction to a maximum fine of £800 or three months imprisonment, or, on conviction on indictment, to a maximum fine of £20,000 or two years imprisonment.  Those fines <Col N="1697" /> should be more than adequate to deter people from considering illegal broadcasting.</P>
    <P>This is a workable piece of legislation. The Minister has struck a balance between the objective of getting a variety of new radio services working and setting up the means to achieve this objective. The State is providing the environment to allow the public to respond, the Government are taking the minimal option of involvement and the Minister is not getting in the way.  He is not dictating to the public precisely what they can have.  The legislation ensures this essential degree of flexibility.</P>
    <P>A most important factor is cost.  This legislation will ensure the minimum cost to both the taxpayer and the potential radio operator.  The setting up of the advisory committee with total responsibility for assessing the applications for licences and for deciding who should get them will not be a costly exercise.  I welcome the fact that the Bill states clearly that not only the character of applicants and the technical and financial resources available to the applicant will be taken into account but that the quality, range and type of programmes proposed will also be taken into consideration.</P>
    <P>The introduction of a local community and neighbourhood radio service gives great scope for local news services involving schools and coverage of local historical and cultural issues.  These are resources which have been untapped up to now.  Likewise, so far as the Gaeltacht areas are concerned, I have no doubt that stations operating in Gaeltacht areas will make a major contribution towards the preservation and promotion of the Irish language, culture and music.</P>
    <P>As one who has in the past advocated the establishment of a Press Council, I wish in particular to welcome the fact that the Bill provides that when a sufficient number of stations are up and running their operators can come together voluntarily and establish a code of conduct. I believe this will ensure that the highest standards will prevail.  Such a body could deal with complaints on an independent <Col N="1698" /> basis; in other words, the whole emphasis is on self-regulation.</P>
    <P>Market research into audience reaction to a service can be called for and obviously this should not be necessary if the stations are responding to the public needs.  The setting up of this body to control a code of conduct and to ensure that high standards are maintained is a crucial part of this legislation.  It cannot be assumed that commercial or community radio stations will enforce their own standards.  It is not quite the same as the newspaper industry.  Market forces alone cannot determine the quality of the service provided.  From a purely financial point of view it is obvious that in the commercial tier of the proposed radio structures it will be more profitable to operate a wall to wall music style station.</P>
    <P>I listened to Deputy Richard Bruton when we discussed this Bill before the break and I would like to point out that community radio does fit into all categories except the national one.  As I understand it, there is nothing to stop a community group applying for a licence on a county, town, city or neighbourhood basis.  At the end of a licence period the franchise will be thrown open to public competition again.  This will provide a good incentive, if it is required, to ensure that the licensee is living up to his or her obligation and is providing a high standard of service.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to take on board a few points in relation to community radio.  Community broadcasting must have a clear definition.  If the tremendous goodwill which exists for the concept is not to be exploited for private gain, it must respond more to social needs rather than commercial requirements. Community broadcasting must also be representative, democratic and promote genuine access.  The advisory committee should be charged with the development role and within their make-up there should be representatives from the community radio sector.</P>
    <P>I look forward to Committee Stage. This Bill is at last before the House and that alone is a major achievement in the light of the public squabbling on this issue <Col N="1699" /> that we all had to endure during the previous Government's term of office.  The Minister is to be congratulated on that score and also on managing to get the right balance in preparing this important and historic legislation.</P>
    <P>In drafting the Bill, the Minister has had an opportunity of looking at the British experience to help him make innovative decisions.  The British method of dealing with pirate radio involved legalising a large number of radio stations but overburdening them with too many restrictive rules and policies.  Having failed to create what they hoped would be a quality radio service for everyone they have now resorted to regularisation of the radio service in an effort to avoid strangling the industry.</P>
    <P>This Government's objective must be to achieve a balance between imposing too many restrictions and allowing some radio stations too much freedom which could lead to misuse of privileges and an ultimate drop in standards.  This legislation should embody an opportunity for research.  Enough research was not carried out by the commission or the Government to determine what people want to hear on radio.  The reference, for example, to current affairs in the first drafting of this Bill is very narrow.  Does current affairs warrant more attention then the inclusion of Irish language, music, theatre or classical music?  The Authority should have a right to demand that independent research be undertaken and the cost could be borne by the radio station.  The results of this research could be used to compare the needs of the audience in the service area with the service provided by the station.  If nothing is done the service will deteriorate to blandness and the Government will miss a great opportunity to capitalise on innovative advances.  Progressive thinking can produce a service of which this State can be proud.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Some of the points I will make are general and some will be very specific but I intend to be brief.  It is incumbent on somebody like myself who <Col N="1700" /> represents the Labour Party and the socialist perspective in this country to speak, because of the extraordinary circumstances which now prevail in the Parliament, circumstances which come close to subverting the meaning of parliament itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have the extraordinary situation where succeeding a debate on the budget we have an Opposition who do not oppose but insist on supplying a number of speakers justified on the number of heads in the House.  They do not oppose the economic thinking of the budget. Now on this broadcasting Bill there will be no effective Opposition even though there will be speeches from people in the Opposition position.  It is the kind of posture which that great antiquarian, Deputy John Kelly, has so often condemned but which like all great palaeological commentators he cannot see, because it is so close to his own nose when it comes to what is happening in parliament.  This is relevant in relation to broadcasting because we are at a crisis in the media coverage of politics.  How can the media cover politics if in the structure of broadcasting itself, be it in radio or television or even in the printed medium, it has to subscribe to the fiction that there are differences where no differences exist?  In some of the right wing international channels in the US they have a programme called &ldquo;A View from the Right, a View from the Left.&rdquo;  Would it not be far more meaningful to deal with the real differences in politics in Ireland and have a view that represents 90 per cent of the people in this House and a view that represents those who oppose the current orthodoxy be it in terms of economics, broadcasting or in terms of so many other pieces of legislation?  The artificiality is not a matter of something superficial or something of mere comment on my part, it is something that is deeply, structurally subversive to the concept of parliamentary opposition and the concept of presenting different viewpoints intellecutally in relation to matters like this.  We are in the unusual position in which the public reading this debate, and future schoolchildren and adults <Col N="1701" /> reading the reports of this debate will take the speakers who followed each other alternatively and will ask if they differed about broadcasting.  People will wonder what happened to the concept of public service broadcasting.</P>
    <P>Public service broadcasting is a concept that has not surfaced so far in this debate. The brave new macho image that the Minister is portraying is one that does not need to be dragged down by such a concept.  Neither has there been any reference to the last time when a group of outsiders looked at the nature of broadcasting in Ireland.  I am referring to the Broadcasting Review Committee who reported in 1974.  This committee included such distinguished figures as Mr. Justice George Murnaghan, Mr. T.K. Whitaker, Tomás Roseingrave, Bryan MacMahon and a number of others.  On page 20 of their report in their opening chapter they said about broadcasting services at paragraph 3.4.3:</P>
    <P>This service should:&mdash; (i) be a balanced service of information, enlightenment and entertainment for people of different ages, interests and tastes covering the whole range of programming in fair proportion.</P>
    <P>I want to pause here and I want these new ignorama of the right to explain to me where in the history of economics or in the history of advertising or in the history of broadcasting have market forces ensured a broad coverage for people of different ages, interests and tastes.  In such circumstances where it is impossible to have a balance across age groups, interests, and tastes the balance has been accommodated historically by the development and devolution of the concept of public service broadcasting which stopped us pandering to the exclusive tastes of those with a high degree of commercial purchasing power which in turn might be the forces of advertising. The report went on that the programmes of information should:</P>
    <P>(ii)  be in Irish and English with appropriate provision for other languages;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1702" /> In the first legislation proposed by the previous administration there were less obstacles placed before an independent radio/television station than there were planning requirements for a hen house. One could have set up a station within spitting distance of Raidio na Gaeltachta. I will develop this point in detail in a moment.  The report also went on that the service should:</P>
    <P>(iii)  actively contribute to the flow and exchange of information, entertainment and culture within Ireland, and between Ireland and other countries, especially her partners in the European Economic Community.</P>
    <P>I wonder at times whether it is the naïve or those who simply subscribe to authoritarianism in our society who want to go through the motions of imagining that every individual citizen has equal access to both providing information and influencing information.  At present we are in conditions of the control of communications, which are extremely dangerous for an open democracy.  It is very interesting to note that of more than 160 Deputies in this House, how very few will ever stand up and say whether they are worried about the near monopoly conditions that exist now in the Irish print media.  John Pilger recently covering Australia, looking back on it, spoke about the disappearance of the diversity of forms of the print medium and the concentration of ownership in the hands of a very small number of people.  I have watched in Ireland newspaper coverage gradually shrinking in terms of those who own and control and influence the news media.  One figure showed that one individual who is at once Irish, American and Australian, being a true citizen of the world depending on where economic interests dictate, controlled 34 per cent of all the print media printed in this country in any one week.</P>
    <P>In the case of Australia, domination of the print media brought forward a number of dangers.  I do not want to bore the House with these, but they have been well noted, particularly the intersection between the print media, politics and <Col N="1703" /> commercial and banking decisions.  It is not for me but for those who claim an integrity in relation to financial and economic matters to ask, for example, what are the consequences in relation to the Stock Exchange in relation to investment and commercial decisions of the type of ownership and quasi-monopoly which exists in the print media &mdash; a point to which this House will return.  This is relevant in relation to the debate on broadcasting in this sense, that all during the time discussions were going on in relation to broadcasting, in dealing with which I sense that there is agreement on all sides of the House, an unsatisfactory situation where legal operators were using the airwaves, the same presence, the same notion, the same investment sources were waiting in the wings at all stages as part of a consortium to bid for private commercial interests in both private radio and private television.</P>
    <P>In the case of the consortium that had been put together as regards private television, it included the interests to which I have already referred from the newspapers. I shall be very specific, it reflected three or four daily newspapers at that time which made proposals for what they though were forthcoming opportunities. It also included some of the Irish banks and a number of other interests.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am saying that they <Col N="1704" /> existed.  We have more facts.  There is an interesting word which is not used by the Government on the Government side, or the Government on the Fine Gael Opposition side, and that is &ldquo;de-regulation&rdquo;. Why is it that the word &ldquo;de-regulation&rdquo; does not come from the lips of the Minister, Deputy Burke, or from Deputy Kitt?  Deputy Kitt is well intentioned in his own way, but I cannot subscribe to his views which are somewhat naïve and innocent, putting the best twist that I can on it.  It is the notion, for example, of the concept of opening up the airwaves to the people of Ireland. What people of Ireland is he talking about?  Is he saying that his wife, himself, his neighbours are free to use the airwaves? The airwaves are there not by international convention, but what is involved is taking the airwaves from them and saying that they will be manipulated by those who hold the possibility and capacity to go on the air in terms of investment, other forms of control and so forth.</P>

    <P>Equally, his version about the benign influence of Thatcher's Britain and her thinking about broadcasting was truly curious.  We are going to eliminate further layers of bureaucracy &mdash; another lovely phrase &mdash; which even the British did not have the courage to remove. What this translates into is that we in this legislation will bring about cruder de-regulation than even the British Government could force on their people.  The word &ldquo;de-regulation&rdquo; exists in any serious discussion on broadcasting.  There have always been those honest people who were saying: &ldquo;I am not interested in the community and the soft notion of the public good.  I am interested in making money from broadcasting.  I am one of those strong, aggressive individuals who want to become a broadcasting baron, if you like.&rdquo;  They argued for de-regulation but what we are getting is a cowardly de-regulation &mdash; every other silly, cowardly idea that we have borrowed in recent times from Britain.  In other words, a set of Thatcherite consequences without the presence of the harridan herself presiding over it.  That is what we are listening to <Col N="1705" /> here, day after day, from the tamed and neutered Republicans and the other nationalists that Deputy Kelly was trying to bring up from their graves last night when speaking on the budget.</P>
    <P>The fact of the matter is this: we in the Labour Party believed in public service broadcasting because we saw it within the history of broadcasting as being profoundly democratic.  It offered the ingress of democracy into the nature of the new technological medium of communications. When new forms of technology in communications emerge at any time, they sit in a context that is either one of free enterprise, or one of free enterprise which is limited by some forms of regulation by certain types of criteria. Sometimes liberals would argue that it must be in such a way as to sustain the fabric of democracy itself.  Others, those to the left who have embraced the concept of public service broadcasting, have argued that it is much more, it allows for the evolution and extension of democracy through the right to participate, the right of access, the right of minority tastes to be serviced and so on.  That is what is involved.  It is just a very simple choice.</P>
    <P>We are really saying: &ldquo;This is what the thinking is in Britain and this is what the thinking is in Ireland.  There are other people who represented this thinking internationally.  There is a tension here between those who believe in the democratic control of broadcasting and those who believe in its private use&rdquo;.  This split the UNESCO organisation down the middle internationally when there was a enormous contrast between the peoples of the world who demanded the right to tell their own story, as the report on Communications put it, and those, on the other hand, who had the capacity, means and possibility of dominating in a cultural sense those who had no other choice but to view and listen through developed tastes and so forth.  It is in that sense that I am saying that in Turkey you can watch &ldquo;Dallas&rdquo;, &ldquo;Dynasty&rdquo; and so forth with subtitles.  Of that material, 84 per cent is produced in two locations.</P>
    <P>There is a problem at world level in relation to the control of communications <Col N="1706" /> towards the civilisation of communication. There are cultures struggling for their rights and their capacity to tell their own story.  That is not a case of putting a brown bag over your head and not watching anything.  That is not a case of putting up shutters to cut out the international influences of broadcasting.  It involves the development of your own capacities to evolve a modern and dynamic culture and to have the confidence and dignity to do so.  That is precisely what is missing in this House.  Week after week I have noticed a crawling, wheedling set of proposals, every member of the real Government standing up with his or her written paragraph mentioning these difficult economic circumstances and wanting to congratulate the Minister.  On the far side, the Members say that they have to find a new role of Opposition which is not to disagree, but at the same time to disagree, but not to vote in case anything happens.</P>
    <P>Let me return to the immediate task of debating this legislation.  When the Labour Party went into Government there was no ambiguity whatsoever about what was agreed between the negotiating partners.  My views on Coalition Governments are well known and particularly my belief &mdash; which thankfully developed very satisfactorily &mdash; that there is need in this country for a real alternative in Irish politics, a socialist alternative and that it was always inimical to the development of that alternative if the Labour Party combined with another party with which, ideologically, it honestly did not agree.  I did not realise until I was in the House yesterday the depth of suppressed and repressed feeling that was contained within the larger partner.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kelly referred yesterday to the &ldquo;poisonous combination&rdquo; of the Labour Party and Fine Gael.  Their blue nearly turned from navy to black in apoplexy at having to deal with this strange people that they had to live with for a number of years.  When we get past those very colourful eccentricities of that Deputy, there are a few realities with which we have to deal.  The 1982 Programme for <Col N="1707" /> Government agreed with the Fine Gael Party by the Labour Party contained the following reference to broadcasting.  I quote it now for the record:</P>
    <P>Community radio is to be developed in an orderly manner by RTE and local community interests.</P>
    <P>There would have been no difficulty whatsoever in reforming broadcasting if that commitment had been honoured by our partners in Government.  It was not.</P>
    <P>The former Minister for Communications, former Deputy Conor Cruise O'Brien, was wont on occasion to give people like myself lectures on Coalition theory, and he had an opening phrase which he used to use in his homilies, &ldquo;Coalitions are about trust&rdquo;.  Indeed he brought his belief in that almost to the point of absurd loyalty.  Be that as it may, what kind of trust was involved in there being, from day one, opposition by the larger partner in Government to honouring a commitment they had given, and on which they had invited the members of both parties to vote at special conferences called to approve the charter for Government?  We continued to deal with this problem, and the first intimation we got of what was to come was an exclusive interview published in <i>The Irish Press</i> where the Minister of the day revealed his thoughts as to what was appropriate for broadcasting.</P>
    <P>It was something very different.  We then were to have two different views. The first one suggested a plethora of stations; 30 local radio stations were to be licensed, and it went on and on and on. Many people asked questions such as, how were all these stations going to get on the air or who was putting them up, would they all be making money or would some be making money or would none of them be making money and so forth. Lo and behold, in the evolution of the departure from what the commitment was, a lesser number of stations was proposed later than that.</P>
    <P>In my own notes about this period I have referred to the first Bill as the Nealon Bill, because the Minister <Col N="1708" /> of State of the day was associated with it and it was with him we had discussions, many of them fruitful, and I would have to agree with the point that was very accurate in relation to my colleague Deputy O'Sullivan's contribution in this regard, that the Labour Party's group who were negotiating the Bill kept continually changing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I was one of the more continual elements in it, I think the former Minister will agree.  I have a list of the meetings here, and the ones I attended and some notes I made afterwards. On those occasions, however, we made considerable progress until the decision-making on the issue was taken from the Minister of State back to the Minister himself, and there was no comparison between the two types of discussion. It is not my business to waste the time of this House in giving a total reconstruction of the meetings that took place but the notion that all that stopped the previous Government from legislating in this area was an obdurate, ideologically commited Labour Party is simply false &mdash; I had better stay within the limits that language in this House allows itself.  The fact of the matter is that the commitment of Government was broken.  Several different forms were proposed, none of which went near to fulfilling the commitment.  It is also true to say that, in a spirit of compromise, the Labour Party, on more than one occasion, were willing to accommodate 49 per cent participation by commercial interests in broadcasting.  What was at stake at the time was the notion, the old orthodoxy, that they will not come in and invest their money unless they have more than 50 per cent so, therefore, one had to have a dominating control among the commercial partners involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill that was proposed in 1972 had as its most significant departure the proposal to vest the ownership of transmitters in the broadcasting contractors. This was a significant departure from the equivalent United Kingdom legislation in <Col N="1709" /> a number of ways.  It raises the question as to what one can control without ownership. I might say that the discussions at this stage were very fruitful.  Again there were many things in it.  It is rather like the more recent Government, the Government <i>du jour</i>.  This Government were talking about deregulation.  There were proposals that were equally without deregulation; for example, the prohibition on musicians, newspapers, on advertising companies and so forth was absolutely forbidden in the British legislation in a number of ways and when one came to the Irish legislation it was confined to minority interest.  It was again the old derived impulse that we would be a bit more macho than the British and it does not matter what we are doing.  Then the question was that the British legislation equally had a number of requirements in relation to local interviews, balance, serving different interests and so forth.  That was missing as well.  As well as that, we were worried by the proposal for 30 stations because we felt that what it would create was a diversity of outlets but not necessarily a diversity of broadcasting content, which bring me rather neatly to the point that I think is very important which, I am afraid, is informing the debate from the other side of the House as well.</P>
    <P>In any approach to legislating in this area it is very important, be one on the deregulation side or on the public service broadcasting side, to specify the separate different dimensions of the ownership, control and content of broadcasting media.  If one does not do that one falls into the trap, as Deputy Kitt has, of suggesting that because the content of some of the new pirates was different to that being broadcast by RTE that was a case for a different kind of broadcasting.  Once again, here is the nub of the matter.  We in the Labour Party never spoke in favour of a total monopoly in relation to the content of radio.  We never spoke about this idea that a single station should have the sole right to determine everything that was put on the airways.  What we did speak about, however, was the <Col N="1710" /> necessity of keeping within public control, in the interests of a democratic ethos and theory of broadcasting, ownership of&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I just find those kind of remarks intolerable.  I do not care how long we delay on this because we have lots more of these cheap references.  In the United States, for example, there are people who have opposed the Wizard of Oz, there are people who have opposed different kinds of stories being carried because they offend the actual written word of the Bible itself.  If, in fact, the Deputy wants an example of the abuse of radio, including people who claim that they can cure haemorrhoids over the radio, he can just go to the United States.  He does not have to indulge in that type of cheap irrelevancy here.</P>
      <P>The fact of the matter is this: let those who are against the concept of public service broadcasting say so openly and honestly to this House.  Let those who are in favour of deregulation discover the strength to say so here in this House instead of this sleight-of-hand, saying &ldquo;we are really giving you the guarantees that were contained in public service broadcasting in terms of ownership and control by handing it to people who we will urge to be responsible&rdquo; and then to use that new cliché, as the Deputy over there put it, &ldquo;when they are all up and running they will regulate themselves in the fullness of time&rdquo;.  Just ask the Irish people to bear in mind what kind of a scenario that opens up in relation to broadcasting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1711" /> Deputy Roche had the nerve to suggest, operating admittedly in a favourable atmosphere in which there is no distinction, no more than there was from the supremo on my left, that there was a distinction between local radio, commercial radio, community radio, public radio, people's radio or whatever kind of radio one wants.  Thus, into all this comes this abuse of the concept of community. A community can mean anything from your most proximate gombeen to a local area of people who want to participate as equals or it can mean a group of people defined as interacting with each other on a regular basis.</P>
    <P>Deputy Roche stood up and announced that this is a charter for community broadcasting.  Deputy Roche is an intelligent, good Deputy in many ways.  I would ask him to tell me before this debate finishes where in this legislation there is any reference to the charter provided by the National Association for Community Broadcasting.  It does not merit a line in the legislation.  The Deputy might like to remember what we were asked by the National Association for Community Broadcasting when we were dealing with broadcasting.  I will quote from their charter which they submitted to all parties in the House.  The said:</P>
    <P>Community Broadcasting should:</P>
    <P>(1)  Serve recognisable local geographic communities and communities of interest.</P>
    <P>(2)  Ensure that democratic ownership and control rests within the local community.</P>
    <P>(3)  Have a commitment to the use of profits for community development work.</P>
    <P>(4)  Have its general management and programming policy made by a governing committee which is democratically representative of the people of the recognisable local community and the various interests in the community.</P>
    <P>I could go on.  There was no mention <Col N="1712" /> of that in the legislation.  It is not even referred to and there is no definition of community broadcasting.  The explanatory memorandum has not a single such definition.  We are told we will know it when we see it.  It is not really community broadcasting at all but one day when we have had private investment in broadcasting the sheer goodness that comes from that peculiar animal, the natural greedy Irish commercial person who, from the fulness of his heart, will break out and care for the community.  These people will say to advertisers who want to hear particular things regarding their advertising: &ldquo;I am sorry but I have become converted to community broadcasting; I must have a programme for the aged; there must be a piece of classical music, and the young have to have their programme, so take all your advertising revenue away; I would love to play pop music but I cannot because I am discovering community broadcasting impulses within myself.&rdquo;  We are all going to regulate ourselves.  Even though the present Government and the last Government have given us the capacity to make money we are going to restrain ourselves and become genuine community broadcasters.  What a load of hogwash.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>It certainly is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>It sure is, this notion that there will be self-regulation.  There are Deputies in this House who should have had a bellyful of self-regulation, even in the different professions which are well represented here including law and medicine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason I am contributing to this debate is to correct the record on a fundamental untruth, that we have some ideological hang-up that block all reform that would have knocked the pirates off the air.  In 1974 we issued a commentary on the Broadcasting Review Committee. In 1978 we held a press conference to produce our first document on broadcasting. We held a press conference in 1982 and again in 1983 and we entered in good faith into what we saw as a proposal <Col N="1713" /> for the orderly development of community radio.  When that was broken we fell back on the arguments that we had been making and developed them.  We said, yes, there is room for people to become involved and to invest their money but they must do so within a very clear, coherent model of broadcasting that leaves intact the accountability, the standards, the professionalism, the openness to democracy and the capacity to develop all the other forms of the community so that we will have in the future something that was built and devolved upon what has given us a satisfactory kind of broadcasting in some respects, unsatisfactory in others.  What it has given us at least is a proper fit between the nature of broadcasting and a democratic society.</P>
    <P>We were worried about the thinking about broadcasting, the tendency to remove broadcasting, an aspect of communications, from that whole ethos of public service accountability, into the marketplace, and that all the accountabilities, the standards, the professionalism and the diversity which had been argued and which had been carried within the concept of public service broadcast were now to be regarded from a residuum of the marketplace.  Perhaps I have put it colourfully but in doing so I hope I have not distracted from the main thrust of what I have been trying to say. Where deregulation has taken place, where any of these previous diversities that were adverted to in the 1974 report have been met, it has been as much accident as anything else.</P>
    <P>I also see it as profoundly dangerous in relation to the whole concept of national culture that we would be moving in this direction but that is not to say that I am an isolationist.  Those who have been looking at the structure of international broadcasting in its better stages have been that the significant contributions that have been made &mdash; material has even been bought by stations abroad &mdash; are ones that were built upon a deep probing often of one's own culture and the discernment of the capacity of one's own <Col N="1714" /> culture.  I will allow myself one pessimistic <i>en passant</i> remark in this regard. In the year of the Millennium people have a tremendous flair for putting up flags and that is encouraging and cheers people up but when people put up flags and imagine that decolonisation is over, they should reflect that the greatest wave of colonisation that is flowing over the planet at present is the colonisation of communications.  If we look at a human geography model of the planet we will find that the capacity to participate in the world communications order lies entirely skewed in the direction of those with resources.  On the other hand, there is the enormous peopled part of the world who are more and more denied the right to tell their own story or to seek a chink into the world transmission service to enable their cultural contributions to ever be respected and made.</P>
    <P>The notion that you move into the marketplace to define the character of your broadcasting is full of perils.  It is one which the Labour Party and I have not opposed absolutely.  We sought again and again to reach accommodations in relation to the models that were being proposed.  We will oppose this Bill because of its failure to address these issues and in particular because of its attempt to smuggle deregulation into broadcasting in Ireland without answering the questions as to why we are moving away from public service broadcasting or spelling out the consequences of de-regulation. I invite the people who are genuinely interested in community broadcasting, the minorities with special tastes, people who want programmes for the young and for the aged and people who are interested in the development of the language and, much more so, in the development of the culture in general, to think very carefully about the situation that has arisen in this House where 90 per cent of the people whom they elected into the House will agree to deregulation proposals for broadcasting in Ireland. The implications of the vote are not confined to this Dáil but will have an impact on the culture over a very long period. We are not traditionalists in the Labour <Col N="1715" /> Party as far as broadcasting is concerned. We believe that public service is but a context.  It is one within which different forms of legislation must be developed to handle contemporary realities and possibilities and technical possibilities.  Equally, we believe that at the same time there must be built into any broadcasting system the capacity to develop, it must be of a dynamic theory of broadcasting.</P>
    <P>It was interesting to speak on radio with the Minister for Communications about broadcasting.  Again and again some lovely interviewer, stuck for words about broadcasting, unfortunately used the phrase to the Minister that it was &ldquo;minimalist&rdquo; legislation.  Like all of those who brighten up when they hear a good word, the Minister retained usage of the word &ldquo;minimalist&rdquo; for at least a forthnight when broadcasting on different media.  He said that his legislation has been called minimalist when, of course, he had called it minimalist himself.  In so saying the Minister was really saying that it was deregulation in broadcasting but he would not use the dirty English word from the pagan island next door.  So the Minister's minimalist broadcasting is Irish creepy, crawly, deregulation.</P>
    <P>We will be voting against it.  It is not in the national interest, in the interests of broadcasting, of democracy to support legislation like this.  Unlike the shadow Government over there we will not be conjuring up some kind of amendment. I actually agree with their amendment &mdash; they are correct &mdash; in that if we are to have this load we might as well have some kind of independent authority so that there will be some body to which people can have recourse to talk about standards. They need not be listened to; it will be therapeutic, but it is better than nothing.  It is better than something constructed from the cumanns, the Dáil ceantars and the rest of it.  They are right about that.  I can understand the amendment, which is in the context of the tribal, no real difference kind of politics that Deputy Kelly likes.</P>
    <P>I want to make it very clear that we shall not be resorting to an amendment <Col N="1716" /> on Committee Stage.  We will be opposing the Bill on the grounds Deputy O'Sullivan advanced which I hope I have developed slightly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. B. O'Keeffe Mr. B. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is to be congratulated on introducing these Bills and on tackling a problem which has been allowed to fester over a ten-year period. Indeed it is one which successive Governments have failed to tackle, or were unwilling to tackle, as in the case of the Coalition Government because of divisions between the parties involved.</P>
      <P>I will refer to an editorial in the <i>Incorporated Law Society Gazette</i> which pointed out:</P>
      <P>Increasingly, it appears that in every facet of the State's activities, particularly in the areas of taxation and the collection of fines imposed by the courts, it is the law-abiding who suffer for being good citizens.  Those who readily or voluntarily submit to the jurisdiction of the State are hardpressed, while those who thumb their noses at the system escape scotfree.</P>
      <P>Of course this referred to the failure to impose the law in relation to illegal pirate radio stations.  We can only conclude that if one law can be flouted with apparent impunity, without any corrective action on the part of the authorities, why not all other laws as well?  I recall also a <i>Business and Finance</i> editorial as far back as 1978 which called for the removal of pirate radio because it broke the law, contending that either the law be changed or pirates treated as wrong-doers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If a law is unenforceable or undesirable it should be amended or rescinded.  It is regrettable that in the past legislators should have allowed illegal operations to continue, allowing some to co-operate with and appear on that type of medium, I would contend adding an inexcusable insult to the legislative process itself. Indeed the National Union of Journalists themselves stand indicted on this issue. In parts of the country members were accepted from pirate stations while, in other parts, there was a clampdown on admissions.  In this regard I salute the <Col N="1717" /> stance taken by the National Union of Journalists Chapel in Cork who, from the beginning, decided they would have nothing whatever to do with illegals.</P>
    <P>The machinations of illegals are even less excusable when it comes to the piracy of editorial material from other media, particularly newspapers.  In this regard the existing law on copyright has been found to be totally deficient in the sense of affording any protection against blatant filching.  Newspapers, as unionised institutions paying excellent wages, regularly had their material stolen by pirate operations whose employment record, to say the least, was questionable.  The enactment of these two Bills will ensure that the days of illegal broadcasting are over.  That is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>I am pleased also that the Minister has empowered an advisory committee to decide who should be granted licences, thereby ensuring that the granting of such licences will be removed from political patronage, a step that must be respected by all sides of the House.</P>
    <P>It is encouraging to note also that, under the criteria laid down for the selection of licensees, the character of an applicant will be assessed on past performance. It is important that it be borne in mind that there are many individuals out there who are interested in becoming involved in local radio but who did not do so to date knowing that they would have been breaking the law.  Therefore, I contend that the Government must ensure that applications from such sources be given bonus points.  I am happy that the criteria laid down in the Bill will so ensure.</P>
    <P>I might also refer to the possibility of applications from a combination of newsprint and illegal stations, comprising a composite application for a licence. Surely there would be a danger in such cases of a monopoly on advertising and media news to the detriment of other applicants?  It would be my fear also that such an eventuality could have repercussions for the role of journalists in regard to which media they should be subservient to.  Here I might refer to the reported negotiations between the <i>Cork <Col N="1718" /> Examiner</i> group in Cork and the illegal station, ERI, which has gone on allegedly over a four-year period.  I understand the same to be true in relation to other newspaper groups.</P>
    <P>Under the provisions of these Bills it is my belief that the problem of copyright will be resolved also.  It is understandable that to date copyright bodies would not enter into agreement with illegals.  Now that the stations will be legalised, commercial arrangements operated with RTE can be entered into with established radio stations and appropriate royalties paid.</P>
    <P>It is appropriate also that the Wireless and Telegraphy Bill, 1987 complements the Radio Bill in that fines for illegal operations are being increased from the paltry £50 to the proposed £800 level and/or three months imprisonment.</P>
    <P>I welcome the establishment of the new independent national radio service.  For far too long a State monopoly was conferred on one single authority, an organisation established largely with Government funds which, in a Stokes, Kennedy, Crowley investigation, was described as being in a very financially-privileged position with guaranteed licence fee and a virtually monopoly of Irish-originated broadcasting advertising revenue.  Revenue from licences is guaranteed.  I am pleased to note that the fines for unlicensed television and radio sets have also been increased.</P>
    <P>Alternative national radio will introduce an element of competition which is good.  It will provide a national news service.  The licensees will be required to relate to areas which affect public interest, such as being impartial and objective in the treatment of news and current affairs, the broadcasting of programmes conforming to good taste and decency, not inciting crime or undermining the authority of the State and, finally, promoting Irish language and culture. This is very important, bearing in mind the numerous external broadcasting services now available.</P>
    <P>There can be no doubt, however, that a totally new national radio station competing with RTE has its attractions.  The <Col N="1719" /> Minister rightly points to the need for diversity and an alternative source of news and current affairs.  A monopoly is not very desirable in any area of activity, particularly in the matter of providing news and information.  Nobody would find it desirable, for example, that there should be just one newspaper group in the Republic.  The new station could be the catalyst RTE needs to raise it to even higher planes of excellence.</P>
    <P>Something which has not been referred to in this House is the monopoly on the control of news.  The Minister should have a look at this from the job creation point of view.  I am thinking in particular of providing job outlets for young graduates from schools like Rathmines and the NIHEs.  Are they going to be blocked off because of a system which has operated for many years?</P>
    <P>It is important that simplicity is the key in regulating radio services.  After all, we do not regulate what appears in newspapers and why should we be introducing a statutory authority for radio?  Is it not much more practical to have a scheme that is self-regulatory rather than involve the State in a costly bureaucracy?  I, too, welcome the suggestion in the Minister's speech that licensees should voluntarily come together and establish a code of conduct within the legislation to ensure that the operators conform to the highest standards.  In any event, there is provision within the Bill for the revocation of licences where standards have not been met.  Would it not be crazy to set up an authority which would propagate an operating cost of £272,500 after five years culminating in an overall operating loss?</P>
    <P>The neighbourhood stations have great potential for real community involvement. As somebody who has participated in local community radio under the auspices of RTE, I am satisfied that they will bring greater coherence to neighbourhoods and will allow people to raise matters of common interest and set common goals for the immediate community. Surely, this would provide the necessary outlet for local initiative and <Col N="1720" /> provide an opportunity for the emergence of local talent in the broadcasting field.</P>
    <P>Before concluding I would like to mention the extension of broadcasting time for Cork local radio.  I take this opportunity to compliment the Minister on meetings, at my request, representatives of the unions working in the station and to pass on their gratitude for a personal hearing.  May I also take this opportunity to castigate those members of the previous Coalition Government and some local councillors in Cork who are now clamouring for an extension of broadcasting time for the local station because we all know that within a four and a half year period it was within their competence to grant such an extension under existing legislation.</P>
    <P>I welcome the decision, in principle, given by the Minister, Deputy Burke to grant an extension of broadcasting time to Cork local radio.  I urge him to be generous when taking a final decision, keeping in mind the necessity to ensure that the station is viable in face of the two stations to be set up in opposition in Cork city and county.  It is only fair that I should point out that difficulties are envisaged in setting up a county station <i>vis-á-vis</i> a city station.  In all likelihood, a county station will encompass the city area and will be likely to draw advertising from that source but a city station may have a restricted broadcasting outlet.  A suggestion has been made that Cork city and county cannot carry three radio stations. The Minister may have to look at the proposal that Cork local radio station might profitably be privatised.  That is a suggestion I ask the Minister to consider when making his final deliberations on this legislation.</P>
    <P>The introduction of these Bills is a courageous move.  It shows a lot of imagination and initiative, qualities we have come to expect from what I would term a very innovative Minister.</P>

      <P>Of necessity my contribution will be brief.  I will not be in a position to resume the debate after Question Time because of a meeting of <Col N="1721" /> the Committee of Public Accounts. There is much to be said about this Bill and I will try to get all my comments on the record.</P>
      <P>I believe the time is overdue for us to consider this matter.  I welcome the Bills because at least they give us an opportunity to debate this matter in the Dáil, a subject which should have been debated in the previous Dáil and even previous to it.  A large number of illegal stations were allowed go their merry way while the only legal station originating in this country had to comply with certain laws, an absurdity which could not be allowed continue.  That is not to say that I want to argue the need for legislative control <i>per se</i>, but if there is to be legislative control of RTE, then there should be regulations and legislation pertaining to the other users of the airwaves.</P>
      <P>RTE radio provides a very good service although it is not without fault.  There are a few people employed by RTE who think they are indispensible and sometimes see themselves as the Government of the day, being the makers and breakers of all and sundry.  The advent of competition should take some of that away. Unfortunately, the sort of competition we are considering will not be on a national basis, it will be on a regionalised or county basis.  There should be competition. That is one of the problems when there are instant comments on the radio by all sorts of people, some of whom have become extremely arrogant. It is time this House gave those people some competition so that their lack of standards can be teased out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regret the tone which has been adopted by some interviewers on RTE. It appears that many members of the Democratic Unionist Party have taken on the personality of Ian Paisley, and in RTE some of the interviewers have adopted a certain personality &mdash; I would not like to mention any particular person. A number of these interviewers have a very arrogant attitude and have difficulty in addressing Members of this House. For example, they have difficulty addressing me as &ldquo;Mr. Mitchell&rdquo;, &ldquo;Deputy Mitchell&rdquo; or &ldquo;Gay&rdquo;.  They say <Col N="1722" />&ldquo;Good morning Gay Mitchell&rdquo;.  Some of these people who have set themselves up as lords need competition and I regret we are not giving them national competition.</P>
    <P>It is only right and proper that we tell the RTE Authority they are providing a good service and when they overstep the mark we, as legislators, will not accept it.  The arrogant attitude adopted by RTE to this House is incredible.  Part of the motion allowing RTE to broadcast the proceedings of this House obliged them to cover committees but they have not done so.  In the case of the Committee of Public Accounts, of which I am chairman, we have been trying for some considerable time to persuade them to cover this committee, the only statutory committee of the House.  Every newspaper in the country has one, if not two, journalists covering that committee, but what do RTE do?  They plagiarise it the following day.  I repeat, they are required by a motion passed in this House to give time to these committees, but they do not find it possible to do so.  It is about time we told them we are the people who make the laws with regard to broadcasting, not the people who for a long time have had a monopoly.</P>
    <P>I was in the New Zealand Parliament last year and they, whose parliament is about the same size as ours, have a station exclusively covering proceedings.  It is on the air as long as parliament is sitting and it is one of the most listened to stations in the country and even the staff, when not working in parliament, never miss this programme.  Why should we not have a similar station?  Why should someone in RTE tell us what we can do about broadcasting our affairs?  It is indicative of the sort of arrogance which has developed in that organisation.  I do not want to take this out of kilter because RTE have some very good points.  Their television performance has certainly come on greatly and is probably the best station received here.  Their radio is second to none, albeit their research is not always as good as it might be.</P>
    <P>There are a number of faults in RTE, some of which I have already alluded to, and it is that sort of attitude and approach <Col N="1723" /> by the national broadcasting station that has irked the Legislature.  Many people feel that RTE are unreasonable and that they need competition.  However, the Bill does not go far enough in providing competition as there should be a national, independent radio capable of competing on a national basis.  There should also be a number of selected radio stations.  I strongly feel that there should also be a religious station, including the Jewish and other faiths as well as Christianity.  I suppose it should be largely a Christian station given the make-up of the nation as I understand the illegal station is very popular and is listened to by a number of people, including Members of this House.  Why should there not be a religious station on a national basis?  It could be spiritually uplifting and people are prepared to provide that service.  We do not always have to think in terms of how broadcasting is done in other countries or indeed how it was provided in this country heretofore.  On Committee Stage the Minister should allow for a religious station, not just for the Christian religion, but others as well.</P>
    <P>With regard to the fears expressed by some employees in RTE, the question of their security of employment is not threatened by the Bill.  In so far as competition is the spice of life, it will give people working for RTE an opportunity to trade their skills and to move to another station if they are not happy.  To that extent, encouragement should come from the employees of RTE because competition will improve their service and their opportunities, not just within RTE, but in the other radio stations which will be set up as a result of eventual legislation passed by the House.  Too much concern need not be expressed in that regard.  There is something hypocritical about journalists in RTE in introducing censorship on Members of this House and the Seanad.  It is a question of the puppet working the master in introducing legislation to ban Members of this House and the Seanad from going on radio when, at the same time, members of their own union are servicing some of <Col N="1724" /> these radio stations.  In a dispute last year, the RTE branch of the NUJ gave money to the NUJ branch of one of the pirate stations who were on strike.  What sort of hypocrisy is that?  Who gave these people the right to introduce this selective censorship? It is a further indication of the total arrogance which has applied in certain parts of the RTE hierarchy.</P>
    <P>What is the principle governing State licensing of radio which would not be tolerated in any other form of media? Why do we need legislation to control RTE when we do not have legislation to control <i>The Irish Press, The Cork Examiner or The Irish Times</i>?  I know there are those who say that <i>The Irish Press</i> is controlled in another way &mdash; I say that in jest.  Legislation controlling editorial content or banning interviews with certain people would simply not be tolerated. What principle governs the need to have a State Authority appointed by the Minister, who can be hired and fired by him?  The only need for legislation in the area of radio is to ensure that the bands are not over worked to the extent that you cannot get any radio station because the others are so close and cause interference.  I understand that is the case in parts of Italy where you cannot get any station finely tuned because there are so many stations near one another.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of the radio station being used by subversives.  Presumably, if that was done on a long term basis, the source could be located and taken out.  I can see a reason for that although there are subversive magazines on sale and nobody seems to be too concerned about them.  I do not know if subversive radio would have many people listening to it.  Apart from that, is there really a role for the State to be involved in radio?  Should there be State boards answerable to this House for their actions?  It is clearly a form of State control. If we had a religious broadcasting station and an independent national broadcasting station, would they have authorities similarly answerable to the Minister?  There is a good argument for saying to them that we are setting down the law and that they must comply with <Col N="1725" /> it.  For instance, newspapers cannot report on matters that are <i>sub judice</i>.  It does not mean that the Dáil will pass legislation appointing boards to run <i>The Irish Times</i>, the <i>Irish Independent, The Irish Press</i> or <i>The Cork Examiner</i>.  What is the argument for this?  Perhaps there is an ideological argument &mdash; and Deputy Higgins had views in that regard &mdash; but I do not understand why we get so worked up over this question.  If we are to continue along the lines of the legislation as explained by the Minister then, at least, if there is to be an authority I think that that authority should be fully independent and should not be in any way politically controlled.  It should not just be independent but should be seen to be independent.</P>
    <P>We had a problem with the question of appeals for planning permissions so we set up an appeals board &mdash; An Bord Pleanála.  Then we decided that An Bord Pleanála was not really independent because the Minister had the right to appoint members to the board.  A similar situation pertains here.  Then we went to absurd lengths and we set up a committee to set up a committee to appoint members of the board who would then be totally independent.  I am not suggesting that that should happen but there should be a means of appointing this board which would ensure that the people who are appointed are not of one political colour. I am not saying that this would just happen with the Government of the day. It could have happened as much when we were in office but it is not in anybody's interest or in the public interest that that should happen.</P>
    <P>With regard to section 3 of the Bill where the Minister appoints an advisory committee, who will this committee be? How independent will they be?  What will their credentials be?  Will their credentials be that they will have to be card-carrying members of a cumann or sympathisers of a particular party of the day changing when the Government of the day change?  I am concerned about this. There should be an independent committee &mdash; not an advisory committee &mdash; but an independent advisory committee. <Col N="1726" /> I would like to see machinery being introduced to ensure that that committee could remain independent.  I note that the Bill allows the Minister, for stated reasons, to conduct an investigation into the operation of programming, financial, technical or other affairs of the licensee. Why?  What is the need?  Why does the Minister need to have the power to do that?</P>
    <P>If the Minister does not like the programme tonight on RTE &ldquo;Today Tonight&rdquo; on this so called &ldquo;General&rdquo;, should he have the power to investigate it and have a big report carried out?</P>
    <P>Some years ago we had a report on the &ldquo;Seven Days&rdquo; programme on money-lending. If the <i>Irish Independent</i> were to do a programme tomorrow on the &ldquo;General&rdquo; would the Minister issue an investigation into that?  What is the need for this power?  Is there not sufficient sanction of publicity where Members can get up in this House and if they do not like what they see on RTE, or somewhere else, to complain about it and generally to bring odium upon the station concerned if they offend against some public principle? Should the Minister have the power to investigate programming?  I seriously doubt it.  That is something we should consider.</P>
    <P>Section 3 proposes that the Minister must have regard to but is not bound by the advice of the advisory committee. What is the point in having an advisory committee which the Minister can appoint and control &mdash; by the way he makes that appointment &mdash; and then he is not even bound by their advice?  That is a lot of nonsense.  Where is the independence there?  There is no independence there.  Before we pass this Bill we should look for safeguards to be put in, particularly in section 3, against political control of such a committee.  That is something which is extremely dangerous not just in the present situation but for any situation for the future.</P>
    <P>Section 10 places a duty on each licensee to ensure that all news and current affairs programmes broadcast by him are reported in an objective and <Col N="1727" /> impartial manner and that a minimum of two hours of such programming is transmitted each day between 07.00 hours and 19.00 hours if the service is broadcast for 12 hours or more, or 20 per cent in other cases.  In the case of a religious national station, why should we require them to have constant newscasts?  What is the point?  If people want to listen to newscasts they can turn on RTE or some other station.</P>
    <P>We are being very narrow-minded in our approach to this matter.  We should open up this debate.  What I think should happen with this Bill is that it should be sent to a Committee of the House who would go through it, amend it, and bring it back here on Report Stage because there are a number of matters which are worrying.  Who decides, for instance, that they are objective and impartial in their reporting?  Whose decision is that?  Is it the advisory group who would have a role in this matter which the Minister does not have to take any heed of?  I have my doubts about that.  If we are to broaden the terms of the Bill &mdash; and I believe we should &mdash; that particular section may not have relevance.</P>
    <P>Section 11 &mdash; I am not on Committee Stage but I just want to refer to these two sections &mdash; says that the advertisements should comply with a code of standards drawn up by RTE.  That puts an unfair onus on RTE and it puts local radio in a disadvantageous position because they have to take heed of their competitors' standards who can impose standards on them which they might find difficult and might restrict their ability to compete. That is something we should safeguard against and perhaps it should be taken out.  If we were to have an independent broadcasting authority then that section should refer to an independent broadcasting authority rather than to Radio Telefís Éireann.  It is unfair to Radio Éireann and to local radio.</P>
    <P>I should like to say that, by and large, advertising on RTE is very tasteful.  On one particular occasion there was a very distasteful advertisement which I thought was offensive and was moved once or <Col N="1728" /> twice to write to RTE but I did not. Eventually, I got a complaint from a constituent which made me go the whole hog and ring somebody.  They range me back and said: &ldquo;We have listened to the ad, you are right&rdquo;.  They actually took it off and modified the advertisement.  The advertisement was about a child who had lost his father &mdash; or something of that kind &mdash; it was an insensitive sort of advertisement and I must say I was very impressed with the way in which RTE looked at it rather impartially.  They made their judgment and the advertisement was changed.  By and large, their advertising is tasteful.</P>
    <P>With regard to the next section of the Bill &mdash; and this is the last section to which I want to refer &mdash; there have been instances in the past where the Minister for Justice was advertising on the radio and the then Minister of State with responsibility for Youth and Sport &mdash; that was Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn's title at the time &mdash; was advertising on the radio at the same time.  I thought that was a bit out of the ordinary to say the least and I made my point in the House at that time.</P>
    <P>Section 11 states that any religious or political advertisement or an advertisement which relates to an industrial dispute may not be taken.  What does that mean?  I presume a similar section is imposed on RTE but, if it is, it did not prevent the then Minister for Justice or the then Minister of State advertising on radio and television at that time.  What is a political broadcast?  Does it mean, for instance, that a Minister has the power to go on and make an advertisement but not a Deputy?  That needs to be clarified. If that is not the case and if this legislation does not relate to RTE and you are allowed carry political advertisements on RTE then presumably the same restriction should apply to both.</P>
    <P>I think the Bill should be sent to a Committee of the House for consideration in detail.  It is an important Bill.  I wonder whether there should be quite the extent of regulation intended in its provisions.  I urge that an independent broadcasting authority be created in so far as there needs to be any Authority. <Col N="1729" /> If RTE are to continue to have an Authority then there should be an independent broadcasting Authority which should be totally independent and which should be set up in such a way that it will not be politically controlled and would not be easily answerable to the Minister.  It would be a good day's work if an all-party Committee of the House got this Bill into Committee and came back here with it because there are a lot of misgivings about it and a lot of changes which need to be made.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Labour is the only member of the Government who has not yet vacated his position on a local authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The following Ministers of State are members of local authorities: Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach and at the Department of Defence, Deputy Vincent Brady; Minister of State at the Department of Energy, Deputy <Col N="1730" /> Michael Smith; Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food, Deputy Joe Walsh; Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce, Deputy Seán MacCarthy; Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Máire Geoghegan-Quinn; Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Deputy Ger Connolly; Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Terry Leyden; Minister of State at the Department of the Marine, Deputy Pat the Cope Gallagher; Minister of State at the Department of Tourism and Transport, Deputy Denis Lyons; Minister of State at the Department of Education, Deputy Frank Fahey and Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Noel Treacy.</P>
    <P>As I informed the House on a number of occasions, the general principle is that Ministers and Ministers of State should, as soon as conveniently possible after appointment, resign from membership of any local authority to which they belong, unless only a short time remains of their term of office or other special considerations are involved.  This principle continues to apply.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I would like to say that I was rather surprised at the long list which the Taoiseach has just read out. I do not think any Minister or Minister of State has resigned since we discussed this matter some three or four months ago.  The Taoiseach has informed us that Ministers should resign as soon as it is conveniently possible for them to do so, unless only a short time remains of their term of office.  Is it because there may be only a short term of office left that the Taoiseach is not insisting on them doing so?  By virtue of having taken no action since this question was asked previously, is the Taoiseach now giving his approval to his Minister for Labour to stay on as a member of a local corporation and to his <Col N="1731" /> Ministers of State on the list he read out &mdash; in fact it would be difficult to find one who is not on that list &mdash; to stay on?  Is the Taoiseach approving of this conduct at this stage and can we now forget the precedent which existed in the House heretofore?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>

      <P>I do not want to have to ask this question again in six months time, but I will do so if the Taoiseach does not take any action.  Will the Taoiseach insist that the Ministers of State, all of whom were appointed to their offices with a lot of razzmatazz, will now apply themselves and their energies full time to their offices as Ministers of State and not to the local authorities?  I am sure there are plenty of people in the Fianna Fáil Party available to replace them at local level.</P>

      <P>As the Taoiseach is aware, time schedules very often slip by and I think the May date is being very optimistic. Is the Taoiseach aware that the museum is preparing a caged-in section of the Central Court for the exhibition of some of their artefacts?  In view of the inadequate space, the importance of the Millennium and the National Museum as a major attraction for the Millennium, would the Taoiseach consider other venues, in particular the newly outfitted Royal Hibernian Academy, the Gallagher Gallery, which I understand will be ready for exhibitions in June?  This may be an ideal place for exhibiting the large number of artefacts which it will not be possible for them to exhibit in the museum, not only for a year but for the next two years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJNoonan" hpid="Minister for Defence (Mr. Noonan, Limerick West) Michael J. (Limerick West) Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick West):</i> I propose to take Questions Nos. 4, 7, 18 and 32 together.</P>
      <P>Aircraft flying is not costed per mile as distances are measured in terms of flying time.  The Air Corps operate Alouette, Gazelle and Dauphin helicopters.  The estimated cost for fuel per flying hour for these aircraft is £60.75, £49.95 and £72 respectively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These helicopters were acquired primarily for search and rescue, security and air ambulance missions.  When not required for such purposes Air Corps <Col N="1736" /> helicopters have been used for many years, irrespective of what party had been in power, to convey members of the Government and Ministers of State.  The expediency of using motor transport and security aspects are taken into account in determining whether a helicopter should be made available on a particular occasion.</P>
    <P>In the period 10 March to 31 December 1987 members of the Government and Ministers of State travelled in Air Corps helicopters on a total of 50 occasions. The number of such journeys for the corresponding period in 1986 was 42.</P>
    <P>Costings for individual journeys are not readily available and a record is not kept of the occasions on which requests to provide a helicopter for a Minister have not been acceded to.</P>
    <P>I am not aware that there is any public disquiet regarding this matter.  As I indicated recently, the use of these helicopters for the transport of civilian personnel, including foreign VIPs, accounts for only 5 per cent of the total flying hours on the Dauphin helicopters.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that this issue is causing disquiet? I understand that the training schedule of pilots in the use of the helicopters at night has been upset because one of those helicopters has to be on standby for the Taoiseach.  Will the Minister agree that that is one of the reasons our pilots have not been trained to fly those helicopters at night?  I understand that a full crew is on standby for the Taoiseach.  In view of the importance of those helicopters to the Air Corps is it right in these stringent economic times to have a crew on standby and helicopters grounded most of the time waiting for a call from the Taoiseach's office?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick West) Mr. Noonan (Limerick West)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> I am glad to have the opportunity to refute positively what the Deputy has said. There is no helicopter on standby for the Taoiseach or for any Minister or Minister of State.  The training operations on the new Dauphin are not being jeopardised, as the Deputy alleged.  I must repeat that <Col N="1737" /> only 5 per cent of total flying time is dedicated to flying VIPs, including foreign dignatories.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister to convey to the personnel of the Air Corps the appreciation of the House for the courageous and expert way they carry out their search and rescue missions and for the many lives they have saved.  I am aware that on many occasions they put their own lives at risk to save those in trouble.  It is an outstanding service. Will the Minister accept that there has been some disquiet in recent times about over use of helicopters by members of the Government?  I accept that it is appropriate for the Minister for Defence to use a helicopter whenever he considers it necessary to avail of one but is the Minister aware of complaints by personnel working at Baldonnel &mdash; I read a letter allegedly written by a member of the staff &mdash; similar to those referred to by Deputy Connaughton?  Will the Minister accept that in these times of financial stringency it is entirely inappropriate for members of the Government to be making excessive use of such expensive transport?</P>

The Minister should clarify the position in regard to their use.  One can never anticipate when it will be necessary to use a helicopter in a sea rescue.  Will the <Col N="1738" /> Minister explain how it is that the helicopters have been used on more occasions to transport Ministers than on rescue operations in the period March 1987 to January 1988?</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> No members of the FCA were integrated into the Permanent Defence Force in the seventies or since, but, with their own consent, a number have been employed on full time security duties.

      <P>In view of the fact that these men at a time of emergency answered the call and made themselves available for full time security duty, thus relieving regular members of the Permanent Defence Force for urgent security duties elsewhere in the State, would the Minister not consider it appropriate that they should qualify for some pension or gratuity payment?  Would the Minister agree to approach the Minister for Finance and the Taoiseach to arrange for the payment of such pensions or gratuities in appreciation of the service these people have given to the State over such a long time?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> Unlike members of the Permanent Defence Forces whose full time service is reckonable for superannuation purposes, service by FCA personnel on full time security duties is not so reckoned.  The FCA are essentially a part time force and even when a member is on full time service he is in a position which is fundamentally different from that of a regular soldier.  He has no service commitment and the range of duties he may perform is limited.  In addition, a member of the FCA can, if he so wishes, readily revert to civilian status in a way which is not open to a member of the Permanent Defence Force.  The question of whether to continue the engagement of FCA personnel on full time security duties is under consideration.  In reply specifically to what the Deputy has requested, I am giving consideration to the payment of gratuities in recognition of their services to those personnel who <Col N="1741" /> opt to stand down from full time security duties.  In due course I will be taking up the matter with my colleagues.</P>

A special allowance of £13.65 per day is payable to the personnel involved.  The total cost of this allowance from the commencement of training up to 5 February 1988 has been £131,000 approximately.

      <P>I am surprised at the Minister's reply.  The main organiser of the Dublin Millennium reported to Dublin City Council that he had sought the participation of the Department of Defence in the millennium celebrations. Would the Minister agree that Easter Week, 1916, was a most important historical event that took place in Dublin city?  In view of this, does he not agree that a special attempt should be made to commemorate the Rising, with the traditional military parade as part of the millennium celebrations?  Would he consider doing this on that occasion?</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> First, the answer to the Deputy's question is that no request has been received by my Department from the organisers of the Dublin Millennium celebrations for assistance in relation to a special Easter Week commemoration.  That is not to say that there have not been requests from time to time to my Department with regard to other assistance which has been readily available.  In October 1987, I took the liberty of writing to the Lord Mayor indicating that my Department would cooperate in the millennium celebrations in whatever way was possible.  Any application for assistance up to now has been dealt with on its merits.</P>
      <P>In reply to the Deputy's other question, it is not a matter for my Department to decide as to whether there should be an Easter Week celebration to commemorate the 1916 Rising.  That has been already decided on by an all-party committee and has been accepted generally by all as suitable.</P>

      <P>Notwithstanding what was decided by an all-party committee, would the Minister agree that as part of the millennium celebrations in Dublin this is a unique occasion, that the 1916 Rising was perhaps the most significant historical event that took place in Dublin city?  In view of this and on this special occasion there is a unique responsibility <Col N="1754" /> to commemorate the Rising as part of the millennium celebrations.  Will the Minister reconsider his position on the possibility of the traditional military parade strictly on this occasion as part of the millenniun celebrations?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotFitzpatrickFF" hpid="Mr. D. Fitzpatrick Mr. D. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I applaud the Minister's proposals and sincerely hope that local communities will avail of this opportunity to provide a service which will create a greater pride in and awareness of their areas.</P>
      <P>I am disappointed that the Minister is recommending that two stations only be franchised in the Dublin area.  In so doing I am sure the Minister is not suggesting that community spirit is less in the townships of Dublin than in rural areas.  I would ask him to take into account the population figures involved.  He has said that he will provide frequencies for rural communities of 1,500 people.  Dublin has 12 electoral areas, the smallest of which is comprised of over 20,000 voters, that is probably over 50,000 people.  Each of those electoral areas has its individual character and culture, its community news, viewpoints and problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest that the Minister consider the provision of frequencies for at least some of these 12 electoral areas.  The major factor in favour of such a course of action at this time is that there is need to develop greater civic awareness among all age <Col N="1800" /> groups.  Local radio provides an excellent medium to achieve this objective.  I have no doubt that in each of our electoral areas, there are dedicated people ready and willing to initiate such an enterprise. I can certainly say that this is true of my own constituency of Dublin Central.  I have no doubt that there will be no shortage of skills and talents to operate such a service on an entirely self-supporting basis.</P>
    <P>This proposal would be of special significance to the youth in the Dublin electoral areas.  We need to create an awareness of the needs of our communities and how these are being met. We need to tell our young people how local and central Government works and most of all to instil in them a love of democracy, a strong desire to sustain it and a pride in themselves and their communities.</P>
    <P>These young people and their teachers can produce and broadcast programmes which would be very acceptable in their own communities.  In so doing they would gain valuable skills and useful experience in communications.  They could produce special programmes for schools and the inclusion of these as part of the schools curricula would add a whole new dimension to education in civics &mdash; a subject lamentably neglected in our primary schools.  Such projects would not be possible in the context of two large commercial stations serving the Dublin area, so I earnestly request the Minister to consider this option.</P>
    <P>Quite apart from stations which would serve the rural areas of 1,500 people and the Dublin community stations which I would hope the Minister would support, we will also need to ensure that community affairs form a significant part of all other franchised broadcasting programmes.</P>
    <P>I now come to the Irish language.  The Minister has decreed that commercial stations should broadcast a minimum quota of news and public affairs.  In this he is absolutely correct.  On the matter of the Irish language, the Bill contents itself with a rather bland statement: &ldquo;It is right that we should take into account what <Col N="1801" /> applicants propose to offer in this sphere (Irish Language Broadcasting), in the selection of a licensee.  We want to ensure that stations operating in the Gaeltacht areas will make their contribution towards the preservation of Irish as a spoken language&rdquo;.  No such recommendation is even mentioned in the case of non-Gaeltacht areas and this, I feel, is the loss of a golden opportunity.</P>
    <P>We have had the problem in the past in the writing of Irish and indeed in its broadcasting that the total purists created a snobbery about Irish which precluded people from taking an interest in the language, even if they could not speak it with absolute fluency.  This has to some extent been overcome by some excellent afternoon programmes on RTE by programmes such as that of Liam Ó Murchú on television, by the much lamented Abbey pantomime and in the past, by some bilingual reviews in Dublin theatres.</P>
    <P>Widespread and varied broadcasting offers a wonderful opportunity to popularise Irish on the airwaves with clever and subtle programming.  To ensure this it is necessary that guidelines or a time quota should be set for the Irish language in the case of all licensees so that there will be no ambiguity when submissions are being made.  Many of those who will apply for broadcasting licences may be quite willing to broadcast Irish language programmes, but in the absence of any guidelines, may have little idea of what is acceptable in the public interest.  For this reason guidelines should be offered.</P>
    <P>This Bill has the potential to do more for the preservation and expansion of the Irish language, not only in Gaeltacht areas, but in the rest of the country, than any other legislation enacted in this house.  Let us not lose this opportunity and let us specify what we feel is required.</P>
    <P>When we talk about the &ldquo;advertising pool&rdquo; for radio, the current estimate for total spending is £15 million per year of which £11 million goes to RTE and £4 million goes to illegal stations.  RTE of course have their annual licence fees.</P>
    <P>We must accept that for a period of time advertising revenue to RTE will <Col N="1802" /> decline as other stations are established and go into operation.  It is generally accepted that advertising expenditure is unlikely to grow for some time.  This means that nearly all the advertising revenue taken by new stations will be at the expense of that of RTE.  Now, under the Minister's terms, RTE will operate at a disadvantage to the new stations in that they will be allowed a lower quota of advertising time in their programming because the Minister says RTE have the benefit of licence fees.</P>
    <P>This may be true, but we cannot have it both ways.  We demand that RTE provide national orchestras, national drama and even national comedy and soap opera, thereby providing employment for our artistes and contributing to the cultural life of our country.  Why should they be disadvantaged in this way?  RTE's costs, if they are to sustain these activities, will be much higher than the costs involved in other stations.  Consequently, I submit that the same quota for advertising content should apply to RTE as to all other franchised stations.</P>
    <P>I take this opportunity to congratulate the Minister on the care and the thought which have gone into the planning of this Bill.  The comments I have made are, I hope, constructive and while I share with the Minister the view that overall controls should be as few as possible, I believe that, certainly in the initial stages, guidelines if not actual quotas, require to be established in order to ensure that the franchised broadcasting services will serve the community and the Irish language at least as well as RTE have done for 25 years.</P>
    <P>As the same time, I believe that the Minister has faced a modern situation with courage and foresight and that in the long term, the development of independent broadcasting facilities in tandem with the continuation of RTE's services will, in providing a wider choice and in developing competition, provide overall a better service for our people.</P>

      <P>It is important to make the point that we are dealing here with two Bills &mdash; the Broadcasting and <Col N="1803" /> Wireless Telegraphy Bill and the Sound Broadcasting Bill.  It is significant that very little attention has been paid to the Broadcasting and Wireless Telegraphy Bill, the aim of which is to control the unlicensed use of the airwaves.  It is also significant that it has not been put into law yet, despite the fact that it was brought before the House on 8 December last and there was an impassioned plea from the spokesman of the Labour Party.  He said, and I would have supported him, that the Bill could have been made law that day if there was the will in the House to do so.  But the will was not there on the part of the conservative parties in this House because it would have meant the pirate stations would immediately have been illegal.  There would have been massive fines imposed on those who continued to operate those stations, on those who continued to provide facilities for them and on those who continued to advertise on those stations.  As I said, it is significant that despite the fact that we are discussing two Bills, that Bill has hardly been mentioned in this debate. The fact is those pirate stations, which were flouting the law &mdash; the Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1926 &mdash; are operating in defiance of that law.  Yet nothing is being done to ensure that the law is kept.</P>
      <P>When you consider the kind of laws which are very rigorously imposed on ordinary people, particularly in relation to road traffic offences, it leads one to think that if you have money and influence the law has no bearing on you.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know how long this debate will be but I urge that the Broadcasting and Wireless Telegraphy Bill be passed through this House quickly and put into effect.  Indeed, if those who continue to operate after the Bill comes into effect apply for licences they should be ruled out on the basis that they have been in breach of the law.  It is significant that in the two Bills there is no indication of what attitude will be taken to those who have flouted the law over the last ten years.  Various excuses have been made <Col N="1804" /> by spokespersons of the conservative parties for those who have flouted the law; they said they had been forced into it.  I do not know of any person coming before our courts who has managed to successfully plead that they were forced to break the law and, as a result, were not penalised by a judge or jury.  It may have mitigated their sentence but they were convicted because the law is the law.  An important amendment to the Bill would be one which ensured that those who have been in breach of the law over the last ten years would have to make a very strong case for licences to be given to them if they applied for them.</P>
    <P>To some extent I would soften my position in relation to a number of community broadcasting pirates.  They are still in breach of the law and, in many cases, have commercial interests involved with them but in at least one instance of which I am aware, the income they derived was ploughed back into the service and no particular individual benefited financially. However, they are pirates in breach of the law and it is a mockery for this House to make excuses for them.  We argue about a host of things in this House from week to week and we cannot advocate respect for the law if those with money and an eye to making a quick buck can simply ignore it.</P>
    <P>The Sound Broadcasting Bill is aimed at controlling the allocation of licences for the use of the airwaves.  I have heard it argued by spokesmen for the conservative parties in the House that there is no need for an Authority to monitor and control standards in relation to the stations which will be set up under this Bill.  Deputy Roche and Deputy Gay Mitchell said that there is no need for an Authority because the print media do not have an Authority monitoring standards and activities.  Of course, the print media do not need a licence to operate; anyone with the resources can print a newspaper or magazine, get advertising and hope to sell it.  Those Deputies cannot argue on the one hand that the issuing of licences must be controlled on the basis that it is needed &mdash; the reasons for licensing have not been clearly expressed so far &mdash; and <Col N="1805" /> at the same time argue that there is no need for an Authority to maintain and monitor standards because the print media do not have such a procedure. However, I argue that there is a need for licensing and for an Authority in relation to the print media as well.  It is not new for people to call for a press council, there is ample evidence of the need for such a body in the State.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to go into specific examples but I am sure very few Deputies in this House could not come up with at least one example of the way the media abuse their position.  There are libel laws and if a person feels sufficiently aggrieved &mdash; and if they have the financial resources &mdash; they can go to law, hoping to get compensation.  In the interests of the common man or woman, there is a need for a press or media council which would cover the print and the electronic media to ensure that certain standards are met. It is important because there has been a growth in the tabloid press in Ireland of late.  It reached a certain pitch in the UK and, while we all have our ideas of good and bad taste, no one could seriously say that the tabloid press in the UK is in good taste.  There are worrying signs that that kind of development will emerge to a greater extent in the Dublin area and perhaps in other parts of the country. Unless there is an Authority in relation to the commercial stations proposed in the Bill, we will have the same kind of low standards in that area.</P>
    <P>Deputy Roche used a phrase that stuck in my mind, that the Sound Broadcasting Bill provided a free medium of the people, by the people, for the people. It is a very old expression, I think an American President said it first.  If the Bill was proposing what Deputy Roche claims for it, I would have no problem in relation to it.  However, it does not propose a free medium of the people, by the people, for the people.  It proposes a licensing procedure whereby those who have the financial resources to establish radio stations, to win advertising, etc. can provide a station over which there will be no control on standards and over which there will be very little control in relation <Col N="1806" /> to what it produces and puts out on the air.  If what Deputy Roche claimed were true, very few people in the House would have any problem with it.  However, the reality, unfortunately, is different.</P>
    <P>There have also been a number of references in the course of the relatively short debate so far to ideology and dismissive comments in relation to it by a number of Deputies from the conservative parties.  It is fashionable to dismiss ideology but it strikes me that the people who make these references to ideology are ignorant, deliberately trying to deny the fact that ideology exists or misunderstand what ideology means. Quite simply, ideology means a framework within which a person or a group of persons see the world, read the world, understand the world or which gives some meaning to their lives.  There is no doubt whatsoever that Deputy Jim Mitchell, Deputy Roche and others who referred to ideology here in a dismissive way have an ideology.  It would be virtually impossible for them as politicians to exist without an ideology, without a framework within which they make their decisions and decide on what is right and what is wrong, as they see it.  Of course, it is always fairly easy to dismiss other ideologies when you are working from within the dominant conservative ideologies of the parties of this House and indeed of Irish society.  It is quite easy to dismiss other ideologies as nonsense and to deny the fact that ideology exists at all.  Their view is that what they believe in is simply commonsense.</P>
    <P>There is a clear ideological split in this House.  It is a fairly uneven one because we have the Fianna Fáil Party, the Fine Gael Party and the Progressive Democrats who, by and large, believe in a particular ideology, the ideology of free enterprise, of individualism, of rolling back the State, of a whole range of things. This is a very clearly understood ideology in the political area at least.  Then, there are those on the Left who believe in a different framework, who see the world in a different light, who see the world in terms of the collective responsibility of individuals for each other, the collective <Col N="1807" /> responsibility of society for those who are weakest and those who cannot make it in the fight of the fittest which we have under capitalism.  It is a fairly clear division. The reason I am referring to it is because that understanding comes across very clearly in the Bill on broadcasting. I think Deputy Michael D. Higgins referred to the idea of deregulation, of not having constraints of any kind on commercial activity, in this case in relation to the airwaves and broadcasting. That derives from the ideology of the conservative parties and likewise the attitude of both the Labour Party and The Workers' Party to this Bill relates to the way we see society and to what broadcasting ought to be about in society.</P>
    <P>What I am talking about is probably under scored by the level of debate which has taken place in relation to this Bill. There has been virtually no reference at all to broadcasting as such.  There has been a lot of talk about licensing, whether there should be two or three licences in the Dublin area or whether there should be more than one county licence in any particular county and whether they will survive because there is a certain limited amount of advertising available to support them.  During my time in this House there has been no debate or at least very little debate either here or outside on the subject of broadcasting.  There has been no thorough investigation of broadcasting within the State.</P>
    <P>We have had a development of broadcasting under Radio Éireann &mdash; as it was known some years ago &mdash; since 1926 up to the present day.  We have gone from a period where radio was a novelty to a point now where we have radio and television and indeed satellite pictures being beamed around the world.  We even have the latest technology where fibre optic cables are being stretched across the Irish Channel and indeed across the Atlantic. Because of this development satellites, in a few years' time, will be rendered obsolete.</P>
    <P>There has been no examination as to what effect that kind of development will have on Irish broadcasting or on what <Col N="1808" /> broadcasting should be about.  What is it in the first place?  What is it for and how should it be controlled in a democratic society?  How should it be used to further the goals of social and cultural life and how should it be used to further the goals of political life in the broadest sense?</P>
    <P>In the Dáil where we are supposed to be entrusted by society with the task of moving people along to common goals, to employment, to job creation, to peace, to justice, to a better life and so on, there has been no debate on how broadcasting can be used to assist us in reaching those goals.  Broadcasting, I would argue, is nothing more nor less than the people talking to each other, arguing with each other, getting involved in public argument rather than talking in the old style of argument in the pub or outside the church on a Sunday Morning or wherever, a style which to a large extent has been replaced by the debate that should be taking place on radio and television.</P>
    <P>The task of this House should be to see how the airwaves can be used to assist that kind of discussion and that kind of debate among Irish people primarily so that we can talk about our common life and our common ambitions.  It is sad to say, but it is a fact, that the major conservative politicians and political parties in this House have again and again decided to ignore that central question of what broadcasting is and have concentrated instead on trying to ensure that the airways are doled out in some way for commercial exploitation so that whatever market is out there for advertising can be exploited by those who have the capacity or the resources to set up stations.</P>
    <P>What is needed and which should have preceded this Bill but which at the very least should be done in tandem with the Bill &mdash; I am talking specifically about the Sound Broadcasting Bill rather than the Broadcasting and Wireless Telegraphy Bill &mdash; is a commission on broadcasting with specific terms of reference which would put broadcasting policy, issues of culture and public policy at the head of their list and questions of cables, frequencies and licences at the bottom of their list.  It would be a commission on <Col N="1809" /> communications on which nobody would sit who did not have a distinguished track record on communications or on cultural work, for example, poets, artists, broadcasters, teachers, novelists, sculptors and men and women widely acknowledged to be public servants of proven merit in the field of cultural administration.  Their brief would be to decide public policy on broadcasting.  We do not have any such policy.  We have only a series of irrelevant reports describing how RTE do things and, indeed, how RTE ought to do things.  We need a report on the principles by which RTE and the kind of commercial stations which are being proposed in this Bill would operate, and how they might do things and by what ends and by what legal cultural and political means they would be regulated.  In the absence of such principles to talk of independent radio is a nonsense and simply a cover up for doling out the airwaves to commercial free enterprise in the hope that someone along the way will come up with some little nuggets.</P>
    <P>The unfortunate thing is that what is being proposed in this Bill &mdash; even though I disagree fundamentally with the approach being taken &mdash; in that most of the commercial stations, whether county stations, national stations or otherwise are likely to be wiped out by the kind of competition which the multinationals will be beaming in at us over the next few years by way of satellite, at present and certainly by way of the fibre optic cables which are the way of the future.</P>
    <P>There is a lot more to be done than simply agreeing to the share out of the airwaves to the commercial interests. There is the task of defining what is the role of broadcasting in fostering Irish culture, of finding out what is contemporary Irish culture, of finding out how to reach our alienated youth in the urban wastelands where unemployment and crime conspire against them having any hope of a future of educating our people to the practice of pluralism, for instance, and of learning to live with other religious, cultural and political traditions.  That is an obligation which is implied in relation <Col N="1810" /> to RTE but which is not implied under the Broadcasting Bill before us.</P>
    <P>It should be the task of the community radio stations &mdash; which again are not in this Bill but for which the Minister told us in his Second Stage speech he would be open to receive applications for licences &mdash; the commercial radio stations as well as RTE to foster a pluralist and tolerant view of the very diverse historical traditions which exist not just in this State but on the island as a whole. Indeed, it is time that the existing Broadasting Acts were amended to stress what should be done as well as to stress what ought not be done.  A director general of RTE in the sixties said that RTE was not neutral about racism.  That is true and should always be true, but should RTE be neutral about sectarianism?  There seems to be a view abroad that RTE should be neutral in relation to sectarianism and what is going on in Northern Ireland, that it is very necessary to present one or other view of those who are engaged in a sectarian war in the North and that in some way there should be a balanced view in relation to what is happening there.  However, I would argue that they have no right to be neutral on those issues.  Indeed, I would argue that any commercial or community radio stations which are set up under this Bill would have no right to be neutral on those issues.</P>
    <P>Where is the injunction either in this Bill or in the existing Broadcasting Acts to foster anti-sectarian ideas?  Where is the clause in either this Bill or in existing Acts which would ensure the kind of positive approach we need in order to develop a pluralist society and tolerance on this island?  Why is it that those that make war on this island get far more attention on the airwaves than those who try to make peace?  These principles and questions should matter more to this House than the giving of the airwaves over to commercial interests.  That particular failing is the fatal flaw in relation to this Bill.  It does not address itself to any of those questions but I hope, in the course of the Committee Stage, to attempt to address those flaws and failings.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1811" /> Again, I must emphasise that I am referring to the Sound Broadcasting Bill and not to the Broadcasting and Wireless Telegraphy Bill, but it strikes me that the Bill would be entirely unnecessary if its only function was to provide for local radio.  It has to be said that there has been no demand for the national radio station which has been proposed in this Bill.  I am not aware of any group or company who have sought a commercial national radio station.  Perhaps, the Minister would enlighten us as to why is it necessary in his view &mdash; we already have RTE 1 and RTE 2 &mdash; and to have a third national station?  The point I am trying to make is that the demand has been for local radio and specifically for community radio.  That would have been quite feesable and possible under the present Broadcasting Acts.</P>
    <P>There is already adequate provision in law for local broadcasting to be initiated efficiently, quickly and to a high standard as RTE have already demonstrated. There is nothing to prevent the Minister from giving RTE the go-ahead to set up radio stations wherever he pleases. Indeed, it is now some years since RTE made proposals for Radio Dublin and were far advanced in setting up this station when it became plain that the Minister would not give them the go-ahead. It is also clear that Cork local radio, who have been building themselves a reputation down through the years, are being prevented by the Minister from extending their broadcasting hours so as to provide the kind of service which the people of Cork want and are entitled to have. The fact is that RTE are not allowed to broadcast on any wavelength except with the specific permission of the Minister and only within the hours allowed by him. It is clear that the Minister, together with the Ministers who came before him from a variety of parties, is far more concerned with making provision for the allocation of the airwaves to commercial interests than with the provision of a diverse public service broadcasting network.</P>
    <P>Over the years RTE have done a very good job in the area of broadcasting, <Col N="1812" /> especially in radio.  They have shown that there is a good natural audience for reasonably intelligent radio programmes and that there is a demand for something other than a diet of pop and patter.  The news at 1.30 pulls in over one million listeners every day and the &ldquo;Gay Byrne Show&rdquo; which is largely a speech programme concerned with a vast range of personal, social and consumer issues, brings in an extraordinary 600,000 listeners every day.  Perhaps, at some stage in this debate there may be a reference as to whether radio should editorialise. If we take the &ldquo;Gay Byrne Show&rdquo; we find a considerable amount of editorialising by the front man of that programme.  I have no objection to that because there is the opportunity to respond where one feels they should respond.</P>
    <P>It is too simplistic to argue that there should be no editorialising when because of the particular way in which programmes are structured or presented there is an inherent editorial line involved.  It would be far better if we acknowledged that there is almost without exception an editorial line in all programmes, be they entertainment programmes, or current affairs, or news programmes.</P>

      <P>I accept the point which the Leas-Cheann Comhairle is making and I will move along fairly quickly.  Many of the problems for which RTE have been blamed have arisen from factors over which they have no direct control.  Successive Governments have failed to ensure that RTE received the financial resources they needed to carry the various public service elements which they were obliged to carry under the Broadcasting Acts and successive Government have been reluctant to allow RTE to take the sort of initiatives which would allow them to expand their services. I have already referred to Radio Dublin which it proposed, and the proposed expansion of the services in Cork.</P>
      <P>We believe that RTE could have been developed, and a network of genuine local community stations developed under the RTE network, to meet the demand that exists for local radio. However, the Government have chosen not to go down that road and given the position of Fine Gael and the Progressive Democrats, it must be expected that the House will approve of commercial broadcasting as proposed in the Bill.  Obviously, we will try to amend some of its provisions but we may not succeed.  If we are to have commercial broadcasting it is essential that the law ensures that the highest broadcasting standards are maintained. We must also ensure that RTE are allowed to compete on equal terms with the new stations envisaged by the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill fails to pass the test in almost every requirement.  The main shortcoming of the Bill is its failure to provide for the establishment of a commercial radio Authority to process applications <Col N="1814" /> for licences and to ensure that the highest possible standards are set and maintained for commercial radio.  Most of the other shortcomings in the Bill arise from that omission.  The proposal in section 4 for an advisory committee is quite inadequate and, indeed, has the potential for serious abuse.  The advisory committee which will be appointed by the Minister will have a role only in considering and recommending applications for a licence. I am aware that since the Minister published the Bill he has announced that he will amend the Bill in such a way that he must accept the recommendations of the committee.  However, that is not an adequate response to the need to have an Authority which monitors the activities of commercial radio stations and, indeed, community stations.  It is not satisfactory that the committee should be appointed by the Minister.</P>
    <P>On a number of occasions the Minister said he did not want an Authority set up because of the expense involved which would arise from the need to have staff and so on but the Authority could be financed by the charging of fees for licences and by levying the stations in the longer term to provide ongoing finance. We believe that if we are to have commercial radio it is essential that there should be a proper Authority to set and monitor standards.  It must be a genuinely independent body and we will seek to amend the Bill to ensure that such an Authority is established and is independent of the Minister.</P>
    <P>We would like to see specific terms of reference for the Authority with specified bodies such as trade unions allowed to nominate persons to the Authority. Another matter which I believe to be of vital importance is that the Authority, rather than the licensees, should own and ultimately control the transmitters which will be used.  Private ownership of transmission equipment would be bound to confer an unfair advantage when licences come up for renewal.  While the Minister has agreed to shed the power to grant licences the Bill gives him the power to withdraw licences without any apparent right of appeal by the licensee.  Just as it <Col N="1815" /> is undesirable for a Minister to be able to grant licences so it is undesirable that he should have the power to take them away.  We can all imagine what might arise if a particular Minister did not approve of the way a certain radio station treated coverage of his own or his Governments performance.  We are all aware of the attempts that were made to interfere in the internal affairs of RTE and, given the powers that the Minister will have under the Bill, the attempts to interfere with commercial radio stations would be likely to be even greater.</P>
    <P>In relation to community radio, it is unfortunate that there is no specific reference in the Bill to the establishment of community radio stations.  The initial demand for local radio came from communities who felt there was a need for them and a gap to be filled.  We will be putting forward amendments to fill that gap.  It is amazing that there has not been any provision by the Minister to specifically exclude those involved in the running of pirate radio stations from qualifying for licences for the new commercial stations.  The fact that successive Governments failed to ensure that the law in relation to illegal broadcasting was observed has brought our legal system into disrepute.  Are we now going to compound this by allowing those who thumb their noses at the law, and make large amounts of money in the process, to be free to qualify for licences for the new stations on the same basis as those who scrupulously observe the law?  What sort of example will that be for the Oireachtas to give to the public?</P>
    <P>If we are to have commercial broadcasting a most important requirement is that RTE should be allowed to compete on an equal basis with the commercial stations.  The Bill only goes part of the way in that regard.  While the obligation is there to comply with the requirements of section 31 and while the same standards and complaints procedures will apply there are other matters we expect of RTE.  There is no indication that the commercial stations will be expected to provide the whole range of public services <Col N="1816" /> that RTE provide at present.  For instance, RTE have a symphony orchestra and we are all aware of the RTE Players.  The station must maintain and support them.  RTE provide a whole range of programmes in the area of farming, drama, for the disabled and for minority tastes in sport, music and so on but there is no indication that that kind of obligation will be on the new commercial stations.  I am not suggesting that each commercial radio station should have a symphony orchestra or, indeed, a drama group but surely it is reasonable to ask them to collectively provide some cultural services and facilities.  RTE also provide educational programmes and special programmes for the elderly and so on and while many of them may not draw huge listening audiences they are important for the people at whom they are directed.  I am sure there would be a public outcry if RTE were to withdraw those programmes but is it fair to ask RTE to carry such programmes when no such obligation will be placed on the commercial stations?</P>
    <P>At present RTE have a policy of playing a minimum percentage of Irish produced records.  That has been important for the development of an indigenous music industry which is now the most significant sector of the broader entertainment industry.  Pirate radio stations have generally shown no such commitment to Irish produced products and I wonder if it would not be reasonable to ensure that RTE and the commercial stations have similar obligations in this area.  The points I have raised are arguments for the establishment of an independent Authority.  Without it the Bill is not satisfactory and, in my view, is positively dangerous.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>RTE, in conjunction with Radio Luxembourg, propose to establish a long wave radio service based in Ireland with the United Kingdom being the main market.  That proposal involves the building of a very high transmission tower in the vicinity of Summerhill in County Meath, an area where there is a substantial rural population. <Col N="1817" /> Quite a number of houses have been built in that area.  Meath County Council, in their various county development plans, have stated that the area is already over developed as a rural area and yet RTE, in conjunction with Radio Luxembourg, propose to erect this large transmission tower there.  Concern has been expressed by residents about the effect on the environment in terms of appearance and of the radiation that will arise &mdash; not nuclear radiation &mdash; as an intrinsic part of the operation of a transmitter of this size.  It is strongly contested by many of the local residents who do not wish to see this intrusion into the rural setting of that part of County Meath.  The whole basis for the project rests on commercial considerations. It is to be a pop music station, but there is no particular need for another pop music station in this State.  We are already amply served and, as a result of this Bill, will be even more amply served with a variety of national and local stations producing that type of music all or part of the time.  The essential rationale for this proposal, which will have considerable disruptive effects in County Meath, is a commercial one.  It is a commercial judgment made by the Government, RTE and the trade union movement, who have endorsed the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>, an appendix to which contains a proposal to build this mast to facilitate the radio station.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Communications stated quite frankly during the budget debate last week that the rationale for the proposal is the prospective advertising revenue which will accrue.  The station will not be able to turn for support to licence fee revenue but will depend exclusively for its commercial survival on its ability to sell advertising within the UK.  The market for this station does not exist in Ireland alone; it is basically targeted at the United Kingdom.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The environmental considerations are quite serious and the grave concerns to which I have referred are currently the subject of an appeal to the Planning Appeals Board.  I do not propose to go into the matter in any detail, beyond <Col N="1818" /> saying that the burden of proof in a case like this should rest on those promoting such a development, not on those objecting. It is up to the promoters to prove that there is not a danger in this development. In the nature of the Planning Acts the burden normally is in favour of those who wish to make a development and it is up to those who wish to stop it to show there is a problem.  In this case I believe the burden of proof should be reversed and that it should rest on those wishing to promote the development to show there is no danger.  I have a worry that the Planning Acts as currently framed will not allow the Planning Appeals Board to take a properly balanced view of the matter in that the Planning Acts have in the past tended, in the absence of clear evidence either way, to favour those wishing to go ahead with a development. That is not as it should be in a case like this.  Hence I am worried that the grounds on which the county manager decided to allow this proposal within the strict interpretation and confines of the Planning Acts will be ones that will constrain the Planning Appeals Board in their decision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot see how this project can survive, given that the British authorities are proposing to establish three new commercial radio stations in Britain which will be coming on stream at the same time as this, domestically based in Britain and surviving on advertising revenue.  The Minister and RTE are asking us to believe that this project, jointly funded by Radio Luxemburg and RTE, will be able to win advertising revenue in competition with three new radio stations established in Britain in their own market.  There is only a limited market for commercial advertising anyway.  This project is backed by RTE which in turn is backed by the Irish taxpayer. We are being asked to use our money to put a new station working in the British market, attempting to win additional advertising revenue at a time when that market is about to be flooded not only by three new commercial stations being established on a national scale in Britain but by between 400 and 500 new commercial local radio stations also coming on stream in Britain at about the same time.  This station will be going into a market which itself is limited since it is in competition with the printed media and with television in terms of advertising. It will be entering that market at a time when the British authorities will be launching on the same market three home-grown national commercial stations plus between 400 and 500 local commercial stations.  This Bill is proposing to launch a proportionately similar number of stations on this market which will also be competing for advertising with this long-range station.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition we have the development of cable television on this and the other side of the Irish Sea which will also be <Col N="1820" /> competing for a virtually fixed amount of advertising.  It will be competing with existing radio, with 503 new British-based radio stations, 26 or 27 new radio stations being established by this Bill, a new commercial television channel being established by the Minister in this State, plus this panopoly of cable television which is surviving on the basis of advertising, all looking for a share of the same advertising manager's budget in a similarly confined number of firms that are involved in the sale of consumer goods. This is the precise time we choose to get into this.  I could see some sense, perhaps, in RTE having gone into this market ten years ago before the British were on their way with their commercial outfit and when all these stations were being established, but I cannot understand the commercial justification for it just now.</P>
    <P>Apart from environmental considerations I question whether this makes commercial and economic sense at this time.  The burden of proof is on Radio Tara and ultimately on the Minister who in every speech he made in this House cited the Radio Tara proposal with approval.  The Minister's local party colleagues are taking a diametrically opposite view to him.  I do not know if they ever discuss matters like this at party meetings, but seemingly they are going in diametrically opposed directions on this issue.  That is nothing new, it is part of their technique.  I do not know whether it comes from the Carr School of Communications or if there is an older form of advice being offered to Fianna Fáil which is that one runs a little bit of the road with every dog and hopes that the other person is not looking while one is doing it.</P>

      <P>The Deputy has given it a fair airing.  I have scanned the legislation and I do not see its relevance to what is proposed here.

      <P>It will also be broadcasting within the State and will be attempting to survive commercially on the basis of selling advertising in competition both with the radio stations established under this Bill within this State and in competition with all the national and local commercial radio stations being established in parallel in the UK.  I have asked the question and I expressed serious doubt as to whether this project which is causing so much aggravation, fear and worry to people in south Meath is itself even within its own commercial terms actually justifiable. That is a consideration which arises quite independently of any consideration of the planning appeal, in that the Planning Appeals Board will not concern themselves with whether or not the thing is commercially viable.  They will simply <Col N="1822" /> look at it within the constraints of the Planning Act.  It is in this House or somewhere else that the commercial wisdom of such a project must be questioned.  I am availing of the first available opportunity to me to question it in this debate. I thank the Chair for his indulgence in allowing me to do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Energy (Mr. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Minister for Communications I thank Deputies from all sides of the House for their thoughtful and helpful contributions to the debate on the Sound Broadcasting Bill, 1987 and the Broadcasting and Wireless Telegraphy Bill, 1987.  For obvious reasons, the debate has in the main concentrated on the Sound Broadcasting Bill which proposes a legal regime for radio services additional to those of RTE. The debate has highlighted the legitimate concerns of Deputies in this area and also the difficulty of accommodating all of the very laudable ideals that could be striven for in such a Bill.</P>
      <P>I am glad to note that there is universal support for the Broadcasting and Wireless Telegraphy Bill, 1987.  As the Minister said when introducing the Bill on 8 December last, it was presumed that in terms of its principles it would find general acceptance in the House as it is precisely the same as that circulated by the previous Government in the Seanad in 1985.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Turning to the Sound Broadcasting Bill I welcome the fact that Deputy Richard Bruton and Deputy Pat O'Malley can, on behalf of their respective parties, support this Bill on Second Stage.  I note, however, their desire for extensive amendment on Committee Stage.  At this stage I would like to outline again the Minister's objective as laid down in this Bill.  The desire is to create a legal regime under which radio services additional to those of RTE can develop and flourish. There is no need for a heavy-handed and costly approach to the regulation of those services.  The Minister's approach reflects two major and connected developments. The first is that frequencies for broadcasting, particularly on VHF, are no <Col N="1823" /> longer in such scarce supply as to require that independent radio stations should be compelled to be all things to all men as in the &ldquo;public service broadcasting&rdquo; concept that originated in the 1920s at the birth of sound broadcasting.  At that time technology and our ability to maximise the use of the radio spectrum was such that the diversity of choice possible today could not be imagined.  The second development is closely related to the first. The earlier concentration in Europe as a whole on structures, controls and regulation is no longer relevant and in large measure has disappeared.</P>
    <P>In this connection it is perhaps worth noting that since this debate started in the House the British Home Secretary with responsibility for broadcasting in the UK, which I think would be accepted as the cradle of &ldquo;public service broadcasting&rdquo;, in a written statement to the British Commons on 19 January 1988 stated that his aim is to provide alongside the existing BBC services opportunities for national commercial radio and for the expansion and deregulation of local radio, that all these services would be free of the existing constricting statutory requirements which have applied to independent local radio in Britain.  Programme operators at national and local level will be subject only to requirements of accuracy, balance and decency.</P>
    <P>The Minister has already accepted the argument that the licensing process should be seen to be administered fairly and it is the Minister's intention on Committee Stage to bring forward an amendment which will require the Minister to accept the decision of an independent body as to who should get a licence.  The Minister of the day will have no say in who gets a licence.  In the context of the introduction of an amendment, the Minister has also indicated his willingness to study the amendments that Deputies propose to put down on Committee Stage and to accommodate them if possible.</P>
    <P>When introducing the Bill the Minister referred to the fact that he was particularly appreciative of the response from the National Association of Community <Col N="1824" /> Broadcasting who were encouraged by the progressive nature of the Bill and its key elements of flexibility and openness. The Minister has looked again at section 3 (4) of the Bill as it stands and he accepts that there is a need to highlight the importance of the community element in radio.  Accordingly, on Committee Stage he will be introducing an amendment to provide that, in considering applications for licences the independent body, in addition to the criteria already provided in the section, will take into account the extent to which the applicant proposes to serve a recognisable local community or communities of interest and the arrangements proposed to ensure that the sound broadcasting service is controlled by groups which are based in the area and are representative of the community or the communities of interest concerned.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies have referred to the position of RTE in relation to this Bill. Concerns have been expressed about the impact of independent radio on the Authority's finances, about the Authority's continued ability to provide the range of public service sound broadcasting to which we have been accustomed and for which we are grateful. There has also been a concern that RTE should not be excluded from local radio. The Minister wishes to assure the House that all these concerns were taken into consideration in detail when the Government decided to introduce this Bill.  There is a mentality abroad which seems to be convinced that both RTE and public service broadcasting will be dealt a death blow if competition in broadcasting is allowed.  First of all let us be clear about the slice of the cake that RTE have &mdash; two national television services, three national radio services including Raidio na Gaeltachta and Cork Local Radio. They continue to have the security, under legislation of a grant-in-aid equivalent to net television licence fee receipts which in 1988 is estimated at approximately £42 million.  Radio advertising revenue &mdash; about £11 million &mdash; accounts for about 12 per cent of the organisation's income.</P>
    <P>The most informed estimates suggest <Col N="1825" /> that independent radio will generate about £6 million in advertising revenue per year in the medium term, £4 million of which is already absorbed by the pirates.  At worst, therefore, we are talking about an impact equivalent to about 2 per cent of the organisation's income. I am quite sure that even more stringent financial control and more efficient use of existing resources can ensure that such an impact has no effect on the quality of RTE's broadcasting services.  On the television side RTE have successfully competed against the best in the world. I have no doubt they can do the same against independent radio here and can I emphasise that I am echoing the Minister's views when I say this?</P>
    <P>May I reiterate that the desire is for the regime that is light to touch in relation to independent radio?  Against this objective the Minister will look most sympathetically at the arguments Deputies have made and at any amendments Deputies may put forward for Committee Stage, but I would urge Deputies, as the Minister did when opening this debate, to use the acid tests of realism, practicality and workability in submitting amendments.</P>
    <P>I now want to deal with a number of contributions that were made during the early morning and afternoon.  Deputy O'Sullivan spoke of the absence of a philosophy in the Bill.  The Deputy is not correct in this respect.  The Minister clearly set out the philosophy which determines his approach in the course of his opening speech on Second Stage.  The objectives are several-fold. first, we wish to respond in a realistic fashion to the demands of the public in the sphere of broadcasting and at the same time to provide for the maintenance of basic standards.  Secondly, we want to ensure that the legislation is sufficiently flexible to enable maximum involvement by the public in the provision of the kind of radio services which they themselves want, be they commercial, community or a mixture of both.  Our task as legislators is to create the environment in which this involvement can occur.  We ourselves must be careful to avoid dictating what <Col N="1826" /> precisely the public can have or can do in the sphere of broadcasting.  This is where we differ very fundamentally from the Labour Party perspective.  If I am to judge from Deputy O'Sullivan's and Deputy Higgins' contributions, they want to be able to dictate in precise detail, through the legislative process, what kind of services the listening public can have, with no assurance, of course, that those diktats could actually be translated into a reality.  We have more faith in the public themselves.  We believe that they are well capable of identifying their own needs and providing for themselves the kind of services which will answer those needs. They will have ample opportunity to do so through the various tiers of stations which we envisage being established, ranging from county to town to neighbourhood stations.</P>
    <P>I should like to thank Deputy Jim Mitchell for his very useful contribution to the debate, a contribution which was clearly borne of his experience as a former Minister with responsibility in this area and who himself sought to grasp this difficult nettle.  The Deputy made several specific points which I shall endeavour to address.  He spoke of the need to have a separate independent Authority to select broadcasters and regulate the services and he argues that the cost can be quite small.  The Minister has already announced his willingness to address some of the concerns that exist in this area, but I must insist that we have to see a practical and pragmatic solution to it.</P>
    <P>The Deputy, more so than many other Deputies because of his involvement in this area, must fully understand the difficulties that lie in this area.  He is well aware of the financial concerns that his own interim Local Radio Commission foresaw for themselves, and they saw themselves as being a very small operation with no more than six heads of permanent staff.  Yet the Deputy will recall that in order to secure the financial viability he was having to consider options such as a diversion of some of RTE's licence fee revenue away from RTE towards the support of the commission. This in effect would be a State <Col N="1827" /> subsidy.  We have firmly set ourselves against any State financing of private broadcasting &mdash; not least because we think it is both unacceptable and unnecessary in these days of economic stringency when services of more critical concern to the public have to be cut back.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his opening speech set out very clearly the costs associated with establishing a regulatory Authority such as that in previous Bills.  It is a matter of some disappointment that none of the Opposition Deputies has really sought to address these aspects in their calls for a separate regulatory Authority.  As I have already said, we will endeavour on Committee Stage to address the fundamental issue which lies behind these calls.  A clear separation of the selection process from the political level will be established but it must be in a practical and sensible way.</P>
    <P>The Deputy raised one or two other issues which he sought to have addressed in the closing stage speech.  He spoke of the new international dimension of broadcasting and of the fact that we are fast approaching a situation where national parliaments will not have the sole say in the way broadcasting is developing.  These issues are having now &mdash; as the Deputy recognised &mdash; to be addressed at European level in both the Council of Europe and the EC.  I can confirm to the Deputy that the work in these two fora is proceeding at a satisfactory pace and there is every prospect that it will be finalised during the current year.  By international standards, the progress on this work has been fast, bearing in mind that one is endeavouring to reconcile the many disparate views and practices in the broadcasting sphere in the whole of Western Europe.</P>
    <P>The Deputy asked for clarification as to how it was proposed to deal with the closing down of illegal stations and the phasing in of new stations.  This indeed, will be a thorny problem and while we would wish to avoid any hiatus between the two, we will nevertheless face up to it if it is the price which has to be paid to get legal stations on the air.  Following <Col N="1828" /> enactment of the Broadcasting and Wireless Telegraphy Bill, one will allow a certain period of time before it takes effect to enable illegal stations voluntarily to go off the air.  We will then proceed to implement the Bill in its full rigours.  In fact, the task may not be that difficult because since it will then be an offence to advertise on a pirate station one will find that the funds of many of them will dry up and they will be forced automatically out of business.</P>
    <P>The Deputy referred to the situation in which some stations may go bankrupt or into receivership and wondered what would be the position in the areas served by such stations.  We do not believe it would be realistic for the regulatory Authority &mdash; whoever it may be &mdash; to take over the operation of such a station. Our objective in those circumstances would be to refranchise the area as soon as possible.  If it is the case that a radio station is simply unviable in a particular area, the question of integrating that station into an adjacent area will be considered.</P>
    <P>The Deputy also referred to the importance of radio stations complying with appropriate technical criteria to avoid interfering with other radio services. The relevant technical criteria will be specified in the licences governing the various services, such as was envisaged in the Deputy's own Bill, and it will be the responsibility of the Department of Communications ultimately to ensure compliance with those criteria.  It will be noted incidentally that the power of the Minister to call for an investigation into the operations of a radio service embraces the technical element and it is envisaged that technical audits will be called for from time to time to ensure compliance.</P>
    <P>In relation to Deputy John Bruton's final query, I want to inform the House that in the dying days of the last Administration the former Minister for Communications and Transport sanctioned Radio Tara.  All the information which is referred to by Deputy Bruton was available to the then Government at that time. I should like to thank all the Deputies on <Col N="1829" /> all sides of the House for their contributions and I look forward to a further very helpful debate on Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>In my opening remarks last night I referred to the fact that most budget debates are flattened by the time the budget is a week old and this one is no exception, particularly as the Government announced the Estimate prior to Christmas and most organisations and Members of the House knew, to a great extent, the contents of the Government proposals.  I referred to the fact that, having served for over 12 years in this House, the ability of the Fianna Fáil Party to put across their proposals, either in Opposition or in Government, to their <Col N="1832" /> own supporters has never ceased to amaze me.</P>
      <P>Between 1982 and 1986 when Fianna Fáil were in Opposition they claimed to have the interests of the country at heart, to put the national interest first, and yet on not one single occasion did their Leader, the Taoiseach, stand up on this side of the House and say to the then Government: &ldquo;You are doing the right thing for Ireland and my party back you on this issue&rdquo;.  Constrained as they now are by the economic realities, this is a budget of contradictions, for a party that has espoused the national cause in so many ways.  It is, indeed, somewhat galling for me as a Fine Gael Deputy to have to see the general policies which were pursued by the Fine Gael Party when in Government now being implemented by the Fianna Fáil Party and being endorsed to a great extent by some sections of public opinion.  However, I recall other budgets introduced by other Ministers for Finance throughout the years which were very well received &mdash; they were dressed up in the usual glossy language of the Department of Finance &mdash; but which, when less than a month old, reduced the poll standings of the various Governments seriously and drastically.</P>
      <P>This budget makes absolutely no provision for employment.  The case has been well made by various spokesmen that Government strategy is to reduce public expenditure on capital and current account.  The net result will be that the national debt problem, having been forced onto the agenda by the Fine Gael Party, will become very clear in this context. The fact remains that within two to two and a half years the engine, initiative and energy for growth will simply not exist.  One can prune a tree so far only before stifling all of its growth.  If this series of premediated cuts and their consequences are not seen by the Government we shall approach that point before very long.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a rural Deputy representing a fairly significant geographic area, I know that many smaller businesses are and have been experiencing serious difficulties for a number of years.  In some cases these <Col N="1833" /> difficulties have been the result of their having had poor accountants, in other cases from blatant non-compliance with the laws and in others on the inability of the Revenue Commissioners to get their act together in terms of a commonsense approach to people whom they deem to be assessable for various levies and taxation. Since new technology has streamlined this Revenue procedure it is now the experience that smaller businesses struggling against the competitive forces of multinationals and larger stores in various high technology areas are in serious difficulties, being faced with a list of arrears they are totally unable to meet. In that context I welcome the amnesty introduced by the Minister for Finance. I hope it will go some way toward relieving the pressure on a great number of smaller businesses experiencing such difficulties. One sheriff appointed told me recently that, in one day, he had received over 400 new warrants for the area he represents.  That is a massive amount of warrants entailing human and personal difficulties for a great many people.  I would hope that common sense would prevail and that, between implementation of the amnesty introduced by the Minister and a commonsense approach on the part of many sheriffs, the burden would be eased to the lowest possible point at which people could pay what they can now, making arrangements to pay outstanding amounts later.</P>
    <P>Many accountants who deal with small business throughout the country are not in a position and do not give the kind of advice necessary to their clients. Certainly not all accountants are guilty in that respect.  But in many cases businessmen have requested accountants to examine their books, prepare accounts, pay the fee demanded by the accountant but find later that court cases have not been attended, the Revenue Commissioners have not been responded to with regard to various charges and so on. There is a great need for a higher level of efficiency and advice in relation to difficulties at present being experienced by businesses and projected difficulties foreseen by accountants on behalf of their <Col N="1834" /> clients.  I have knowledge of many small businesses having been built up over the years by their proprietors, families and so on, who are now out on the road, as it were, seeking business, not having an understanding or knowledge of the complexities of the taxation system.  Handing the whole lot over to an accountant, in many cases, has resulted in large bills being presented to them which they might not have had to meet had they been given better advice at the outset.</P>
    <P>
      <i>The Programme of National Recovery</i>, the Government bible, spoke of the creation of over 20,000 jobs annually.  Even in good times, when a pound was a pound, when it was easier to attract industry here and set up in business, very rarely were those targets met.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed at the thrust of the Minister for Finance's remarks and those of Fianna Fáil Deputies since because they have not really addressed the problem of unemployment.  When they were on these benches, they were awash with the tears of nationalism, patriotism and the better way brigade.  There has not been any firing of that engine in this budget.</P>
    <P>I listened for many years at public meetings and speeches in this House to Fianna Fáil speakers comment on emigration, the haemorrhage of the young souls of Ireland heading across the Atlantic, to Britain, to a lesser extent, the Continent and to the southern hemisphere. On many occasions bitter words were spoken on this subject.  The Coalition Government of 1982 to 1986 were branded as being monetarist, Thatcherite, not having the ability to address our economic problems or those of emigration and unemployment.  We were informed of diplomatic onslaughts having been made to Capitol Hill.  We were told of the various methods available to arrest the tide of emigration, keeping our young people at home, providing them with jobs and a decent standard of living.  Emigration now is worse than ever, with over 30,000 leaving annually. I did not live to appreciate the seriousness of this problem on the last wave of emigration in the late forties and <Col N="1835" /> mid-fifties.  From my work as a public representative I now understand what it really means.</P>
    <P>One can have all the high technology one likes, faster travel than before, instant communication, but they do not do away with the personal heartbreak, the tears of sorrow on the breaking-up of families, on sons and daughters leaving for places across the water where they have no contact or real chance of employment. It is not so bad if people who have to or want to emigrate have contacts, friends and relations in various business abroad, when there is always a chance of their finding a job at least initially.  Many of our younger emigrants, forced to leave, go to England and to the USA legally or illegally.  They find themselves with no real contacts in the employment world.  In the working class areas of London in particular, there is a surplus of employment.  There is a boom in the building industry.  The gangers and the employers can go back to the days of the spailpín fánach.  They can choose who they wish to employ from the queues of those looking for work.  The rates of pay can be as low as £25 a day and taking into account accommodation, food, etc., it does not leave a person with much over in his pocket than he would have if he were in receipt of social welfare payments here.</P>
    <P>People with contacts in the major cities can earn as much as £1,000 a week.  This is an indication of the quality of our vocational education, the hand to eye education which is so essential.  Many subcontractors across the world, particularly in Britain and the United States, employ a great number of young Irish engineers and navvies.</P>
    <P>In one area in County Mayo over 300 people have left in the last 12 months.  In Carraroe, County Galway, at least 500 people have left in the last 14 months. This has had a devastating effect on the economic, social and sporting activities in the area.  Families are being forced to break up.  Husbands have to leave wives and children behind them; husbands and sons are emigrating in an effort to earn <Col N="1836" /> enough to provide their families with a decent standard of living.  This is a social time bomb the consequences of which will last well into the next generation. I am not sure how those who have to emigrate will view the politicians on all sides when they look back objectively and see the difficulties the people who are working here have to contend with.</P>
    <P>This Fianna Fáil Government, who promised so much in &ldquo;The Better Way&rdquo; slogan, sat around the Cabinet table and deliberately, wilfully and consciously decided on a programme for action which every year will send at least 30,000 young people across the water and will give no hope of employment to those left behind. This is fundamental to the strategy of the budget and it has not been addressed by the Government.  I hope that the general support this party have given to the Fianna Fáil Government in the national interest, and for which we have suffered in the last 12 months, may force the Government to address the real problems of emigration and employment and try to solve them.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has taken on board the question of tourism.  This has been addressed by the Minister for Finance and other people on the Government side.  Bord Fáilte have taken a hammering over the last 12 months.  The regional tourist boards are being starved of funds and are operating with skeleton staffs.  They will be unable to do any effective work this year.  There appears to be great hope placed in the tourism task force set up by the Government with a budget of £4 million.  I welcome this task force provided they are effective and address themselves to attracting tourists. Lower access fares, the advent of Ryanair, the de-regulation of the airlines and so on, are all important matters.  It is interesting to note that the travel agents, who produced their holiday brochures a few days ago, expect almost 250,000 Irish people to leave on continental holidays this summer.  They state that their fares are lower now than they were seven years ago.  While I wish the task force well, various members on that task force have been associated with travel abroad for <Col N="1837" /> many years.  I hope there will not be a conflict of interests here.</P>
    <P>It could be said that after Franco's death Spain exported her sunshine because she did not have anything else to export at that time, but we do not have such an attraction.  I hope the perception of tourists who come to Ireland is not that of dirty Ireland with tinkers at every crossroads, bags of rubbish dumped in our most famous beauty spots, surgical gloves stuck to fishing boats in Claddagh Bay, as was reported in the <i>Galway Advertiser</i> recently, rubbish tips and a general lackadaisical approach to keeping our comparatively unpolluted country clean.  A keen eyed farmer from my county, who rarely travelled beyond the borders of County Mayo, was persuaded last year to visit his brother in Australia. His observation on his return was that we could learn many lessons from the Australians about how to keep Ireland clean.  He said he saw men walk ten yards to put a cigarette butt in a dustbin.  Would that we had the same respect for our country.</P>
    <P>Other countries have learned bitter lessons from industrialisation and flagrant acts of pollution.  I support the Minister for the Environment and the Government in their determination to ensure that commonsense would be used but that the law should apply where deliberate breaches of that law occur.  We have one of the better countries in Europe, irrespective of the weather, and the peculiar quality of the Irish nature is something which cannot be sold.  It can only be experienced.  It is that above anything else which makes holidays in Ireland worthwhile.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the Minister for Education's announcement that £6.5 million is to be made available for the capital building programme.  This is no great achievement.  In 1987 the figure for the national school programme was £30 million. This was reduced to £15 million in 1988.  The provision in 1988 for the national schools building programme is £18 million, an increase of £3 million on the original proposal.  I understand £2 million was saved last year.  This means <Col N="1838" /> only £1 million is being made available this year.  Small though this sum is, it is welcome.</P>
    <P>If I were to make personal representations to the Minister I am not sure she would give me a favourable hearing in view of some of the comments she made about building which was carried out west of the Shannon in previous years.  I note that most of this money is to be spent in rural areas, which is commendable.  I am also in favour of the position the Department have negotiated in that rationalisation should apply where space is available, but the paltry sum now allocated will do nothing to alleviate the desperate problems experienced by teachers, parents and pupils in many parts of the country.  Irrespective of any rationalisation procedures, schools will have to be provided in certain areas and that problem will have to be addressed seriously.  We have never cherised the children of the nation equally.  Some of them are attending schools in Dickensian conditions.  I had the privilege of being involved in the mechanics of the Department of Education for a short time and during that period the difficulties people were experiencing were brought to my attention.</P>
    <P>I want to deal with the installation grants which have been restored.  I know they come under the EC directives, but there is so much red tape involved that it is neither feasible nor practical for young farmers to apply for assistance under this scheme.  I urge the powers that be to look seriously at removing this red tape because young farmers with 250 man-days, with 70 suckler cows, or 400 ewes, will not make application under this scheme because of the red tape.  I ask that something be done about this.</P>
    <P>As I said, over the years we have seen the particular ability of the Fianna Fáil Party to promote sensitive issues and to cause controversy on various matters when the Coalition were in office.  One which was brought to my attention very forcibly when I was in the Department of Education was the politicisation of the Gaelic Athletic Association with which <Col N="1839" /> my family and I have a very long association. I very much regret that this campaign took place when the president of the association was from my own county. The campaign, backed by Fianna Fáil, was launched throughout the country in relation to rates on GAA grounds, DIRT tax and VAT on hurleys.  While it was very well explained by the then Government and special concessions were made to the GAA in terms of grants in respect of their centenary year, the campaign reached a climax when, for the first time, the then Taoiseach was refused an invitation to attend the All-Ireland Final in Croke Park.  What has happened to the campaign for VAT on hurleys?  In answer to a Dáil Question on 2 December 1987, the Minister for Finance said he had no proposals for a concession in this regard. The campaign seems to have died out completely, which I regret, because it is a contradiction for the Government to turn their backs on it now when they were so vociferous about it previously.  In the recent spate of conventions for election of officers within that organisation, several Government Ministers were very prominent in canvassing delegates and it might be more appropriate if they addressed themselves to the creation of opportunities for employment and jobs.</P>
    <P>In relation to the Irish language, all Governments over the years have failed to appreciate its potential economic impact.  It should never be underestimated, it is part of what we are, part of our culture, heritage and tradition.  It is what makes us different, what makes us stand apart and has a lot to do with why Irish people do so well in the various walks of like into which they enter abroad.  This cultural driving force has never been evident to the same extent at home and it is time to examine the State's investment in the area and, if necessary, to change the direction or the methods to achieve a higher level of personal development.  Thousands of teachers spend many hours each week teaching Irish and thousands of students emerge every year, some having spent ten years in the cauldron of education but they <Col N="1840" /> have little or no meas on the language. Compare that to Wales, Finland and Japan, where the whole economy is built around their culture, and it is obvious that we have a lot to learn.</P>
    <P>We have been dominant abroad in many walks of life for some years and we have employed many different nationalities beyond our shores.  We have reversed that trend because State agencies are now inviting those same nationalities into this country where they employ us.  Probably one of the reasons is that, being an island nation and having an insular mentality, we are not exposed to the competitive instinct of mainland Europe or the greater nations beyond.  It is only when we are faced with reality that the inherent and latent talent of Irish people, which is part of our culture and language, really comes to the fore.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Education should ask her experts in that Department and others to look at how we could turn around the State's investment in the Irish language, culture and tradition so that we might improve our personal development and driving force which makes us the people that we are in other countries but which we have never developed as we should at home.  As they say as Gaeilge, &ldquo;níl aon tinteán mar do thinteán féin&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Ó thaobh na coláistí samhraidh de, ba mhaith liom soiléiriú a fháil ón Aire Airgeadais faoi seo.  Téann níos mó ná 20,000 Gaeilgeoirí isteach chuig na Gaeltachtaí ag foghlaim Gaeilge sna coláistí samhraidh chuile bhliain.  Nuair a bhí sé ag caint ar an cháinaisnéis dúirt sé nach mbeadh deontas Stáit iníoctha gan cháinuimhir curtha isteach chuig an Roinn. An mbeidh gá ag mná tithe na tíre cáin ioncaim a bheith acu, mar má bhíonn, mura bhfuil fear chéile ag iascaireacht nó ag feirmeoireacht go páirt-aimsearach, ní rachaidh siad isteach sa scéim sin níos mó mar bheadh an iomarca trioblóide acu ag deileáil leis an rud seo.  Níl siad ach ag fáil fíor-bheagán airgid mar dheontas, ach mar sin féin tá sé ráite ag an Aire Airgeadais go mbeidh gá cáin uimhir a bheith acu.  Ba mhaith liom soiléiriú a fháil ón Aire faoin fhadhb sin.</P>

      <Col N="1841" /> Is fíor a rá go bhfuil an-seirbhís tugtha ag Raidió na Gaeltachta do na Gaeltachtaí agus don Ghaeilge ar fud na tíre. Tá siad ag craoladh ó 8 a.m. go dtí 1.30 p.m. agus arís ó 5 p.m. go dtí 8 p.m.  Sílim go bhfuil sé molta ag RTE go líonfaí an t-am idir 1.30 agus 5 p.m. le cláracha ó RTE as Béarla.  Tá a fhios agat, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, go bhfuil Raidió na Gaeltachta ag craoladh ar an ardmhinicíocht &mdash; tá an wavelength sin acu &mdash; agus dá mba rud é go raibh pop-ceol agus cláracha Béarla ag teacht i rith an ama sin ar fad, chuirfeadh sé sin isteach go mór ar na cláracha atá molta do Raidió na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>Bhí díospóireacht anseo inniu faoin mBille Raidió agus ba mhaith liom go mbeadh soiléiriú agus dian-mhonatóireacht déanta ag an Aire Cumarsáide faoi na coscanna a chuirfí ar na stáisiúin raidió áitiúla ionas nach mbeidís ag craoladh isteach in áiteacha Gaeltachta an t-am ar fad as Béarla.  Tugann Raidió na Gaeltachta seirbhís náisiúnta agus idirnáisiúnta. Caithfidh siad deileáil le scéalta ón tuaisceart, ón iarthar agus ón deisceart agus thart faoin tír go coitianta.  Ní bhíonn siad in ann deileáil an t-am ar fad le Conamara, le Dún na nGall nóle Ciarraí, agus dá mbeadh stáisiún áitiúil i gCathair na Gaillimhe mar shampla, agus é ag craoladh isteach i mBéarla go Conamara an t-am ar fad, chuirfeadh sé sin isteach go mór ar chláracha Raidió na Gaeltachta. Ba mhaith liom go gcuirfeadh an tAire Cumarsáide dian-chosc isteach sa Bhille Raidió ar na stáisiúin sin i dtreo is go mbeidh seans ag an Ghaeilge agus ag Raidió na Gaeltachta craoladh mar a dhéanfadh siad go dtí seo.</P>
    <P>Tháinig tuarascáil amach ón Údarás le déanaí.  Aontaim leis.  Tá job sáchmaith déanta acu, ach aontaím leis an bpríomhfheidhmeannach go gcaithfear níos mó béime a chur ar achmhainní nádúrtha, agus beidh mé ag caint faoi seo leis an Taoiseach trí cheisteanna agus mar sin de.  Sílim nach bhfuil an t-airgead ag muintir na Gaeltachta féin chun fostaíocht a chur ar fáil agus caithfear níos mó airgid a fháil ón Chiste Réigiúnach agus sna háiteacha in a bhfuil an t-airgead faoi láthair i dtreo is go mbeidh seans ag <Col N="1842" /> an Údarás na hachmhainní nádúrtha, is é sin, turasóireachta, iascaireacht, feirmeoireachta agus cúrsaí portaigh a fheabhsú agus a fhorbairt as seo amach.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned that the Minister for Energy was given a recommendation that the moneys from the Valorem fund would go into the provision of hydro-electric facilities at ten locations and for various other matters.  My understanding is that we have an over capacity and a surplus in the electricity area at present.  It seems to me that personnel within the Department have influenced the Minister unduly to allow this money to Bord na Móna, who, because of weather conditions, can have severe losses. That matter should be looked at again. There are other areas in the private bog development that could be looked at.</P>
    <P>The mineral development announced by the Minister is welcome.  I tabled a question to the Minister on 9 February in relation to mineral development on the Croagh Patrick site, County Mayo.  The Minister replied:</P>
    <P>These operations are carried out in accordance with the general rules pertaining to the grant of prospecting licences including provisions in relation to safeguarding the interests of local-landowners and in relation to preservation of the amenities of the locality.</P>
    <P>I should like to inform you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, that Ireland's holy shrine at Croagh Patrick, or the reek, as it is referred to locally, is now being savaged commercially on one side by an unauthorised development for which planning retention has since been applied for, all in the interests of commercial activities.  One cannot serve God and mammon and I wonder what would happen if a mining company were to apply for rights to mine for minerals on other sacred mountains in various other countries.  It is a disgrace that a mountain associated with hundreds of thousands of pilgrims over the years, in the pursuit of their religious beliefs, should be plundered <Col N="1843" /> in this way and I would seriously ask that the Minister for the Environment and the Minister for Energy would see to it that if a Klondyke is discovered there that at least the most stringent conditions are attached to any development that may take place.</P>
    <P>I welcome the announcement by the Minister for Health that he has made an allocation for the commencement of operations for the opening of Castlebar hospital, that is phase I, later this year. However, I would remind him of a commitment given on his behalf, on 4 February 1987, with regard to phase II.  That matter will be dealt with later.</P>
    <P>The Minister for the Environment referred to the Opposition as a crowd of ideological hitchhikers looking for a bandwagon to jump on.  I would remind him that if one sees a bandwagon it is already too late.  I would also like to remind him of a statement in <i>The Irish Times</i> on 21 January 1988 in which he is reported as saying:</P>
    <P>.... business people who are looking for &ldquo;cheap Brownie points&rdquo; are identifying somebody currently famous in seeking to get a bit of that person's credit.</P>
    <P>We saw famous personalities from this country at the end of the Champs-Elysées when Stephen Roche, fair play to him, did his job for Ireland &mdash; and indeed also when Eddie, the aviator crossed the Atlantic we all took our line in the pecking order.  I will have more to say on the details of this budget at a later time.  I am disappointed at Fianna Fáil have never owned up in the context of their opposition in saying that the then Government did a good job for Ireland and that they would back them.  Our conditional support &mdash; and I would stress that it is conditional &mdash; has made us suffer but then maybe we should suffer temporarily in the national interest.  Our time will come, too.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. B. O'Keeffe Mr. B. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Kenny raised a very important question which requires an answer.  He asked why the Taoiseach, <Col N="1844" /> when in Opposition, did not support the then Government.  I would like to put it this way to the Deputy: how could he have supported them when that Government doubled the national debt in their four and a half years in Government.  On coming into office the Taoiseach had a national duty to perform and that was to get the public finances in order.  That is exactly what he has done.</P>
      <P>The 1987 budget marked a major step forward in the Government's determined programme in correcting the public finances.  The cornerstone of that programme was the bringing under control of public spending and Government borrowing. The 1988 budget takes a further major step in achieving that objective. The current budget deficit is expected to be £1,125 million or 6.3 per cent of GNP and public borrowing is targeted to be £1,457 million or 8.2 per cent of GNP in 1988.  These figures are a significant improvement on the corresponding figures for 1985 and 1986, and the borrowing figure as a percentage of GNP is the lowest since 1980.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What are the benefits of this improvement we, may well ask?  The most immediately apparent benefit has been the reduction in interest rates.  Up to 1986, the then Government appeared to have an insatiable desire for funds.  These funds were borrowed thereby keeping Irish interest rates at an inordinately high level.  The improvement in the Government's borrowing position has contributed significantly to a substantial reduction in interest rate levels.  This reduction has helped to increase business profits and to put more money in the pockets of PAYE workers and mortgage holders.  Of course international factors have contributed to the reduction but the key factor has been the reduction in Government spending and borrowing.  In addition, inflation has fallen dramatically and it is now at its lowest for many years. Inflation is widely expected to stay at this low level.  In a sentence, this reduction in interest rates and inflation has contributed to increased confidence in the business community and in the country generally.  Lower interest rates must be <Col N="1845" /> the stepping stone to major increases in employment levels.</P>
    <P>Many of the detailed budget provisions will also contribute to this increased business and personal confidence.</P>
    <P>On the personal taxation front, the tax reduction contained in the budget will amount to £91 million this year and £152 million in a full year.  This is substantially more than the Government undertook to provide on an annualised basis under the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i> These benefits will accrue mainly to the PAYE sector and accordingly are to be particularly welcomed.  The extension of the 35 per cent rate band by £2,000 for a married couple will be a major incentive to PAYE taxpayers to earn more, by way of increased effort on their part.  This, couplied with decreased interest costs on the borrowings and especially on mortgages, will put more disposable income into the pockets of ordinary workers.</P>
    <P>The corporate business sector will also benefit significantly from the budget.  The proposed reduction in corporate tax rates will contribute to business confidence. Business will prefer to have lower tax rates, although allied to lower capital allowances, than higher tax rates and high capital allowances.  The after tax profit of a business is the acid test; the lower corporate tax rate will allow retention of profits for reinvestment into those companies. The service industries, which tend to be more employment intensive, will especially benefit from the reduction in tax rates.  Manufacturing industry will also continue to benefit from the special 10 per cent manufacturing tax.  The establishment of the special trading houses proposed in 1986 and recently approved by the EC, will contribute to the export marketing success of smaller manufacturing companies.  In the UK, comporate tax rates and capital allowances have both been reduced at this time. These have undoubtedly assisted in increasing business confidence: and while the corporation tax paid has increased, after tax business profits have also increased and that is significant.  This has <Col N="1846" /> benefited both the Exchequer and business, through higher taxes and higher profits respectively.</P>
    <P>A further development aspect of the budget is the proposal to allow tax free repatriation of overseas profits.  This is a welcome relief to progressive Irish companies who expand their Irish operations by overseas expansion.  The tax free repatriation will be subject to certain conditions. I suggest that the type of conditions imposed on repatriation should be no more onerous than the conditions imposed on foreign companies setting up in Ireland and qualifying for our tax incentives.  The repatriation of overseas profits will assist in the development of Irish profitable operations and, therefore, in increased Irish employment and output from Irish facilities and factories.</P>
    <P>I would like to comment here on an issue which has received some adverse coverage in recent years.  This is the alleged black hole caused, it is said, by the repatriation of profits by foreign multinationals set up here.</P>
    <P>What is very often overlooked is that the profits had to be brought into Ireland in the first instance by these companies. Most, if not all, of the multinational companies established in Ireland export their total production.  They contribute to this country's export performance and the Irish subsidiaries leave substantial amounts of money in Ireland through employment and locally sourced goods and services.</P>
    <P>Is it to be suggested therefore that these companies be prohibited from repatriating the profits which have been earned overseas in the first instance?  In any event I could point out that the section 69 securities, issued by the Minister for Finance, are a constructive and novel manner of retaining these profits in Ireland, and a contribution to the Government's debt service reduction programme.</P>
    <P>The proposal to increase the threshold for capital allowances and car running costs from £4,000 to £6,000 is to be particularly welcomed by the motor industry. This is a 50 per cent increase in the tax deduction for business, and the motor <Col N="1847" /> industry must benefit.  The increase will help to bring forward the decision of many companies to change their motor car fleets.</P>
    <P>In looking at business taxation, there is one sector which has suffered significantly from the budget.  These are self-employed persons or partnerships which do not or cannot trade as companies. While these persons will suffer from the lower capital allowances as proposed in the budget, there is no reduction in their rate of tax.  This, allied to the introduction of PRSI, and the acceleration of the effective date of payment of income tax by the self-employed, will result in a fairly significant loss to self-employed persons. Many self-employed partnerships are very substantial employers.  There is a very strong case for the taxation of such partnerships as corporations, with the income of the individuals being taxed on withdrawal from the company, with a credit for corporate taxes paid.</P>
    <P>The measures to expedite the payment and collection of tax will be welcomed by almost everyone.  The new system will allow the Revenue to devote its resources to scrutinising the real defaulting and offending cases.  This can only be good for the tax system as a whole.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the area of tourism which is a Labour-intensive industry and which will be a major beneficiary of the new company tax regime.  The Government are committed, as demonstrated by the additional £4 million allocation in the budget, to a new package of incentives for tourism to help this industry achieve its full potential.  Let me suggest two further incentives.  First, the retention of 100 per cent capital allowances throughout the entire country for hotels.  Secondly, the extension of capital allowances for industrial buildings to restaurants.  At present restaurants located within hotels generally qualify for capital allowances; it seems discriminatory that &ldquo;stand-alone&rdquo; restaurants do not qualify for tax relief. They play a major part in out tourism trade and should be recognised as such &mdash; of course, to qualify for tax capital <Col N="1848" /> allowances the premises should be registered with Bord Fáilte.  I hope that with the establishment of the tourism task force something like this will be brought about.</P>
    <P>The tourism industry is of vital importance to the south west area of the country. One of the trends of recent years has been the growth in the &ldquo;low budget&rdquo; end of the holiday market, yet many of our guest-houses and camping and caravan sites are totally uncontrolled and make little or no contribution towards the development of the industry.</P>
    <P>I have been approached by people offering tourist accommodation with the suggestion that they should be required to attain minimum standards and that all such operators should be licensed by the regional tourism organisation.</P>
    <P>If we take as an example the Cork-Kerry tourism board, there are 600 Bord Fáilte registered bed and breakfast outlets in the region but it is estimated that there are at least 1,000 unapproved outlets in the same region.  Were we to levy £25 per outlet, which is approximately the cost of accommodation for two persons for one night, it would bring in £25,000.</P>
    <P>Should we not also look at the various craft shops and allied retail shops and pubs which are deriving direct benefits from tourism and ask them for a contribution towards brochures which could be used internationally to help the local tourism board market their own area? Should we not, also, strive to introduce a major element of self financing to regional tourism boards?  Cork-Kerry Tourism, for example, have received direct funding of £213,000 out of a total budget of £640,000.  Therefore, they are left to find £400,000 with 15 staff members.  If a levy system could achieve £50,000 in the region then it could be more purposefully used for marketing rather than for balancing the books.</P>
    <P>In promoting tourism we must ensure that attractions which have international renown are made accessible to tourists and impediments to their proper exploitation eradicated.  I speak in particular of the Blasket Islands and Sceillig Rock <Col N="1849" /> where not one approved boat is operating to these amenities.  Surely the time has come to change the law whereby local authorities can licence boats carrying up to 25 passengers.  These two amenities could be worth millions of pounds as an integral part of the Ring of Kerry and the Dingle peninsula and it is reasonable to assume that in any other country they would be exploited to the full.  I would exhort the Minister not to allow this ludicrous situation to continue as it has for over a 20 year period.</P>
    <P>In the Cork area there are also major attractions which have a marine and defence theme.  A great opportunity now exists for the proper development of Fort Meagher in Crosshaven because the Department of Defence have decided that the fort is surplus to requirements.  I am pleased that Cork County Council have indicated that they are prepared to retain it in public hands.  Dunree Fort in Donegal would complement it; it could be compared with Charles Fort in Kinsale which dates from a previous era and it could incorporate as a tourist package the French Armada Museum in Bantry House; the Powder Mills in Ballincollig and the Coffin Ships Project at Blennerville in Tralee.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the Minister in allocating amenity grants from the national lottery take cognisance of tourist promoting projects such as the ones I have mentioned to ensure an increase in the interest levels necessary to attract tourists to particular areas.</P>
    <P>The survival of the Cork-Swansea car ferry is vital to the south west of the country and should get every assistance. Even though it was a &ldquo;start up&rdquo; operation it has proved that the business is there. Tourist inward traffic is reckoned at 60 per cent on a national basis with a 40 per cent outflow.  However, the inward traffic on the Cork-Swansea ferry is well over 70 per cent, well above the national average. Therefore, as a state value and as a vibrant economic factor for the area it is fundamental that proper funding in the short term should be made available to sustain its operation.</P>
    <P>The Cork area has been particularly <Col N="1850" /> hard hit over the past ten years or so by the effects of the recession.  The demise of a number of the traditional industries which provided very substantial employment in the area is very well known, and the effects of the loss of earnings and purchasing power in the area has resulted in less dramatic but nonetheless substantial reductions in employment throughout the entire economy of the region.  There was welcome news from the Taoiseach in Cork last Friday with the expectation of 1,500 jobs through new industry.  I should like to thank the IDA's Cork task force whose hard work on behalf of that region is at last coming to fruition.</P>
    <P>The setting up, and making-up of substantial investment in the new freeport area in Ringaskiddy is, therefore, a most welcome development.  In view of the need of the Cork area to have the benefit of the economic activity generated in the freeport as quickly as possible, and to make it as attractive as possible to investors, I would earnestly request the Government to extend the benefits of the 10 per cent rate of tax to freeport area activities.  I suggest that this should be on the lines of the provisions already announced for the Shannon Free Airport Development area and the Dublin Custom House Docks area where qualifications for the 10 per cent rate of corporation tax would be based on certification by the Minister for Industry and Commerce that the activity is likely to benefit the development of the freeport and subject to the approval of the Minister for Finance.  I would urge that provisions on these lines should be included in the forthcoming Finance Bill in order that the marketing of the investment opportunities available in the freeport area can be done with the benefit of certainty of tax treatment.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the concept of the setting up of a port development authority to manage and control the freeport area. It is vital that such an authority should not consist of not more than 11 members who would have no personal vested interest but who should have an expertise <Col N="1851" /> and entrepreneurship vital to the progressive, professional and profitable management of such an authority.</P>
    <P>I wish to welcome the Government moves on the relocation of Government Departments and the signing of contracts for phase 1 of that programme.  I also welcome the assurance by the Taoiseach that Cork is earmarked for part of that relocation programme.</P>
    <P>I wish to remind Deputy Allen, an Opposition Cork Deputy, that it was his Government who, in the 1982 budget, cancelled the decentralisation programme and sold off the site earmarked for such an eventuality.  Surely his craven carping on this issue at this time can be seen only as the rantings of a Deputy hanging from his umbilical cord; a Deputy whose Government were devoid of ideas for the development of Cork during their term of office and whose penchant, anything for a line, is well known to all.</P>
    <P>The second city of the Republic offers an ideal location for a substantial Government Department having already the infrastructural requirements for access and communications, and the variety of third level educational institutions, including a full university, to meet all education requirements.  The region appears particularly well suited as a location for the Departments of Forestry, Tourism, Energy or the Marine.  Such a relocation would not only ease the pressure on Dublin and help redress the substantial imbalance in the distribution of population but would also lift the national and international profile of the second city and provide a welcome boost to the economy of the region.</P>
    <P>The actuality of a huge national asset lying idle and disintergrating at Verolme dockyard requires to be addressed immediately.  The revelation that fees of £300,000 were paid to the liquidator suggests a great waste of equipment and it is reasonable to assume that additional fee payments will be paid through further asset stripping.  Surely, private companies alleged to be interested in purchasing the yard must have a time limit <Col N="1852" /> placed on them to decide as it is a national asset should we not now seriously look at the possibility of retaining the yard for ourselves and return it to the debenture holder, Fóir Teoranta whereby the premises can be leased to a consortium of semi-State bodies, and private concerns involved in heavy engineering projects identified in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>.  In that document we asked semi-State concerns to produce proposals on heavy industry.  It stands to reason that the ESB, Bord na Móna, Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann and many others could have major engineering works which could be successfully completed in the yard.  We have many instances of private companies leasing the yard to carry out ship repairs profitably since the yard closed.  There remains the possibility of offshore oil works and the icing on the cake would be the inclusion of the yard within the free port zone.  The facilities are there to be used and only by making them available can the State achieve a return.</P>
    <P>I welcome the move by the Minister of Education, Deputy Mary O'Rourke, in seeking further gains in productivity in the third level sector.  It is important that we evaluate the necessity of some four year degree programmes.  It is essential that the cross-fertilisation of ideas between our third level institutions and industry is increased to achieve a much higher level of financing within the third level sector.  No longer can we allow classes of four or six students in degree or diploma programmes to be maintained. There is room for rationalisation and this must be pursued vigorously.</P>
    <P>We should strive to make much more use of expertise available in universities, regional colleges and institutes of higher education in planning and executing training courses under the auspices of FÁS.  Greater EC funding could be made available to this sector by using the facilities, the equipment and qualified staff already funded by the State.</P>
    <P>The issue of modern language teaching has been well documented and education must have a greater link to economic factors.  The fact that as a country we <Col N="1853" /> must export or die means that modern language teaching must be introduced at primary school level.  After all is it not ironic that Gaelscoileanna can have French as a subject on their curriculum yet the ordinary national school is debarred from having modern languages on their curriculum?  It is being suggested that the spending of £160 million on the teaching of Irish is too much.  Perhaps one could say that we are spending too much on the teaching of geography and history.  There has to be rationalisation of resources to ensure greater allocation to the teaching of modern languages in our schools.</P>
    <P>In summary, the 1988 budget moves us further along the road of controlling public finances.  The budget will assist to restore confidence in industry and the workforce.  People will have more money in their pockets as a result of Government policy and business confidence has grown.  All polls since the budget confirm this.  With the increased confidence will come extra employment and a brighter future for everyone.  For those reasons I will be voting in favour of this Resolution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. D. O'Malley Mr. D. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's efforts to reduce the level of the public sector borrowing requirement are to be commended but one should immediately sound a warning in this regard because I fear that if a similar methodology is applied for 1989 the delicate fabric of the national economy could be irreparably damaged.  Clearly the Estimates part of the budget, as published last October, seeks to reduce the public sector borrowing requirement and the final projected level shows a significant reduction for 1988 but I see a serious problem in the future if the targeted reductions are to be achieved in a manner which was employed for the 1988 budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not belittling the Minister's efforts in dealing with the reduction in borrowing but I think he will acknowledge that the fundamental problem will not be alleviated simply by enormously reducing the provision for capital spending whilst, relatively speaking, playing down the <Col N="1854" /> necessity to deal with the level of recurring current expenditure.  It is a remarkable fact for a country that is so extraordinarily over-borrowed that our borrowing for capital purposes is perhaps the lowest in Europe and is a tiny percentage of our GNP this year.</P>
    <P>In respect of recurring current expenditure as opposed to capital expenditure, I have to refer to the arrangements contained in the so-called <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> whereby public sector employees were provided with guaranteed annual increases for a period covering three years.  That was an extraordinary provision in that it was quite unnecessary and was not seriously sought or seriously accepted.  It has had a direct cost in this budget and of course will have a recurring cost in excess of £70 million a year.  That extra £70 million will have to be found next year and the year after, as well as a further £70 million on top of that next year and the year following.</P>
    <P>At the same time as that expensive operation is going on, we have in parallel with it a scheme of redundancy for people in the public service which has not yet, to the best of my knowledge, been fully costed or quantified.  The more one looks at it the more it seems to be extraordinarily expensive.  One wonders whether it is necessary.  It is being paid for not from current expenditure but in some slightly off-balance sheet way by mortgaging the projected future surplus of the Central Bank for this purpose, keeping it out of the national accounts.  I do not quite see the value of doing that. It is something of an illusion.  The future annual surpluses of the Central Bank would be available to the Exchequer in the ordinary way in the years in which they arise.  Therefore this rather extraordinary system of paying people very large sums of money to give up work is being funded out of current expenditure, except that this is future current expenditure rather than present.</P>
    <P>I might digress briefly to say that it is a matter of great regret to me from what I have seen of individual public servants who have chosen to resign or retire under <Col N="1855" /> this scheme that, in some of the agencies at least, the very best people are getting out.  When a scheme of that kind is made available which is attractive to individuals it is to be expected that the best people will avail of it.  Those who might find it more difficult to make their way successfully in the private sector are those who would be most likely to want to retain their employment in the public sector.  What is happening in the IDA is very distressing, knowing the calibre of the people involved.  What is happening in CTT and Bord Fáilte is also very distressing.</P>
    <P>In particular I was sorry to see the early retirement of a man who is generally regarded as perhaps the best county manager in the country.  I refer to Mr. Haslam from County Limerick, whose early retirement was announced within the past week or two.  In his case it was not just a matter of the attractive terms; there were other factors to which I will refer later, particularly his frustration at the way in which local government finds itself constrained.  It is regrettable that during these months we are seeing the resignation or early retirement of many of the finest public servants.  With the best of them going, we are not achieving a great deal, particularly when we are paying for it out of future current expenditure.</P>
    <P>I do not have to spell out the inevitable consequences for any farmer if he begins to consume the corn which he should be keeping for seed.  It is a great pity that the easiest way has been found to reduce the borrowing requirement.  No significant evidence is apparent of coming to grips with the recurring burden of current expenditure.  We are now spending not just what is currently available from revenue but also what will be available to us in four or six years' time.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats have advocated vigorously over the past two years the necessity to reduce borrowing.  We advocated the kind of figures that have come to pass in the Estimates for this year.  We were denounced from all sides, not least from the present Government <Col N="1856" /> side, for what we were doing.  We were told that anyone who thought in those terms was Thatcherite, which in their eyes is the ultimate political insult.</P>
    <P>In advocating that necessity to reduce borrowing we recognised that great care would be required to avoid inflicting fundamental damage to the very delicate balance in the economy, particularly in the sick state in which it has been in recent years.  We recognise that our economy is more than a mathematical programme fed into some computer in the Department of Finance.  It requires a delicate approach to maintain the balance between four principal factors. These four factors are sectional aspirations, long term responsibility, consideration for the weak and reward for enterprise.  In trying to achieve a balance between these four factors we must not forget our people, our responsibility to them and to their potential to contribute.</P>
    <P>We have to recognise that the economies of the western world have been in a period of stagnation and that countries everywhere have had to accept the necessity for prudent housekeeping.  We can no longer expect the growth of our economy to come from the expansion of large-scale international corporations who move into new locations to increase their sales in newly-formed economic blocks.  We must develop an environment in which indigenous industry and services can prosper and we must realise that the nature of much of that industry and those services will have to be quite radically different from what they were even as recently as ten years ago.</P>
    <P>We need to look at the industrial policies we pursue and begin to realise that what can be pursued and what was pursued very successfully in the latter part of the seventies, and particularly at the turn of this decade, is clearly no longer relevant today.  It is disappointing that so little has been put forward by the Government at the level that is necessary to transform these policies so as to take account of the very changed situation which we are in.  It is not necessary to draw anyone's attention to the total absence in this budget of any strategy <Col N="1857" /> which could have this effect or will take account of the huge changes in industry and in services, and of the extraordinarily serious unemployment problem that we face today.</P>
    <P>At the Progressive Democrats' second national conference on 10 October last, Deputy Anne Colley, who was our spokesperson on labour and on related matters, said that there has been a forty-fold increase in the numbers of long term unemployed since the mid-sixties and that in social and therefore political terms this means that we live in a divided society and that expected levels of growth will not erode the huge numbers of long term unemployed.  Is it not time to offer the long term unemployed an opportunity to be part of our work force, an opportunity such as the third sector idea which is so widely used in many other countries, countries which do not have an unemployment problem as bad as ours or a long term unemployment problem even remotely as bad as ours?  Nothing was done in this budget in that regard.</P>
    <P>I would like to draw attention to that statistic.  Those who were in authority in the mid-sixties, those who were in this House at that time, agonised about unemployment and about unemployed people.  They agonised about people who had been unemployed for as long as 12 months or more.  Today we in this House face a problem 40 times greater and I do not see much agonising or much effort to come to grips with the problem.  It is very disappointing that in this budget while the fact that we have a large number of unemployed people is recognised, the only thing that is done for them is to hand them a little more money.  Money is regarded as the only solution open in this State for those people.  It does not solve any of the problems.  It is a minor temporary palliative which ensures that the situation they are in continues all the longer.</P>
    <P>Giving them a little more money simply ensures that they will be kept a little quieter than they would otherwise be kept and that they will not rock the boat in this rather divided society which, other things being equal, could easily be <Col N="1858" /> a society that could be torn by violent social disagreement.  The absence of any reference to any serious expectation of growth in the number of jobs is proof that employment creation is not part of the objective of this budget.  If one wants proof of that, the tables in the budget assume that the average level of unemployed for 1988 will be 253,000.  The only thing that might put that wrong from the Government's point of view and increase it substantially, would be if they were to suffer the misfortune of a drop in emigration.</P>
    <P>The figure quoted these days for annual emigration is 30,000 to 31,000.  What is sometimes overlooked is that that is net emigration.  It is frequently forgotten that every year, whether or not the economy is going well, at least 20,000 people come back into this country to settle here permanently, usually on their retirement from employment in other countries. Therefore, the gross emigration from this country last year and, presumably, unfortunately again next year it will be not fewer than 50,000 people.</P>
    <P>In the lengthy speech on the budget, which the Minister for Finance took an hour and a half to deliver, neither the word &ldquo;emigration&rdquo; not the concept of the problem were once referred to.  We were told that we now had GNP growth in real terms last year of 3½ per cent and that this is a marvellous achievement.  In the last resort the only thing that counts so far as most people in this country are concerned, is not some statistic on paper that might impress in a slight way a small number of foreign bankers, but the availability of employment here and the existence of a climate that will encourage people to become involved in this economy. Here we have this huge number of people who are long-term unemployed &mdash; 40 times more than we had 20 years ago &mdash; and all that can be done for them is to pay them some more money to keep them quiet and quiescent over the next 12 months and then something similar will be done again.</P>
    <P>It is not too soon to think about the strategies needed for the next budget where these factors will be taken into <Col N="1859" /> account rather than the ones which unfortunately were taken into account in this present budget.  In the meantime the Government should apply themselves to identifying additional areas of potential savings of current expenditure in the public sector, to addressing themselves particularly to those sectors which waste taxpayers' money and which contribute little or nothing for the money spent.  It seems that the State spending machine is used to lubricate structures for the benefit of those involved with or in them, losing sight of the original purpose of meeting the needs of those who pay for them.  The Progressive Democrats have repeated this message time and time again over the last two years.  It is beginning to be heard but it will only be heard properly and will only be acted on properly when we introduce some form of zero budgeting which does not begin from the premise that what a Department or agency had last year is where one starts from and that one adds to that inflation or whatever else.  Unless we are prepared to begin on the basis that no agency is entitled to anything unless it justifies itself, then we will never solve this problem.  Many of these structures and bodies that exist only for their own institutional sake and welfare remind me of dinosaurs which became extinct centuries ago.  In this country we seem to be helping with their rebirth.</P>
    <P>The Minister has achieved some recognition for his efforts in slowing the mad rush of debt burdened economic suicide with which we were faced.  It is therefore with some regret that although some months have passed since the publication of the departmental Estimates in October, there was no significant effect caused by their publication on the providers of new capital for industrial and economic expansion in this country.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance must be aware of the banking sector's movement in a substantial way into the housing mortgage market.  This trend has accelerated to a point where a few banks now account for 43 per cent of the funds advanced in 1987 for new housing loans. <Col N="1860" /> The Minister and all of us should ask ourselves what kind of an economy we are in where we have a large building society movement, as it is called, where the building societies are tripping over themselves to lend money at present and yet 43 per cent of the money for housing &mdash; which by no stretch of the imagination is productive in the short term &mdash; is being lent by banks which should be lending it for productive and employment creating purposes.  That money when lent by banks is largely a waste because it could so easily be lent elsewhere.  The volume of housing, of course, has dropped enormously.</P>
    <P>The drop in new housing construction to a level which is now equal to 50 per cent of what it was five years ago has resulted in a very significant increase in the liquidity of the traditional source of house mortgage loans, the building societies.  They are now circularising their existing borrowers asking them if they would like to borrow more money and saying that the societies would double their mortgage.  They are saying that they have so much money and are restricted from lending it for other purposes.  The banks are lending such a huge amount to house buyers that the societies cannot get rid of their money.  They are asking their borrowers if they would like more money.  I got such a letter myself from one such society with which I have a loan, asking me if I would like to take out a loan twice as large as the one I have. Perhaps they have not looked at my personal financial affairs when they send that out to me.</P>

      <P>It is pretty appalling that at the same time as all of this is going on, we have over 250,000 unemployed and industry and services, commerce and business generally very seriously short of capital in a country which is, by comparison with many others, largely capital starved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are residential areas in and around every town and city which are <Col N="1861" /> devastated by unemployment and emigration at the present time.  Millions of square feet of State-owned industrial premises have become economic graveyards while the financial institutions play &ldquo;Pass the parcel&rdquo; with exotic financial instruments which they have now developed, fixed assets based lending, funding external investment and at the same time they are doing as little as possible to provide finance for employment creating manufacturing industry at realistic interest rates.</P>
    <P>There is an ever-growing number of institutions competing for the spending by the consumer on imported consumer goods.  These institutions are providing leasing and hire purchase facilities at exorbitant rates of interest and they tell you that they need to charge high interest rates to cover the losses that they incur with bad payers.  They seem to be blind to the fact that people cannot maintain their payments because they have lost their jobs, because their employers are being driven out of business by exorbitant PRSI contributions, by high interest rates, by insufficient capital, by inadequate profit levels, by high rates, by high energy and transport costs, by high telephone costs, by high market costs.</P>
    <P>If we are to judge by the budgetary expectations of funding from the Central Bank for what I have already referred to and what is described in the budget as the &ldquo;Advance of Projected Future Profits&rdquo; of the bank, it is apparent that there is a very special relationship between the Minister for Finance and the Central Bank, as there should be.  I would ask the Minister to use his good offices with the bank so as to obtain the assistance of that bank when it sets its guidelines for sectional lending for the financial institutions so that a much larger percentage of lending is allocated for export-related and import-substitution manufacture.  There is an urgent need to broaden the base of the productive sector of the economy to reduce the level of debt, in addition to reducing the level of current expenditure. Economic strategies should be directed towards achieving these objectives at one and the same time.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1862" /> The philosophy expounded by Seán Lemass in the 1950s and 1960s when he spoke of a rising tide being able to raise the level of all craft that were afloat is regrettably unworkable in present-day conditions.  I am not wishing to be unfair when I say that I detect some threads of this philosophy in the somewhat passive way in which this budget moves the counters from one place to another, trying to leave it to the future to see if the tide will rise, in the hope that if it does it will give a lift which somehow or other will not create too many waves.  I do not think that we can afford to wait and see what may happen.  I believe we have to take things by the scruff of the neck and positively make them happen.</P>
    <P>In this regard I have to say that there is little evidence of any real sense of urgency with regard to State asset disposal and development.  As a nation we are obsessed with retaining the ownership of assets at the expense of depriving ourselves of working capital.  A private company which turns over the capital it has twice, three times, or even four times in a year, will generate activity, profits and growth which will bring benefits to the owners of the company and the workers in it alike.  We cannot live off the land simply because we own it; it is what the land produces that creates the food to sustain us.  We seem to have lost that point entirely, so far as our State companies are concerned and also many of the State assets.</P>
    <P>As I have said recently, I greatly regret that in this budget the opportunity was not taken to announce the privatisation of the Irish Life Assurance Company, which is the obvious first candidate in a programme that will have to be followed here and that this Government will have to follow, notwithstanding their solemn undertaking to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions last February in a letter from the present Taoiseach that nothing would be privatised.  They will have to follow this course, because even at this stage we are the only country in Western Europe where the State is not disposing of assets of this kind that it has available to it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1863" /> We should remind ourselves again by taking an analogy with a private company. If a private company have incurred enormous debt as a result of consistent borrowing and if they find themselves with a huge amount of assets on which they are getting either a negligible return, or no return, or even a negative return, then it is commercially crazy for that company to continue to service the burden of debt that they have at 10 to 13 per cent interest and retain assets on which they are getting little or no return.  The Irish Life Assurance Company are a classic example of that.  The dividend payable to the State is about £400,000 a year.  It recently increased to that figure; it had been lower.  The potential sale value of that company is about £300 million, we are told.  If it was sold that saves us, straight away, assuming a 10 per cent average interest or marginal interest rate, £30 million a year.  Why therefore retain something for the sake of £400,000 a year when by disposing of it you will make a profit of £29,600,000 a year, not just there and then but every year into the future, <i>ad infinitum?</i>  A country that runs its affairs in that fashion can be accused of being commercially crazy.  It is not exercising common sense. Equally if we look at those operations which are asset rich on which the State gets a negative return, the classic example is CIE where the taxpayer gives it a subsidy each year in excess of £100 million.</P>

      <P>The arrangement entered into was to facilitate more Deputies to allow them to contribute.  To date, each speaker has been allowed half an hour to contribute to the debate, and I was conscious last evening that there were a number of people offering to speak who certainly would not have got in this evening if it was not agreed that each speaker this evening would speak for only 15 minutes.  To date Fine Gael has only had three speakers and the Government party have had five speakers.  I would anticipate this evening that both my own party and other Opposition parties in the House should get in.  But Deputy Harney should be reminded that she had half an hour herself on her contribution.  I anticipate the Progressive Democrats certainly will get in this evening.  However it is not for me to rule on that but for the Chair. This arrangement is introduced not to curtail or prevent people from speaking <Col N="1865" /> but to facilitate additional Members getting in who would not otherwise have got in.</P>

Whilst Fine Gael might have had only two speakers, one speaker spoke for 40 minutes and the other for half an hour, and Deputy Flanagan is now in possession.

      <P>I will be brief in order to facilitate all Members of the House on this issue.  It is regrettable that the party that actually introduced the Bill has just had two speakers to date; I am the third. It is most unlikely that each and every person from our party who wants to contribute will have the opportunity to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Yesterday I covered many sections of <Col N="1866" /> this Bill which I regarded as being most welcome, having based my comments on a general feeling that if we are to tackle the problem of marital breakdown, we will have to take a very serious look at the question of increasing the age at which people can enter a contract of marriage.</P>
    <P>Just before we adjourned yesterday I was dealing with the serious difficulties that a family law practitioner has here. The general public and many members of this Legislature are not aware of the serious difficulties that arise in almost every courthouse in the country.  The atmosphere and the general surroundings militate against any form of conciliatory approach in family law matters.  In many instances applicants in family law courts must stand in a dancehall-like fashion, men on one side and women on the other. It is most degrading that people involved in this most traumatic proceeding have to put up with lack of proper seating facilities, never mind consultation rooms which I would regard as being of ultimate importance.  This is no way to deal with the problem of marriage breakdown. Now that we are proceeding to enact this Bill I suggest that we look at the manner in which we run our family law courts.</P>
    <P>Section 22 of the Bill is to be welcomed. It provides that the State should institute special day hearings for family law matters in buildings or at a time separate from other court proceedings.  This will do more than just facilitate the applicants and the officers of the court.  It will also facilitate the judges.  It is most unfair of us to expect a judge to engage in what could be a very lengthy criminal trial or a very lenghty civil matter and immediately afterwards go into camera to hear a family law matter.  It is very important to have a different venue or a different time for family law proceedings.</P>
    <P>Sections 22 and 33 deal with the informalities that are necessary if we are to adopt a more reasoned approach to family law hearings.  It is at present intimidating for many applicants or respondents to be faced with the concept of counsel with wigs and gowns, judges with wigs and gowns, the formal leather seating of the courts, the witness stand, the <Col N="1867" /> court crier and so on.  For family law matters it would be better to see less of the formal procedure.  This has worked very successfully in New Zealand and in Australia.  I certainly do not see it as demeaning in any way or reducing the status of our court officers.  It would go some way towards adopting a more reasoned and conciliatory approach in the entire matter.</P>
    <P>Deputy Harney mentioned that lawyers are shunning family law and, as a legal practitioner, I would agree with that.  For some reason, family law has become the poor relation.  Deputy Ahern said that the feeling was that there was no money in family law.  I would not like to think that is the reason.  I think it is because there is no sufficient expertise within the legal profession to deal with the problems. It is not surprising when, even in 1988, there is not in our law schools a comprehensive course in family law available to the students, nor is reaching a sufficient standard in family law required to pass a law examination.  Without this training and without the expertise family law will not be treated as it deserves by the legal practitioners.  It is important for practitioners of many years standing, as well as for the Judiciary, that refresher courses be introduced and training facilities be set up.  I do not think our Judiciary would disregard this suggestion or would regard themselves or their positions as being above it.  I think many of them would welcome it and that would be a very important step.  This is a matter that was strongly recommended by the Oireachtas Joint Committee which reported some years ago.</P>
    <P>As I said last night, I welcome the Bill but it will not function properly without a comprehensive improvement with regard to the legal aid facilities available in this country.  Undoubtedly the most fundamental defect in the Irish legal system is the absence of a comprehensive legal aid scheme.  We can have all the good legislation in the world but it will not be of any benefit unless there is access by the people to the courts and without <Col N="1868" /> improvement in our legal aid system this access will not be there.</P>
    <P>It is 11 years since the Pringle Report was published.  That report called for immediate consideration to be given to a comprehensive civil legal aid system. What we have seen since 1977 is the concept of the law centre which was set up to provide legal aid in centres of urban population.  I would not like to be overcritical of the law centres but there is a limit to the amount of work that these people can do.  It is unfortunate if somebody in a family law case has to have recourse to a law centre because it is lawyer by lottery in so far as they pick a ticket and are introduced and assigned to a particular lawyer without any choice whatever.  It is regrettable with a matter as traumatic as a family law case that one does not see one's lawyer until one is assigned one, without any element of choice.  Undoubtedly the lack of finance for the running of a particular case means, in many instances, a lot of hardship. It is a denial of access to the courts and perhaps leads many people to seek legal advice from untrained people, such as social workers or, indeed, politicians, as is often the case.</P>
    <P>Sections 13 and 19 of the Bill deal in some respects with the question of maintenance.  I think it was my colleague, Deputy Monica Barnes, who called for a fairer system of maintenance and I think everybody on all sides of the House would be in agreement with a fairer system of maintenance in family law matters. Society has ordained that the basic wage that is available to a breadwinner is to provide him or her with sufficient means to look after their families.  Never was it envisaged and never will it be envisaged that sufficient wages will be given to somebody to look after two families and that is the difficulty we will always have with regard to maintenance &mdash; no matter what the dispute, one wage will not run two families or two houses. However, section 13 attempts to regularise matters but the grim reality is that one cannot divide what is not there.</P>
    <P>I agree with the setting up of family law courts and with the removal of the <Col N="1869" /> concept of fault and blame.  This brings me back to section 2 which I see as being fundamental.  I urge the Government not to consider amendments along the lines suggested by the Law Reform Commission. We have before us the Oireachtas Joint Committee report which considered 700 written submissions and which heard many submissions from all interested parties.  I urge that section 2 should not be amended on Committee Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>In the light of the agreement to curtail the individual contributions to 15 minutes it is my intention to do so.  I had intended pacing myself for 30 minutes but I am sure, on the basis of the agreement, there was a general sigh of relief that I will not have to expound for any longer than 15 minutes. This is a subject which is very dear to my heart and has been of serious concern to me in my privileged and long membership of this House.  The Bill is part of a development in Irish politics which I very much welcome, that is consensus politics. Because one is in Opposition, therefore one apparently, up to recent times, was completely shut out in terms of presenting legislation or having a point of view accepted by the Government of the day.  I welcome this development.  It is one which I have been seeking during my public life.  It is nice to see consensus coming into democracy in this country, albeit belatedly, but welcome nevertheless.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is in that spirit of consensus that we welcome Deputy Shatter's Bill, and I welcome it unreservedly.  It was a genuine effort by a Dáil Deputy on his own behalf, regardless of which political party he happens to be a member, to achieve perfection in an area where perfection is required.  It is on those grounds that I welcome the Bill &mdash; on the ground of consensus and on the ground of an achievement by an individual Dáil Deputy to produce very complex and important legislation.  I hope this is not the last time a Deputy in Opposition or, indeed, a Deputy in Government in the backbenches, will bring forward a Bill of <Col N="1870" /> this nature &mdash; in this instance dealing with family law.  It is a good day's work for Dáil Éireann and I thank the Deputy for bringing the Bill forward.</P>
    <P>In relation to the Bill, it is not my intention to engage in a lecture on morality either inside or outside marriage. There are enough people trained in morality to get on with the business of telling us how we should conduct our lives.  I do it by an instinct, I hope an instinct of decency.  However, I can offer some little advice and observe on the horror and the eventual tragedy of marital breakdown.  It is fair to point out to the House that there is surely no Deputy in this House untouched by marital breakdown, either within one's immediate family, within the extended family, uncle, aunt, brother or sister or a friend who is suffering in this country at present from either tension within marriage or marriage breakdown.</P>
    <P>I do not want to be pessimistic about marriage because it is an institution that we cherish and do our best to protect against all the attacks on it from outside marriage.  The family is a fundamental unit in our society.  Inevitably it is the family against or with every other family. The family is first, second and last.  As long as the family unit remains steady society benefits directly.  It would be most unusual if, within our immediate or extended family, or within the circles in which we move, we did not know somebody with a problem of marriage breakdown.</P>
    <P>I was one of those Deputies who was &ldquo;guilty&rdquo; of supporting the referendum on divorce.  I was one of those people who expressed the view that, when marriage has broken down irretrievably, the State should provide for divorce.  When a referendum was put to them the people decided, in their wisdom, that such a proposition was unacceptable at this time.  Being a democrat, I accept the will of the people.  I do not necessarily agree but one agrees to disagree and accepts their decision.  Without making a political point I believe that the referendum on the subject was put too soon, that people were not prepared for it and that it will <Col N="1871" /> be put properly in, say, ten years time. It might be accepted then, if not by my generation, by that of my children, that they would have a different point of view. Although, viewing my children's generation, it would appear that they will be as conservative as mine.  As is well known, one tends to be radical when young and become conservative when older.</P>
    <P>This Bill is properly supported in principle by the Government.  It is to be referred to a special committee of the House.  I hope the Government do not support it in a begrudging manner, but rather give their full support to its principles. From the backbenches of the Government party I support it in an unreserved and hopefully generous fashion.  I do not begrudge its thrust or intent in any way in what it seeks to achieve.</P>
    <P>It is my respectful submission that the composition of the special committee of the House will be most important.  It should be comprised of members of the House with a special knowledge of and concern in the whole area of marriage breakdown.  The people who might be appointed thereto by their various parties would need to have shown a special interest in family law reform.  I make that merely as a proposal.  The Government can appoint whoever they wish.  I would have no say in that matter but, for goodness sake, let people be appointed to the committee who have a special interest in the subject.</P>
    <P>The provisions of this Bill seek, as the sole ground for separation, the concept of irretrievable breakdown.  I understand the word &ldquo;sole&rdquo; to mean only and the word &ldquo;irretrievable&rdquo; that, &ldquo;never the twain shall meet&rdquo;, that the marriage has irretrievably broken down.</P>
    <P>As I understand the position in law at present with regard to judicial separation one can discharge a decree.  For that reason it concerns me.  Perhaps I am misinterpreting the meaning of the word &ldquo;irretrievable&rdquo;.  I should have thought that &ldquo;irretrievable&rdquo; would relate to the type of divorce I wanted and which the people decided we could not have.  In <Col N="1872" /> relation to judicial separation I should have thought that &ldquo;irretrievable&rdquo; was a wrong concept.  I am sure Deputy Shatter, when responding, will deal with that point.  For example, section 1 says:</P>
    <P>After the commencement of this Act the sole ground upon which an application for judicial separation (divorce <i>a mensa et thoro</i>) may be presented to the court by either party to a marriage and granted by the court shall be that the marriage has broken down irretrievably.</P>
    <P>No doubt Deputy Shatter, in his able way, will dismiss my observation. However, I hope he will take it as one made in as constructive a manner as possible, based on my interpretation of the meaning of the word &ldquo;irretrievable&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The question of mediation and counselling was dealt with thoroughly in the report of the Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown.  We should endeavour in every way possible to protect marriages against breakdown and, in that sense, look to the recommendations of that committee.  That report set out parameters for mediation and counselling and the necessary requirements there for. Here I might refer the House to what is said at page 121 of that report, chapter 8, under the heading of, &ldquo;Mediation&rdquo; where the committee's opinion is well expressed.  There are there set out the ground rules for a mediation service. That is the sort of service we should be providing before considering the finality of marriage breakdown.</P>
    <P>I could not agree more with Deputy Flanagan's remarks about informality of court proceedings, dispensing with the wearing of wigs and gowns, etc.  Indeed I would contend that not only should the wig be abandoned in family courts &mdash; where informality is necessary &mdash; but in all courts from the Supreme Court down to the Circuit Court.  The gown perhaps is not intimidating, it saves one's clothing against the wear and tear occasioned in the course of one's daily practice but if abandonment of the gown would help create an atmosphere of informality, then <Col N="1873" /> so much the better.  I would campaign strongly for the abandonment of the wig.</P>
    <P>There is a problem <i>vis-à-vis</i> provision for children in the Bill, in that it does not expressly provide that a court, before granting a decree of judicial separation, must be satisfied that the arrangements made for each child of a marriage are reasonable and adequate in the circumstances. Conceding that, perhaps one cannot fit in as much as one would wish in a Bill of this kind, I would hope that, when it is referred to the special committee, there would be express provision made for children by way of counselling, accommodation, financial arrangements and so on, and that those provisions would be clearly spelled out.</P>

      <P>I welcome this Bill which is long overdue.  It is a Bill which comes from a constituency colleague of mine. I have long had admiration for Deputy Shatter and the work he has done along these lines.  The problem of marriage breakdown has been unattended for many years and is probably the most urgent problem in the social area.  I believe the numbers involved are greatly underestimated.  That could be due to the innate shyness in the Irish people and the wish to keep private one's business.  I believe the census figures recently released indicating how many people said they were separated, underestimates the numbers involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill introduces greater access to the remedy of legal separation.  The former situation was almost a prohibition for most people obtaining a legal separation, even when they had acknowledged that their marriages had irretrievably broken down.  The two <Col N="1874" /> possibilities of a remedy were to go to the High Court, a slow, cumbersome, costly process with very limited grounds on which they could claim a decree, or they could agree to execute a deed of separation.  For many couples in the midst of a marriage breakdown, the latter is not an option.  With the best will in the world, even if both of them wish to complete a deed of separation, getting to the nub of the matter, they cannot agree the details. This Bill allows many of those couples to come to court with far greater access and by proving that the one ground for separation exists, they are entitled to be judicially separated and the court is entitled to make orders ancillary to that separation.</P>
    <P>I welcome the extra flexibility that is given to the courts because up to now it was extremely expensive for couples who wished to obtain a judicial separation. They had to initiate many separate actions which were in themselves costly and in the end were being dealt with on one occasion.</P>
    <P>Again I want to welcome the removal of the fault element from obtaining a judicial separation.  Earlier in the debate points were made as to whether the fault element is really being removed.  I believe it is, as much as is humanly possible.  By saying that the one ground for obtaining a judicial separation is irretrievable breakdown &mdash; certainly there may be, and will be, faults on both sides &mdash; the emphasis is not on determining who was at fault but simply what was the result of that fault on both sides, and if it had led to this breakdown.</P>
    <P>The Bill is only part of the kind of reform that is needed in the marital law area.  I welcome it wholeheartedly because it is a major step forward.  It is a radical Bill in terms of what we have known so far, but it really only touches the surface of the kind of attitudinal changes we should be looking for and the kind of support services for marriage which we have denied marriage for so long.</P>
    <P>I am starting with education.  I do not just mean pre-marriage education.  I am speaking about the kind of education which starts in the home, that will be <Col N="1875" /> continued in schools and that will be available before a couple get married. Deputy Flanagan referred to the fact that many people enter into marriage far easier than they enter a mortgage contract for a house.  That is not good enough for the kind of contract marriage is and the kind of commitment we are asking people to make.  We are pushing them into it with their eyes closed.  This Bill deals with the result of possibly doing that, but we must look to the preventive measures which we are not providing.</P>
    <P>Other areas we have to look at very seriously in conjunction with this Bill, are those relating to marriage counselling.  I for one would not use the terminology &ldquo;marriage guidance counselling&rdquo; because that is misleading and I speak as a former marriage counsellor.  The main element in counselling has to be enabling the couple to make up their minds about the direction they should be following.  It is not guidance.  That is a very important differentiation to make.  The counsellor does not guide the couple, the counsellor facilitates and enables the couple to do that.  Many people look for advice when they should be looking for counselling. We do not have those services available to us.</P>
    <P>This Bill requires a lawyer to inform his or her client of the services that are available, the names and addresses of the people offering the services and to direct their clients to get help in that line.  The simple facts are that there is one main organisation offering nationwide counselling, and that is run by the Catholic Church.  There are a number of smaller organisations but there is no support coming from the State.  The kind of support that has been offered for counselling by the State in recent years has been, to say the least of it, grudging.  It has amounted to some £100,000 a year for supporting those kind of services.  Considering the number of people getting married, the number who are married, and whose marriages are in difficulty, that sum is totally inadequate.</P>
    <P>Mediation is another area which is referred to in this Bill and, as far as I am <Col N="1876" /> concerned, this should be increased in extent.  We have one pilot project operating in Dublin.  That may fold next year when its term runs out, and what do we do then?  The role of a mediator is separate to that of a counsellor or lawyer. In fact, it is very much a preventive role, and if a mediator is working properly he or she will be able to prevent the couple going into court for the adversarial type of destructive situation we see so often nowadays.</P>
    <P>Deputy Andrews unreservedly welcomed the Bill and I was very glad to hear him do so.  However, I have to draw attention to the fact that the Minister for Social Welfare replying to Deputy Shatter said he welcomed the Bill, but he immediately went on to question the basic concept, that is irretrievable breakdown. To my mind, you can only define, parse and analyse the phrase &ldquo;irretrievable breakdown&rdquo; to a reasonable degree.  My understanding of the change this Bill proposes is that there is a reasonable expectation that the relationship will not be resumed.  That is as far as one can go.  One does not have second sight and knows the relationship will be resumed, but all the indicators should point to irretrievable breakdown.</P>
    <P>I mentioned the fault concept in the present legislation which has been so destructive and is removed in this Bill. That is extremely important, because at present if a couple are in difficulties and go separately to lawyers or solicitors, the solicitor doing his or her job will advise the client of his or her rights, and the best way of achieving those rights.  That encourages exploitation of the difficulties as opposed to efforts to reconcile.  It is built into the system.  I welcome the move away from that because it allows tempers to cool.  It allows people to stand back from the situation and to make a considered decision.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the proofs required to establish irretrievable breakdown. He took exception to section 2 (1) (f) which says that the family and marital circumstances are such that it is reasonable for the applicant to wish to live separate and apart from the respondent and <Col N="1877" /> to cease to be obliged to cohabit with the respondent.  Deputy Cowen also threw cold water on this provision and he could not see any reason for its inclusion. However, I know of many situations where that is very reasonable and useful. For instance, a couple may agree that they do not wish to live together but they cannot agree on the details or they may be living separate lives under one roof.  I know of cases where houses have been physically divided, children living with the mother in one part of the houses and the father in the other.  The father refuses to agree to a deed of separation, they cannot afford to go to court and, in that case, subsection (f) is exactly what is required.  They have, indeed, reached the stage where their marriage has irretrievably broken down; they do not wish to live together but one or other party find that they have no redress.</P>
    <P>Protection of children has too often been used as a weapon in marital warfare. It is all too easily used and any protection children can get against it is essential. However, the Bill merely allows the court to look for a report from other services regarding the welfare of the children.  I would favour putting in the Bill that the court must, in any case where there is a disagreement regarding the children, refer to specialists for a report.</P>
    <P>Provision for interim orders concerning custody, maintenance or access is very welcome because the period of time leading up to a court hearing, after the proceedings have been initiated, is fraught with difficulties and high emotions.  In those cases, interim orders can help to defuse the situation so that a useful court hearing takes place.  The right of the court to make orders regarding the family home or lump sum payments, particularly where a non-working spouse is involved, is just, because such spouse should have his or her contribution recognised and the family life to which they have contributed taken into account.</P>
    <P>One aspect about which I have been particularly concerned for some time is in relation to where a family home is mortgaged or a loan obtained against it. <Col N="1878" /> Under present legislation, the spouse has an equitable right in that periphery but is not told about the mortgage or the loan and the first they know about it is when the sheriff is on the doorstep.  At the very least, the spouse who has not a real interest on paper in the property should be notified of any loans or mortgages made against the property.</P>
    <P>Finally, I want to refer to the provisions regarding the requirement to refer to counsellors.  Couples in difficulties should be referred to counsellors but my experience is that many couples who reach the point where they go to a solicitor have gone past the stage of going to counsellors. That is not to say that some of them would not benefit from counselling but I am very fearful that it will simply clog the existing counselling system if couples whose only interest in going to a counsellor is simply to fulfil the rigour of the law and to have another stamp on their passport to judicial separation.  I am afraid that it will be more of a hindrance to the way the Bill should work than a help.  It certainly could become a hindrance to those who are legitimately seeking counselling at an early stage in their difficulties and when they may have a far greater chance of reconciliation.</P>
    <P>The system of courts for marriage breakdown suggested in the Bill is welcome. However, marriage tribunals would be preferable in the first instance. I am not saying that they should have a total say in this sphere but just in the first instance, to bring it away from the formality inherent in a court.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very pleased that this Bill is before the House and that the Government allowed it in Private Members' time.  I also welcome the fact that they are supportive of the Bill.  It is one of the results of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown which sat for over two years.  Of the 11 Dáil Members who sat on the committee, there are still seven in the House.  As one who sat on the committee, I am particularly pleased that the Bill is now before the House.  One of the recommendations made by the committee was <Col N="1879" /> that a referendum should be held to change the constitutional ban on divorce. The referendum was held and lost and the next initiative is the presentation of this Bill.  I commend Deputy Shatter for the trojan work he has done in assiduously preparing the Bill and the manner in which he has presented it.  The committee worked extremely hard; they met most weeks on two occasions and sometimes during the weekends.  There was a remarkably high level of attendance at all the meetings and a very high degree of interest expressed by all the members. There was a great degree of sympathy and concern and the result was that we presented a report which had the agreement of all the representatives on the committee.</P>
      <P>Many recommendations were made by the committee but most of them cannot be dealt with in this Bill which deals very specifically with legal reform.  There were other recommendations in relation to the protection of marriage and family life and we dealt extensively with education, counselling and mediation and recommended that the minimum age for marriage should be 18 years.  I hope at some future date that legislation will be introduced to deal with these issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am happy that the grounds on which judicial separation should be sought are the grounds of irretrievable breakdown. The committee recommended that the court should grant a decree of judicial separation if it was satisfied that the marriage had irretrievably broken down and that irretrievable breakdown should be the one and overall ground for the grant of a decree of judicial separation.  The committee recommended that in considering whether a marriage had irretrievably broken down the court should satisfy itself of one of a number of aspects, all of which are incorporated in the Bill and are practically as recommended by the Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown.  This is far more commendable than the situation that exists at present where you have to judge on a fault or of accusing one partner <i>vis-à-vis</i> the other.  This situation leads to a <Col N="1880" /> lot of harassment, to a lot of bad feeling and indeed goes from bad to worse, not helping in any way to come to any type of satisfactory conclusion particularly where children are involved.  What is recommended in this Bill must be commended and did have the full support of the Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown.</P>
    <P>Deputy Andrews was particularly concerned that the Bill did not provide adequately for children.  On going through the Bill I find there are a number of sections which deal extensively with the protection of children.  Section 11 sets out the criteria the court is to have in regard to the making of an order relating to a family home, pursuant to section 10 (1).  In exercising the latter jurisdiction the court is required to have regard to the welfare of the family as a whole and in particular must take into consideration the following matters:</P>
    <P>(a)  that where a decree of judicial separation is granted it is not possible for the parties to a marriage to continue to reside together;</P>
    <P>(b)  that proper and secure accommodation should, where practicable, be provided for a dependent spouse and any dependent child of the family.</P>
    <P>Section 18 effectively provides that where a maintenance order is made by the court such maintenance payments should be made to the local office of the District Court in the same manner as such payments are currently made under the Family Law Act, 1976, unless the spouses agree to a different method of payment.</P>
    <P>Section 19 gives power to the court to make an attachment of earnings order, to require the employer to deduct the necessary moneys where the spouse has failed to make the payments directly to the court.  It protects the interests of children to a certain degree so I do not understand why Deputy Andrews has some difficulty with it.</P>
    <P>In relation to the overall court procedure &mdash; an issue we dealt with very extensively in the committee &mdash; we were particularly concerned by the present <Col N="1881" /> manner in which family cases are conducted. We were concerned particularly that spouses were subjected to being out in corridors or halls for everybody to see, with one barrister running one way and another running the other way.  The other problem was the intimidating manner in which court proceedings are conducted and the effect that has on the applicants for judicial separation.  It was recommended in our report that, as far as possible, all this be changed.  We recommend that the wig and gown be disposed of and that all the formal trappings, more associated with mid-17th century legal behaviour be done away with.  While Deputy Andrews agrees with getting rid of the wig, I say that all the trappings should be got rid of.  As Deputy Shatter recommends in the Bill the court hearings should take place on days when the other courts are not taking place and that, as far as possible &mdash; although we do appreciate that there is a financial difficulty in relation to providing separate buildings at this stage &mdash; cases be heard somewhere conducive to cordial discussion rather than in a formal court setting.</P>
    <P>In rural areas that might be more possible than in some of the courts in the Dublin area.  There is one thing in particular I am happy that Deputy Shatter has included in this Bill and that is that the family law court be of similar status to the Circuit Court.  We on the Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown had much discussion on that issue and we examined it closely.  There was a strong body of opinion that the court should have the status of the High Court.  I believe that the High Court is not as accessible or as available to the public at large as is the Circuit Court is.  The Circuit Court sits in practically every county and as such is more accessible to the people.  For that reason it is good that this Bill recommends a Circuit Court status for the family court.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the fact that the one application could cover a number of issues.  At present various applications are being made for different areas, for example, maintenance orders, barring orders, separation agreements and <Col N="1882" /> judicial separations.  There are many justices and judges dealing with many issues relating to the same marriage.  This Bill recommends that they be all incorporated into the one application.  That is good because it serves a number of purposes.  It reduces the cost on the people concerned and, as well as that, the process can be got through much more speedily.  That is welcome.</P>
    <P>Sections 23 and 33 deal with the area of informality.  Previous speakers have also recommended these sections.  Overall, the Bill does a great service to people who are in a very difficult situation, who are in extreme difficulties and who need to be treated in a humane and civilised way.  This Bill does something to help them, to relieve them of some of the fears they have at present.  It makes the situation more relaxed and less formal. The Bill is a major and radical step forward. It is the first major radical piece of legislation that has been present in relation to family law in the past 200 years.  It implements many of the recommendations of the Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown.  As I said previously, there are many other recommendations which it is not within the ambit of this Bill to deal with but which it is within the ambit of Department of Health Bills or Department of Social Welfare Bills to deal with in the future. I hope they will be dealt with.</P>
    <P>The Bill specifically provides for the granting of a decree of judicial separation when a marriage has irretrievably broken down and that is extremely important.  It provides for the circuit family court which could be the principal court and this is of particular significance.  It confers on the court comprehensive legal powers to make financial, property, custody and other orders necessary for the protection of dependent spouses and children following the granting of separation decrees.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides additional protection for wives and children by enabling the courts to make lump sum payment orders and property transfer orders.  It requires the court to recognise the contribution made by the wife who works in <Col N="1883" /> the home and that is something that has not been taken into serious consideration previously.  It states that the court, when making financial and property orders, must have regard to the contribution made by each spouse to the welfare of the family, including any contribution made by looking after the home or caring for the family, to the income earning capacity, property and financial resources of the other spouse and indeed to the effect on the earning capacity of each spouse of the marital responsibilities assumed by each during the marriage. It reduces very significantly the financial cost of family law court proceedings. That is very important because at present family law court proceedings are not available to a very large percentage of the population because of the huge high expense involved.  There are many people who would dearly love to be in the position to go before the courts to have their matters settled but they are unable to do so.</P>
    <P>This Bill will also radically reform the approaches to the court by ensuring that Circuit Court proceedings are not heard at the same time as criminal proceedings and other legal actions.  It will require the District, Circuit and High Courts when involved in family law matters to ensure that family law proceedings are as informal as is practicable and consistent with the administration of justice. It will also prohibit judges and barristers&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Bill is highly commendable in that it will prohibit judges, barristers and solicitors from appearing in family law proceedings wearing wigs and gowns and all of the formal trappings which go with it.  It will confer independent power on the courts when determining custody cases to seek <Col N="1884" /> independent medical, psychiatric, psychological or social worker reports when necessary to do so in the interests of a child's welfare.</P>
      <P>This Bill is a very comprehensive one and there is nothing within the legal ambit which has not been dealt with.  Again I compliment Deputy Shatter for the tremendous work he has done and for the sincere and humane way in which he has dealt with this matter.  I am delighted that he has been afforded the opportunity to bring this Bill before the House and nationally I think everybody recognises his expertise.  I am very happy that the Government party on this occasion have seen fit to support the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>At the risk of being repetitive, I, too, wish to commend my constituency colleague, Deputy Shatter, for bringing this important legislation before the House.  I am aware of the work which has been put into preparing this Bill and I wish to join with the many other speakers who to date have complimented Deputy Shatter.</P>
      <P>This Bill is a response to the evergrowing problem of marital breakdown in society and also the many recommendations made by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown. The fact that the present law in relation to the obtaining of decrees of separation is based on legislation introduced in 1870, over 100 years ago, is an indication of the urgent need to update our legislation in this area to meet the needs of the many couples involved in cases of marital breakdown.  It is quite obvious that the grounds for marital separation must be broadened, given the fact that the old grounds upon which a decree of separation can be granted is upon proof of adultery, cruelty or unnatural practices. Therefore, putting it simply, this Bill is overdue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In some ways the fact that it comes before the House in Private Members' Time is breaking a mould in regard to the introduction of this type of legislation and I believe that this is a good thing.  I would like to see this aspect of Dáil procedure developed, in particular where it relates <Col N="1885" /> to social issues on which there would be all-party support and consensus, as appears to be the case on this issue.  The Minister indicated to the House that the Government proposals for changes in the law on separation are at an advanced stage of preparation.  Therefore, in one sense the Bill is most timely in that there is a coming together of much work on both sides of the House.  I must say that Deputy Shatter in particular deserves our congratulations for initiating the necessary reform.</P>
    <P>Any of us who conducts advice centres will recognise the growing problem of marital breakdown and the tragic circumstances in which many people find themselves.  Many spouses are trapped in, due to archaic legislation.  The passing of this legislation will mean that there will be new hope and a chance of a new life for such people.  A couple will be able to get a judicial separation if their marriage breaks down irretrievably. Most couples will still resort to comprehensive deeds of separation.  It is obviously better for couples to come to mutually satisfactory solutions rather than to involve themselves in the courts. I believe that in section 4 of the Bill an obligation should be placed on the client to respond to a solicitor advising reconciliation and mediation.  I think there could be a strengthening in this area and it is one improvement in the Bill which I would recommend.</P>
    <P>Many of these points will come up again on Committee Stage and the real debate will take place on that Stage.  The fact is that many spouses cannot agree to the terms of separation and the need to resort to the courts is there.  This Bill responds to that reality.  The Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Bill is being debated in a spirit of all-party cooperation and reality based, I would presume, on the lengthy deliberations of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown.  Obviously, that has been very productive and this all-party approach has emerged from those difficult and lengthy deliberations.  It is obvious to me that the work done in that <Col N="1886" /> committee over the years has been most worthwhile.</P>
    <P>There is one other constructive criticism which I have to make and Deputy Taylor-Quinn referred to the fact that my colleague, Deputy Andrews, did refer to this.  It is in regard to the children.  I must express concern about the welfare of children in relation to this Bill in that it does not provide for the court, before granting a decree, to be satisfied that the arrangements made for each child are adequate and reasonable in the circumstances. Proper arrangements must be in mandatory form for any dependent children.  It should not be left to the discretion of the courts.  Family law courts should be established and successive Governments have failed to address themselves to that issue.</P>
    <P>The procedural changes embodied in the Bill are to be welcomed and these again have been referred to by many speakers.  The fact that family business in the courts will be conducted as informally as possible in a very positive thing and the fact that judges and barristers will not wear wigs or gowns is a good development and very much a step in the right direction.  I welcome the fact that the Government have expressed support for the &ldquo;principle&rdquo; of the Bill.  As I have said, I have no doubt that the real debate will take place on Committee Stage.  Taking into account that this legislation will help so many people in real difficulties I hope that the positive atmosphere which has been building up during the course of this debate will continue into Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The census figure of 37,245 people affected in a legal sense by marital breakdown tells its own sad story.  The real figure is no doubt much higher as many people who suffer these problems do not come forward.  We are all aware of this. Deputy Shatter has tried in this Bill to bring forward the most comprehensive measures possible in this area.  We have reached a new level of maturity in this House when an Opposition Deputy can play such a positive and prominent role in bringing forward new legislation.  As Deputy Shatter is now about to reply <Col N="1887" /> I will reserve any future comments for Committee Stage but, like my colleague, Deputy Andrews, I will conclude by saying that I welcome the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank all those who have contributed to the debate.  The debate on this Bill has run for two weeks and I think it has been an exceptional debate.  I cannot recall any issue being discussed in this House since I was elected in 1981 in which all of the parties here, of different ideologies, backgrounds and political beliefs, have come together in a non-party political way to confront a major social issue and to deal with legislation in a constructive way.  Many of the criticisms and comments which have been made have been by way of constructive criticism by people who wish to ensure that when this legislation is enacted it will have the intended effect which is to provide a modern and humane code of family law which will enable people whose marriages have collapsed to separate in a civilised way and in a way in which the law would not exacerbate marital conflict but rather seek to ameliorate it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the fact, as Deputy Kitt correctly said, that in the last couple of weeks we have in a sense &mdash; to use a phrase that Deputy Harney on occasion used &mdash; managed to break a mould.  The House has reached a new degree of political maturity.  I welcome the fact, if I can be permitted one indulgence in making one partisan comment in a debate that has not been partisan, that it is the Fine Gael Party who are leading in breaking the mould.  I would hope that the constructive debate we have had in the last two weeks, the use of Private Members' Business to bring forward a major social legislation to deal with a reform that is badly needed, can be repeated time and again during the lifetime of this Dáil to bring forward other measures.  I have already put on the record of the House that the Adoption Bill we published last year, and the Bill before us tonight, are among a number of social reforming measures that the Fine <Col N="1888" /> Gael Party in Opposition intend bringing before the House in Private Members' Business.  I hope that the precedent we are establishing in this area will be mirrored so that finally Members can be perceived as acting as legislators and not merely be seen to be the playthings or the tools of the Government of the day engaged in a game of confrontational politics from the Opposition benches or from the Government benches, as the passive supporters of measures they may occasionally not approve of.</P>
    <P>The Bill represents a new departure.  I am not saying that in a sense myself; I am saying it to praise all the Members who participated in the debate.  I look forward to a constructive Committee Stage when we will tease out many of the worries that have been expressed and look at the different sections of the Bill. It is not going to be possible for me tonight to deal with all the issues raised by those who have contributed to the debate.  However, I want to refer briefly to some of them because they will, no doubt, be in the forefront of the minds of many Deputies who will be involved on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>In opening the debate on the Bill I welcomed the constructive approach of the Government in putting it on the record of the House before Christmas that they supported the Bill in principle and would not be opposing it on Second Stage.  I reiterate that welcome tonight but I have to say that some aspects of the contribution of Deputy Woods, on behalf of the Minister for Justice, give rise to serious concern in the context of what the Bill is seeking to achieve and what the thinking might be in the Minister's Department.  It appears to be at variance not merely with the intent of the Bill but at variance to a very strange degree with the recommendations of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown.</P>
    <P>As the many speakers on all sides of the House who were members of that joint committee have said, the Bill seeks to accurately reflect the concensus that was reached in that committee with regard to marriage law reform and, in <Col N="1889" /> particular, with regard to our laws relating to marriage breakdown and judicial separation.  The Oireachtas Joint Committee reported in 1985 and some two years before that committee reported the Law Reform Commission also published a report dealing with the law relating to judicial separation.  The report of the Law Reform Commission was considered in detail by the joint committee and was considered and referred to by many of the groups who made written submissions to the joint committee and by many of those who made oral submissions to that committee.</P>
    <P>I have to record, and I am sure others such as Deputy Harney and Deputy Taylor who contributed this evening will confirm, that there was universal agreement within the joint committee that the approach recommended by the Law Reform Commission should not be adopted.  Yet, when the Minister came to deal with some of the specific provisions of the Bill practically all of the criticisms he raised with a view to indicating suggested amendments he may propose on Committee Stage derive from proposals of the Law Reform Commission which were rejected by the joint committee.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that in the deliberations of the House on a Bill such as this the views expressed by a joint committee of the Oireachtas should be taken very seriously in so far as they differ from what the Law Reform Commission said.  That should be so in particular because the joint committee engaged in a consultative process that was alien to the way in which the Law Reform Commission worked during the lifetime of the previous Law Reform Commission.  The most important difference is that the Law Reform Commission sought to retain in the context of separation laws the old confrontational approach.  The Law Reform Commission recommended, in effect, that the current law be retained and a couple of new grounds be added on upon which a husband or a wife whose marriage has broken down could obtain a decree of separation.</P>
    <P>The Law Reform Commission would have retained generally, though there is <Col N="1890" /> one exception to this, the concept of the matrimonial offence, and generally imposed upon the courts a requirement that they label a husband or wife as the guilty party when a marriage collapses. The joint committee, as many speakers have said, sought to take some of that confrontational approach out of the law and unanimously recommended that irretrievable breakdown should be the one overall ground upon which a decree of separation should be granted.  By proposing that irretrievable breakdown should be the sole ground, the joint committee recognised that the committing of adultery or cruelty which currently constitutes a ground for getting a separation decree, or the desertion by one spouse of the other, is most often simply an external manifestation or symptom of marital failure but is rarely the sole cause of marital breakdown.</P>
    <P>In the vast majority of cases the joint committee recognised that both a husband and a wife in marriage by their behaviour either intentionally or unintentionally to varying degrees most often contribute to the permanent sundering of a marital relationship.  They recognised that a law founded on the doctrine of breakdown would accord with social reality by recognising this fact and effectively accepting that the purpose of separation proceedings is not to provide a procedure designed to assign blame or determine guilt for marital failure but is to provide a judicial procedure that can give factual recognition to the inability of a husband and wife to maintain a stable and lasting relationship with each other. Indeed, the concept of marital breakdown emphasises the importance of what could be described as the relationship concept of marriage as opposed to the contractual concept of marriage.  In a sense such an approach acknowledges that there is nothing to be gained either for a husband or a wife, or for society in general, by ultimately labelling a particular husband or wife as guilty or innocent.</P>
    <P>Indeed, the joint committee very cogently made the point that whenever a marriage breaks down, in a large number <Col N="1891" /> of cases there are still young children, and the husband and wife who separate, despite the fact that they are living apart from each other, will for many years in the future have to co-operate with each other as parents of their children.  The labelling of one spouse as the guilty person when a marriage has broken down does not assist in any way the possibility of a husband and wife as mother and father, as parents, in the future co-operating with each other in the interests of their children.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that the approach of the Minister, which, in fairness to him, appeared to be an acceptance of what the Law Reform Commission said without realising that the joint committee rejected its recommendations, and his suggestion that he may seek to amend the Bill to accord with the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission, seems to be based on a belief that in some way it is in the interests of husbands and wives that we label or isolate one or other of them as the person solely responsible for a marriage breaking down.  I would take the view that this is not and should not be a goal of social policy and that rather than minimising family divisions and promoting future harmony between a couple following breakdown such an approach would simply perpetuate and exacerbate family conflict.  It should be a major social policy consideration that we seek to minimise conflict.</P>
    <P>The Minister and some speakers on the Fianna Fáil side of the House said that in the context of irretrievable breakdown there are six sets of facts that can be established in a court by which it can be established that a marriage has irretrievably broken down.  They pointed out that three of them are themselves a matrimonial offence concept, proof of desertion or proof of cruelty.  Each of these, as recommended by the Oireachtas Joint Committee, is not used to label a spouse as guilty or innocent.  The proof of either of these facts merely constitutes evidence that a marriage has broken down.  The fact that a husband or wife has deserted <Col N="1892" /> the other is very clear evidence that a marriage has collapsed.  Upon establishing that either of these things has happened, the court can make the decision that quite clearly the marriage has irretrievably broken down.  The decree obtained from a court does not label any spouse as the guilty or innocent party. Anyone who practices in the area of family law as lawyer, social worker or guidance counsellor will say it is very rare that a husband or wife leaves home simply as a result of a whim.  It normally takes two people to create the problem. Within the context of this Bill it is quite possible for a couple to get a decree of separation without any necessity to prove desertion or adultery.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cowen and others asked why, if a couple agreed to separate, they should get a decree in the first place, because within the context of this Bill it is established that if a couple have been living apart for a year and they both consent to a separation a decree can be obtained.  The purpose of including this provision, as the Oireachtas Joint Committee recommended, is that a couple may be living apart for a year but they may not be able to agree as to what future arrangements should operate between them with regard to the family home, children, support payments and a whole variety of things.  This Bill will facilitate them in getting the court, through a simple and less expensive procedure, to resolve those problems.</P>
    <P>Section 2 (1) (f) has been a cause of some concern to the Minister, Deputy Woods, and a number of other Fianna Fáil Deputies who contributed.  Deputy Colley in referring to that provision set out very articulately why it is there.  I could not say it any better than she did but it bears repeating.  Some Members opposite seem to think that this provision has no particular function and would achieve nothing.  It is one of the most important subdivisions of section 2 (1). Currently there is a particular problem which affects many husbands and wives whose marriages have broken down.  A husband and wife who have been married for many years may be completely and <Col N="1893" /> totally incompatible.  The husband does not assault his wife and neither party has committed adultery.  They are living in the one home engaged in what could best be described as a matrimonial war of attrition and they cannot reach any agreement between them as to the basis upon which they can separate.  As things stand, the courts cannot give them any assistance in separating.</P>
    <P>The provision in section 2 (1) (f) was teased out by the Oireachtas Joint Committee having heard at great length of these difficulties.  I was very sorry to hear the Minister dismiss that provision as being not very relevant and too vague.  It is phrased in the way the Oireachtas Joint Committee recommended after two years of deliberations.  If that provision were removed from the Bill on Committee Stage, it would leave not hundreds but thousands of husbands and wives with no hope and no remedy to extract themselves from the unhappy position in which they are living with each other but not together.  As the Oireachtas Joint Committee heard from child psychiatrists and from psychiatrists from the Royal College engaged in adult psychiatry, it is in the interests of children living with a couple engaged in that form of matrimonial war of attrition that a means be found whereby the husband and wife can separate on a civilised basis and the children can live in a stable home environment with one parent as opposed to living in a warring environment with two. That provision is of great importance.</P>
    <P>I will not have time to deal with many other issues raised by Deputies which we will tease out on Committee Stage.  There is, however, a further matter to which I wish to refer.  I was astonished to hear some Members opposite suggesting that whenever a decree of separation was granted both the husband and the wife would automatically lose their inheritance rights.  This was something the Oireachtas Joint Committee expressly rejected and something which, most curiously, the Law Reform Commission recommended.  It is most curious that the Minister should have come up with this proposal.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1894" /> I do not wish to introduce a note of contention but not very long ago during the divorce referendum campaign various Members opposite were stomping around the country telling people not to vote for divorce because if they did husbands and wives would automatically lose their inheritance rights.  It is extraordinary that in a measure in which we are seeking to provide additional protection for husbands and wives, some Members opposite should now be saying that when the court grants a decree of separation husbands and wives should automatically lose their inheritance rights.  This is simply a reiteration of a very peculiar recommendation emanating from the Law Reform Commission. This proposal would, if implemented, result in many dependent wives and some dependent husbands being left destitute upon the death of the maintenance-paying spouse in circumstance where at the date of the granting of a separation decree there was no family property in existence which could be transferred to the maintenance recipient or to the dependent wife to provide some security for the future.  The Oireachtas Joint Committee recommended that the court should merely be empowered to vary or discharge a spouse's rights of succession following the granting of a decree of separation, having regard to the circumstances of the parties in the context of determining what orders, if any, should be made for the division or transfer of property.  There will be many instances under this Bill where both the husband and wife would wish that the wife had the security of the family home being placed in her sole name during her lifetime without having to wait to receive some property on the death of her husband. There are many marital situations where there is not much property, where the wife is getting maintenance from her husband, there are no large amounts of property to be transferred to her and the husband does not have the financial ability to make lump sum payments.  To introduce a provision whereby both husband and wife would automatically lose their inheritance rights when a decree of <Col N="1895" /> separation was granted would not only leave wives destitute but would act as a barrier to people in poor economic circumstances, particularly wives, seeking the protection under this Bill to get a decree of separation in circumstances in which they would require one.  I would hope the Minister would not come to Committee Stage with that amendment.</P>
    <P>I want to express disappointment at the Minister's indication that during the lifetime of this Government there is no possibility of their providing a unified system of family courts.  In reforming the court structure we have done all we can do in this Bill in a Private Member's measure.  I hope the Government will reconsider that approach bearing in mind that four members of the current Government are parties to the Oireachtas joint committee report which recommended unanimously the establishment of a unified system of family law courts.</P>
    <P>I thank all Members who contributed to this debate.  It is something of a new departure that the House engaged in debate on an issue such as this.  Further debates of this nature will do a lot of good not merely in the context of bringing forward much needed legislation but of improving the image of members of this House amongst members of the general public and improving our credibility as legislators.  I look forward to Committee Stage.  I hope we will get down to working in committee very speedily and I hope that it will be an aim of this House to have the Bill passed through all stages in this House before the summer recess.  I hope we will work as a unified team in this House to achieve that, with a view to bringing the Bill back into this House not too long after Eastern to take Report and Final Stages so that this Bill will, with as little delay as possible, implement the badly needed reforms that so many people now look to us to provide to relieve them of a great deal of marital misery.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy that the Minister has taken the time to come into the House to listen to my plea on behalf of the Coolock Community Law Centre, and to my raising the general point that at this time legal services for the poor in this city are in a dismal condition and are in disarray.</P>
      <P>The civil legal aid centres operating under the Government's scheme are inundated with work, so much so that the doors are almost always closed to new customers.  The workload carried in these centres is so horrendous that the service is slowly grinding to a halt.  It will take a great deal of time and effort to get them moving again.  The legal profession must stand condemned.  They continue to ignore the vast area of their responsibility to meet legal needs.  The profit motive dominates their interest and they are not prepared to meet their social responsibility of delivering a comprehensive service for all people on all issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is now ten years since the Pringle report issued its well though out proposals for the introduction of a comprehensive legal aid service.  Since then we have spent very little time considering it.  The whole concept of community law centres has not been taken on by any Government in the ten years since that report, centres located in the community, not just in city centre locations, centres that would be active in the immediate environment delivering not just a service of court or lawyer orientation but also an educational service designed to make <Col N="1897" /> people aware of their rights and how to tackle issues.  Great credit must be given to the people who work in the Government law centres.  They are doing trojan work in unbelievable conditions.  In any debate on legal services our appreciation of them must be made obvious.</P>
    <P>In this whole area of confusion and the disarray in the delivery of legal services for the poor, shines one beacon of example, that is the community law centre in Coolock, a centre and facility that towers above any other service delivered by the entire legal profession, in looking after the needs of poor people. This centre is well know to the Minister and myself as it is located in our constituency. However, since its foundation in 1975 at the behest of students of law in the free legal advice centres services, the centre in Coolock has never operated on a sound financial basis.  It has never had a budget on which it could plan.  They do not know from one year to the next whether they will be open in the coming months.  They never know where the money is to come from.  In their history they have received funding from different Departments, even though more recently their budget seems now fixed into the budget of the Combat Poverty Agency. In addition, their current funding is on a limited period of three years from 1987 to 1989 at the sum of £60,000 per annum.</P>
    <P>At the moment the centre has an overdraft of about £10,000.  The money they have on a yearly basis would just about cover running costs.  They have no hope of tackling the overdraft which is daily increasing.  Funding is only adequate to employ a secretary administrator, one solicitor and one community officer working in the field, developing the service and developing the whole concept of the centre as a community facility. Against that, the case load for 1986 the last year for which figures are available, show that the solicitor had to deal with 300 new cases in that year alone in addition to carrying on all the work that came from the preceding years.  She was obliged to participate in upwards of 300 court appearances involving upwards of two visits a day to court.  In reality she is <Col N="1898" /> permanently tied up in attending at court looking after the interests of the many beleagured people who come through the doors of the centre.  The result is that there is no one at base to carry on the legal professional work that should be done there.</P>
    <P>For a number of years the centre has been crying out for funding for at least one additional solicitor.  If one considers the service given by Cooklock community law centre and the commitment given by one solicitor there one would not grudge one penny of such increased funding for the appointment of one other solicitor who would have such an incredible impact on the facilities to the people in the North-East area.  I refer to the North-East area because that is the constituency of the Minister and myself, but in fact the law centre covers a vastly greater area than one constituency.  It covers a catchment area of 30,000 households and serves, without ever telling a person that they are too busy, everyone who knocks on the door.  In addition to simple legal service the law centre is a genuine community-based law facility, the kind of idea that Mr. Pringle in his report advocated should be established throughout the country.  Nothing has been done to date.</P>
    <P>The centre involves itself in delivering leaflets to people in localities advising them of their rights regarding social welfare, consumer matters and other areas of the law often befuddling and confusing to the layman.  It is involved in the issuing and publication of newsletters telling the community about what the law centre is doing and what facilities it can offer.  It involves itself in the bringing together of groups such as the women's group to help people to work together and deal with common problems that arise, not just in the courts and by reason of the law but in the community generally.  It works on ongoing education, to which I have had the privilege of being a party in talking to people about their rights and what way they should go about dealing with the many bureaucracies that confront them in their daily lives as they seek their rights.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1899" /> The range of service and activity of Coolock Community Law Centre is unparalleled and unequalled by anything that the legal profession, solicitors and barristers together, has ever even contemplated. It is remarkable what that centre does, given the very uncertain and very inadequate base of its funding.  It is essential that funding of this law centre is put on a permanent basis, locked into the fund of some or other of the Departments appropriate, be it Welfare or Justice. It is essential that it is increased, however modestly, to enable additional staff of a professional and secretarial nature to be taken on so that it can begin, at least, to breathe a little bit in the work that it is doing.</P>
    <P>Of course, in all this, again, the work of the Coolock Community Law Centre cannot be divorced from the work of the free legal advice centres which originally were intended to be disbanded and closed on the publication of the Pringle report and the introduction of the scheme as proposed by Judge Pringle.  They saw the achievement of the setting up of that committee as the conclusion and culmination of their years of work and agitation. They hoped that when the Government scheme was introduced it would mean their necessary and obvious demise.  Unique probably of any body in the country, they looked forward to the day when they could say that their job was done and would close the door because they were no longer needed. However, within months of the scheme operating under Pringle as introduced by the Government of the day, they realised that it could never meet the legal needs of poor people in the city.  Consequently, they reopened their doors.</P>
    <P>This body has only once been assisted or funded by Government and that was to help them, with EC moneys, to pay off a huge debt that had accumulated over the years.  They are again in a desperate situation.  If this body were funded in some way through the Combat Poverty Agency, through the Minister's brief and budget, or through some allocation &mdash; I know not where and I dare not mention <Col N="1900" /> the word &ldquo;lottery&rdquo;&mdash; but from whatever source, a sum however small would go a huge way because it would be carried through the hands of the most enthusiastic body of students that one could hope to meet, those who give up their time to sit in centres around the city, upwards of 20 of them, to try to help and supplement the work of Coolock Community Law Centre and the work of the State law centres and to offset the complete negligence of our legal professions in dealing with the needs of poor people.</P>
    <P>In this regard it would be wrong to depart without saying a word of commendation to the members of the Bar who recently have agreed by resolution to impose a levy on their more senior members.  It is hoped that that levy, when contributed to by the members of the Bar Council, will yield up something in the order of £14,000 per annum to help to part-fund FLAC and its endeavours around the city.  I would hope that the solicitors' side of the profession would now respond with at least the sum of £10 per qualified solicitor around the country, and I think there is somewhere in the order of 3,000 of them.  That would easly fund the activities of FLAC and see that in some way the adequate service that the legal profession provide would be made up by the endeavours of students working through FLAC.  That sum of £10 per member of the Law Society would yield, at the moment, in the order of £30,000.  It would be very little out of the pocket of the individual solicitor but would mean so much to the service that is being provided.</P>
    <P>A sure funding base for Coolock Community Law Centre and the vibrant work of the students in the FLAC centre would go a huge distance in improving the quality of service to poor people in trying to deal with their problems in coming to court throughout this city and, indeed, the country.  It would take a great amount of pressure off the law centres themselves. It would give people an opportunity of catching up on work; it would mean that a proper service of some sort was being delivered to those who need it and at the end of the day, for very little, <Col N="1901" /> if the leadership or lead were given from the Minister's Department, or whoever within Government, to put some money on a solid permanent basis in the way of Cooklock Community Law Centre, I believe that the solicitors' profession would respond.  The Bar have already committed themselves and by this response from all quarters we could go a very long way for very little in providing a much improved voluntary service for people who so badly need the assistance of people like Mary Kiely in Coolock Community Law Centre and the students who work in FLAC.</P>
    <P>I am making a very strong and earnest plea to the Minister to realise that that centre &mdash; despite the generous effort, as I am sure he will call it, of £60,000 per annum &mdash; is on the brink of extinction unless its overdraft problem is dealt with, unless it is given extra staff to deal with the huge workload.  It will not be able to carry the worry and burden much longer. In paying homage to the work these people have done, as a representative in their area I hope the Minister can respond in a magnanimous way.  From this we could go on, through both arms of the profession, to see FLAC restored to viability, the service overall improved and pressure taken off the law centres.  I await the Minister's answer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Deputy first raised the question this morning, he spoke about funding of the free legal aid centres.  Then later in the day the question changed to the funding of the Coolock Community Law Centre.  If you were discussing the free legal aid centres, that is a matter for the Minister for Justice.  The Coolock Law Centre, because of various things that have happened over the years, is being supported by the Minister for Social Welfare at present, so I am not in a position to respond to much of what the Deputy has to say about the civil legal aid centres.  I suggest that he put down a question to the Minister for Justice in relation to that area specifically.  The budget this year for the free legal aid <Col N="1902" /> centres is £1.92 million, just under £2 million.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Coolock centre, I know that the question of its funding has been a source of concern for the centre for a number of years.  Last year, however, I was able to arrange with the Combat Poverty Agency to fund the centre for a period of three years.  This is a major step forward for the centre and was a vast improvement on the previous <i>ad hoc</i> arrangements.  Over the years there has been a close relationship between my Department and the centre. Since it was set up in 1975, my Department, either directly or through agencies under their control, have contributed to the funding of the centre in most years. In the earlier years this was in addition to the funding that the centre received from other sources.  It received funding from the National Committee on Pilot Schemes to Combat Poverty in 1976 and 1978 towards the cost of a full time community law officer.  Following the winding up of the poverty committee in December 1980, a sum of money was allocated in the 1981 Social Welfare Estimate for poverty research plans.  The centre was one of a group of voluntary bodies which received once-off payments in December 1981 from the poverty subhead.</P>
      <P>In his Budget Statement in 1983 the Minister for Finance announced that a sum of £30,000 was being made available to the centre.  The centre received a further allocation of £11,000 under this scheme in 1983.  Exchequer funding for the centre has been provided by way of the scheme of grants to voluntary bodies from 1984 to 1986.  In these years the Coolock Community Law Centre received grants totalling some £143,000 from my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following the introduction of the scheme of civil legal aid and advice Department of Justice funding was discontinued in 1981.  While Justice funding was restored for 1982 it has been discontinued since 1983.  The Department of Justice ceased funding because, in the light of the establishment of the civil legal aid scheme, it was considered wrong, in principle, to spend public funds on a local <Col N="1903" /> service for some people when a State service was available to meet the needs of all the people concerned.  In addition, it was considered wrong to make public funds available to finance services for some people on a different basis from comparable services provided for people generally, that is without a means test and without contributions.  It was felt that any further State expenditure in the area of legal aid would best be spent on the civil legal aid scheme.</P>
    <P>That is basically the background from the point of view of the Department of Justice.  Then, in 1987, £60,000 was provided by the Combat Poverty Agency for the centre.  In addition, the Combat Poverty Agency have agreed, at my request, to continue funding the centre up to the end of 1989.  Funding will be at this level this year and next year.  The Combat Poverty Agency are in a good position to look at the centre's existing and proposed activities and to carry out a full evaluation on an on-going basis.  In the light of the findings that emerge the question of appropriate funding arrangements beyond 1989 will be considered. This will undoubtedly be of benefit in terms of defining the appropriate relationship between statutory and voluntary activity in the field generally.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will agree that what I have arranged through the Combat Poverty Agency is a degree of stability and certainty at a higher level of funding than they had at any time in the past and for a period of three years together with a thorough evaluation so that decisions can be taken thereafter on the future direction of such services.</P>
    <P>An advisory committee for the evaluation of the centre has been established. This committee comprises representatives of the centre, the Combat Poverty Agency and my Department. The committee will be describing the objectives of the centre, in terms of who the clients are meant to be and what needs the centre is intended to meet, and will also be describing in detail the operating systems.  A complete claimant <Col N="1904" /> profile will be drawn up and an assessment of the extent to which needs are being met will be undertaken.</P>
    <P>The evaluation will also make an assessment of the main strengths and weaknesses in the structure, control and operation of the centre and will list impediments to the efficient and effective delivery of service.  Recommendations will be made covering policy, operational targets and management control mechanisms. For this purpose a separate sum of £2,165 has been provided, as we provided in 1987, for the evaluation of the centre by the Combat Poverty Agency. This provides a good indication of the support that the centre has enjoyed over the years since it was first established.</P>
    <P>I am aware that the centre provides a range of services for the people in the Coolock area.  It provides a comprehensive, free legal advisory service in relation to social welfare, housing, marital and other problems.  It assists in campaigns in relation to legal rights and also undertakes research on legal issues.  It has, in many ways, removed the mystique surrounding some of our laws and made the law more accessible to people.  This is an issue that should concern us all as legislators.  We have a duty to ensure that the legislation we enact is not only relevant, fair and equitable but also that it is understood and made known to people.  How often do we hear or see misguided views expressed by people who, if they had a better understanding of the law, would not express them.</P>
    <P>My own area of social welfare forms a block of work for the centre.  About 19 per cent of its case work is related to social welfare matters of one kind or another.  In addition, many of the queries to the centre are of a social welfare nature.  Their work in that respect will come under the NSSB and the community information services and this relationship is one that will have to be considered.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would like to place on record my appreciation for the invaluable work that the centre is doing for the people in the Coolock area.  The bulk of the case work for the centre comes from areas <Col N="1905" /> such as Bonnybrook, Edenmore, Raheny, Kilbarrack, Harmonstown, Donnycarney, Kilmore West, Darndale and Whitehall.  The total population of the catchment area served by the centre is estimated at about 60,000 people.</P>
    <P>As can be seen, the centre is very much community based and many local community organisations in the Coolock area are represented on the management committee of the centre.</P>
    <P>When I made this arrangement through the Combat Poverty Agency, not only did it give a definite funding arrangement, it also provided in this case for a very thorough evaluation of the work of the Community Law Centre in an objective way, and I believe that that evaluation will be very useful for the future.  I have heard so many arguments about that.  It has been treated in an <i>ad hoc</i> way year in and year out, and it does not fit into the overall system of free legal advice centres.  It raises the question of whether this kind of centre should be continued or extended or used much more in the future.</P>
    <P>We have provided the mechanism for that evaluation to be undertaken.  There was, as the Deputy said, no funding arrangement.  There was great uncertainty as to whether they should continue and how they would continue.  If they have difficulties now in relation to an overdraft, then I suggest they take this up with the Combat Poverty Agency in the first instance, since they are evaluating their position and looking at it from the long-term point of view.</P>
    <P>It is essentially a legal service with some health and social welfare advice. It is totally free service, regardless of income.  I considered that it was worthy of full evaluation and I asked the Combat Poverty Agency to undertake this function and they have very willingly agreed to do so.  They had no funding or continuity and the position was, as the Deputy said, totally uncertain.  But, through the Combat Poverty Agency, I <Col N="1906" /> have provided a total of £180,000 spread over three years which provides a certainty and definite funding.  Incidentally, the funding in 1985 from the various sources was £48,000; in 1986 it was £50,000. In 1987, 1988 and 1989 it will be £60,000 in each of those three years.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will realise that in doing this I gave great certainty; I provided a basis on which it can be thoroughly evaluated and on which decisions can be made in future.  In the <i>Coolock Community Law Centre News</i> they said they were very pleased with this, that the news was hopeful since the Minister, Deputy Woods, had informed the management committee that the Combat Poverty Agency had agreed to fund the centre on a three year basis until the end of 1989 and that at the time of going to print the full details of the arrangement were not clear but it looked as if for the first time the centre has some security within which to operate.</P>

      <P>Well, it is £60,000 in each of three years.  The highest they ever had before that was £60,000, so it is not bad security, The Deputy would like to see much more but the logical and sensible thing to do at this stage is to have it thoroughly evaluated because this has been going since 1975 and there has been no comprehensive evaluation of the work.  I accept that much of the work is valuable and I hope from the study that will take place that we will have very good, clear signposts for the future and that the Deputy at that stage will be very happy with this project.</P>

        <i>Limerick West</i>): In August 1985 a meeting was held between representatives of Dublin Corporation and of my Department at which the corporation were informed that the Department would be agreeable in principle to transfer an area of about 3.5 acres at Cathal Brugha Barracks to the corporation subject to conditions to be agreed.  Since then the matter has been the subject of much discussion and correspondence between the corporation and my Department, mainly about the question of access to the site. However, to date the corporation have not indicated that they are prepared to proceed with the proposed transaction and accordingly my Department are considering the question of making alternative arrangements for the disposal of the property.</P>

      <P>Following the inconclusive outcome of the European Council in Copenhagen on 4-5 December 1987, on which the Taoiseach reported to this House on 8 December 1987, consideration of the question of the reform of the Community's structural funds has continued in the Council of Ministers for Foreign Affairs.  The matter is being examined in the wider context of the overall plan for the future development of the Community presented by Commission President, Delors.  It will be considered by the European Council at its meeting in Brussels tomorrow and Friday, 11 and 12 February.  Some progress has been made and certain key issues have been clarified. It is hoped that it will be possible to reach agreement on a satisfactory overall settlement.  In regard to economic and social cohesion, Ireland will be seeking to ensure that adequate resources are made available to the structural funds and that these resources are concentrated to a greater degree on the less developed regions of the Community.</P>

      <P>Foreign Ministers of the Twelve meeting in the European Political Co-operation framework in Bonn on 8 February discussed thoroughly the situation in the occupied territories.  They adopted a declaration reiterating the Twelve's profound concern at the deteriorating conditions in the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem.  They expressed their conviction that the <i>status quo</i> in the occupied territories is not sustainable and that the only solution is by means of a comprehensive, just and lasting political settlement.  They reaffirmed Twelve support for an international conference. The Foreign Ministers expressed the Twelve's determination to work towards improving the living conditions of the inhabitants of the territories and they deplored Israel's illegal settlement policy.  They urged Israel to comply with recent UN Security Council resolutions and with the 1949 Geneva Convention on the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War.  They strongly appealed to all <Col N="1774" /> parties to exercise maximum restraint in order to reduce the dangerous level of tension.</P>
      <P>A copy of the Ministerial Declaration is available in the Library.</P>
      <P>Events in the occupied territories have been the subject of ongoing consultations among the Twelve in the European Political Co-operation framework.</P>
      <P>On two occasions in recent weeks on 18 December 1987 and 12 January 1988, the Presidency's ambassador in Tel Aviv expressed to the Israeli authorities the concern of the Twelve at the rapidly and seriously deteriorating situation and called urgently on the Israeli authorities to ensure the immediate protection of the inhabitants of the area.  The Presidency also conveyed to the Israeli Government the Twelve's deep concern at Israel's decision to pursue a policy of deportation in the occupied territories.</P>
      <P>In view of the very recent and thorough discussion of this matter by Foreign Ministers and in the light of the declaration adopted by them on 8 February it is not expected that this matter will be discussed at the meeting of the European Council on 11-12 February.</P>

      <P>The person concerned was in receipt of disability benefit from December 1986 to December 1987.  He applied for invalidity pension in November 1987. Due to an administrative oversight he was incorrectly notified that he was entitled to the pension.  Prior to the issue of the pension book, however, it was noted that the person concerned did not satisfy all the contribution conditions for entitlement to invalidity pension.  He does not satisfy the condition which requires the claimant to have qualifying contributions paid or credited in respect of not less than 48 contribution weeks in the last complete contribution year before the date of the claim.</P>
      <P>The contribution year in question is the period from April 1986 to April 1987. According to the Department's records there are only 16 credited contributions registered in respect of the person concerned during that period.  A deciding officer has accordingly decided that he is not entitled to invalidity pension.  He was notified of this decision on 1 February 1988.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The person concerned ceased to be eligible for the receipt of disability benefit on 11 December 1987 as he has insufficient contributions paid or credited on his behalf in the 1985-86 contribution <Col N="1781" /> year, which is the year that governs his claim to disability benefit from that date.</P>
    <P>It is noted that the person concerned resided in England from September 1985 to a date unknown and during that period claimed sickness benefit from the Department of Health and Social Security.  The British authorities have been asked to supply details of his British insurance record.  On receipt of this information his entitlement to disability benefit and invalidity pension will be further considered.</P>

Many of these persons were not on local authority waiting lists.  Details of the numbers of homeless housing applicants where circumstances were found, on investigation, to warrant housing by the local authority are set out in the following table:&mdash;</P>

      <P>All categories of post-primary school are now catering for a wide range of subject choice and ability levels and I am confident that they will continue to do so.  The Government are of the opinion that the developing equalisation of education provision should be reflected in the allocation of teaching posts at post-primary level.</P>

      <P>In regard to primary schools I would refer the Deputy to my replies to Questions Nos. 29 and 47 of 3 November and 3 December 1987, respectively.  I have nothing to add to these replies.  With regard to savings in the post-primary sector I would refer the Deputy to my reply to Question No. 314 of 27 January 1988.</P>
